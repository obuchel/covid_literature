142,"La Crosse virus infectivity, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in mice and monkeys",2008-02-11,"BACKGROUND: La Crosse virus (LACV), family Bunyaviridae, was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year-old girl with fatal encephalitis in La Crosse, Wisconsin. LACV is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America and infects up to 300,000 persons each year of which 70–130 result in severe disease of the central nervous system (CNS). As an initial step in the establishment of useful animal models to support vaccine development, we examined LACV infectivity, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in both weanling mice and rhesus monkeys. RESULTS: Following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice, LACV replicated in various organs before reaching the CNS where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease. The peripheral site where LACV replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates, and, presumably, LACV can enter the CNS via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium. The mouse infectious dose(50 )and lethal dose(50 )was similar for LACV administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally. LACV was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100% of the animals at 10 PFU. However, the infection was asymptomatic, and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response. CONCLUSION: In mice, LACV likely gains access to the CNS via the blood stream or via olfactory neurons. The ability to efficiently infect mice intranasally raises the possibility that LACV might use this route to infect its natural hosts. Rhesus monkeys are susceptible to LACV infection and develop strong neutralizing antibody responses after inoculation with as little as 10 PFU. Mice and rhesus monkeys are useful animal models for LACV vaccine immunologic testing although the rhesus monkey model is not optimal.","Bennett, Richard S; Cress, Christina M; Ward, Jerrold M; Firestone, Cai-Yen; Murphy, Brian R; Whitehead, Stephen S",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2276200/,88
150,Functional Analysis of the 5′ Genomic Sequence of a Bovine Norovirus,2008-05-14,"BACKGROUND: Jena Virus (JV), a bovine Norovirus, causes enteric disease in cattle and represents a potential model for the study of enteric norovirus infection and pathogenesis. The positive sense RNA genome of JV is organised into ORF1 (non-structural proteins), ORF2 (major capsid protein) and ORF3 (minor capsid protein). The lack of a cell culture system for studying JV replication has meant that work to date has relied upon in vitro systems to study non-structural protein synthesis and processing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Only two of the three major ORF1 proteins were identified (p110 and 2C) following in vitro translation of JV RNA, the N-term protein was not detected. The N-term encoding genomic sequence (5′GS) was tested for IRES-like function in a bi-cistronic system and displayed no evidence of IRES-like activity. The site of translation initiation in JV was determined to be at the predicted nucleotide 22. Following the insertion of an epitope within the 5′GS the JV N-term protein was identified in vitro and within RNA transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro transcription/translation system is currently the best system for analysing protein synthesis and processing in JV. Unlike similarly studied human noroviruses JV initially did not appear to express the N-terminal protein, presenting the possibility that the encoding RNA sequence had a regulatory function, most likely involved in translation initiation in an IRES-like manner. This was not the case and, following determination of the site of translation initiation the N-term protein was detected using an epitope tag, both in vitro and in vivo. Although slightly larger than predicted the N-term protein was detected in a processed form in vivo, thus not only demonstrating initial translation of the ORF1 polyprotein but also activity of the viral protease. These findings indicate that the block to noroviral replication in cultured cells lies elsewhere.","Salim, Omar; Clarke, Ian N.; Lambden, Paul R.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2364642/,88
214,Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Protein Promotes Post-Transcriptional Downregulation of Protein Kinase PKR and Inhibits eIF2α Phosphorylation,2009-02-06,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock. A nonstructural RVFV NSs protein inhibits the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon-β mRNA, and is a major virulence factor. The present study explored a novel function of the RVFV NSs protein by testing the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) or α-amanitin, both of which served as a surrogate of the host mRNA synthesis suppression function of the NSs. In the presence of the host-transcriptional inhibitors, the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs protein, but not that carrying NSs, induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)–mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2α phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation. RVFV NSs promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of PKR early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eIF2α accumulation. These data suggested that a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcriptional suppression induces PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation, while the NSs facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating PKR and inhibiting PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation. Thus, the two distinct functions of the NSs, i.e., the suppression of host transcription, including that of type I interferon mRNAs, and the downregulation of PKR, work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions, allowing efficient replication and survival of RVFV in infected mammalian hosts.","Ikegami, Tetsuro; Narayanan, Krishna; Won, Sungyong; Kamitani, Wataru; Peters, C.

228,Virus-Specific Read-Through Codon Preference Affects Infectivity of Chimeric Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Viruses Displaying a Dengue Virus Epitope,2009-03-22,"A Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) was used to present a truncated dengue virus type 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acids 379 to 423 (EB4). The EB4 gene was inserted at the terminal end of the CGMMV coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF). Read-through sequences of TMV or CGMMV, CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA, or AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA were, respectively, inserted in between the CP and the EB4 genes. The chimeric clones, pRT, pRG, and pCG+FSRTRE, were transcribed into full-length capped recombinant CGMMV transcripts. Only constructs with the wild-type CGMMV read-through sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant, muskmelon (Cucumis melo) leaves. The ratio of modified to unmodified CP for the read-through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1:1, higher than what has been previously reported. It was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in pI between the chimera and its wild counterpart. Analysis of recombinant viruses after 21-days-postinculation (dpi) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct.","Teoh, Pak-Guan; Ooi, Aik-Seng; AbuBakar, Sazaly; Othman, Rofina Yasmin",J Biomed Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2659398/,88
232,Proteolytic processing of a precursor protein for a growth-promoting peptide by a subtilisin serine protease in Arabidopsis,2008-08-01,"Phytosulfokines (PSKs) are secreted, sulfated peptide hormones derived from larger prepropeptide precursors. Proteolytic processing of one of the precursors, AtPSK4, was demonstrated by cleavage of a preproAtPSK4–myc transgene product to AtPSK4–myc. Cleavage of proAtPSK4 was induced by placing root explants in tissue culture. The processing of proAtPSK4 was dependent on AtSBT1.1, a subtilisin-like serine protease, encoded by one of 56 subtilase genes in Arabidopsis. The gene encoding AtSBT1.1 was up-regulated following the transfer of root explants to tissue culture, suggesting that activation of the proteolytic machinery that cleaves proAtPSK4 is dependent on AtSBT1.1 expression. We also demonstrated that a fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site in proAtPSK4 is cleaved in vitro by affinity-purified AtSBT1.1. An alanine scan through the recognition site peptide indicated that AtSBT1.1 is fairly specific for the AtPSK4 precursor. Thus, this peptide growth factor, which promotes callus formation in culture, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by a specific plant subtilase encoded by a gene that is up-regulated during the process of transfering root explants to tissue culture.","Srivastava, Renu; Liu, Jian-Xiang; Howell, Stephen H",Plant J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2667306/,88
286,Crystal Structure of the N-Acetylmannosamine Kinase Domain of GNE,2009-10-20,"BACKGROUND: UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase, GNE, is a bi-functional enzyme that plays a key role in sialic acid biosynthesis. Mutations of the GNE protein cause sialurea or autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy/Nonaka myopathy. GNE is the only human protein that contains a kinase domain belonging to the ROK (repressor, ORF, kinase) family. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We solved the structure of the GNE kinase domain in the ligand-free state. The protein exists predominantly as a dimer in solution, with small populations of monomer and higher-order oligomer in equilibrium with the dimer. Crystal packing analysis reveals the existence of a crystallographic hexamer, and that the kinase domain dimerizes through the C-lobe subdomain. Mapping of disease-related missense mutations onto the kinase domain structure revealed that the mutation sites could be classified into four different groups based on the location – dimer interface, interlobar helices, protein surface, or within other secondary structural elements. CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure of the kinase domain of GNE provides a structural basis for understanding disease-causing mutations and a model of hexameric wild type full length enzyme.

316,Exposure of cats to low doses of FeLV: seroconversion as the sole parameter of infection,2009-10-28,"In felids, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection results in a variety of outcomes that range from abortive (virus readily eliminated and never detectable) to progressive infection (persistent viremia and viral shedding). Recently, a novel outcome was postulated for low FeLV infectious doses. Naïve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted, indicating infection, but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood. FeLV provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow, infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression. To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses. Blood p27, proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection. Tissue proviral loads were determined as well. The immune response was monitored by measuring FeLV whole virus and p45 antibodies; and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) assay. One cat showed regressive infection (transient antigenemia, persistent provirus-positivity, and seroconversion) with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice. In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative. Overall, the results show that FeLV low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection. Therefore, commonly used detection methods do not detect all FeLV-infected animals, possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection.","Major, Andrea; Cattori, Valentino; Boenzli, Eva; Riond, Barbara; Ossent, Peter; Meli, Marina Luisa; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2789331/,88
334,Fluorescence Competition Assay Measurements of Free Energy Changes for RNA Pseudoknots,2009-11-18,"[Image: see text] RNA pseudoknots have important functions, and thermodynamic stability is a key to predicting pseudoknots in RNA sequences and to understanding their functions. Traditional methods, such as UV melting and differential scanning calorimetry, for measuring RNA thermodynamics are restricted to temperature ranges around the melting temperature for a pseudoknot. Here, we report RNA pseudoknot free energy changes at 37 °C measured by fluorescence competition assays. Sequence-dependent studies for the loop 1−stem 2 region reveal (1) the individual nearest-neighbor hydrogen bonding (INN-HB) model provides a reasonable estimate for the free energy change when a Watson−Crick base pair in stem 2 is changed, (2) the loop entropy can be estimated by a statistical polymer model, although some penalty for certain loop sequences is necessary, and (3) tertiary interactions can significantly stabilize pseudoknots and extending the length of stem 2 may alter tertiary interactions such that the INN-HB model does not predict the net effect of adding a base pair. The results can inform writing of algorithms for predicting and/or designing RNA secondary structures.","Liu, Biao; Shankar, Neelaabh; Turner, Douglas H.",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808147/,88
371,Rapid Accumulation of Virulent Rift Valley Fever Virus in Mice from an Attenuated Virus Carrying a Single Nucleotide Substitution in the M RNA,2010-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae, is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, while in livestock it causes fever and high abortion rates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequence analysis showed that a wild-type RVFV ZH501 preparation consisted of two major viral subpopulations, with a single nucleotide heterogeneity at nucleotide 847 of M segment (M847); one had a G residue at M847 encoding glycine in a major viral envelope Gn protein, while the other carried A residue encoding glutamic acid at the corresponding site. Two ZH501-derived viruses, rZH501-M847-G and rZH501-M847-A, carried identical genomic sequences, except that the former and the latter had G and A, respectively, at M847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rZH501-M847-A into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera, livers, spleens, kidneys and brains, and killed most of the mice within 8 days, whereas rZH501-M847-G caused low viremia titers, did not replicate as efficiently as did rZH501-M847-A in these organs, and had attenuated virulence to mice. Remarkably, as early as 2 days postinfection with rZH501-M847-G, the viruses carrying A at M847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter, while replicating viruses retained the input A residue at M847 in rZH501-M847-A-infected mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrated that the single nucleotide substitution in the Gn protein substantially affected the RVFV mouse virulence and that a virus population carrying the virulent viral genotype quickly emerged and became the major viral population within a few days in mice that were inoculated with the attenuated virus.","Morrill, John C.; Ikegami, Tetsuro; Yoshikawa-Iwata, Naoko; Lokugamage, Nandadeva; Won, Sungyong; Terasaki, Kaori; Zamoto-Niikura, Aya; Peters, C.

890,Retroviral Env Glycoprotein Trafficking and Incorporation into Virions,2012-07-02,"Together with the Gag protein, the Env glycoprotein is a major retroviral structural protein and is essential for forming infectious virus particles. Env is synthesized, processed, and transported to certain microdomains at the plasma membrane and takes advantage of the same host machinery for its trafficking as that used by cellular glycoproteins. Incorporation of Env into progeny virions is probably mediated by the interaction between Env and Gag, in some cases with the additional involvement of certain host factors. Although several general models have been proposed to explain the incorporation of retroviral Env glycoproteins into virions, the actual mechanism for this process is still unclear, partly because structural data on the Env protein cytoplasmic tail is lacking. This paper presents the current understanding of the synthesis, trafficking, and virion incorporation of retroviral Env proteins.","Murakami, Tsutomu",Mol Biol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395148/,88
936,Functional Analysis of Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Encoding a Partial Truncation,2012-09-19,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), belongs to genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, causes high rates of abortion and fetal malformation in infected ruminants as well as causing neurological disorders, blindness, or lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen and a select agent in the U.S., and currently there are no therapeutics available for RVF patients. NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)-β mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210–230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN-β promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect. Unexpectedly, we found that RVFV NSs truncated at aa. 6–30, 31–55, 56–80, 81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230, 231–248 or 249–265 lack functions of IFN–β mRNA synthesis inhibition and degradation of PKR. Truncated NSs were less stable in infected cells, while nuclear localization was inhibited in NSs lacking either of aa.81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230 or 231–248. Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominant-negative functions for NSs-mediated IFN-β suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain. Our results suggest that conformational integrity of NSs is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of RVFV NSs, and the co-expression of truncated NSs does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype.","Head, Jennifer A.; Kalveram, Birte; Ikegami, Tetsuro",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3446906/,88
955,Virus contaminations of cell cultures – A biotechnological view,2002-01-01,"In contrast to contamination by microbes and mycoplasma, which can be relatively easily detected, viral contamination present a serious threat because of the difficulty in detecting some viruses and the lack of effective methods of treating infected cell cultures. While some viruses are capable of causing morphological changes to infected cells (e.g. cytopathic effect)which are detectable by microscopy some viral contaminations result in the integration of the viral genome as provirus, this causes no visual evidence, by means of modification of the cellular morphology. Virus production from such cell lines, are potentially dangerous for other cell cultures (in research labs)by cross contaminations, or for operators and patients (in the case of the production of injectable biologicals) because of potential infection. The only way to keep cell cultures for research, development, and the biotech industry virus-free is the prevention of such contaminations. Cell cultures can become contaminated by the following means: firstly, they may already be contaminated as primary cultures (because the source of the cells was already infected), secondly, they were contaminated due to the use of contaminated raw materials, or thirdly, they were contaminated via an animal passage. This overview describes the problems and risks associated with viral contaminations in animal cell culture, describes the origins of these contaminations as well as the most important virsuses associated with viral contaminations in cell culture. In addition, ways to prevent viral contaminations as well as measures undertaken to avoid and assess risks for viral contaminations as performed in the biotech industry are briefly described.","Merten, O.-W.",Cytotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463984/,88

The MultiSite Gateway(TM) system allows combining multiple genetic fragments such as promoter, ORF and epitope tag in one single reaction. To date, this technology has not been accessible in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the most widely used experimental systems in molecular biology, due to the lack of appropriate destination vectors. RESULTS: Here, we present a set of three-fragment MultiSite Gateway(TM) destination vectors that have been developed for gene expression in S. cerevisiae and that allow the assembly of any promoter, open reading frame, epitope tag arrangement in combination with any of four auxotrophic markers and three distinct replication mechanisms. As an example of its applicability, we used yeast three-hybrid to provide evidence for the assembly of a ternary complex of plant proteins involved in jasmonate signalling and consisting of the JAZ, NINJA and TOPLESS proteins. CONCLUSION: Our vectors make MultiSite Gateway(TM) cloning accessible in S. cerevisiae and implement a fast and versatile cloning method for the high-throughput functional analysis of (heterologous) proteins in one of the most widely used model organisms for molecular biology research.","Nagels Durand, Astrid; Moses, Tessa; De Clercq, Rebecca; Goossens, Alain; Pauwels, Laurens",BMC Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3519679/,88
1011,Immunization with a Recombinant Vaccinia Virus That Encodes Nonstructural Proteins of the Hepatitis C Virus Suppresses Viral Protein Levels in Mouse Liver,2012-12-17,"Chronic hepatitis C, which is caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is a global health problem. Using a mouse model of hepatitis C, we examined the therapeutic effects of a recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) that encodes an HCV protein. We generated immunocompetent mice that each expressed multiple HCV proteins via a Cre/loxP switching system and established several distinct attenuated rVV strains. The HCV core protein was expressed consistently in the liver after polyinosinic acid–polycytidylic acid injection, and these mice showed chronic hepatitis C-related pathological findings (hepatocyte abnormalities, accumulation of glycogen, steatosis), liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunization with one rVV strain (rVV-N25), which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins, suppressed serum inflammatory cytokine levels and alleviated the symptoms of pathological chronic hepatitis C within 7 days after injection. Furthermore, HCV protein levels in liver tissue also decreased in a CD4 and CD8 T-cell-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, we showed that rVV-N25 immunization induced a robust CD8 T-cell immune response that was specific to the HCV nonstructural protein 2. We also demonstrated that the onset of chronic hepatitis in CN2-29((+/−))/MxCre((+/−)) mice was mainly attributable to inflammatory cytokines, (tumor necrosis factor) TNF-α and (interleukin) IL-6. Thus, our generated mice model should be useful for further investigation of the immunological processes associated with persistent expression of HCV proteins because these mice had not developed immune tolerance to the HCV antigen. In addition, we propose that rVV-N25 could be developed as an effective therapeutic vaccine.","Sekiguchi, Satoshi; Kimura, Kiminori; Chiyo, Tomoko; Ohtsuki, Takahiro; Tobita, Yoshimi; Tokunaga, Yuko; Yasui, Fumihiko; Tsukiyama-Kohara, Kyoko; Wakita, Takaji; Tanaka, Toshiyuki; Miyasaka, Masayuki; Mizuno, Kyosuke; Hayashi, Yukiko; Hishima, Tsunekazu; Matsushima, Kouji; Kohara, Michinori",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524174/,88
1043,Identification of a novel Getah virus by Virus-Discovery-cDNA random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD),2012-12-27,"BACKGROUND: The identification of new virus strains is important for the study of infectious disease, but current (or existing) molecular biology methods are limited since the target sequence must be known to design genome-specific PCR primers. Thus, we developed a new method for the discovery of unknown viruses based on the cDNA - random amplified polymorphic DNA (cDNA-RAPD) technique. Getah virus, belonging to the family Togaviridae in the genus Alphavirus, is a mosquito-borne enveloped RNA virus that was identified using the Virus-Discovery-cDNA RAPD (VIDISCR) method. RESULTS: A novel Getah virus was identified by VIDISCR from suckling mice exposed to mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus) collected in Yunnan Province, China. The non-structural protein gene, nsP3, the structural protein gene, the capsid protein gene, and the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the novel Getah virus isolate were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence identities of each gene were determined to be 97.1–99.3%, 94.9–99.4%, and 93.6–99.9%, respectively, when compared with the genomes of 10 other representative strains of Getah virus. CONCLUSIONS: The VIDISCR method was able to identify known virus isolates and a novel isolate of Getah virus from infected mice.

1063,Vesicular stomatitis virus with the rabies virus glycoprotein directs retrograde transsynaptic transport among neurons in vivo,2013-02-07,"Defining the connections among neurons is critical to our understanding of the structure and function of the nervous system. Recombinant viruses engineered to transmit across synapses provide a powerful approach for the dissection of neuronal circuitry in vivo. We recently demonstrated that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can be endowed with anterograde or retrograde transsynaptic tracing ability by providing the virus with different glycoproteins. Here we extend the characterization of the transmission and gene expression of recombinant VSV (rVSV) with the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G), and provide examples of its activity relative to the anterograde transsynaptic tracer form of rVSV. rVSV with RABV-G was found to drive strong expression of transgenes and to spread rapidly from neuron to neuron in only a retrograde manner. Depending upon how the RABV-G was delivered, VSV served as a polysynaptic or monosynaptic tracer, or was able to define projections through axonal uptake and retrograde transport. In animals co-infected with rVSV in its anterograde form, rVSV with RABV-G could be used to begin to characterize the similarities and differences in connections to different areas. rVSV with RABV-G provides a flexible, rapid, and versatile tracing tool that complements the previously described VSV-based anterograde transsynaptic tracer.","Beier, Kevin T.; Saunders, Arpiar B.; Oldenburg, Ian A.; Sabatini, Bernardo L.; Cepko, Constance L.",Front Neural Circuits,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3566411/,88
1093,"NOA36 Protein Contains a Highly Conserved Nucleolar Localization Signal Capable of Directing Functional Proteins to the Nucleolus, in Mammalian Cells",2013-03-13,"NOA36/ZNF330 is an evolutionarily well-preserved protein present in the nucleolus and mitochondria of mammalian cells. We have previously reported that the pro-apoptotic activity of this protein is mediated by a characteristic cysteine-rich domain. We now demonstrate that the nucleolar localization of NOA36 is due to a highly-conserved nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) present in residues 1–33. This NoLS is a sequence containing three clusters of two or three basic amino acids. We fused the amino terminal of NOA36 to eGFP in order to characterize this putative NoLS. We show that a cluster of three lysine residues at positions 3 to 5 within this sequence is critical for the nucleolar localization. We also demonstrate that the sequence as found in human is capable of directing eGFP to the nucleolus in several mammal, fish and insect cells. Moreover, this NoLS is capable of specifically directing the cytosolic yeast enzyme polyphosphatase to the target of the nucleolus of HeLa cells, wherein its enzymatic activity was detected. This NoLS could therefore serve as a very useful tool as a nucleolar marker and for directing particular proteins to the nucleolus in distant animal species.","de Melo, Ivan S.; Jimenez-Nuñez, Maria D.; Iglesias, Concepción; Campos-Caro, Antonio; Moreno-Sanchez, David; Ruiz, Felix A.; Bolívar, Jorge",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3596294/,88
1140,Dynamics of translation by single ribosomes through mRNA secondary structures,2013-03-31,"During protein synthesis, the ribosome translates nucleotide triplets in single-stranded mRNA into polypeptide sequences. Strong downstream mRNA secondary (2°) structures, which must be unfolded for translation, can slow or even halt protein synthesis. Here we employ single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to determine reaction rates for specific steps within the elongation cycle as the Escherichia coli ribosome encounters stem loop or pseudoknot mRNA 2° structures. Downstream stem-loops containing 100% G-C base pairs decrease the rates of both tRNA translocation within the ribosome and deacylated tRNA dissociation from the ribosomal exit (E) site. Downstream stem-loops or pseudoknots containing both G-C and A-U pairs also decrease the rate of tRNA dissociation, but they have little effect on tRNA translocation rate. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, unfolding of mRNA 2° structures is more closely coupled to E-site tRNA dissociation than to tRNA translocation.","Chen, Chunlai; Zhang, Haibo; Broitman, Steven L.; Reiche, Michael; Farrell, Ian; Cooperman, Barry S.; Goldman, Yale E.",Nat Struct Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3648610/,88
1219,"Design, Synthesis, Evaluation and Thermodynamics of 1-Substituted Pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]Pyridine Derivatives as Cysteine Protease Inhibitors",2013-08-05,"Targeting papain family cysteine proteases is one of the novel strategies in the development of chemotherapy for a number of diseases. Novel cysteine protease inhibitors derived from 1-pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine representing pharmacologically important class of compounds are being reported here for the first time. The derivatives were initially designed and screened in silico by molecular docking studies against papain to explore the possible mode of action. The molecular interaction between the compounds and cysteine protease (papain) was found to be very similar to the interactions observed with the respective epoxide inhibitor (E-64c) of papain. Subsequently, compounds were synthesized to validate their efficacy in wet lab experiments. When characterized kinetically, these compounds show their K(i) and IC(50) values in the range of 13.75 to 99.30 µM and 13.40 to 96.50 µM, respectively. The thermodynamics studies suggest their binding with papain hydrophobically and entropically driven. These inhibitors also inhibit the growth of clinically important different types of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria having MIC(50) values in the range of 0.6–1.4 µg/ml. Based on Lipinski’s rule of Five, we also propose these compounds as potent antibacterial prodrugs. The most active antibacterial compound was found to be 1-(2-pyridyl)-3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (3a).","Khan, Mohd Sajid; Baig, Mohd Hassan; Ahmad, Saheem; Siddiqui, Shapi Ahmad; Srivastava, Ashwini Kumar; Srinivasan, Kumar Venkatraman; Ansari, Irfan A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3734177/,88
1305,Synonymous Codon Usage in TTSuV2: Analysis and Comparison with TTSuV1,2013-11-26,"Two species of the DNA virus Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, have become widely distributed in pig-farming countries in recent years. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage bias in 41 available TTSuV2 coding sequences (CDS), and compared the codon usage patterns of TTSuV2 and TTSuV1. TTSuV codon usage patterns were found to be phylogenetically conserved. Values for the effective number of codons (ENC) indicated that the overall extent of codon usage bias in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 was not significant, the most frequently occurring codons had an A or C at the third codon position. Correspondence analysis (COA) was performed and TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 sequences were located in different quadrants of the first two major axes. A plot of the ENC revealed that compositional constraint was the major factor determining the codon usage bias for TTSuV2. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis of 41 TTSuV2 isolates based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values suggested that there was no association between geographic distribution and codon bias of TTSuV2 sequences. Finally, the comparison of RSCU for TTSuV2, TTSuV1 and the corresponding host sequence indicated that the codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 was similar to that of TTSuV1. However the similarity was low for each virus and its host. These conclusions provide important insight into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV2, as well as better understangding of the molecular evolution of TTSuV2 genomes.","Zhang, Zhicheng; Dai, Wei; Dai, Dingzhen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841265/,88
1331,"Identification of RNase L-Dependent, 3′-End-Modified, Viral Small RNAs in Sindbis Virus-Infected Mammalian Cells",2013-11-19,"Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21- to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3′-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.","Girardi, Erika; Chane-Woon-Ming, Béatrice; Messmer, Mélanie; Kaukinen, Pasi; Pfeffer, Sébastien",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3870239/,88
1525,A Comprehensive Phylogenetic and Structural Analysis of the Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Gene Family,2014-05-23,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and codes for a vast number of glycoproteins that differ greatly both in amino acid composition and function. The CEA family is divided into two groups, the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins. The CEA family members are implicated in pleiotropic (patho)physiological functions including cell–cell adhesion, pregnancy, immunity, neovascularization, regulation of insulin homeostasis, and carcinogenesis. In general, the CEA-encoded proteins are composed of an extracellular region with Ig variable and constant-like domains and a cytoplasmic region containing signaling motifs. Of particular interest, the well-studied human and mouse CEA genes are arranged in clusters in a single chromosome. Taking into account this characteristic, we made an effort to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the CEA gene family. Toward this end, the publicly available genomes were searched extensively for CEA homologs. The domain organization of the retrieved protein sequences was analyzed, and, subsequently, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the entire length CEA homologous proteins were performed. A series of evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues, functionally important, were identified. The relative positioning of these residues on the modeled tertiary structure of novel CEA protein domains revealed that they are, also, spatially conserved. Furthermore, the chromosomal arrangement of CEA genes was examined, and it was found that the CEA genes are preserved in terms of position, transcriptional orientation, and number in all species under investigation.","Pavlopoulou, Athanasia; Scorilas, Andreas",Genome Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4079198/,88
1651,Cell Surface Protein Disulfide Isomerase Regulates Natriuretic Peptide Generation of Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate,2014-11-24,"RATIONALE: The family of natriuretic peptides (NPs), including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), exert important and diverse actions for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. The autocrine and paracrine functions of the NPs are primarily mediated through the cellular membrane bound guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors GC-A (NPR-A) and GC-B (NPR-B). As the ligands and receptors each contain disulfide bonds, a regulatory role for the cell surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was investigated. OBJECTIVE: We utilized complementary in vitro and in vivo models to determine the potential role of PDI in regulating the ability of the NPs to generate its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibition of PDI attenuated the ability of ANP, BNP and CNP to generate cGMP in human mesangial cells (HMCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), each of which were shown to express PDI. In LLC-PK1 cells, where PDI expression was undetectable by immunoblotting, PDI inhibition had a minimal effect on cGMP generation. Addition of PDI to cultured LLC-PK1 cells increased intracellular cGMP generation mediated by ANP. Inhibition of PDI in vivo attenuated NP-mediated generation of cGMP by ANP. Surface Plasmon Resonance demonstrated modest and differential binding of the natriuretic peptides with immobilized PDI in a cell free system. However, PDI was shown to co-localize on the surface of cells with GC-A and GC-B by co-immunoprecpitation and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate for the first time that cell surface PDI expression and function regulate the capacity of natriuretic peptides to generate cGMP through interaction with their receptors.","Pan, Shuchong; Chen, Horng H.; Correia, Cristina; Dai, Haiming; Witt, Tyra A.; Kleppe, Laurel S.; Burnett, John C.; Simari, Robert D.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4242536/,88
1767,Advanced Molecular Surveillance of Hepatitis C Virus,2015-03-13,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important public health problem worldwide. HCV exploits complex molecular mechanisms, which result in a high degree of intrahost genetic heterogeneity. This high degree of variability represents a challenge for the accurate establishment of genetic relatedness between cases and complicates the identification of sources of infection. Tracking HCV infections is crucial for the elucidation of routes of transmission in a variety of settings. Therefore, implementation of HCV advanced molecular surveillance (AMS) is essential for disease control. Accounting for virulence is also important for HCV AMS and both viral and host factors contribute to the disease outcome. Therefore, HCV AMS requires the incorporation of host factors as an integral component of the algorithms used to monitor disease occurrence. Importantly, implementation of comprehensive global databases and data mining are also needed for the proper study of the mechanisms responsible for HCV transmission. Here, we review molecular aspects associated with HCV transmission, as well as the most recent technological advances used for virus and host characterization. Additionally, the cornerstone discoveries that have defined the pathway for viral characterization are presented and the importance of implementing advanced HCV molecular surveillance is highlighted.","Gonçalves Rossi, Livia Maria; Escobar-Gutierrez, Alejandro; Rahal, Paula",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379565/,88
1819,Computational Design of Artificial RNA Molecules for Gene Regulation,2014-10-21,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for the regulation of gene expression. Small exogenous noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as siRNA and shRNA are the active silencing agents, intended to target and cleave complementary mRNAs in a specific way. They are widely and successfully employed in functional studies, and several ongoing and already completed siRNA-based clinical trials suggest encouraging results in the regulation of overexpressed genes in disease. siRNAs share many aspects of their biogenesis and function with miRNAs, small ncRNA molecules transcribed from endogenous genes which are able to repress the expression of target mRNAs by either inhibiting their translation or promoting their degradation. Although siRNA and artificial miRNA molecules can significantly reduce the expression of overexpressed target genes, cancer and other diseases can also be triggered or sustained by upregulated miRNAs. Thus, in the past recent years, molecular tools for miRNA silencing, such as antagomiRs and miRNA sponges, have been developed. These molecules have shown their efficacy in the derepression of genes downregulated by overexpressed miRNAs. In particular, while a single antagomiR is able to inhibit a single complementary miRNA, an artificial sponge construct usually contains one or more binding sites for one or more miRNAs and functions by competing with the natural targets of these miRNAs. As a consequence, natural miRNA targets are reexpressed at their physiological level. In this chapter we review the most successful methods for the computational design of siRNAs, antagomiRs, and miRNA sponges and describe the most popular tools that implement them.","Laganà, Alessandro; Veneziano, Dario; Russo, Francesco; Pulvirenti, Alfredo; Giugno, Rosalba; Croce, Carlo Maria; Ferro, Alfredo",RNA Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425273/,88

To better understand the host interactions at the transcriptional level, microarray data analysis was performed in chicken embryo fibroblast cells at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after infection with REV. This study identified 1,785 differentially expressed genes that were classified into several functional groups including signal transduction, immune response, biological adhesion and endocytosis. Significant differences were mainly observed in the expression of genes involved in the immune response, especially during the later post-infection time points. These results revealed that differentially expressed genes IL6, STAT1, MyD88, TLRs, NF-κB, IRF-7, and ISGs play important roles in the pathogenicity of REV infection. Our study is the first to use microarray analysis to investigate REV, and these findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the host antiviral response and the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis.","Miao, Ji; Bao, Yanqing; Ye, Jianqiang; Shao, Hongxia; Qian, Kun; Qin, Aijian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4431687/,88
1901,Representing virus-host interactions and other multi-organism processes in the Gene Ontology,2015-07-28,"BACKGROUND: The Gene Ontology project is a collaborative effort to provide descriptions of gene products in a consistent and computable language, and in a species-independent manner. The Gene Ontology is designed to be applicable to all organisms but up to now has been largely under-utilized for prokaryotes and viruses, in part because of a lack of appropriate ontology terms. METHODS: To address this issue, we have developed a set of Gene Ontology classes that are applicable to microbes and their hosts, improving both coverage and quality in this area of the Gene Ontology. Describing microbial and viral gene products brings with it the additional challenge of capturing both the host and the microbe. Recognising this, we have worked closely with annotation groups to test and optimize the GO classes, and we describe here a set of annotation guidelines that allow the controlled description of two interacting organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Building on the microbial resources already in existence such as ViralZone, UniProtKB keywords and MeGO, this project provides an integrated ontology to describe interactions between microbial species and their hosts, with mappings to the external resources above. Housing this information within the freely-accessible Gene Ontology project allows the classes and annotation structure to be utilized by a large community of biologists and users.","Foulger, R.

2006,IFNL3 mRNA structure is remodeled by a functional non-coding polymorphism associated with hepatitis C virus clearance,2015-11-04,Polymorphisms near the interferon lambda 3 (IFNL3) gene strongly predict clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We analyzed a variant (rs4803217 G/T) located within the IFNL3 mRNA 3′ untranslated region (UTR); the G allele (protective allele) is associated with elevated therapeutic HCV clearance. We show that the IFNL3 3′ UTR represses mRNA translation and the rs4803217 allele modulates the extent of translational regulation. We analyzed the structures of IFNL3 variant mRNAs at nucleotide resolution by SHAPE-MaP. The rs4803217 G allele mRNA forms well-defined 3′ UTR structure while the T allele mRNA is more dynamic. The observed differences between alleles are among the largest possible RNA structural alterations that can be induced by a single nucleotide change and transform the UTR from a single well-defined conformation to one with multiple dynamic interconverting structures. These data illustrate that non-coding genetic variants can have significant functional effects by impacting RNA structure.,"Lu, Yi-Fan; Mauger, David M.; Goldstein, David B.; Urban, Thomas J.; Weeks, Kevin M.; Bradrick, Shelton S.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631997/,88
2120,The Hepatitis C Virus-Induced Membranous Web and Associated Nuclear Transport Machinery Limit Access of Pattern Recognition Receptors to Viral Replication Sites,2016-02-10,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family and a major cause of liver disease worldwide. HCV replicates in the cytoplasm, and the synthesis of viral proteins induces extensive rearrangements of host cell membranes producing structures, collectively termed the membranous web (MW). The MW contains the sites of viral replication and assembly, and we have identified distinct membrane fractions derived from HCV-infected cells that contain replication and assembly complexes enriched for viral RNA and infectious virus, respectively. The complex membrane structure of the MW is thought to protect the viral genome limiting its interactions with cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and thereby preventing activation of cellular innate immune responses. Here we show that PRRs, including RIG-I and MDA5, and ribosomes are excluded from viral replication and assembly centers within the MW. Furthermore, we present evidence that components of the nuclear transport machinery regulate access of proteins to MW compartments. We show that the restricted assess of RIG-I to the MW can be overcome by the addition of a nuclear localization signal sequence, and that expression of a NLS-RIG-I construct leads to increased immune activation and the inhibition of viral replication.","Neufeldt, Christopher J.; Joyce, Michael A.; Van Buuren, Nicholas; Levin, Aviad; Kirkegaard, Karla; Gale Jr., Michael; Tyrrell, D.

This novel dsRNA targeting metagenomic method is characterized by an extremely high recovery rate of viral RNA sequences, the retrieval of terminal sequences, and uniform read coverage, which has not previously been reported in other metagenomic methods targeting RNA viruses. This method revealed a previously unidentified viral RNA diversity of more than 20 complete RNA viral genomes including dsRNA and ssRNA viruses associated with an environmental diatom colony.

2174,"Porcine Sapelovirus Uses α2,3-Linked Sialic Acid on GD1a Ganglioside as a Receptor",2016-03-28,"The receptor(s) for porcine sapelovirus (PSV), which causes diarrhea, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis, and reproductive disorders in pigs, remains largely unknown. Given the precedent for other picornaviruses which use terminal sialic acids (SAs) as receptors, we examined the role of SAs in PSV binding and infection. Using a variety of approaches, including treating cells with a carbohydrate-destroying chemical (NaIO(4)), mono- or oligosaccharides (N-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and 6′-sialyllactose), linkage-specific sialidases (neuraminidase and sialidase S), lectins (Maakia amurensis lectin and Sambucus nigra lectin), proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin), and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and phospholipase C), we demonstrated that PSV could recognize α2,3-linked SA on glycolipids as a receptor. On the other hand, PSVs had no binding affinity for synthetic histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), suggesting that PSVs could not use HBGAs as receptors. Depletion of cell surface glycolipids followed by reconstitution studies indicated that GD1a ganglioside, but not other gangliosides, could restore PSV binding and infection, further confirming α2,3-linked SA on GD1a as a PSV receptor. Our results could provide significant information on the understanding of the life cycle of sapelovirus and other picornaviruses. For the broader community in the area of pathogens and pathogenesis, these findings and insights could contribute to the development of affordable, useful, and efficient drugs for anti-sapelovirus therapy. IMPORTANCE The porcine sapelovirus (PSV) is known to cause enteritis, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis, and reproductive disorders in pigs. However, the receptor(s) that the PSV utilizes to enter host cells remains largely unknown. Using a variety of approaches, we showed that α2,3-linked terminal sialic acid (SA) on the cell surface GD1a ganglioside could be used for PSV binding and infection as a receptor. On the other hand, histo-blood group antigens also present in the cell surface carbohydrates could not be utilized as PSV receptors for binding and infection.

2232,Interaction of Hsp40 with influenza virus M2 protein: implications for PKR signaling pathway,2010-10-01,"Influenza virus contains three integral membrane proteins: haemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix protein (M1 and M2). Among them, M2 protein functions as an ion channel, important for virus uncoating in endosomes of virus-infected cells and essential for virus replication. In an effort to explore potential new functions of M2 in the virus life cycle, we used yeast two-hybrid system to search for M2-associated cellular proteins. One of the positive clones was identified as human Hsp40/Hdj1, a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein. Here, we report that both BM2 (M2 of influenza B virus) and A/M2 (M2 of influenza A virus) interacted with Hsp40 in vitro and in vivo. The region of M2-Hsp40 interaction has been mapped to the CTD1 domain of Hsp40. Hsp40 has been reported to be a regulator of PKR signaling pathway by interacting with p58(IPK) that is a cellular inhibitor of PKR. PKR is a crucial component of the host defense response against virus infection. We therefore attempted to understand the relationship among M2, Hsp40 and p58(IPK) by further experimentation. The results demonstrated that both A/M2 and BM2 are able to bind to p58(IPK)in vitro and in vivo and enhance PKR autophosphorylation probably via forming a stable complex with Hsp40 and P58(IPK), and consequently induce cell death. These results suggest that influenza virus M2 protein is involved in p58(IPK) mediated PKR regulation during influenza virus infection, therefore affecting infected-cell life cycle and virus replication.","Guan, Zhenhong; Liu, Di; Mi, Shuofu; Zhang, Jie; Ye, Qinong; Wang, Ming; Gao, George F.; Yan, Jinghua",Protein & Cell,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13238-010-0115-x.pdf,88
2243,"Optimized Expression, Purification of Herpes B Virus gD Protein in Escherichia coli, and Production of Its Monoclonal Antibodies",2016-03-12,"BACKGROUND: Herpes B virus (BV) is a zoonotic disease caused by double-stranded enveloped DNA virus with cercopithecidae as its natural host. The mortality rate of infected people could be up to 70% with fatal encephalitis and encephalomyelitis. Up to now, there are no effective treatments for BV infection. Among the various proteins encoded by monkey B virus, gD, a conserved structural protein, harbors important application value for serological diagnosis of frequent variations of the monkey B virus. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to expressed the gD protein of BV in Escherichia coli by a recombinant vector, and prepare specific monoclonal antibodies against gD of BV to pave the way for effective and quick diagnosis reagent research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gD gene of BV was optimized by OptimWiz to improve codon usage bias and synthesis, and the recombinant plasmid, pET32a/gD, was constructed and expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3). The expressed fusion protein, His-gD, was purified and the BALB/c mice were immunized by this protein. Spleen cells from the immunized mice and SP2/0 myeloma cells were fused together, and the monoclonal cell strains were obtained by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening, followed by preparation of monoclonal antibody ascetic fluid. RESULTS: The optimized gD protein was highly expressed in E. coli and successfully purified. Five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against BV were obtained and named as 4E3, 3F8, 3E7, 1H3 and 4B6, and with ascetic fluid titers of 2 × 10(6), 2 × 10(5), 2 × 10(5), 2 × 10(3) and 2 × 10(2), respectively. The 1H3 and 4E3 belonged to the IgG2b subclass, while 3E7, 3F8 and 4B6 belonged to the IgG1 subclass.

2341,A Possible Mechanism of Zika Virus Associated Microcephaly: Imperative Role of Retinoic Acid Response Element (RARE) Consensus Sequence Repeats in the Viral Genome,2016-08-09,"Owing to the reports of microcephaly as a consistent outcome in the fetuses of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Brazil, Zika virus (ZIKV)—microcephaly etiomechanistic relationship has recently been implicated. Researchers, however, are still struggling to establish an embryological basis for this interesting causal handcuff. The present study reveals robust evidence in favor of a plausible ZIKV-microcephaly cause-effect liaison. The rationale is based on: (1) sequence homology between ZIKV genome and the response element of an early neural tube developmental marker “retinoic acid” in human DNA and (2) comprehensive similarities between the details of brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly and retinoic acid embryopathy. Retinoic acid is considered as the earliest factor for regulating anteroposterior axis of neural tube and positioning of structures in developing brain through retinoic acid response elements (RARE) consensus sequence (5′–AGGTCA–3′) in promoter regions of retinoic acid-dependent genes. We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of RARE consensus sequence repeats in the genome of developing brain cells. Additional support to our hypothesis comes from our findings that screening of other viruses for RARE consensus sequence repeats is positive only for those known to display neurotropism and cause fetal brain defects (for which maternal-fetal transmission during developing stage may be required). The numbers of RARE sequence repeats appeared to match with the virulence of screened positive viruses. Although, bioinformatic evidence and embryological features are in favor of our hypothesis, additional studies including animal models are warranted to validate our proposition. Such studies are likely to unfold ZIKV-microcephaly association and may help in devising methods to combat it.","Kumar, Ashutosh; Singh, Himanshu N.; Pareek, Vikas; Raza, Khursheed; Dantham, Subrahamanyam; Kumar, Pavan; Mochan, Sankat; Faiq, Muneeb A.",Front Hum Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4977292/,88

However, since January 2015, the first report of CPV-2c in a puppy has occurred in Taiwan. There is currently limited information about the CPV-2c variant in Taiwan. In the present study, we characterized the previously unidentified CPV-2c variant and investigated the distribution of CPV-2 variants in Taiwan. METHODS: During January 2014 to April 2016, fecal or rectal swab samples from 99 dogs with suspected CPV-2 infection in Taiwan were collected. Eighty-eight were identified as being either CPV-2a, −2b or -2c variants positive by real-time PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of the 88 isolates confirmed CPV-2c as the dominant variant (54.6 %), followed by CPV-2b (26.1 %) and CPV-2a (19.3 %). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent CPV-2c variants are similar to the Chinese CPV-2c strain but can be considered as novel Asian CPV-2c isolates.

The prevalence of CDV is a major concern in susceptible animals. Presently, it is unclear whether intragenic recombination can contribute to gene mutations and segment reassortment in the virus. In this study, 25 full-length CDV genome sequences were subjected to phylogenetic and recombinational analyses. The results of phylogenetic analysis, intragenic recombination, and nucleotide selection pressure indicated that mutation and recombination occurred in the six individual genes segment (H, F, P, N, L, M) of the CDV genome. The analysis also revealed pronounced genetic diversity in the CDV genome according to the geographically distinct lineages (genotypes), namely Asia-1, Asia-2, Asia-3, Europe, America-1, and America-2. The six recombination events were detected using SimPlot and RDP programs. The analysis of selection pressure demonstrated that a majority of the nucleotides in the CDV individual gene were under negative selection. Collectively, these data suggested that homologous recombination acts as a key force driving the genetic diversity and evolution of canine distemper virus.","Yuan, Chaowen; Liu, Wenxin; Wang, Yingbo; Hou, Jinlong; Zhang, Liguo; Wang, Guoqing",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386261/,88
2673,Porcine circovirus type 2 capsid protein induces unfolded protein response with subsequent activation of apoptosis,2017-04-01,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has recently been reported to elicit the unfolded protein response (UPR) via activation of the PERK/eIF2α (RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2α) pathway. This study attempted to examine which viral protein might be involved in inducing UPR and whether this cellular event would lead to apoptosis of the cells expressing the viral protein. By transient expression, we found that both replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins of PCV2 could induce ER stress as shown by increased phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2α-ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4)-CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) axis. Cap expression, but not Rep, significantly reduced antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and increased caspase-3 cleavage, possibly due to increased expression of CHOP. Since knockdown of PERK by RNA interference clearly reduced Cap-induced CHOP expression, caspase-3 cleavage, and apoptotic cell death possibly by partially rescuing Bcl-2 expression, we propose that there is connection between Cap-induced UPR and apoptosis via the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP/Bcl-2 pathway. This study, together with our earlier studies, provides insight into the mechanisms underlying PCV2 pathogenesis.","Zhou, Ying-shan; Gu, Yuan-xing; Qi, Bao-zhu; Zhang, Yi-kai; Li, Xiao-liang; Fang, Wei-huan",Journal of Zhejiang University-SCIENCE B,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5394096?pdf=render,88
2697,"The discovery of a novel compound with potent antitumor activity: virtual screening, synthesis, biological evaluation and preliminary mechanism study",2017-02-21,"Farnesyltransferase has been regarded as a promising drug target against cancer as it is critical for membrane association of several signal transduction proteins. In this study, a novel farnesyltransferase inhibitor (IMB-1406) was identified through virtual screening. It exhibits stronger potency (IC(50)s: 6.92–8.99 μM) than Sunitinib against all of the tested cancer cell lines. Preliminary studies on mechanism reveal that IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the S phase, altering anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3. This anti-tumor effect is most probably related to the inhibition of farnesyltransferase as indicated by molecular docking. Overall, IMB-1406 is a novel lead compound with potent antitumor activity and deserves further structural modifications.","Jin, Yuanyuan; Li, Linhu; Yang, Zhaoyong; Liu, Mingliang; Guo, Huiyuan; Shen, Weiyi",Oncotarget,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421875/,88
2716,Parallel ClickSeq and Nanopore sequencing elucidates the rapid evolution of defective-interfering RNAs in Flock House virus,2017-05-05,"Defective-Interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) have long been known to play an important role in virus replication and transmission. DI-RNAs emerge during virus passaging in both cell-culture and their hosts as a result of non-homologous RNA recombination. However, the principles of DI-RNA emergence and their subsequent evolution have remained elusive. Using a combination of long- and short-read Next-Generation Sequencing, we have characterized the formation of DI-RNAs during serial passaging of Flock House virus (FHV) in cell-culture over a period of 30 days in order to elucidate the pathways and potential mechanisms of DI-RNA emergence and evolution. For short-read RNAseq, we employed ‘ClickSeq’ due to its ability to sensitively and confidently detect RNA recombination events with nucleotide resolution. In parallel, we used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies’s (ONT) MinION to resolve full-length defective and wild-type viral genomes. Together, these accurately resolve both rare and common RNA recombination events, determine the correlation between recombination events, and quantifies the relative abundance of different DI-RNAs throughout passaging. We observe the formation of a diverse pool of defective RNAs at each stage of viral passaging. However, many of these ‘intermediate’ species, while present in early stages of passaging, do not accumulate. After approximately 9 days of passaging we observe the rapid accumulation of DI-RNAs with a correlated reduction in specific infectivity and with the Nanopore data find that DI-RNAs are characterized by multiple RNA recombination events. This suggests that intermediate DI-RNA species are not competitive and that multiple recombination events interact epistatically to confer ‘mature’ DI-RNAs with their selective advantage allowing for their rapid accumulation. Alternatively, it is possible that mature DI-RNA species are generated in a single event involving multiple RNA rearrangements. These insights have important consequences for our understanding of the mechanisms, determinants and limitations in the emergence and evolution of DI-RNAs.","Jaworski, Elizabeth; Routh, Andrew",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435362/,88
2906,Reference gene selection for gene expression study in shell gland and spleen of laying hens challenged with infectious bronchitis virus,2017-10-27,"Ten reference genes were investigated for normalisation of candidate target gene expression data in the shell gland and spleen of laying hens challenged with two strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Data were analysed with geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, and a comprehensive ranking (geomean) was calculated. In the combined data set of IBV challenged shell gland samples, the comprehensive ranking showed TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta (YWHAZ) as the two most stable, and succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A (SDHA) and albumin (ALB) as the two least stable reference genes. In the spleen, and in the combined data set of the shell gland and spleen, the two most stable and the two least stable reference genes were TBP and YWHAZ, and ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and ALB, respectively. Different ranking has been due to different algorithms. Validation studies showed that the use of the two most stable reference genes produced accurate and more robust gene expression data. The two most and least stable reference genes obtained in the study, were further used for candidate target gene expression data normalisation of the shell gland and spleen under an IBV infection model.","Khan, Samiullah; Roberts, Juliet; Wu, Shu-Biao",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5660252/,88

The mechanisms underlying such high viral pathogenicity are incompletely understood. Here, we report that the H5N1 influenza virus encodes a microRNA-like small RNA, miR-HA-3p, which is processed from a stem loop-containing viral RNA precursor by Argonaute 2, and plays a role in enhancing cytokine production during H5N1 infection. Mechanistic study shows that miR-HA-3p targets poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and suppresses its expression. Consistent with PCBP2 being an important negative regulator of RIG-I/MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immunity, suppression of PCBP2 expression by miR-HA-3p promotes cytokine production in human macrophages and mice infected with H5N1 virus. We conclude that miR-HA-3p is the first identified influenza virus-encoded microRNA-like functional RNA fragment and a novel virulence factor contributing to H5N1-induced 'cytokine storm' and mortality.","Li, Xihan; Fu, Zheng; Liang, Hongwei; Wang, Yanbo; Qi, Xian; Ding, Meng; Sun, Xinlei; Zhou, Zhen; Huang, Ying; Gu, Hongwei; Li, Limin; Chen, Xi; Li, Donghai; Zhao, Quan; Liu, Fenyong; Wang, Hua; Wang, Jin; Zen, Ke; Zhang, Chen-Yu",Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5799819/,88
3119,In Vivo Characterisation of Five Strains of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus 1 (Subgenotype 1c),2018-01-19,"Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is strongly associated with several important diseases of cattle, such as bovine respiratory disease, diarrhoea and haemoragic lesions. To date many subgenotypes have been reported for BVDV-1, currently ranging from subgenotype 1a to subgenotype 1u. While BVDV-1 has a world-wide distribution, the subgenotypes have a more restricted geographical distribution. As an example, BVDV-1 subgenotypes 1a and 1b are frequently detected in North America and Europe, while the subgenotype 1c is rarely detected. In contrast, BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c is by far the most commonly reported in Australia. Despite this, uneven distribution of the biological importance of the subgenotypes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to characterise the in vivo properties of five strains of BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c in cattle infection studies. No overt respiratory signs were reported in any of the infected cattle regardless of strain. Consistent with other subgenotypes, transient pyrexia and leukopenia were commonly identified, while thrombocytopenia was not. The quantity of virus detected in the nasal secretions of transiently infected animals suggested the likelihood of horizontal transmission was very low. Further studies are required to fully understand the variability and importance of the BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c.","Ambrose, Rebecca K.; Gravel, Jennifer L.; Commins, Margaret A.; Fowler, Elizabeth V.; Mahony, Timothy J.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5874738/,88

The main purpose of the present study is to investigate GALT induced cross-protection between different APP serotypes and elucidate key mechanisms of the immune response to GALT antigenic stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that galT is a highly conserved gene in APP, widely distributed across multiple pathogenic strains. Homologies between any two strains ranges from 78.9% to 100% regarding the galT locus. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed that GALT specific antibodies could not be induced by inactivated APP L20 or MS71 whole cell bacterin preparations. A recombinant fusion GALT protein derived from APP L20, however has proven to be an effective cross-protective antigen against APP sevorar 1 MS71 (50%, 4/8) and APP sevorar 5b L20 (75%, 6/8). Histopathological examinations have confirmed that recombinant GALT vaccinated animals showed less severe pathological signs in lung tissues than negative controls after APP challenge. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis indicated that the infiltration of neutrophils in the negative group is significantly increased compared with that in the normal control (P<0.001) and that in surviving animals is decreased compared to the negative group. Anti-GALT antibodies were shown to mediate phagocytosis of neutrophils. After interaction with anti-GALT antibodies, survival rate of APP challenged vaccinated animals was significantly reduced (P<0.001). This study demonstrated that GALT is an effective cross-protective antigen, which could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against multiple APP serotypes.","Zhang, Fei; Zhao, Qin; Quan, Keji; Zhu, Zhuang; Yang, Yusheng; Wen, Xintian; Chang, Yung-Fu; Huang, Xiaobo; Wu, Rui; Wen, Yiping; Yan, Qigui; Huang, Yong; Ma, Xiaoping; Han, Xinfeng; Cao, Sanjie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983418/,88
3503,Immunogenicity of Pigeon Circovirus Recombinant Capsid Protein in Pigeons,2018-10-31,"Pigeon circovirus (PiCV) is the most frequently diagnosed virus in pigeons and is thought to be one of the causative factors of a complex disease called the young pigeon disease syndrome (YPDS). The development of a vaccine against this virus could be a strategy for YPDS control. Since laboratory culture of PiCV is impossible, its recombinant capsid protein (rCP) can be considered as a potential antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines. The aim of this basic research was to evaluate the immune response of pigeons to PiCV rCP. Sixty six-week-old carrier pigeons were divided into two groups (experimental immunized with PiCV rCP mixed with an adjuvant, and control immunized with an adjuvant only), and immunized twice in a 21-day interval. On the day of immunization and on two, 23, 39, and 46 days post first immunization (dpv), samples of blood, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius were collected from six birds from each group to examine anti-PiCV rCP IgY, anti-PiCV rCP IgY-secreting B cells (SBC), IFN-γ gene expression, and percentage of T CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and B IgM(+) lymphocytes. The results indicated a correct immune response to PiCV rCP both in humoral and cell-mediated immunity, which was manifested by seroconversion since 23 dpv, by a significantly higher anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC number on two and 23 dpv, and significantly higher IFN-γ gene expression since two dpv. There were no significant differences or trends noted between particular T and B lymphocyte subpopulations. To conclude, PiCV rCP may be deemed immunogenic and could be considered as an antigen candidate in sub-unit vaccines against PiCV infections in pigeons.","Stenzel, Tomasz; Dziewulska, Daria; Tykałowski, Bartłomiej; Śmiałek, Marcin; Kowalczyk, Joanna; Koncicki, Andrzej",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6265742/,88

3662,Quantitative impacts of incubation phase transmission of foot-and-mouth disease virus,2019-02-25,"The current investigation applied a Bayesian modeling approach to a unique experimental transmission study to estimate the occurrence of transmission of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) during the incubation phase amongst group-housed pigs. The primary outcome was that transmission occurred approximately one day prior to development of visible signs of disease (posterior median 21 hours, 95% CI: 1.1–45.0). Updated disease state durations were incorporated into a simulation model to examine the importance of addressing preclinical transmission in the face of robust response measures. Simulation of FMD outbreaks in the US pig production sector demonstrated that including a preclinical infectious period of one day would result in a 40% increase in the median number of farms affected (166 additional farms and 664,912 pigs euthanized) compared to the scenario of no preclinical transmission, assuming suboptimal outbreak response. These findings emphasize the importance of considering transmission of FMD during the incubation phase in modeling and response planning.","Arzt, Jonathan; Branan, Matthew A.; Delgado, Amy H.; Yadav, Shankar; Moreno-Torres, Karla I.; Tildesley, Michael J.; Stenfeldt, Carolina",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389902/,88
3868,Efficient Production of Human Norovirus-Specific IgY in Egg Yolks by Vaccination of Hens with a Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Expressing VP1 Protein,2019-05-16,"Human norovirus (HuNoV) is responsible for more than 95% of outbreaks of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Despite major efforts, there are no vaccines or effective therapeutic interventions against this virus. Chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY)-based passive immunization has been shown to be an effective strategy to prevent and treat many enteric viral diseases. Here, we developed a highly efficient bioreactor to generate high titers of HuNoV-specific IgY in chicken yolks using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing HuNoV capsid protein (rVSV-VP1) as an antigen. We first demonstrated that HuNoV VP1 protein was highly expressed in chicken cells infected by rVSV-VP1. Subsequently, we found that White Leghorn hens immunized intramuscularly with rVSV-VP1 triggered a high level of HuNoV-specific yolk IgY antibodies. The purified yolk IgY was efficiently recognized by HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs). Importantly, HuNoV-specific IgY efficiently blocked the binding of HuNoV VLPs to all three types (A, B, and O) of histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), the attachment factors for HuNoV. In addition, the receptor blocking activity of IgY remained stable at temperature below 70 °C and at pH ranging from 4 to 9. Thus, immunization of hens with VSV-VP1 could be a cost-effective and practical strategy for large-scale production of anti-HuNoV IgY antibodies for potential use as prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against HuNoV infection.","Zhu, Yang; Ma, Yuanmei; Lu, Mijia; Zhang, Yu; Li, Anzhong; Liang, Xueya; Li, Jianrong",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6563233/,88
3930,Reverse Engineering Provides Insights on the Evolution of Subgroups A to E Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus Receptor Specificity †,2019-05-30,"The initial step of retrovirus entry—the interaction between the virus envelope glycoprotein trimer and a cellular receptor—is complex, involving multiple, noncontiguous determinants in both proteins that specify receptor choice, binding affinity and the ability to trigger conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins. Despite the complexity of this interaction, retroviruses have the ability to evolve the structure of their envelope glycoproteins to use a different cellular protein as receptors. The highly homologous subgroup A to E Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus (ASLV) glycoproteins belong to the group of class 1 viral fusion proteins with a two-step triggering mechanism that allows experimental access to intermediate structures during the fusion process. We and others have taken advantage of replication-competent ASLVs and exploited genetic selection strategies to force the ASLVs to naturally evolve and acquire envelope glycoprotein mutations to escape the pressure on virus entry and still yield a functional replicating virus. This approach allows for the simultaneous selection of multiple mutations in multiple functional domains of the envelope glycoprotein that may be required to yield a functional virus. Here, we review the ASLV family and experimental system and the reverse engineering approaches used to understand the evolution of ASLV receptor usage.","Federspiel, Mark J.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630264/,88

Human cases of SEOV virus infection have most recently been reported in the USA, United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands and were primarily associated with contact with pet rats and feeder rats. Infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection. Little is known about the cell tropism of SEOV in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature. Here we report the histopathological analysis of SEOV cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats, comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles. All adult rats in this study were positive for SEOV specific antibodies and viral RNA in their tissues. One juvenile rat was seropositive, but negative in the rRT-PCR. Of the 19 adult rats of which subsequently additional organs were tested, SEOV RNA was detected in all lungs, followed by kidney (79%) and liver (74%). Histopathologic changes associated with SEOV infection were primarily found in the liver, consistent with a pathological diagnosis of a mild hepatitis.

Great efforts have been made in developing more effective and less side-effects anti-herpes simplex virus agents, including traditional Chinese herbal medicines. In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of Rheum tanguticum nanoparticles against HSV-1 in vitro and in vivo. R. tanguticum nanoparticles could inactivate the HSV-1 virions and block the viral attachment and entry into cells. Time-of-addition assay indicated that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could interfere with the entire phase of viral replication. Besides, R. tanguticum nanoparticles showed the ability to inhibit the mRNA expression of HSV-1 immediate early gene ICP4 and early gene ICP8 as well as the expression of viral protein ICP4 and ICP8. Moreover, R. tanguticum nanoparticles have been proved to protect mice against HSV-1 induced lethality by decreasing the viral load and alleviated pathological changes in brain tissues. In conclusion, we demonstrated that R. tanguticum nanoparticles could inhibit HSV-1 infection through multiple mechanisms.

4067,Multiple Long-Read Sequencing Survey of Herpes Simplex Virus Dynamic Transcriptome,2019-09-24,"Long-read sequencing (LRS) has become increasingly important in RNA research due to its strength in resolving complex transcriptomic architectures. In this regard, currently two LRS platforms have demonstrated adequate performance: the Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and the nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Even though these techniques produce lower coverage and are more error prone than short-read sequencing, they continue to be more successful in identifying polycistronic RNAs, transcript isoforms including splice and transcript end variants, as well as transcript overlaps. Recent reports have successfully applied LRS for the investigation of the transcriptome of viruses belonging to various families. These studies have substantially increased the number of previously known viral RNA molecules. In this work, we used the Sequel and MinION technique from PacBio and ONT, respectively, to characterize the lytic transcriptome of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In most samples, we analyzed the poly(A) fraction of the transcriptome, but we also performed random oligonucleotide-based sequencing. Besides cDNA sequencing, we also carried out native RNA sequencing. Our investigations identified more than 2,300 previously undetected transcripts, including coding, and non-coding RNAs, multi-splice transcripts, as well as polycistronic and complex transcripts. Furthermore, we found previously unsubstantiated transcriptional start sites, polyadenylation sites, and splice sites. A large number of novel transcriptional overlaps were also detected. Random-primed sequencing revealed that each convergent gene pair produces non-polyadenylated read-through RNAs overlapping the partner genes. Furthermore, we identified novel replication-associated transcripts overlapping the HSV-1 replication origins, and novel LAT variants with very long 5’ regions, which are co-terminal with the LAT-0.7kb transcript. Overall, our results demonstrated that the HSV-1 transcripts form an extremely complex pattern of overlaps, and that entire viral genome is transcriptionally active. In most viral genes, if not in all, both DNA strands are expressed.","Tombácz, Dóra; Moldován, Norbert; Balázs, Zsolt; Gulyás, Gábor; Csabai, Zsolt; Boldogkői, Miklós; Snyder, Michael; Boldogkői, Zsolt",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769088/,88

As training sets for the model, we measured frameshifting efficiencies on 64 dnaX mRNA sequence variants in vitro and also used 21 published in vivo efficiencies. With the obtained free-energy difference between mRNA-tRNA base pairs in the 0 and −1 frames, the frameshifting efficiency of a given sequence can be reproduced and predicted from the tRNA−mRNA base pairing in the two frames. Our results further explain how modifications in the tRNA anticodon modulate frameshifting and show how the ribosome tunes the strength of the base-pair interactions.","Bock, Lars V.; Caliskan, Neva; Korniy, Natalia; Peske, Frank; Rodnina, Marina V.; Grubmüller, Helmut",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787027/,88

Unlike the P(S/T)AP and YPX((1–3))L late domains, which interact directly with the ESCRT proteins Tsg101 and ALIX, the molecular linkage connecting the PPXY late domain to ESCRT proteins is unclear. The mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) matrix protein, Z, contains only one late domain, PPXY. We previously found that this domain in LCMV Z, as well as the ESCRT pathway, are required for the release of defective interfering (DI) particles but not infectious virus. To better understand the molecular mechanism of ESCRT recruitment by the PPXY late domain, affinity purification-mass spectrometry was used to identify host proteins that interact with the Z proteins of the Old World mammarenaviruses LCMV and Lassa virus. Several Nedd4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases interact with these matrix proteins and in the case of LCMV Z, the interaction was PPXY-dependent. We demonstrated that these ligases directly ubiquitinate LCMV Z and mapped the specific lysine residues modified. A recombinant LCMV containing a Z that cannot be ubiquitinated maintained its ability to produce both infectious virus and DI particles, suggesting that direct ubiquitination of LCMV Z alone is insufficient for recruiting ESCRT proteins to mediate virus release. However, Nedd4 ligases appear to be important for DI particle release suggesting that ubiquitination of targets other than the Z protein itself is required for efficient viral ESCRT recruitment.","Ziegler, Christopher M.; Dang, Loan; Eisenhauer, Philip; Kelly, Jamie A.; King, Benjamin R.; Klaus, Joseph P.; Manuelyan, Inessa; Mattice, Ethan B.; Shirley, David J.; Weir, Marion E.; Bruce, Emily A.; Ballif, Bryan A.; Botten, Jason",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6874086/,88

The unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV. In the present investigation, in silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (5a–f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out. nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding pocket of the macrodomain. The 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO) of CHIKV. Compounds 5c and 5d showed docking scores of −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol(–1), respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm their (5a–f) antiviral potential against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and was found to be <100 μM. The compounds 5c and 5d showed their inhibitory potential for CHIKV, which was determined through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 μM concentration of the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of 5c and 5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 μM concentration of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants, leading to remedial management to preclude CHIKV infection.","Puranik, Ninad V.; Rani, Ruchi; Singh, Vedita Anand; Tomar, Shailly; Puntambekar, Hemalata M.; Srivastava, Pratibha",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893968/,88

The continuous struggle between viruses and their hosts to maintain at least a constant fitness level led to the development of an unceasing arms race, where weapons are often shuttled between the participants.

4397,Prediction of RNA-protein interactions using conjoint triad feature and chaos game representation,2018-08-17,"RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) play a very important role in a wide range of post-transcriptional regulations, and identifying whether a given RNA-protein pair can form interactions or not is a vital prerequisite for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of functional RNAs. Currently, expensive and time-consuming biological assays can only determine a very small portion of all RPIs, which calls for computational approaches to help biologists efficiently and correctly find candidate RPIs. Here, we integrated a successful computing algorithm, conjoint triad feature (CTF), and another method, chaos game representation (CGR), for representing RNA-protein pairs and by doing so developed a prediction model based on these representations and random forest (RF) classifiers. When testing two benchmark datasets, RPI369 and RPI2241, the combined method (CTF+CGR) showed some superiority compared with four existing tools. Especially on RPI2241, the CTF+CGR method improved prediction accuracy (ACC) from 0.91 (the best record of all published works) to 0.95. When independently testing a newly constructed dataset, RPI1449, which only contained experimentally validated RPIs released between 2014 and 2016, our method still showed some generalization capability with an ACC of 0.75. Accordingly, we believe that our hybrid CTF+CGR method will be an important tool for predicting RPIs in the future.","Wang, Hongchu; Wu, Pengfei",Bioengineered,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6984769/,88

The method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection, a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections, especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic. This review summarizes the different LAMP methods that have been developed for the virus and summarizes their features, advantages, and limitations.","da Silva, Severino Jefferson Ribeiro; Pardee, Keith; Pena, Lindomar",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019470/,88
4568,Acetylation at K108 of the NS1 protein is important for the replication and virulence of influenza virus,2020-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Topical 0.12% chlorhexidine has been used widely to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. However, it is not approved for mucosal application in Japan. The aims of this study were to investigate if topical povidone iodine (i) inhibits bacterial growth and (ii) disrupts the balance of the oral microbiota. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial included 23 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: the intervention group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 7). All patients received oral cleaning with 3% hydrogen peroxide, followed by irrigation with tap water. The patients in the intervention group received 10% povidone iodine applied topically to the oral cavity. The concentration of total bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid were determined before, immediately after, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after oral care using the Rapid Oral Bacteria Quantification System, which is based on dielectrophoresis and impedance measurements. The number of streptococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans before, immediately after, 1 h, and 3 h after oral care were estimated based on real-time polymerase chain reaction data. RESULTS: After irrigation of the oral cavity, the number of bacteria decreased, but increased again at 1 h after oral care in the control group; however, in the intervention group, the concentration of bacteria was significantly lower than that in the control group at 1 hour (p = 0.009), 2 h (p = 0.001), and 3 h (p = 0.001) after oral care. The growth of all bacterial species tested was inhibited in the intervention group at 3 h after oral care, suggesting that povidone iodine did not disturb the balance of the oral microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of povidone iodine after cleaning and irrigation of the oral cavity inhibited bacterial growth in the oropharyngeal fluid of patients on mechanical ventilation while not disrupting the balance of the oral microbiota.

4625,Identification of Linear B-Cell Epitopes on Hemagglutinin Protein of Canine Distemper Virus Using Two Monoclonal Antibodies,2020-02-28,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of applying the respiratory “critical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated management model” in severe stroke-associated pneumonia and evaluate its effect. METHODS: From January to September 2018, 24 patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, who were admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit of the Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Department of Henan Provincial People’s Hospital, were randomly divided into two groups: integrated management group and control group. According to the admission criteria of the respiratory “critical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated model” prescribed by the above-mentioned hospital, patients were grouped. The professional respiratory therapy team participated in the whole treatment. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) and oxygenation index of these two groups were dynamically observed, and the average hospital stay, 28-day mortality and patient satisfaction were investigated. RESULTS: Patients in the integrated management group and control group were similar before treatment (P > 0.05). After treatment, the main indicators, the APACHE II score, CPIS score and oxygenation index, were significantly different between the integration group and control group (P < 0.05). The secondary indicators, the average hospitalization days and patient/family member satisfaction scores, were also significantly different between the integration group and control group (P < 0.05). However, the 28-day mortality wasn’t significantly different (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, it was feasible to implement the respiratory “critical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated management model”, which could significantly improve the treatment effect, shorten average hospitalization days and improve patient/family satisfaction.","Wang, Xue-Lin; Ma, Li-Jun; Hu, Xin-Gang; Wang, Kai; Cheng, Jian-Jian",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7059713/,88
4810,Inhibition of Human Cytomegalovirus Entry into Host Cells through A Pleiotropic Small Molecule,2020-02-29,"BACKGROUND: Drug safety assessments in clinical trials present unique analytical challenges. Some of these include adjusting for individual follow-up time, repeated measurements of multiple outcomes and missing data among others. Furthermore, pre-specifying appropriate analysis becomes difficult as some safety endpoints are unexpected. Although existing guidelines such as CONSORT encourage thorough reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials, they provide limited details for safety data analysis. The limited guidelines may influence suboptimal analysis by failing to account for some analysis challenges above. A typical example where such challenges exist are trials of anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy. Lack of proper standardized evaluation of the safety of antimalarial drugs has limited the ability to draw conclusions about safety. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to establish the current practice in statistical analysis for preventive antimalarial drug safety in pregnancy. METHODS: The search included five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Malaria in Pregnancy Library and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify original English articles reporting Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention in pregnancy published from January 2010 to July 2019. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were included in this review that collected multiple longitudinal safety outcomes including AEs. Statistical analysis and reporting of the safety outcomes in all the trials used descriptive statistics; proportions/counts (n = 18, 100%) and mean/median (n = 2, 11.1%). Results presentation included tabular (n = 16, 88.9%) and text description (n = 2, 11.1%). Univariate inferential methods were reported in most trials (n = 16, 88.9%); including Chi square/Fisher’s exact test (n = 12, 66.7%), t test (n = 2, 11.1%) and Mann–Whitney/Wilcoxon test (n = 1, 5.6%). Multivariable methods, including Poisson and negative binomial were reported in few trials (n = 3, 16.7%). Assessment of a potential link between missing efficacy data and safety outcomes was not reported in any of the trials that reported efficacy missing data (n = 7, 38.9%). CONCLUSION: The review demonstrated that statistical analysis of safety data in anti-malarial drugs for malarial chemoprevention in pregnancy RCTs is inadequate. The analyses insufficiently account for multiple safety outcomes potential dependence, follow-up time and informative missing data which can compromise anti-malarial drug safety evidence development, based on the available data.","Patson, Noel; Mukaka, Mavuto; Otwombe, Kennedy N.; Kazembe, Lawrence; Mathanga, Don P.; Mwapasa, Victor; Kabaghe, Alinune N.; Eijkemans, Marinus J.

4825,Demyelination in mice resulting from infection with a mutant of Semliki Forest virus,1981,"A study was made to determine the causative lesion of Marek's disease virus (MDV)-induced transient paralysis (TP) in chickens by comparing the ultrastructure of brain tissue from MDV-infected genetically susceptible and resistant birds. There were numerous intramyelinic vacuoles in the brains of TP-affected birds. Many of these vacuoles contained particulate material compatible with precipitated protein from edema. Astrocyte processes often were distended with similar particulate material. Most intrameylinic vacuoles were either adjacent to the axolemma or within inner myelin lamellae. Myelin sheaths of affected axons, while being displaced, were relatively normal with no vesiculation. Most affected axons were also otherwise normal. Cell processes adjacent to occasional affected axons were distended by degenerating mitochondria, vacuoles, and amorphous material. Some of these processes appeared to be inner loops of oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. The cell bodies of most oligodendrocytes were normal, but a few contained vacuoles similar to those seen in processes adjacent to axons. There were scattered necrotic cells. While most of these could not be specifically identified, some appeared to be oligodendrocytes. Mononuclear inflammatory cells were present both perivascularly and within the parenchyma. Although these cells occasionally contacted myelinated axons and there was myelin phagocytosis, there was no indication that they initiated demyelination. Brain tissue from virus-inoculated resistant birds had perivascular aggregates of mononuclear cells, but there were no intramyelinic vacuoles and few necrotic cells. These findings suggest that intramyelinic vacuolation contributes to the pathogenesis of transient paralysis. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the vacuoles, including brain edema and oligodendrocyte injury, are discussed.","Kornegay, J. N.; Gorgacz, E.

Using these primers, the genome RNA from twelve strains of the various serotypes were reverse-transcribed to cDNA and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With all strains, 400 base DNA was amplified, indicating that there were no apparent insertions or deletions in this region. However, the amplified DNA showed different cleavage patterns by the restriction enzymes. These 12 strains were classified into 5 groups. The strain typing based on a comparison of the cleavage patterns was consistent with the previous serological typing.

4984,Mapping of viral epitopes with prokaryotic expression products,1990,"Previous virological and immunological studies have suggested that multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto-immune disease triggered by a virus infection. In order to inhibit the growth of measles virus in the patient's jejunum, we obtained an IgA-rich cow colostrum containing anti-measles lactoglobulin resistant to proteases. This colostrum was orally administered to patients with MS to investigate its effect on the course of the disease. Measles-positive antibody colostrum was orally administered every morning to 15 patients with MS at a daily dosage of 100 ml for 30 days. Similarly, measles-negative antibody (< 8) control colostrum was orally administered to 5 patients. As a clinical assessment, disability scores developed by the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies were used. As a result, of 7 high NT titre (512–5120) anti-measles colostrum recipients 5 patients improved and 2 remained unchanged. Among 8 low NT titre (8–32) anti-measles colostrum recipients 5 patients improved and 3 remained unchanged. However, of 5 negative NT titre (< 8) colostrum recipients 2 patients remained unchanged and 3 worsened. No side-effects were observed in colostrum recipients. These findings suggest the efficacy of orally administered anti-measles colostrum in improving the condition of MS patients (P < 0.05).","Ebina, T.; Sato, A.; Umezu, K.; Aso, H.; Ishida, N.; Seki, H.; Tsukamoto, T.; Takase, S.; Hoshi, S.; Ohta, M.",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087162/,88

5212,Viral genome cleavage with artificial ribonucleases: A new method to inactivate RNA-containing viruses,2009-09-03,"“Societal teleconnections” – analogous to physical teleconnections such as El Niño – are human-created linkages that link activities, trends, and disruptions across large distances, such that locations spatially separated from the locus of an event can experience a variety of impacts from it nevertheless. In the climate change context, such societal teleconnections add a layer of risk that is currently neither fully appreciated in most impacts or vulnerability assessments nor in on-the-ground adaptation planning. Conceptually, societal teleconnections arise from the interactions among actors, and the institutions that guide their actions, affecting the movement of various substances through different structures and processes. Empirically, they arise out of societal interactions, including globalization, to create, amplify, and sometimes attenuate climate change vulnerabilities and impacts in regions far from those where a climatic extreme or change occurs. This paper introduces a simple but systematic way to conceptualize societal teleconnections and then highlights and explores eight unique but interrelated types of societal teleconnections with selected examples: (1) trade and economic exchange, (2) insurance and reinsurance, (3) energy systems, (4) food systems; (5) human health, (6) population migration, (7) communication, and (8) strategic alliances and military interactions. The paper encourages further research to better understand the causal chains behind socially teleconnected impacts, and to identify ways to routinely integrate their consideration in impacts/vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning to limit the risk of costly impacts.

The sero-prevalences of the first four diseases were respectively 76.2, 94.4, 42.1 and 87.4%. Five samples (2.3%) gave doubtful reactions for BT. Prevalences of 28.5% for brucellosis, 14% for Rift Valley fever (RFV), 0.9% for Q fever and 11.2% for chlamydiosis were also recorded. Significantly higher values for BVD-MD (p<0.005), IBR-IPV (p<0.01) and brucellosis (p<0.05) were found in animals over 1 year of age. No differences were recorded between herds or between male and female animals. The high concentration of wild and domestic ruminants grazing together in the flood plains during the dry season may be a major determinant of the high values observed. Traditional farmers, slaughterhouse workers and other people involved in livestock production are particularly at risk of contracting brucellosis and RVF because of the high prevalences in cattle and local habits favourable to their transmission.","Ghirotti, M.; Semproni, G.; De Meneghi, D.; Mungaba, F.

The receptor-like protein was identified by exploiting the molecular mimicry potential of anti-idiotypic antibodies. A single-chain Fv molecule derived from the monoclonal antibody 7A (Mab-7A), which recognizes the CP of TuMV, was produced in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein was used to raise rabbit antibodies. The immune serum reacted with Mab-7A but not with a monoclonal antibody of the same isotype, indicating that anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced. These anti-idiotypic antibodies recognized a 37 kDa protein from Lactuca sativa. Complex formation between the anti-idiotypic antibodies and the plant protein was inhibited by the CP of TuMV which indicates that the plant protein interacts with the viral protein. The 37 kDa protein was localized in chloroplasts and was detected in other plant species.","McClintock, Katherine; Lamarre, Alain; Parsons, Valérie; Laliberté, Jean-François; Fortin, Marc G.",Plant Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088609/,88

These methods demonstrated acute Chlamydophila-induced diseases such as epizootic bovine abortion, as well as worldwide variable, but generally high, Chlamydophila seroprevalence. However, it was impossible to consistently detect the low levels of these organisms which were suspected to be present in endemic infections. Application of highly sensitive real-time PCR and ELISA methods for detection of Chlamydophila spp. DNA and of antibodies against Chlamydophila spp., respectively, in a series of prospective cohort studies revealed a high prevalence of Chlamydophila spp. genital infections in female calves (61%) and adult heifers (53%). These infections were acquired by extragenital transmission in the first weeks of life, and infection frequency was increased by crowding of the animals. A challenge study demonstrated that infection with C. abortus resulted in decreased fertility of heifers. The experimental use of a C. abortus vaccine provided evidence for immunoprotection against C. abortus-induced suppression of bovine fertility. The results of these investigations suggest that bovine Chlamydophila infection should be viewed more as pervasive, low-level infection of cattle than as rare, severe disease. Such infections proceed without apparent disease or with only subtle expressions of disease, but potentially have a large impact on bovine herd health and fertility.","Kaltenboeck, B.; Hehnen, H. -R.; Vaglenov, A.",Vet Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088619/,88
5364,Analysis of codon usage in Newcastle disease virus,2011-01-20,"This study aimed to analyze main groups accused on social media of causing or spreading the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. In this analysis, blame is construed as a vehicle of meaning through which the lay public makes sense of an epidemic, and through which certain classes of people become “figures of blame”. Data was collected from Twitter and Facebook using key word extraction, then categorized thematically. Our findings indicate an overall proximate blame tendency: blame was typically cast on “near-by” figures, namely national governments, and less so on “distant” figures, such as generalized figures of otherness (“Africans”, global health authorities, global elites). Our results also suggest an evolution of online blame. In the early stage of the epidemic, blame directed at the affected populations was more prominent. However, during the peak of the outbreak, the increasingly perceived threat of inter-continental spread was accompanied by a progressively proximal blame tendency, directed at figures with whom the social media users had pre-existing biopolitical frustrations. Our study proposes that pro-active and on-going analysis of blame circulating in social media can usefully help to guide communications strategies, making them more responsive to public perceptions.","Roy, Melissa; Moreau, Nicolas; Rousseau, Cécile; Mercier, Arnaud; Wilson, Andrew; Atlani-Duault, Laëtitia",Cult Med Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088957/,88

The isolate, serologically distinct from other avian reoviruses, was isolated in turkey embryo kidney cells and RNA was purified for cDNA synthesis. Oligonucleotide primers were designed based on conserved avian S3 nucleotide sequence data. The NC98 S3 open reading frame comprised 1101 base pairs and encoded 366 amino acids with a predicated molecular mass of 40.5 kDa. Although the S3 nucleotide sequence from several chicken isolates share at least 86% identity, they share only 64% with the NC98 turkey isolate. Interestingly, the S3 nucleotide sequence from a muscovy duck reovirus shares 55% identity with NC98 and 53% identity with chicken isolates. As observed in other avian reovirus σ2 protein sequences, a zinc-binding motif and double-stranded RNA binding domain were found within the predicted amino acid sequence of NC98. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced σ2 sequence demonstrated that NC98 separated as a distinct virus relative to other avian strains. The results of this study indicate that NC98 is a novel turkey reovirus that shares limited genomic sequence identity to isolates of chicken and duck origin and should be considered a separate virus species within subgroup 2 of the Orthoreovirus genus.","Kapczynski, Darrell; Sellers, Holly; Simmons, Valrie; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089376/,88

Interaction of GP with cellular receptors alone or coupled to exposure to the acidic environment of endosomes induces extensive conformational changes in the fusion protein which pull two membranes into close enough proximity to trigger bilayer fusion. The refolding process provides the energy for fusion and repositions both membrane anchors, the transmembrane and the fusion peptide regions, at the same end of an elongated hairpin structure in all fusion protein structures known to date. The fusion process follows several lipidic intermediate states, which are generated by the refolding process. Although the major principles of viral fusion are understood, the structures of fusion protein intermediates and their mode of lipid bilayer interaction, the structures and functions of the membrane anchors and the number of fusion proteins required for fusion, necessitate further investigations.","Weissenhorn, Winfried; Hinz, Andreas; Gaudin, Yves",FEBS Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094569/,88

However, the mechanisms utilized by enterovirus 71 (EV71) to mediate anti-apoptotic activity remained undetermined. We observed that EV71 infection induced an early activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. The activity of GSK3β, a downstream target of these pathways, was negatively regulated by the activation of both MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. The phosphorylation of GSK3 could be inhibited by treatment with the specific inhibitors of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. Other Akt downstream targets, BAD, caspase-9 and the Forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), were not phosphorylated during the course of infection by EV71. We further demonstrated that infection by UV-irradiated, inactivated virus triggered early Akt activation but was insufficient to trigger late Akt activation. These data suggest that with the phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt the subsequent inactivation of GSK3β is utilized by EV71 as a potential mechanism to delay host cell apoptosis.","Wong, Wen-Rou; Chen, Yu-Yun; Yang, Shun-Min; Chen, Yin-Li; Horng, Jim-Tong",Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094582/,88

We characterized in mammalian cells the model of ribosomal stalling at the STOP-codon based on proteins tagged at the C-terminus with the picornavirus 2A peptide followed by a termination codon instead of the Proline (2A*). We exploited the 2A* stalling model to characterize the pathway of degradation of ER-targeted polypeptides. We report that the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 is a new main factor involved. Moreover, degradation of the ER-stalled polypeptides required the activities of the AAA-ATPase VCP/p97, its associated deubiquitinylase YOD1, the ribosome-associated ubiquitin ligase Listerin and the proteasome. In human proteome, we found two human C-terminal amino acid sequences that cause similar stalling at the STOP-codon. Our data suggest that translational stalling at the ER membrane activates protein degradation at the interface of ribosomal- and ER-associated quality control systems.","Cesaratto, Francesca; Sasset, Linda; Myers, Michael P.; Re, Angela; Petris, Gianluca; Burrone, Oscar R.",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094721/,88

6179,Long live structural biology,2004,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilation and impaired contraction that is not explained by abnormal loading conditions (for example, hypertension and valvular heart disease) or coronary artery disease. Mutations in several genes can cause DCM, including genes encoding structural components of the sarcomere and desmosome. Nongenetic forms of DCM can result from different aetiologies, including inflammation of the myocardium due to an infection (mostly viral); exposure to drugs, toxins or allergens; and systemic endocrine or autoimmune diseases. The heterogeneous aetiology and clinical presentation of DCM make a correct and timely diagnosis challenging. Echocardiography and other imaging techniques are required to assess ventricular dysfunction and adverse myocardial remodelling, and immunological and histological analyses of an endomyocardial biopsy sample are indicated when inflammation or infection is suspected. As DCM eventually leads to impaired contractility, standard approaches to prevent or treat heart failure are the first-line treatment for patients with DCM. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter–defibrillators may be required to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. In addition, identifying the probable cause of DCM helps tailor specific therapies to improve prognosis. An improved aetiology-driven personalized approach to clinical care will benefit patients with DCM, as will new diagnostic tools, such as serum biomarkers, that enable early diagnosis and treatment.","Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter; Fairweather, DeLisa; Caforio, Alida L.

7125,Herpes simplex virus 1 regulates β-catenin expression in TG neurons during the latency-reactivation cycle,2020-03-30,"A sensitive and specific method for the analysis of anisodamine and its metabolites in rat urine by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was developed. Various extraction techniques (free fraction, acid hydrolyses and enzyme hydrolyses) and their comparison were carried out for investigation of the metabolism of anisodamine. After extraction procedure the pretreated samples were injected on a reversed-phase C18 column with mobile phase (0.2 ml/min) of methanol/0.01% triethylamine solution (adjusted to pH 3.5 with formic acid) (60:40, v/v) and detected by MS/MS. Identification and structural elucidation of the metabolites were performed by comparing their changes in molecular masses (ΔM), retention-times and full scan MS(n) spectra with those of the parent drug. At least 11 metabolites (N-demethyl-6β-hydroxytropine, 6β-hydroxytropine, tropic acid, N-demethylanisodamine, hydroxyanisodamine, anisodamine N-oxide, hydroxyanisodamine N-oxide, glucuronide conjugated N-demethylanisodamine, sulfate conjugated and glucuronide conjugated anisodamine, sulfate conjugated hydroxyanisodamine) and the parent drug were found in rat urine after the administration of a single oral dose 25 mg/kg of anisodamine. Hydroxyanisodamine, anisodamine N-oxide and the parent drug were detected in rat urine for up 95 h after ingestion of anisodamine.","Chen, Huaixia; Wang, Hong; Chen, Yong; Zhang, Huashan",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105195/,88
7617,Neurodegeneration as an RNA disorder,2012-10-10,"Biomarkers are increasingly used in patients with serious infections in the critical care setting to complement clinical judgment and interpretation of other diagnostic and prognostic tests. The main purposes of such blood markers are (1) to improve infection diagnosis (i.e., differentiation between bacterial vs. viral vs. fungal vs. noninfectious), (2) to help in the early risk stratification and thus provide prognostic information regarding the risk for mortality and other adverse outcomes, and (3) to optimize antibiotic tailoring to individual needs of patients (“antibiotic stewardship”). Especially in critically ill patients, in whom sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, rapid diagnosis is desirable to start timely and specific treatment. Besides some biomarkers, such as procalcitonin, which is well established and has shown positive effects in regard to utilization of antimicrobials and clinical outcomes, there is a growing number of novel markers from different pathophysiological pathways, where the final proof of an added value to clinical judgment and ultimately clinical benefit to patients is still lacking. Without a doubt, the addition of blood biomarkers to clinical medicine has had a strong impact on the way we care for patients today. Recent trials show that as an adjunct to other clinical and laboratory parameters these markers provide important information about risks for bacterial infection and resolution of infection. Moreover, biomarkers can help to optimize management of patients with serious illness in the intensive care unit, thereby offering more individualized treatment courses with overall improvements in clinical outcomes.","Heilmann, Eva; Gregoriano, Claudia; Schuetz, Philipp",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117078/,88

Selection of hybrid cell colonies was based on the ratio of bovine and murine chromosomes, the presence of cell-surface immunoglobulins and growth characteristics. First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated. Hybrid cell colonies that initially secreted antibodies were selected from first-generation heteromyelomas to function as second-generation fusion partners. Although fusion efficiencies for both generations did not differ, the second-generation heteromyelomas yielded a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones. Fusion of heteromyelomas with either lymph node cells or splenocytes indicated that fusion with lymph node cells results in a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones, whereas fusion efficiency was found to be higher with splenocytes. The optimal time intervals between the final booster injection and fusion were found to be 4 days for splenocytes and 7 days for lymph node cells. Finally, the characterization of bovine monoclonal antibodies against bovine rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and their neutralizing capacities in vitro are described.","Booman, P.; Tieman, M.; Van Zaane, D.; Bosma, A.A.; De Boer, G.F.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119475/,88

SLA expression was maximal either in the total cell extract or on the cell surface at 3–4 days of culture; after 4 days these values began to decrease. Fluorescence analyses of immunostained macrophages cultured with or without M-CSF indicated a major upward shift in the number of SLA Class I molecules on individual macrophages whereas for SLA Class II both a novel expression of Class II and an upward shift in the number of molecules per cell were evident. Infection of 3-day-old macrophage cultures with three different isolates of ASFV resulted in minor changes in surface expression of SLA Class I, SLA Class II, and macrophage markers. No differences in infection with ASFV was observed whether macrophages were SLA Class II positive or negative, nor was there blocking by anti-SLA Class I or Class II monoclonal antibodies of ASFV infection of cultured macrophages.","Juarrero, Mercedes Gonzalez; Mebus, Charles A.; Pan, Reyes; Revilla, Yolanda; Alonso, Jose M.; Lunney, Joan K.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119579/,88
7780,"Cloning, expression and characterization of biologically active feline tumour necrosis factor-α",2000-03-10,"Rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune gnotobiotic calves were treated with high doses of dexamethasone (DX) to suppress the immune system. Calves were then infected with a virulent rotavirus inoculum, J-160, to investigate the role of immune responses both in recovery from primary rotavirus infection and in resistance to secondary rotavirus infection. Treatment of calves with DX markedly suppressed in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens within 48 h of the start of DX treatment. Suppression was similar in rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune calves. In contrast, the effect of DX treatment on specific antibody responses differed depending on when DX treatment started in relation to rotavirus infection. When DX treatment commenced prior to primary rotavirus infection both systemic and local specific antibody responses were inhibited. These calves, in which mitogen and antibody responses were suppressed, exhibited greater clinical signs than did control calves after infection with virulent rotavirus, but virus excretion was affected in only one of the two calves. When DX treatment was started after primary rotavirus infection but before secondary infection, systemic and local antibody responses to the primary infection and to the challenge infection were not affected. These calves resisted challenge with virulent virus as did DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves, even though mitogen responses were suppressed. We conclude that in a primary rotavirus infection, virus excretion ceased when both antibody and mitogen responses were suppressed. Resistance to secondary rotavirus infection occurred when mitogen responsiveness was suppressed, but when antibody levels were normal. Thus, no evidence was obtained that fully functional cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for resistance to rotavirus infection. Evidence was provided for the ability of parenteral treatment with DX to suppress mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.","Oldham, G.; Bridger, J.C.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119640/,88

Although immune mechanisms operate in many disease processes of the central nervous system (CNS), cells of the CNS generally express low levels of HLA molecules. In this study, the potential for upregulation of HLA molecules on adult human glial cells was examined. Moreover, the functional implication of this upregulation was assessed by the capacity of glial cells to process and present target antigens to HLA class I-restricted influenza-specific and class II-restrict myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific CTL lines. Glial cells cultured from adult human surgical brain specimens or cells from established glioblastoma multiforme cell lines were studied. Lysis by antigen-specific CTLs was dependent on treatment of the target cell with interferon-γ. The lysis was HLA restricted and antigen specific. The results indicate that adult human glial cells can process and present antigen to HLA-restricted CTLs but require the upregulation of HLA molecules. These findings have implications for infectious and autoimmune diseases of the CNS.","Dhib-Jalbut, Suhayl; Kufta, Conrad V.; Flerlage, Marjorie; Shimojo, Naoki; McFarland, Henry F.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119691/,88

This mutant has a genetic defect in copper metabolism and spontaneous neuronal degeneration develops around postnatal day 10, in particular in the parasagittal regions of the cerebral cortex and thalamus. The antibodies to macrophage specific antigen, F4/80 and to type-three complement receptor, Mac-1 were used for the study. Reactive morphological changes of microglia, which are immuno-reactive to the antibodies to F4/80 and/or Mac-1, were demonstrated in areas corresponding to those of neuronal degeneration, coincident with the emergence of cells expressing major histocompatibility complex class II, Ia, antigen. Some of the Ia expressing cells had morphological features of ramified microglia, while others were rod shaped with few processes and were mostly located in the perivascular regions. The focal nature of such cellular changes suggests that signal(s) from the degenerating neurons may be responsible for microglial activation and cellular expression of the Ia antigen in the brain of the brindled mouse.","Ohno, Masaki; Higashi, Yasuto; Suzuki, Kinuko",Brain Res Dev Brain Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119898/,88

The major routes of entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment are industries, hospitals, or direct disposal of unwanted or expired drugs made by the patient. The most important and distinct features of pharmaceuticals are that they are deliberately designed to have an explicit mode of action and designed to exert an effect on humans and other living systems. This distinctive feature makes pharmaceuticals and their metabolites different from other chemicals, and this necessitates the evaluation of the direct effects of pharmaceuticals in various environmental compartments as well as to living systems. In this background, the alarming situation of ecotoxicity of diverse pharmaceuticals have forced government and nongovernment regulatory authorities to recommend the application of in silico methods to provide quick information about the risk assessment and fate properties of pharmaceuticals as well as their ecological and indirect human health effects. This chapter aims to offer information regarding occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, their persistence, environmental fate, and toxicity as well as application of in silico methods to provide information about the basic risk management and fate prediction of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Brief ideas about toxicity endpoints, available ecotoxicity databases, and expert systems employed for rapid toxicity predictions of ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals are also discussed.","Roy, Kunal; Kar, Supratik",In Silico Methods for Predicting Drug Toxicity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120582/,88

8084,Inhibition of Anatid Herpes Virus-1 replication by small interfering RNAs in cell culture system,2005-09-30,"Transmission electron microscopy has had a profound impact on our knowledge and understanding of viruses and bacteria. The 1000-fold improvement in resolution provided by electron microscopy (EM) has allowed visualization of viruses, the existence of which had previously only been suspected as the causative agents of transmissible infectious disease. Viruses are grouped into families based on their morphology. Viruses from different families look different and these morphological variances are the basis for identification of viruses by EM. Electron microscopy initially came to prominence in diagnostic microbiology in the late 1960s when it was used in the rapid diagnosis of smallpox, by differentiating, on a morphological basis, poxviruses from the less problematic herpesviruses in skin lesions. Subsequently, the technique was employed in the diagnosis of other viral infections, such as hepatitis B and parvovirus B19. Electron microscopy has led to the discovery of many new viruses, most notably the various viruses associated with gastroenteritis, for which it remained the principal diagnostic method until fairly recent times. Development of molecular techniques, which offer greater sensitivity and often the capacity to easily process large numbers of samples, has replaced EM in many areas of diagnostic virology. Hence the role of EM in clinical virology is evolving with less emphasis on diagnosis and more on research, although this is likely only to be undertaken in specialist centres. However, EM still offers tremendous advantages to the microbiologist, both in the speed of diagnosis and the potential for detecting, by a single test, any viral pathogen or even multiple pathogens present within a sample. There is continuing use of EM for the investigation of new and emerging agents, such as SARS and human monkeypox virus. Furthermore, EM forms a vital part of the national emergency response programme of many countries and will provide a frontline diagnostic service in the event of a bioterrorism incident, particularly in the scenario of a deliberate release of smallpox virus. In the field of bacteriology, EM is of little use diagnostically, although some bacterial pathogens can be identified in biopsy material processed for EM examination. Electron microscopy has been used, however, to elucidate the structure and function of many bacterial features, such as flagellae, fimbriae and spores and in the study of bacteriophages. The combined use of EM and gold-labelled antibodies provides a powerful tool for the ultrastructural localisation of bacterial and viral antigens.","Curry, Alan; Appleton, Hazel; Dowsett, Barry",Micron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126980/,88

It is not permeable to ions and to low molecular weight solutes, let alone to proteins and polynucleotides. Yet it is clear that viruses are capable of transferring their genome and accessory proteins into the cytosol or into the nucleus, and thus infect the cell. While the detailed mechanisms remain unclear for most animal viruses, a general theme is apparent like other stages in the replication cycle; their entry depends on the activities of the host cell. In order to take up nutrients, to communicate with other cells, to control the intracellular ion balance, and to secrete substances, cells have a variety of mechanisms for bypassing and modifying the barrier properties imposed by their plasma membrane.

The disappearance of these structures observed under scanning electron microscopy or in cryofracture preparations in vivo and in vitro cannot be reversed by the action of cytochalasin B on the microfilament network. The decrease in the porosity seems to be related directly to the productive infection of the endothelial cells, because it was not observed in A/J mice resistant to the virus and in susceptible BALB/c mice immunized with a thermosensitive mutant in which no viral replication occurs.

In this study, the activities of dipeptidyl (carboxy)peptidase (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl (amino)peptidase IV (DPP IV) were measured in the blood, the human bronchial epithelial and alveolar cells, bronchoalveolar macrophages, and the soluble phase of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from normal human volunteers and patients with pulmonary pathologic conditions. BAL fluid expressed ACE activity and very low levels of APN and DPP IV activities in the volunteer population, but higher levels could be measured in samples from patients. In patients, increased APN corresponded to a high granulocyte count, while DPP IV and ACE were associated with a high percentage of lymphocytes. Neither AIDS nor smoking induced an increased level of these enzymes. Immunohistochemical staining of bronchoalveolar smears with anti-human ACE monoclonal antibody showed that only macrophages expressed this enzyme. Enzyme histochemistry for DPP IV and APN showed that all leukocytes expressed these activities. APN, DPP IV, and ACE activities were also found in cell extracts of bronchoalveolar macrophages. In extracts of bronchial epithelial and alveolar cells, only APN and DPP IV activities were detected. Kinetic properties of the soluble enzymes in lavage supernatants were comparable to those of serum enzymes.

8714,Early Virus–Host Cell Interactions,2018-08-17,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent demyelinating disease of young adults, affecting an estimated 300,000 individuals in the United States alone. The majority of affected individuals have a relapsing–remitting course while a smaller subset has a more chronic–progressive presentation. Women are affected more often than men, a phenomenon associated with a number of auto-immune diseases. Although the etiology of MS is unknown, it is generally believed that genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors are involved. This chapter discusses these issues as they suggest that exogenous factors are associated with the pathogenesis of this disorder. Recently, the human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) has received considerable attention as an infectious agent candidate that might be associated with the pathogenesis of MS. The chapter focuses on this agent and the data that support the role of this virus in MS disease pathogenesis. A model is proposed, whereby in genetically susceptible individuals, multiple viruses may trigger either a virus-specific or a cross-reactive auto-immune response that results in clinical MS. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that it is a multifactorial disease that develops as a result of host genetics, immune response, and environment.","Soldan, Samantha S.; Jacobson, Steven",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131605/,88
8732,Structure and Function of the Hef Glycoprotein of Influenza C Virus,2008-03-01,"This chapter focuses on the history of the discovery of cap and an update of research on viral and cellular-messenger RNA (mRNA) capping. Cap structures of the type m(7) GpppN(m)pN(m)p are present at the 5′ ends of nearly all eukaryotic cellular and viral mRNAs. A cap is added to cellular mRNA precursors and to the transcripts of viruses that replicate in the nucleus during the initial phases of transcription and before other processing events, including internal N(6)A methylation, 3′-poly (A) addition, and exon splicing. Despite the variations on the methylation theme, the important biological consequences of a cap structure appear to correlate with the N(7)-methyl on the 5′-terminal G and the two pyrophosphoryl bonds that connect m(7)G in a 5′–5′ configuration to the first nucleotide of mRNA. In addition to elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of capping and the downstream effects of this 5′- modification on gene expression, the advent of gene cloning has made available an ever-increasing amount of information on the proteins responsible for producing caps and the functional effects of other cap-related interactions.

It focuses on the interplay between viral and cellular mRNAs and the translational machinery. That interplay, together with the intrinsic structure of viral mRNAs, determines the patterns of translation in infected cells. It also points out some possibilities for translational regulation that can only be glimpsed at present, but are likely to come into focus in the future. The mechanism of selecting the initiation site for protein synthesis appears to follow a single formula. The translational machinery displays a certain flexibility that is exploited more frequently by viral than by cellular mRNAs. Although some of the parameters that determine efficiency have been identified, how efficiently a given mRNA will be translated cannot be predicted by summing the known parameters.","Kozak, Marilyn",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131717/,88

The aims of this study were to follow the histological changes in the villi and crypts and the changes in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes in the jejunum of naturally infected calves during the acute phase of infection. For this purpose, 29 calves aged between 7 and 10 days were bought at a local auction. The animals were housed in individual pens to avoid cross-contamination. Fecal samples were examined microscopically for the presence of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts, three times per week for a period of 45 days. Six calves did not pass any cysts or oocysts and were used as controls. Fifteen calves passed Giardia cysts only, five passed both cysts and oocysts, and three passed oocysts only. The villus to crypt ratio index was 1.76 in the control group and 1.08 in the Giardia-infected group. In the Cryptosporidium-infected calves, the ratio was 1.18 and calves infected with both parasites had an index of 1.37. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes per millimeter of jejunum tissue was 21 in the control group.

8780,Functions of alphavirus nonstructural proteins in RNA replication,2004-01-07,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, fatal complication of measles virus infection arising years after acute measles. During this chronic disease process, characteristic measles virus inclusions are present in the cells of the central nervous system (CNS). During SSPE, infectious virus is not present either in the CNS or other tissues, but it has proved possible, in some cases, to rescue a measles-like virus by cocultivation techniques. These viruses may differ from measles virus, and from each other, but no single, stable property differentiates them. Differences between various strains of measles virus are of a similar magnitude to those observed between SSPE and measles viruses. This chapter discusses experiments to differentiate these agents using monoclonal antibodies raised against purified measles virus Edmonston. In no case is an isolate of measles virus available from the acute phase of infection preceding the develoment of SSPE by the same patient. This event is modeled in vitro by using a tissue culture of Vero cells persistently infected with an SSPE virus “Lec,” and this system is compared to other carrier cultures. These in vitro persistent infections differ from any in vivo persistence, because they are maintained in the absence of an immune response and may provide an insight into the importance of that phenomenon in the development of SSPE.","Carter, Michael J.; Meulen, V.

It briefly mentions clinical diseases and syndromes such as influenza, respiratory tract infections, hepatitis, and arbovirus infections resulting from virus infections. Viruses causing respiratory diseases, as well as many other diseases in humans are also discussed in the chapter. It describes the vaccines that are used to check the attack of different viruses as well as their cost-effectiveness. There is a list of some viruses that have been ranked according to different variables in an attempt to select a good candidate for an antiviral drug. The incidence of the viral disease is naturally an important factor, as is the severity of the disease. The incidence can be obtained for diseases being reported in accordance with local regulations, but in many cases viral diseases are not reported and the incidence has to be calculated from different surveys. Also, a grading of the severity is not easy and an example is when herpesvirus infections are handled as a group, which includes both herpes encephalitis and cold sores. The greatest challenges and probably the most difficult and medically important areas for prophylaxis and therapy of viral diseases are the viruses that are rapidly changing in antigenic composition and/or viruses with animal reservoirs (influenza and arboviruses) and those forming latent infections (herpesviruses).",,Perspect Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134146/,88

The lowest parenteral doses (10(4) units per kg body wt) and the orally administered interferon did not lead to any disturbances, whereas the higher dosages led to marked changes in body temperature, pulse and respiration rates. Animals with the highest dose (10(8) units per kg body wt) became extremely distressed. The blood picture showed distinct changes, with very low leukocyte counts during treatment, which took weeks to recover.

Surprisingly, it has turned out that the vast majority of apoptotic cells are T lymphocytes and that they actually represent the antigen-specific T-cell population responsible for the induction of the disease. Taken together, these data suggest that clearance of autoimmune inflammation in the nervous system is accomplished by the destruction of the antigen-specific T-cell population within the lesions.

They sent for some doctors in sneezles and wheezles, to tell them what ought to be done. All sorts and conditions of famous physicians came hurrying round at a run. They all made a note of the state of his throat, they asked if he suffered from thirst; They asked if the sneezles came after the wheezles, or if the first sneezle came first.

This obligation especially concerns food‐borne zoonotic hazards transmitted to humans through pork consumption, such as thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica. Prevalence estimates of these four hazards are affected by the sampling strategy and diagnostic procedure. Individual prevalence estimates for pig carriage (from digestive contents or lymph nodes collected at slaughterhouse) were higher than individual prevalence estimates for pig shedding (from faeces). Among risk factors described in the literature, poor pen cleaning and disinfection after pig departure to slaughterhouse and poor bio‐security measures are of major significance. Moreover, whereas wet feed increases the risk of pig infection by L. monocytogenes, dry feed is a risk factor for Salm. enterica. Mixing batches of pigs, notably in fattening herds, represents a risk for the transmission of Salm. enterica and Y. enterocolitica. Whereas small herds are more infected by thermophilic campylobacters and Y. enterocolitica, higher prevalence of Salmonella is observed in large herds due to a more frequent mixing of batches. Antibiotic treatment during the finishing period increases the risk of transmission of Salm. enterica. The forenamed elements should be taken into account to characterize farms in a risk assessment approach and to improve zoonotic hazard management in the pork food chain.","Fosse, J.; Seegers, H.; Magras, C.",Zoonoses Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165994/,88

Unfortunately, the disease is difficult to detect before a myopathic process ensues. Treatment of myocarditis‐induced heart failure includes the standard regimen of diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, and currently, β‐adrenergic blockers. Treatment of myocarditis itself is dependent on the etiology of the illness. Treatments under investigation include immunosuppressants, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, immunoglobulins, immunomodulation, antiadrenergics, calcium‐channel blockers, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, nitric oxide inhibition (e.g., aminoguanidine), and antiviral agents. Despite advances in treatment, more work needs to be done in the early detection of myocarditis. Additionally, better means need to be established for distinguishing between viral and autoimmune forms of the disease, so that appropriate treatment can be instituted.","Anandasabapathy, Sharmila; Frishman, William H.",J Clin Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166703/,88

Tadham Moor in Somerset, England, is an exceptionally rich wetland site which has been mown for hay for many years, with stock grazing the aftermath, but with no history of any fertilizer use. A randomized blocks field experiment (1986–1989) was used to study the effects of five levels of nitrogen input treatments: 0 = control, 25, 50, 100 and 200 kg of N fertilizer per ha per yr. In Phase II of the experiment (1990–1993), each plot was split into two subplots. The allocated fertilizer treatment for the plot was continued in one, randomly selected, subplot but the treatment was discontinued in the other subplot. The experiment not only identified and quantified the changes occurring in the vegetation of hay meadows under different levels of N input, it also provided valuable insight into the dynamics of the sward upon the discontinuance of the treatments. The data for Phase II were used to estimate the time required by the changed vegetation (under different nitrogen treatments) to revert to a state comparable to that prevailing in the control plots. A method for estimating reversion times is described. The main difficulties in estimating the reversion times are identified, the choice of robust vegetation variables being critical. Reversion time estimation methods are presented and used to obtain working estimates for the four nitrogen treatments, applied for 5 yr. These estimates are 3, 5, 7 and 9 yr respectively. The validity of the estimates of 3 yr for the lowest nitrogen input treatment (25 kg /ha/yr) was checked using the available post cessation data.","Mountford, J.O.; Lakhani, K.H.; Holland, R.J.",J Veg Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201877/,88

Thus, we initiated a baseline study to compare demographics, management and outcomes of severely injured patients between Southern Finland and Northern Estonia utilizing regional trauma repositories. METHODS: A comparison of data fields of the Helsinki University Hospital trauma registry (HTR) and trauma registry at the North Estonia Medical Centre in Tallinn (TTR) between 1/1/2015 and 31/12/2016 was performed. The inclusion criterion was Injury Severity Score > 15. Transferred patients, patients with penetrating injuries, and pediatric patients were excluded. The data for comparison included demographics, Trauma Score-Injury Severity Score (TRISS), mortality, and standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Primary outcome was mortality and SMR per TRISS methodology. RESULTS: During the 2-year study period, 324 patients from the HTR and 152 from the TTR were included. Demographic profile was similar between the repositories with the exception of severe abdominal injuries being more prevalent at the TTR (25.0% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.002). Predominant injury mechanism was non-ground level fall in both repositories. Mortality was similar at 14.5% and 13.6% at the TTR and HTR, respectively (adj. p = 0.762; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.64–1.99). SMR was lower at the HTR compared to the TTR (0.65 vs. 0.77, p > 0.05), however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Benchmarking trauma repositories at a national level provides opportunities for quality and performance improvements. We observed comparable demographic profile and outcome indicators in the compared regional trauma systems.","Saar, Sten; Brinck, Tuomas; Laos, Juhan; Handolin, Lauri; Talving, Peep",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223228/,88

Many of these young people have mental health, cognitive disability and/or other health issues that also impact on their lives. These young people need to navigate multiple, diverse, and often difficult transitions between services, adding to the existing chaos in their lives. This article explores the experiences of young people with complex support needs in transition, specifically young people’s viewpoints and experiences of supports they receive from paid professionals. This qualitative study used body mapping research methods and in-depth interviews with 38 young people aged 16 to 26 years in three Australian states. Helpful and trusting paid relationships could serve as an anchor to young people during complex transitions and other highly turbulent life periods. These relationships were contingent on a deep and non-judgmental knowing of the young person, contributed constructive outcomes and stability in young people’s lives, and for some young people, had ‘life-saving’ effects. These findings present opportunities and challenges for policymakers and practitioners to balance the tensions between authentic relationship-based work with young people and risk-averse, economically-driven imperatives in contemporary youth service provision.","Ellem, Kathy; Smith, Louisa; Baidawi, Susan; McGhee, Adrienne; Dowse, Leanne",Child Adolesc Social Work J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223451/,88

Current preoperative clinical risk assessment strategies have poor accuracy for identifying patients who will sustain adverse events following heart surgery. There is an ongoing need to integrate clinical variables with novel technology and biomarkers to accurately predict outcome following pediatric heart surgery. We tested whether preoperative levels of miRNAs-208a can serve as such a biomarker. Serum samples were obtained from pediatric patients immediately before heart surgery. MiRNA-208a was quantified by RQ-PCR. Correlations between the patient’s clinical variables and miRNA levels were tested. Lower levels of preoperative miRNA-208a correlated with and could predict the appearance of postoperative cardiac and inflammatory complications.

It, however, generates additional hemodynamic indices that need to be evaluated. Our objective was to investigate the performance of a multiparametric predictive score based on a combination of several parameters generated by the PRAM monitor to predict fluid responsiveness. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective observational study from April 2016 to December 2017 in two French teaching hospitals. We included critically ill patients who were monitored by esophageal Doppler monitoring and an invasive arterial line, and received a 250–500 mL crystalloid fluid challenge. The main outcome measure was the predictive score discrimination evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. RESULTS: The three baseline PRAM-derived parameters associated with fluid responsiveness in univariate analysis were pulse pressure variation, cardiac cycle efficiency, and arterial elastance (P < 0.01, P = 0.03, and P < 0.01, respectively). The median [interquartile range] predictive score, calculated after discretization of these parameters according to their optimal threshold value was 3 [2–3] in fluid responders and 1 [1–2] in fluid non-responders, respectively (P < 0.001). The area under the curve of the predictive score was 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.662 to 0.909; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A multiparametric score combining three parameters generated by the PRAM monitor can predict fluid responsiveness with good positive and negative predictive values in intensive care unit patients.

12173,Small Molecule NF-κB Pathway Inhibitors in Clinic,2020-07-21,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been shown to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion binding GLP-1 receptor on pancreatic β cells. β-arrestin 1 (βARR1) is known to regulate the desensitization of GLP-1 receptor. Mounting evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are fundamental in the regulation of β cell function and insulin release. However, the regulation of GLP-1/βARR1 pathways by miRs has never been explored. Our hypothesis is that specific miRs can modulate the GLP-1/βARR1 axis in β cells. To test this hypothesis, we applied a bioinformatic approach to detect miRs that could target βARR1; we identified hsa-miR-7-5p (miR-7) and we validated the specific interaction of this miR with βARR1. Then, we verified that GLP-1 was indeed able to regulate the transcription of miR-7 and βARR1, and that miR-7 significantly regulated GLP-1-induced insulin release and cyclic AMP (cAMP) production in β cells. Taken together, our findings indicate, for the first time, that miR-7 plays a functional role in the regulation of GLP-1-mediated insulin release by targeting βARR1. These results have a decisive clinical impact given the importance of drugs modulating GLP-1 signaling in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Matarese, Alessandro; Gambardella, Jessica; Lombardi, Angela; Wang, Xujun; Santulli, Gaetano",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7407368/,88

However, the studies to date focus on Eurasian variation, and hence the diversity of early-diverging branches found in Africa has not been adequately documented. Here, we analyze over 900 kb of Y chromosome sequence obtained from 547 individuals from southern African Khoisan- and Bantu-speaking populations, identifying 232 new sequences from basal haplogroups A and B. We identify new clades in the phylogeny, an older age for the root, and substantially older ages for some individual haplogroups. Furthermore, while haplogroup B2a is traditionally associated with the spread of Bantu speakers, we find that it probably also existed in Khoisan groups before the arrival of Bantu speakers. Finally, there is pronounced variation in branch length between major haplogroups; in particular, haplogroups associated with Bantu speakers have significantly longer branches. Technical artifacts cannot explain this branch length variation, which instead likely reflects aspects of the demographic history of Bantu speakers, such as recent population expansion and an older average paternal age. The influence of demographic factors on branch length variation has broader implications both for the human Y phylogeny and for similar analyses of other species.

A growing body of research focuses on the causes, both medical and social, of this opioid crisis, but little work as yet on its larger ramifications. Using novel public records of accidental opioid deaths linked to behavioral political outcomes, we present causal analyses showing that opioid overdoses have significant political ramifications. Those close to opioid victims vote at lower rates than those less affected by the crisis, even compared to demographically-similar friends and family of other unexpected deaths. Moreover, among those friends and family affected by opioids, Republicans are 25% more likely to defect from the party than the statewide average Republican, while Democrats are no more likely to defect; Independents are moderately more likely to register as Democrats. These results illustrate an important research design for inferring the effects of tragic events and speak to the broad social and political consequences of what is becoming the largest public health crisis in modern United States history.","Kaufman, Aaron R.; Hersh, Eitan D.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402477/,88

Polymeric nanoparticles stand out as a key tool to improve drug bioavailability or specific delivery at the site of action. The versatility of polymers makes them potentially ideal for fulfilling the requirements of each particular drug-delivery system. In this review, a summary of the state-of-the-art panorama of polymeric nanoparticles as drug-delivery systems has been conducted, focusing mainly on those applications in which the corresponding disease involves an important morbidity, a considerable reduction in the life quality of patients—or even a high mortality.

13264,Induction of the Unfolded Protein Response during Bovine Alphaherpesvirus 1 Infection,2020-09-02,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Animal welfare is a priority objective for the livestock industry. Litter size environmental variability has been related to environmental sensitivity. A divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out successfully in rabbits over thirteen generations. The low line showed a lower inflammatory response and susceptibility to infectious disorders than the high line. In conclusion, the decrease of environmental sensitivity seems to increase the adaptation of the animal to the environment, and thus, its welfare. ABSTRACT: A divergent selection experiment for environmental variance of litter size variance was carried out in rabbits over thirteen generations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response in the two lines of the experiment, in order to analyse the effect of selection on susceptibility to diseases after challenging to stressful situations, such as 24 h after the first delivery. A total of 78 females were used in this study, 39 from each line. The line selected for litter size heterogeneity (the high line) showed lower white blood leukocyte count (WBC; −0.87 × 10(3)/µL), lower percentage of basophils (−0.11%), higher concentration of TNF-α (+13.8 pg/mL), and greater concentration of CRP (+38.1 µg/mL) than the line selected for litter size homogeneity (the low line). The high line had also higher concentrations of bilirubin, cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to the low line (difference between lines were +0.08 µmol/L, +0.14 µmol/L, +0.35 U/L and +2.4 U/L, respectively). The high line showed higher inflammatory response than the low line, in accordance with a larger susceptibility to infectious disorders. In conclusion, the line selected to increase litter size environmental variability seems to have poor capacity coping with environmental stressors. Therefore, selection for litter size environmental variability can be a useful way to improve animal welfare.","Beloumi, Dhekra; Blasco, Agustín; Muelas, Raquel; Santacreu, María Antonia; García, María de la Luz; Argente, María-José",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552264/,88
14222,New RNA Structural Elements Identified in the Coding Region of the Coxsackie B3 Virus Genome,2020-10-30,"Loneliness and social isolation have negative consequences on physical and mental health in both adult and pediatric populations. Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) are often excluded and experience more loneliness than their typically developing peers. This scoping review aims to identify the type of studies conducted in children with NDD to determine the effects of loneliness and/or social isolation. Three electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO) were searched from inception until 5 February 2019. Two independent reviewers screened the citations for inclusion and extracted data from the included articles. Quantitative (i.e., frequency analysis) and qualitative analyses (i.e., content analysis) were completed. From our search, 5768 citations were screened, 29 were read in full, and 12 were included. Ten were case-control comparisons with cross-sectional assessment of various outcomes, which limited inference. Autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and learning disorder were the most commonly studied NDD. This review showed that loneliness among children with NDD was associated with negative consequences on mental health, behaviour, and psychosocial/emotional development, with a likely long-term impact in adulthood. Lack of research in this area suggests that loneliness is not yet considered a problem in children with NDD. More studies are warranted using prospective designs and a larger sample size with a focus on the dynamic aspect of loneliness development.","Kwan, Celia; Gitimoghaddam, Mojgan; Collet, Jean-Paul",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7693393/,88
14886,Identification of Important N-Linked Glycosylation Sites in the Hemagglutinin Protein and Their Functional Impact on DC-SIGN Mediated Avian Influenza H5N1 Infection,2021-01-13,"Cobalt porphyrin phospholipid (CoPoP) can incorporate within bilayers to enable non-covalent surface-display of antigens on liposomes by mixing with proteins bearing a polyhistidine tag (his-tag); however, the mechanisms for how this occurs are poorly understood. These were investigated using the his-tagged model antigen Pfs25, a protein antigen candidate for malaria transmission-blocking vaccines. Pfs25 was found to associate with the small molecule aquocobalamin, a form of vitamin B12 and a cobalt-containing corrin macrocycle, but without particle formation, enabling comparative assessment. Relative to CoPoP liposomes, binding and serum stability studies indicated a weaker association of Pfs25 to aquocobalamin or cobalt nitrilotriacetic acid (Co-NTA) liposomes, which have cobalt displayed in the aqueous phase on lipid headgroups. Antigen internalization by macrophages was enhanced with Pfs25 bound to CoPoP liposomes. Immunization in mice with Pfs25 bound to CoPoP liposomes elicited antibodies that recognized ookinetes and showed transmission-reducing activity. To explore the physical mechanisms involved, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bilayers containing phospholipid, cholesterol, as well as either CoPoP or NTA-functionalized lipids. The results show that the CoPoP-containing bilayer creates nanodomains that allow access for a limited but sufficient amount of water molecules that could be replaced by his-tags due to their favorable free energy properties allowing for stabilization. The position of the metal center within the NTA liposomes was much more exposed to the aqueous environment, which could explain its limited capacity for stabilizing Pfs25. This study illustrates the impact of CoPoP-induced antigen particleization in enhancing vaccine efficacy, and provides molecular insights into the CoPoP bilayer properties that enable this.","Federizon, Jasmin; Feugmo, Conrard Giresse Tetsassi; Huang, Wei-Chiao; He, Xuedan; Miura, Kazutoyo; Razi, Aida; Ortega, Joaquin; Karttunen, Mikko; Lovell, Jonathan F.",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7828809/,88
15342,The mechanism of the nucleo-sugar selection by multi-subunit RNA polymerases,2021-02-04,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) on assessing response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) in patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (LARC). METHODS: 50 patients with rectal cancer who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after nCRT, the values of pre-nCRT and post-nCRT IVIM-DWI parameters apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), diffusion coefficient (D), false diffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f), together with the percentage changes (∆% parametric value) induced by nCRT were calculated. According to the patient's response to nCRT, the patients were divided into pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pCR groups, Good Response (GR) group and Poor Response (PR) group, and the above values were compared between different groups. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were done to investigate the relation between different parameters and patient nCRT. Draw ROC curve according to sensitivity and specificity, and compare its diagnostic efficacy. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline data of 50 patients. After nCRT, the ADC and D values for LARC increased significantly (all p < 0.05). The pCR group (n = 9) had higher preD*, pref, postD*, ∆%ADC and ∆%D values than the non-pCR group (n = 41) (all p < 0.05). The GR group (n = 17) exhibited higher post D, ∆%ADC and ∆%D values than the PR group (n = 33) (all p < 0.05). From the results of Logistic regression analysis found that ∆%ADC and ∆%D were significantly correlated with patients' response to nCRT. Based on ROC analysis, ∆%D had a higher area under the curve value than ∆%ADC (p = 0.009) in discriminating the pCR from non-pCR groups. CONCLUSIONS: IVIM-DWI technology may be helpful in identifying the pCR and GR patients to nCRT for LARC.","Hu, Hongbo; Jiang, Huijie; Wang, Song; Jiang, Hao; Zhao, Sheng; Pan, Wenbin",Abdom Radiol (NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864832/,88

15700,Interaction of TLR4 and TLR8 in the Innate Immune Response against Mycobacterium Tuberculosis,2021-02-04,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of various preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prescription strategies for African–American women impacted by mass incarceration within an urban setting. DESIGN: An agent-based model was utilized to evaluate prevention strategies in an efficient, ethical manner. By defining agents, their characteristics and relationships, we assessed population-level effects of PrEP on HIV incidence. METHODS: We tested hypothetical PrEP prescription strategies within a simulation representing the African–American population of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Four strategies were evaluated: PrEP for women meeting CDC indicators regarding partner characteristics, PrEP for women with a recently incarcerated male partner, PrEP for women with a recently released male partner and couples-based PrEP at time of release. Interventions occurred alongside scale-up of HAART. We evaluated reductions in HIV transmissions, the number of persons on PrEP needed to avert one HIV transmission (NNT) and the resulting proportions of people on PrEP. RESULTS: Scenarios prescribing PrEP based on criminal justice system involvement reduced HIV transmissions. The NNT ranged from 147 (couples-based scenario) to 300 (recently released scenario). The percentage of the female population covered by PrEP at any one time ranged from 0.14% (couples-based) to 10.8% (CDC-based). CDC-guideline scenarios were consistently less efficient compared to the justice-involved interventions. CONCLUSION: Expanding PrEP for African–American women and their male partners affected by incarceration should be considered in national HIV prevention goals and correctional facilities leveraged as intervention sites. Partner characteristics in the current CDC indications may be more effective and efficient if guidelines considered criminal justice involvement.","Adams, Joëlla W.; Khan, Maria R.; Bessey, S.E.; Friedman, Samuel R.; McMahon, James M.; Lurie, Mark N.; Galea, Sandro; Marshall, Brandon D.L.",AIDS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7855567/,88

16120,The nucleocytosolic O-fucosyltransferase SPINDLY affects protein expression and virulence in Toxoplasma gondii,2020-11-23,"BACKGROUND: Africans pour dirty water around their houses which constitutes aquatic habitats (AH). These AH are sought by mosquitoes for larval development. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of destroying AH around houses in reducing malaria incidence. An agent-based model is proposed for controlling malaria’s incidence through population sensitizing campaigns on the harmful effects of AH around houses. METHODS: The environment is constituted of houses, AH, mosquitoes, humans, and hospital. Malaria’s spread dynamic is linked to the dynamics of humans and mosquitoes. The mosquito’s dynamic is represented by egg-laying and seeking blood. The human’s dynamic is animated by hitting mosquitoes. AH are destroyed each time by 10% of their starting number. The number of infected humans varied from 0-90 which led to a total of 1001 simulations. RESULTS: When the number of houses and AH is equal, the results are approximate as the field data. At each reduction of AH, the incidence and prevalence tend more and more towards 0. When there is no AH and infected humans, the prevalence and incidence are at 0. CONCLUSIONS: When there is no AH site, the disease disappears completely. Global destruction of AH in an environment and using many parameters in the same model are recommended.","Layie, Paul; Kamla, Vivient Corneille; Kamgang, Jean Claude; Wono, Yves Emvudu",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953772/,88

The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores, and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4–60 d of age), and carry-over effects during post-weaning (61–90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were assigned to either a control (CON, n = 15) or a blend of essential oil supplementation (BEO, n = 14) treatment, maintaining a balance of genetic composition. The BEO was supplemented in the MR with 1 g/d/calf of a blend of essential oils (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China) composed by plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted to 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum of 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. Feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. The BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30, and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly and on the weaning day to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N, and acetate:propionate proportion—C2:C3) were measured on days 14, 28, 42, 60, 74 and 90. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of the BEO’s effect on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes, and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes, both adopting a CI = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of the effect of BEO in MR on feed intake, performance, body development, and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre- and post-weaning (P = 0.05). Similarly, the effect was significant for basophil (P ≤ 0.001), and platelet (P = 0.04) counts pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P ≤ 0.001), revealing a cumulative effect. Lastly, fecal scores were also significant (P = 0.04) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. The BEO contributed to ruminal manipulation in pre-weaning and carry-over effects in post-weaning, immunity improvement, and decreased morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in the pre-weaning phase.","Palhares Campolina, Joana; Gesteira Coelho, Sandra; Belli, Anna Luiza; Samarini Machado, Fernanda; R.

16224,Versatility in acyltransferase activity completes chicoric acid biosynthesis in purple coneflower,2021-03-10,"A hybrid particle ensemble Kalman filter is developed for problems with medium non-Gaussianity, i.e. problems where the prior is very non-Gaussian but the posterior is approximately Gaussian. Such situations arise, e.g., when nonlinear dynamics produce a non-Gaussian forecast but a tight Gaussian likelihood leads to a nearly-Gaussian posterior. The hybrid filter starts by factoring the likelihood. First the particle filter assimilates the observations with one factor of the likelihood to produce an intermediate prior that is close to Gaussian, and then the ensemble Kalman filter completes the assimilation with the remaining factor. How the likelihood gets split between the two stages is determined in such a way to ensure that the particle filter avoids collapse, and particle degeneracy is broken by a mean-preserving random orthogonal transformation. The hybrid is tested in a simple two-dimensional (2D) problem and a multiscale system of ODEs motivated by the Lorenz-‘96 model. In the 2D problem it outperforms both a pure particle filter and a pure ensemble Kalman filter, and in the multiscale Lorenz-‘96 model it is shown to outperform a pure ensemble Kalman filter, provided that the ensemble size is large enough.","Grooms, Ian; Robinson, Gregor",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7951907/,88

16502,Molecular basis of V-ATPase inhibition by bafilomycin A1,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Air pollution has been consistently linked with dementia and cognitive decline. However, it is unclear whether risk is accumulated through long-term exposure or whether there are sensitive/critical periods. A key barrier to clarifying this relationship is the dearth of historical air pollution data. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of modelling historical air pollution data and using them in epidemiologicalmodels. METHODS: Using the EMEP4UK atmospheric chemistry transport model, we modelled historical fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) concentrations for the years 1935, 1950, 1970, 1980, and 1990 and combined these with contemporary modelled data from 2001 to estimate life course exposure in 572 participants in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 with lifetime residential history recorded. Linear regression and latent growth models were constructed using cognitive ability (IQ) measured by the Moray House Test at the ages of 11, 70, 76, and 79 years to explore the effects of historical air pollution exposure. Covariates included sex, IQ at age 11 years, social class, and smoking. RESULTS: Higher air pollution modelled for 1935 (when participants would have been in utero) was associated with worse change in IQ from age 11–70 years (β = –0.006, SE = 0.002, p = 0.03) but not cognitive trajectories from age 70–79 years (p > 0.05). There was no support for other critical/sensitive periods of exposure or an accumulation of risk (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The life course paradigm is essential in understanding cognitive decline and this is the first study to examine life course air pollution exposure in relation to cognitive health.","Russ, Tom C.; Cherrie, Mark P.C.; Dibben, Chris; Tomlinson, Sam; Reis, Stefan; Dragosits, Ulrike; Vieno, Massimo; Beck, Rachel; Carnell, Ed; Shortt, Niamh K.; Muniz-Terrera, Graciela; Redmond, Paul; Taylor, Adele M.; Clemens, Tom; van Tongeren, Martie; Agius, Raymond M.; Starr, John M.; Deary, Ian J.; Pearce, Jamie R.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990442/,88

Eliminating biochemical isolation steps required by other techniques, this method opens up the cell to in-situ structural studies. However, the need to compensate for errors in targeting introduced during mechanical navigation of the specimen significantly slows down tomographic data collection thus limiting its practical value. Here, we introduce protocols for tilt-series acquisition and processing that accelerate data collection speed by up to an order of magnitude and improve map resolution compared to existing approaches. We achieve this by using beam-image shift to multiply the number of areas imaged at each stage position, by integrating geometrical constraints during imaging to achieve high precision targeting, and by performing per-tilt astigmatic CTF estimation and data-driven exposure weighting to improve final map resolution. We validated our beam image-shift electron cryo-tomography (BISECT) approach by determining the structure of a low molecular weight target (~300 kDa) at 3.6 Å resolution where density for individual side chains is clearly resolved.","Bouvette, Jonathan; Liu, Hsuan-Fu; Du, Xiaochen; Zhou, Ye; Sikkema, Andrew P.; da Fonseca Rezende e Mello, Juliana; Klemm, Bradley P.; Huang, Rick; Schaaper, Roel M.; Borgnia, Mario J.; Bartesaghi, Alberto",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8009872/,88

METHODS: A cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) protocol was performed in 12 rats while 12 controls underwent sham operation. Half of the rats in each group were paralyzed and mechanically ventilated. We performed blood gas analysis and lactic acid assays 6 h after surgery. Afterwards, we measured diaphragm strength and mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ATP and ROS generation, and cytochrome c oxidase activity. We also measured malondialdehyde (MDA) content as an index of lipid peroxidation, and mRNA expression of the proinflammatory interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in diaphragms. RESULTS: CLP rats showed severe hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and upregulation of diaphragm IL-1β mRNA expression. Compared to sham controls, spontaneously breathing CLP rats showed lower diaphragm force and increased susceptibility to fatigue, along with depressed mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production and cytochrome c oxidase activity. These rats also showed increased mitochondrial ROS generation and MDA content. Mechanical ventilation markedly restored mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production in CLP rats; lowered mitochondrial ROS production by the complex 3; and preserved cytochrome c oxidase activity. CONCLUSION: In an experimental model of sepsis, early initiation of mechanical ventilation restores diaphragm mitochondrial function.","Eyenga, P.; Roussel, D.; Rey, B.; Ndille, P.; Teulier, L.; Eyenga, F.; Romestaing, C.; Morel, J.; Gueguen-Chaignon, V.; Sheu, S-S.",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8025065/,88
16930,The immune response of young turkeys to haemorrhagic enteritis virus infection at different levels and sources of methionine in the diet,2019-11-01,"Ascidians are marine invertebrates associated with diverse microbial communities, embedded in their tunic, conferring special ecological and biotechnological relevance to these model organisms used in evolutionary and developmental studies. Next-generation sequencing tools have increased the knowledge of ascidians’ associated organisms and their products, but proteomic studies are still scarce. Hence, we explored the tunic of three ascidian species using a shotgun proteomics approach. Proteins extracted from the tunic of Ciona sp., Molgula sp., and Microcosmus sp. were processed using a nano LC-MS/MS system (Ultimate 3000 liquid chromatography system coupled to a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer). Raw data was searched against UniProtKB – the Universal Protein Resource Knowledgebase (Bacteria and Metazoa section) using Proteome Discoverer software. The resulting proteins were merged with a non-redundant Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) database and analysed with MaxQuant freeware. Overall, 337 metazoan and 106 bacterial proteins were identified being mainly involved in basal metabolism, cytoskeletal and catalytic functions. 37 AMPs were identified, most of them attributed to eukaryotic origin apart from bacteriocins. These results and the presence of “Biosynthesis of antibiotics” as one of the most highlighted pathways revealed the tunic as a very active tissue in terms of bioactive compounds production, giving insights on the interactions between host and associated organisms. Although the present work constitutes an exploratory study, the approach employed revealed high potential for high-throughput characterization and biodiscovery of the ascidians’ tunic and its microbiome.","Matos, Ana; Domínguez-Pérez, Dany; Almeida, Daniela; Agüero-Chapin, Guillermin; Campos, Alexandre; Osório, Hugo; Vasconcelos, Vitor; Antunes, Agostinho",Mar Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7401272/,88
16966,PEDV infection in neonatal piglets through the nasal cavity is mediated by subepithelial CD3(+) T cells,2021-02-17,"Reovirus infection requires the concerted action of viral and host factors to promote cell entry. After interaction of reovirus attachment protein σ1 with cell-surface carbohydrates and proteinaceous receptors, additional host factors mediate virus internalization. In particular, β1 integrin is required for endocytosis of reovirus virions following junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) binding. While integrin-binding motifs in the surface-exposed region of reovirus capsid protein λ2 are thought to mediate integrin interaction, evidence for direct β1 integrin-reovirus interactions and knowledge of how integrins function to mediate reovirus entry is lacking. Here, we use single-virus force spectroscopy and confocal microscopy to discover a direct interaction between reovirus and β1 integrins. Comparison of interactions between reovirus disassembly intermediates as well as mutants and β1 integrin show that λ2 is the integrin ligand. Finally, using fluidic force microscopy, we demonstrate a functional role for β1 integrin interaction in promoting clathrin recruitment to cell-bound reovirus. Our study demonstrates a direct interaction between reovirus and β1 integrins and offers insights into the mechanism of reovirus cell entry. These results provide new perspectives for the development of efficacious antiviral therapeutics and the engineering of improved viral gene delivery and oncolytic vectors.","Koehler, Melanie; Petitjean, Simon J.

METHODS: We sourced the vaccine economic evaluations from a previous systematic review by Nymark et al. (2009–2015) and searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase from 2015 to 2019 using the same search strategy. For tuberculosis economic evaluations, we extracted studies from 2009 to 2019 that were published in a previous review by Siapka et al. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. Studies were classified according to the categories and subcategories (e.g., herd immunity, non-specific effects, and labor productivity) defined in a framework identifying additional unintended consequences by Nymark and Vassall. Where possible, methods for estimating the additional unintended consequences categories and subcategories were described. We evaluated the reporting quality of included studies according to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) extraction guideline. RESULTS: We identified 177 vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) between 2009 and 2019 that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 98 included unintended consequences. Of the total 98 CEAs, overall health consequence categories were included 73 times; biological categories: herd immunity 43 times; pathogen response: resistance 15 times; and cross-protection 15 times. For health consequences pertaining to the supply-side (health systems) categories, side effects were included five times. On the nonhealth demand side (intrahousehold), labor productivity was included 60 times. We identified 29 tuberculosis CEAs from 2009 to 2019 that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, six articles included labor productivity, four included indirect transmission effects, and one included resistance. Between 2009 and 2019, only 34% of tuberculosis CEAs included additional unintended consequences, compared with 55% of vaccine CEAs. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of additional unintended consequences in economic evaluations of immunization and tuberculosis continues to be limited. Additional unintended consequences of economic benefits, such as those examined in this review and especially those that occur outside the health system, offer valuable information to analysts. Further work on appropriate ways to value these additional unintended consequences is still warranted.

17439,Binding moral values gain importance in the presence of close others,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem that places a significant disease burden on society. Self-care is important in the management of HF because it averts disease progression and reduces the number of hospitalizations. Effective nursing interventions promote HF self-care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore participants’ perspectives on a nurse-led, home-based heart failure self-management program (HOM-HEMP) in a randomized controlled trial conducted in Singapore to gain insight into the effectiveness of the study intervention. METHODS: A descriptive, qualitative approach was used. English- or Chinese-speaking participants from the intervention arms were recruited through a purposive sampling method from January 2019 to July 2019. Individual, face-to-face, semistructured interviews were conducted with 11 participants. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, with the participant identifiers omitted to ensure confidentiality. The thematic analysis approach was used to identify, analyze, and report patterns (themes) within the data. RESULTS: A total of six themes emerged from the process evaluation interviews and were categorized according to the Donabedian structure-process-outcome framework as intervention structure, intervention process, and intervention outcome. These six themes were manageability of the intervention, areas for improvement, benefits of visiting, personal accountability in self-care, empowered with knowledge and skills in self-care after the intervention, and increased self-efficacy in cardiac care. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the process evaluation provided additional information on participants’ perceptions and experiences with the HOM-HEMP intervention. Although a home visit may be perceived as resource intensive, it remains to be the preferred way of engagement for most patients. Nurses play an important role in promoting HF self-care. The process of interaction with the patient can be an important process for empowering self-care behavior changes.","Jiang, Ying; Koh, Karen Wei Ling; Ramachandran, Hadassah Joann; Tay, Yee Kian; Wu, Vivien Xi; Shorey, Shefaly; Wang, Wenru",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8114165/,88

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an ecological study carried out using an Exploratory Multiple-Group design on 3769 children under 15 years of age with ALL from 2006 to 2014. Data analysis was performed using Mann–Whitney U, Global Moran's I and Kuldorff's purely spatial scan statistic tests at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: The average annual incidence rate of ALL during 2006–2014 period was 2.25/100,000 children under 15 years of age. The most likely high-risk cluster with log-likelihood ratio (LLR) =327.47 is located in the southwestern part of Iran with a radius of 294.93 km and a centrality of 30.77 N and 50.83 E, which contained 1276 patients with a RR of 2.56.

The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has resulted in the development of prediction models, which might aid clinical decision-making. This systematic review seeks to give a contemporary overview of the current maturity of AI in the ICU, the research methods behind these studies, and the risk of bias in these studies. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in Embase, Medline, Web of Science Core Collection and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify eligible studies. Studies using AI to analyze ICU data were considered eligible. Specifically, the study design, study aim, dataset size, level of validation, level of readiness, and the outcomes of clinical trials were extracted. Risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated by the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). RESULTS: Out of 6455 studies identified through literature search, 494 were included. The most common study design was retrospective [476 studies (96.4% of all studies)] followed by prospective observational [8 (1.6%)] and clinical [10 (2%)] trials. 378 (80.9%) retrospective studies were classified as high risk of bias. No studies were identified that reported on the outcome evaluation of an AI model integrated in routine clinical practice. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of developed ICU-AI models remain within the testing and prototyping environment; only a handful were actually evaluated in clinical practice. A uniform and structured approach can support the development, safe delivery, and implementation of AI to determine clinical benefit in the ICU.

International liver societies recommend surveillance with biannual abdominal ultrasound (US) for patients with cirrhosis of any etiology because of their high risk of developing HCC. This strategy is considered cost-effective, as surveillance requires an articulated and costly set of interventions, including linkage to care of patients with an early detected tumor. However, as transition to HCC is increasingly being observed in noncirrhotic patients, the majority of which does not reach the threshold of cost effectiveness for screening. The European and Japanese liver societies elected to confine recommendations for HCC screening to noncirrhotic patients with advanced fibrosis due to hepatitis C or hepatitis B only. These latter recommendations, however, are challenged by the increasing number of patients with viral hepatitis in whom HCC risk has been attenuated but not eradicated by successful antiviral therapy. In this set of patients, entry criteria of surveillance need to be refined in the light of the suboptimal diagnostic accuracy of non invasive tests that are employed to identify the ideal candidates for surveillance.","Sangiovanni, Angelo; Colombo, Massimo",Saudi J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8183361/,88

A comprehensive review of wind-wildlife fatality information is still lacking for Latin America; however, given the current installed capacity and the projected increase of wind energy production across Latin America, it is important to fill in the knowledge gap on impacts to wildlife. To provide a current summary of known impacts to birds and bats in Latin America and to identify gaps on this important information, we compiled, reviewed, and synthesized bird and bat fatality information at wind energy projects in the region. Our literature search resulted in 10 references relevant to the scope of this review, six of which provided number of fatalities by species and the type of PCFM search being conducted, meeting our criteria for inclusion in fatality summaries. From this pool, we found that Passerines composed the majority of bird fatalities, with no Threatened bird species reported. The bat family Molossidae composed the majority of bat fatalities, with one Threatened bat species reported. Our review of all studies and focused assessment of only those studies with fatality summaries indicated differences in the amount of information and level of detail related to bird and bat fatalities at wind energy projects in Latin America. Due to the taxon-specific nature of collision risk with wind turbines for birds and bats, it is difficult to make a general impact assessment of wind energy development on birds and bats in Latin America, especially given the limited information available. However, this summary can be used as a starting point to inform conservation efforts aiming at avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating impacts of wind energy development on birds and bats and future, standardized results would enhance our ability to do so.","Agudelo, M.

18603,CRISPR/Cas9-based generation of a recombinant double-reporter pseudorabies virus and its characterization in vitro and in vivo,2021-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Clusters of sex-specific loci are predicted to shape the boundaries of the M/m sex-determination locus of the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti, but the identities of these genes are not known. Identification and characterization of these loci could promote a better understanding of mosquito sex chromosome evolution and lead to the elucidation of new strategies for male mosquito sex separation, a requirement for several emerging mosquito population control strategies that are dependent on the mass rearing and release of male mosquitoes. This investigation revealed that the methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase (MtnB) gene, which resides adjacent to the M/m locus and encodes an evolutionarily conserved component of the methionine salvage pathway, is required for survival of female larvae. RESULTS: Larval consumption of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) strains engineered to express interfering RNA corresponding to MtnB resulted in target gene silencing and significant female death, yet had no impact on A. aegypti male survival or fitness. Integration of the yeast larvicides into mass culturing protocols permitted scaled production of fit adult male mosquitoes. Moreover, silencing MtnB orthologs in Aedes albopictus, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex quinquefasciatus revealed a conserved female-specific larval requirement for MtnB among different species of mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation, which may have important implications for the study of mosquito sex chromosome evolution, indicate that silencing MtnB can facilitate sex separation in multiple species of disease vector insects.

METHODS: During July 1(st) and December 31(th) 2019, participants were prospectively derived from the ‘Zhongshan Cardiovascular Surgery Cohort’. NLPR was determined using neutrophil counts, lymphocyte and platelet count at the two-time points. Dose-response relationship analyses were applied to delineate the non-linear odds ratio (OR) of CSA-AKI in different NLPR levels. Then NLPRs were integrated into the generalized estimating equation (GEE) to predict the risk of AKI. RESULTS: Of 2449 patients receiving cardiovascular surgery, 838 (34.2%) cases developed CSA-AKI with stage 1 (n = 658, 26.9%), stage 2–3 (n = 180, 7.3%). Compared with non-AKI patients, both preoperative and postoperative NLPR were higher in AKI patients (1.1[0.8, 1.8] vs. 0.9[0.7,1.4], p < 0.001; 12.4[7.5, 20.0] vs. 10.1[6.4,16.7], p < 0.001). Such an effect was a ‘J’-shaped relationship: CSA-AKI’s risk was relatively flat until 1.0 of preoperative NLPR and increased rapidly afterward, with an odds ratio of 1.13 (1.06–1.19) per 1 unit. Similarly, patients whose postoperative NLPR value >11.0 were more likely to develop AKI with an OR of 1.02. Integrating the dynamic NLPRs into the GEE model, we found that the AUC was 0.806(95% CI 0.793–0.819), which was significantly higher than the AUC without NLPR (0.799, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dynamics of perioperative NPLR is a promising marker for predicting acute kidney injury. It will facilitate AKI risk management and allow clinicians to intervene early so as to reverse renal damage.","Li, Yang; Zou, Zhouping; Zhang, Yunlu; Zhu, Bowen; Ning, Yichun; Shen, Bo; Wang, Chunsheng; Luo, Zhe; Xu, Jiarui; Ding, Xiaoqiang",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260043/,88

Although the disease mechanism is unclear, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) produced by pancreatic acinar cells is a known pathogenic trigger. Here, we show macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles with a built-in ‘lure and kill’ mechanism (denoted ‘MΦ-NP(L&K)’) for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. MΦ-NP(L&K) are made with polymeric cores wrapped with natural macrophage membrane doped with melittin and MJ-33. The membrane incorporated melittin and MJ-33 function as a PLA2 attractant and a PLA2 inhibitor, respectively. These molecules, together with membrane lipids, work synergistically to lure and kill PLA2 enzymes. These nanoparticles can neutralize PLA2 activity in the sera of mice and human patients with acute pancreatitis in a dose-dependent manner and suppress PLA2-induced inflammatory response accordingly. In mouse models of both mild and severe acute pancreatitis, MΦ-NP(L&K) confer effective protection against disease-associated inflammation, tissue damage and lethality. Overall, this biomimetic nanotherapeutic strategy offers an anti-PLA2 treatment option that might be applicable to a wide range of PLA2-mediated inflammatory disorders.","Zhang, Qiangzhe; Zhou, Julia; Zhou, Jiarong; Fang, Ronnie H.; Gao, Weiwei; Zhang, Liangfang",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260623/,88

Most collaboratives are limited to the public health and health care delivery sectors; however, multisector collaboratives are becoming more recognized as a strategy for combining efforts from medical, public health, social services, and other sectors. PROGRAM: Based on a 4-year multisector collaborative project, we identify concepts for widening the lens to conduct multisector alignment research. The goal of the collaborative was to address the serious care fragmentation and conflicting financing systems for persons with behavioral health disorders. Our work with these 7 sectors provides insight for creating a framework to conduct multisector alignment research for investigating how alignment problems can be identified, investigated, and applied to achieve systems alignment. IMPLEMENTATION: The multisector collaborative was undertaken in Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix, Arizona, and consisted of more than 50 organizations representing 7 sectors. EVALUATION: We develop a framework for systems alignment consisting of 4 dimensions (alignment problems, alignment mechanisms, alignment solutions, and goal attainment) and a vocabulary for implementing multisector alignment research. We then describe the interplay and reciprocity between the 4 dimensions. DISCUSSION: This framework can be used by multisector collaboratives to help identify strategies, implement programs, and develop metrics to assess impact on population health and equity.","Riley, William J.; Love, Kailey; Runger, George; Shafer, Michael S.; Pine, Kathleen; Mays, Glen",J Public Health Manag Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8291142/,88

METHODS: We enrolled consecutive eligible patients listed for elective OPCABG who underwent cardiorespiratory polygraphy before surgery between January 2019 and December 2019 in this prospective observational single-center study. Baseline, intraoperative, and postoperative clinical data were compared between absent-mild and moderate-severe OSA groups. Regression analysis investigated the relationship between Hs-CRP level and severity of OSA, and further assessed the factors influencing postoperative atrial fibrillation, duration of hospitalization, and hospital cost. RESULTS: Patients with moderate-severe OSA accounted for 42.3% (52/123) of the cohort. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO(2)), Hs-CRP, apnea hypopnea index (AHI), mean apnea time, maximum apnea time, and oxygen desaturation index ODI ≥ 3% were significantly higher in the moderate-severe OSA group than in the absent-mild OSA group. Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), lowest arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), and mean SaO(2) were significantly lower in the moderate-severe OSA group. Moderate-severe OSA was associated with elevated Hs-CRP level (OR = 2.356, 95% CI 1.101–5.041, P = 0.027). Hs-CRP was an independent risk factor for post-CABG atrial fibrillation (POAF) (OR = 1.212, P = 0.01).

19754,Investigating Virus–Host Interactions in Cultured Primary Honey Bee Cells,2021-07-17,"Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been widely used as a viral vector across mammalian biology and has been shown to be safe and effective in human gene therapy. We demonstrate that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature dentate granule cells (DGCs) within the adult murine hippocampus are particularly sensitive to rAAV-induced cell death. Cell loss is dose dependent and nearly complete at experimentally relevant viral titers. rAAV-induced cell death is rapid and persistent, with loss of BrdU-labeled cells within 18 hr post-injection and no evidence of recovery of adult neurogenesis at 3 months post-injection. The remaining mature DGCs appear hyperactive 4 weeks post-injection based on immediate early gene expression, consistent with previous studies investigating the effects of attenuating adult neurogenesis. In vitro application of AAV or electroporation of AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) is sufficient to induce cell death. Efficient transduction of the dentategyrus (DG)– without ablating adult neurogenesis– can be achieved by injection of rAAV2-retro serotyped virus into CA3. rAAV2-retro results in efficient retrograde labeling of mature DGCs and permits in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of dentate activity while leaving adult neurogenesis intact. These findings expand on recent reports implicating rAAV-linked toxicity in stem cells and other cell types and suggest that future work using rAAV as an experimental tool in the DG and as a gene therapy for diseases of the central nervous system should be carefully evaluated.","Johnston, Stephen; Parylak, Sarah L; Kim, Stacy; Mac, Nolan; Lim, Christina; Gallina, Iryna; Bloyd, Cooper; Newberry, Alexander; Saavedra, Christian D; Novak, Ondrej; Gonçalves, J Tiago; Gage, Fred H; Shtrahman, Matthew",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8331179/,88

This is counteracted by phagocytosis that plays a key role in the protection against invading microbes both during the initial engulfment of pathogens and in the clearance of infected cells. Phagocytic cells balance two vital functions: preventing the accumulation of cell corpses to avoid pathological inflammation and autoimmunity, whilst maintaining host defence. In this review, we compare elements of phagocytosis in mammals and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Initial recognition of infection requires different mechanisms. In mammals, pattern recognition receptors bind pathogens directly, whereas activation of the innate immune response in the nematode rather relies on the detection of cellular damage. In contrast, molecules involved in efferocytosis—the engulfment and elimination of dying cells and cell debris—are highly conserved between the two species. Therefore, C. elegans is a powerful model to research mechanisms of the phagocytic machinery. Finally, we show that both mammalian and worm studies help to understand how the two phagocytic functions are interconnected: emerging data suggest the activation of innate immunity as a consequence of defective apoptotic cell clearance.","Lukácsi, Szilvia; Farkas, Zsolt; Saskői, Éva; Bajtay, Zsuzsa; Takács-Vellai, Krisztina",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396242/,88

21325,Ancient viral integrations in marsupials: a potential antiviral defence,2021-09-02,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common malignant tumor of the digestive system with a poor prognosis. The high recurrence rate and metastasis after surgery reduce the survival time of patients. Therefore, assessing the overall survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy is critical to clinicians’ clinical decision-making. Conventional hepatocellular carcinoma assessment systems (such as tumor lymph node metastasis and Barcelona clinical hepatocellular carcinoma) are obviously insufficient in assessing the overall survival rate of patients. This research is devoted to the development of nomogram assessment tools to assess the overall survival probability of patients undergoing liver resection. METHODS: We collected the clinical and pathological information of 438 hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing surgery from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, then excluded 87 patients who did not meet inclusion criteria. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on patient characteristics and related pathological factors. Finally, we developed a nomogram model to predict patient’s prognosis. RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of 438 consecutive samples from the TCGA database of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent potentially curative liver resections. Six risk factors were included in the final model. In the training set, the discriminative ability of the nomogram was very good (concordance index = 0.944), and the external verification method (concordance index = 0.962) was used for verification. At the same time, the internal and external calibration of the model was verified, showing that the model was well calibrated. The calibration between the evaluation of the nomogram and the actual observations was good. According to the patient’s risk factors, we determined the patient’s Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis curve. Finally, the clinical decision curve was used to compare the benefits of two different models in evaluating patients’ clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram can be used to evaluate the post-hepatectomy 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The Kaplan-Meyer curve can intuitively display the survival differences among patients with various risk factors. The clinical decision curve is a good reference guide for clinical application.","Ye, Dingde; Qu, Jiamu; Wang, Jian; Li, Guoqiang; Sun, Beicheng; Xu, Qingxiang",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450568/,88

Knowledge of the concept of developmental hemostasis is an essential prerequisite for the proper interpretation of conventional coagulation tests (CCT) and is critical to ensure the optimal diagnosis and treatment of hemorrhagic and thrombotic diseases in neonatal age. Viscoelastic tests (VETs) provide a point-of-care, real-time, global, and dynamic assessment of the mechanical properties of the coagulation system with the examination of both cellular and plasma protein contributions to the initiation, formation, and lysis of clots. In this work, we provide a narrative review of the basic principles of VETs and summarize current evidence regarding the two most studied point-of-care VETs, thromboelastography (TEG(®)) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM(®)), in the field of neonatal care. A literature analysis shows that viscoelastic hemostatic monitoring appears to be a useful additive technique to CCT, allowing targeted therapy to be delivered quickly. These tools may allow researchers to determine the neonatal coagulation profile and detect neonatal patients at risk for postoperative bleeding, coagulation abnormalities in neonatal sepsis, and other bleeding events in a timely manner, guiding transfusion therapies using the goal-oriented transfusion algorithm. However, diagnosis and treatment algorithms incorporating VETs for neonatal patients in a variety of clinical situations should be developed and applied to improve clinical outcomes.

In a prospective cohort study, 37 parameters from four categories were recorded from 60 men and 98 women before and four months after endoscopic sinus surgery, including endoscopic measures of nasal anatomy/pathology, assessments of olfactory function, quality of life, and socio-demographic or concomitant conditions. Parameters containing relevant information about changes associated with surgery were examined using unsupervised and supervised methods, including machine-learning techniques for feature selection. The analyzed cohort included 52 men and 38 women. Changes in the endoscopic Lildholdt score allowed separation of baseline from postoperative data with a cross-validated accuracy of 85%. Further relevant information included primary nasal symptoms from SNOT-20 assessments, and self-assessments of olfactory function. Overall improvement in these relevant parameters was observed in 95% of patients. A ranked list of criteria was developed as a proposal to assess the outcome of functional endoscopic sinus surgery in CRS patients with nasal polyposis. Three different facets were captured, including the Lildholdt score as an endoscopic measure and, in addition, disease-specific quality of life and subjectively perceived olfactory function.","Lötsch, Jörn; Hintschich, Constantin A.; Petridis, Petros; Pade, Jürgen; Hummel, Thomas",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465949/,88

It is a powerful tool for analyzing viral genes, the development of novel vaccines, and gene delivery vectors. The standard reverse genetics protocols are laborious, time-consuming, and inefficient for negative-strand RNA viruses. A new reverse genetics platform was established, which increases the recovery efficiency of the measles virus (MV) in human 293-3-46 cells. The novel features compared with the standard system involving 293-3-46 cells comprise (a) dual promoters containing the RNA polymerase II promoter (CMV) and the bacteriophage T7 promoter placed in uni-direction on the same plasmid to enhance RNA transcription; (b) three G nucleotides added just after the T7 promoter to increase the T7 RNA polymerase activity; and (c) two ribozymes, the hairpin hammerhead ribozyme (HHRz), and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDVrz), were used to cleavage the exact termini of the antigenome RNA. Full-length antigenome cDNA of MV of the wild type IC323 strain or the vaccine AIK-C strain was inserted into the plasmid backbone. Both virus strains were easily rescued from their respective cloned cDNA. The rescue efficiency increased up to 80% compared with the use of the standard T7 rescue system.

Together, DCs and complement are key points for understanding host defence against HIV-1 infection and for studying the impact of new drugs on the regulation of innate host-pathogen interactions and adaptive immunity. For this, we evaluated the antiviral effect of the P80 natural essence (Longan extract) on interactions of non- and complement-opsonized HIV-1 with DCs. In viability assays, we first illustrated the effects of P80 natural essence on DC function. We found that P80 concentrations above 1.5% caused increased cell death, while at concentrations between 0.5% and 1% the compound exerted efficient antiviral effects in DCs and illustrated an adjuvant effect regarding DC activation. DC maturation, as well as co-stimulatory capacity, were significantly improved by P80 natural essence via p38 MAPK phosphorylation in presence of the viral challenge independent of the opsonization pattern. These findings might be exploited for future therapeutic options to target DC subsets directly at mucosal sites by P80 natural essence and to block entry of both, non- and complement-opsonized HIV-1.","Zaderer, Viktoria; Posch, Wilfried; Gstir, Ronald; Filipek, Przemyslaw A.; Bonn, Günther K.; Aramwit, Pornanong; Huber, Lukas A.; Wilflingseder, Doris",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472994/,88
21750,Human Rotavirus Reverse Genetics Systems to Study Viral Replication and Pathogenesis,2021-09-08,"This paper is to design a new type of auxetic metamaterial-inspired structural architectures to innovate coronary stents under hemodynamics via a topological optimization method. The new architectures will low the occurrence of stent thrombosis (ST) and in-stent restenosis (ISR) associated with the mechanical factors and the adverse hemodynamics. A multiscale level-set approach with the numerical homogenization method and computational fluid dynamics is applied to implement auxetic microarchitectures and stenting structure. A homogenized effective modified fluid permeability (MFP) is proposed to efficiently connect design variables with motions of blood flow around the stent, and a Darcy-Stokes system is used to describe the coupling behavior of the stent structure and fluid. The optimization is formulated to include three objectives from different scales: MFP and auxetic property in the microscale and stenting stiffness in the macroscale. The design is numerically validated in the commercial software MATLAB and ANSYS, respectively. The simulation results show that the new design can not only supply desired auxetic behavior to benefit the deliverability and reduce incidence of the mechanical failure but also improve wall shear stress distribution to low the induced adverse hemodynamic changes. Hence, the proposed stenting architectures can help improve safety in stent implantation, to facilitate design of new generation of stents.","Xue, Huipeng; Saha, Suvash C.; Beier, Susann; Jepson, Nigel; Luo, Zhen",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473832/,88

We derive analytical and semi-analytical solutions of the coupled heat and mass diffusion equations within a spherical droplet and in the ambient vapor phase that describe the evaporation process of aqueous free droplets containing nonvolatile solutes. Our results demonstrate that the solute-induced water vapor-pressure reduction considerably slows down the evaporation process and dominates the solute-concentration dependence of the droplet evaporation time. The evaporation-induced enhanced solute concentration near the droplet surface, which is accounted for using a two-stage evaporation description, is found to further slow-down the drying process. On the other hand, the presence of solutes is found to produce a lower limit for the droplet size that can be reached by evaporation and, also, to reduce evaporation cooling of the droplet, which tend to decrease the evaporation time. Overall, the first two effects are dominant, meaning that the droplet evaporation time increases in the presence of solutes. Local variation of the water diffusivity inside the droplet near its surface, which is a consequence of the solute-concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient, does not significantly change the evaporation time. Crust formation on the droplet surface increases the final equilibrium size of the droplet by producing a hollow spherical particle, the outer radius of which is determined as well.","Rezaei, Majid; Netz, Roland R.",Phys Fluids (1994),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8474021/,88

A breathing motion model is detected and established through a ventilator. The research objects are mainly divided into group A and group B. By comparing the two groups of emergency ventilator ventilation, it can effectively prevent the increase in respiratory muscle fatigue, reduce oxygen consumption, improve the patient's ventilation function and oxygen balance, quickly correct hypoxia and carbon dioxide storage, cooperate with drug treatment, and quickly take out the ventilator after relief. Good treatment results were achieved. The results show that the emergency ventilator controlled by a microcomputer is effective.

However, the epidemiology and predictors of CMV reactivation in immunocompetent patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and predictors of CMV reactivation in immunocompetent patients requiring MV. METHODS: A single-center, prospective observational study (conducted from June 30, 2017 to July 01, 2018) with a follow-up of 90 days (September 29, 2018) that included 71 CMV-seropositive immunocompetent patients with MV at a 37-bed university hospital general intensive care unit (ICU) in China. Routine detection of CMV DNAemia was performed once a week for 28 days (Days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28). CMV serology, laboratory findings, and clinical data were obtained during hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 71 patients, 13 (18.3%) showed CMV reactivation within 28 days in the ICU. The median time to reactivation was 7 days. CMV reactivation was related to various factors, including body mass index (BMI), sepsis, N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and hemoglobin (Hb) levels (P < 0.05). In the multivariate regression model, BMI, Hb level, and sepsis were independently associated with CMV reactivation patients (P < 0.05). Moreover, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of BMI, Hb, and BMI combined with Hb was 0.69, 0.70, and 0.76, respectively. The duration of MV, hospitalization expense, length of ICU stay, and 90 day all-cause mortality rate in patients with CMV reactivation was significantly higher than in those without CMV reactivation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among immunocompetent patients with MV, the incidence of CMV reactivation was 18.3%. CMV reactivation was associated with several adverse prognoses. BMI, Hb, and sepsis were independent risk factors for CMV reactivation. BMI and Hb may predict CMV reactivation.

Acrolein’s initial interaction, which in itself can be function‐altering, is followed by time‐dependent cascade of complex cellular and pulmonary responses that dictate the severity of the injury. To investigate the pathophysiological progression of sex‐dependent acrolein‐induced acute lung injury, C57BL/6J mice were exposed for 30 min to sublethal, but toxic, and lethal acrolein. Male mice were more sensitive than female mice. Acrolein of 50 ppm was sublethal to female but lethal to male mice, and 75 ppm was lethal to female mice. Lethal and sublethal acrolein exposure decreased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) total cell number at 3 h after exposure. The cell number decrease was followed by progressive total cell and neutrophil number and protein increases. The BAL total cell number in female mice exposed to a sublethal, but not lethal dose, returned to control levels at 16 h. In contrast, BAL protein content and neutrophil number were higher in mice exposed to lethal compared to sublethal acrolein. RNASeq pathway analysis identified greater increased lung neutrophil, glutathione metabolism, oxidative stress responses, and CCL7 (aka MCP‐3), CXCL10 (aka IP‐10), and IL6 transcripts in males than females, whereas IL10 increased more in female than male mice. Thus, the IL6:IL10 ratio, an indicator of disease severity, was greater in males than females. Further, H3.3 histone B (H3F3B) and pro‐platelet basic protein (PPBP aka CXCL7), transcripts increased in acrolein exposed mouse BAL and plasma at 3 h, while H3F3B protein that is associated with neutrophil extracellular traps formation increased at 12 h. These results suggest that H3F3B and PPBP transcripts increase may contribute to extracellular H3F3B and PPBP proteins increase.","Bein, Kiflai; Birru, Rahel L.; Wells, Heather; Larkin, Theodore P.; Ge, Tengziyi; Leikauf, George D.",Physiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8488558/,88

Coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales, the other three families being the Arteriviridae, Toroviridae and Roniviridae. (For a review of classification and evolutionary relatedness of Nidovirales see Gorbalenya et al. 2006.) This grouping is based on the arrangement and relatedness of open reading frames within their genomes and on the presence in infected cells of multiple subgenomic mRNAs that form a 3'-co-terminal, nested set with the genome. Among the Nidovirales, coronaviruses (and toroviruses) are unique in their possession of a helical nucleocapsid, which is unusual for plus-stranded but not minus-stranded RNA viruses; plus-stranded RNA-containing plant viruses in the Closteroviridae and in the Tobamovirus genus also possess helical capsids. Coronaviruses are very successful and have infected many species of animals, including bats, birds (poultry) and mammals, such as humans and livestock. Coronavirus species are classified into three groups, which were based originally on cross-reacting antibodies and more recently on nucleotide sequence relatedness (Gonzalez et al. 2003). There have been several reviews of coronaviruses published recently and the reader is referred to them for more extensive references (Enjuanes et al. 2006; Masters 2006; Pasternak et al. 2006; Sawicki and Sawicki 2005; Sawicki et al. 2007; Ziebuhr 2005).","Sawicki, Stanley G.",Viral Genome Replication,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122471/,88

Zoals voor veel inwendige aandoeningen geldt, is een goede anamnese en lichamelijk onderzoek onontbeerlijk bij de analyse van pulmonale aandoeningen. De eerste paragrafen van dit hoofdstuk zullen hier dieper op ingaan. Helaas zijn de klachten vaak weinig specifiek en noodzaken dikwijls tot verder beeldvormend onderzoek. De X-thorax is vaak het beginpunt van een dergelijk diagnostisch traject. In de latere paragrafen zullen specifieke bevindingen op de X-thorax verder worden uitgediept. In veel gevallen is naast laboratoriumonderzoek ook functieonderzoek en computertomografie van de thorax noodzakelijk om de differentiële diagnose verder te versmallen. Het verkrijgen van weefsel is bij interstitiële longaandoeningen, tuberculose en maligniteit vaak het sluitstuk van de diagnostiek. Nieuwe endoscopische echogeleide technieken komen steeds meer in de plaats van invasief onderzoek zoals mediastinoscopie of thoracotomie.

Quantitatively assessing the truthfulness of content becomes key, but it is often challenging and thus done by experts. In this work we look at how experts and non-expert assess truthfulness of content by focusing on the effect of the adopted judgment scale and of assessors’ own bias on the judgments they perform. Our results indicate a clear effect of the assessors’ political background on their judgments where they tend to trust content which is aligned to their own belief, even if experts have marked it as false. Crowd assessors also seem to have a preference towards coarse-grained scales, as they tend to use a few extreme values rather than the full breadth of fine-grained scales.","La Barbera, David; Roitero, Kevin; Demartini, Gianluca; Mizzaro, Stefano; Spina, Damiano",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148047/,88

In order to better grasp the multilevel regulation of complex policy problems, it is needed to understand how uncertainty and scientific expertise are dealt with. We investigate this via the regulation of pandemics by the EU and the WHO, with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 as critical case. The analysis of the multilevel practice reveals that the attitude toward uncertainty fundamentally differed between the global (WHO) and the European level. At the global level a classic speaking truth to power approach involved the denial of uncertainty, while at the EU level the assigned role of providing scientific expertise was interpreted as a necessity to openly communicate about uncertainty. While the global approach was heavily criticized, the uncertainty communication at the European level was much appreciated.","Versluis, Esther; van Asselt, Marjolein; Kim, Jinhee",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163688/,88

In this article, we investigate the computational power of programs over monoids in [Image: see text], a small variety of finite aperiodic monoids. First, we give a fine hierarchy within the class of languages recognised by programs over monoids from [Image: see text], based on the length of programs but also some parametrisation of [Image: see text]. Second, and most importantly, we make progress in understanding what regular languages can be recognised by programs over monoids in [Image: see text]. We show that those programs actually can recognise all languages from a class of restricted dot-depth one languages, using a non-trivial trick, and conjecture that this class suffices to characterise the regular languages recognised by programs over monoids in [Image: see text].","Grosshans, Nathan",Language and Automata Theory and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206935/,88

Data mining, a process of uncovering silent characteristics of big data is one of such techniques which have nowadays become more popular for treating massive volume of infectious disease data set. In the current study, we apply cluster analysis, one of the data mining techniques to classify real groups of infectious disease “novel corona virus disease (COVID-19)” data set of different states and union territories (UTs) in India according to their high similarity to each other. The results obtained permit us to have a sense of clusters of affected Indian states and UTs. The main objective of clustering in this study is to optimize monitoring techniques in affected states and UTs in India which will be very valuable to the government, doctors, the police and others involved in understanding seriousness of the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to improve government policies, decisions, medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks etc.), treatment etc. to reduce number of infected and deceased persons.","Kumar, Sanjay",Ann,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7236640/,88

The method is based on the hybrid echo state network (hESN). We assume that the system is ergodic, so the time average is equal to the ergodic average. Compared to conventional echo state networks (ESN) (purely data-driven), the hESN uses additional information from an incomplete, or imperfect, physical model. We evaluate the performance of the hESN and compare it to that of an ESN. This approach is demonstrated on a chaotic time-delayed thermoacoustic system, where the inclusion of a physical model significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction, reducing the relative error from 48% to 1%. This improvement is obtained at the low extra cost of solving a small number of ordinary differential equations that contain physical information. This framework shows the potential of using machine learning techniques combined with prior physical knowledge to improve the prediction of time-averaged quantities in chaotic systems.","Huhn, Francisco; Magri, Luca",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304724/,88

Apart from providing a livelihood, rural communities find food and nutrients necessary for their survival and well-being from their farms. Agriculture also brings risks to health through infectious diseases. Poor health leads to reduction in productivity, where individuals are not able to carry out their livelihoods due to ill health. This could lead to reduction in income through excess expenditure on treatments, thereby inhibiting economic development of the affected communities. Infectious diseases have both direct and indirect impact on livelihoods. The direct impact includes poor health and loss of lives, which leads to partial and complete loss of livelihoods. Indirectly, infectious diseases lead to loss of income through poor performance of livelihoods as well as diversion of resources that could have been used to improve livelihood to seek medical treatment.

Recent literature indicates a growing number of studies about e-authentication and authorship verification for quality assurance with more flexible modes of assessment. Yet understanding the acceptability of e-authentication systems among SEND students is underexplored. This study examines SEND students’ views about the use of e-authentication systems, including perceived advantages and disadvantages of new technology-enhanced assessment. This study aims to shed light on this area by examining the attitudes of 267 SEND students who used, or were aware of, an authentication system known as adaptive trust-based e-assessment system for learning (TeSLA). The results suggest a broadly positive acceptability of these e-authentication technologies by SEND students. In the view of these students, the key advantages are the ability of proving the originality of their work, and trust-based e-assessment results; the key disadvantages are the possibility that the technology might not work or present wrong outputs in terms of cheating.","Laamanen, Merja; Ladonlahti, Tarja; Uotinen, Sanna; Okada, Alexandra; Bañeres, David; Koçdar, Serpil",Int J Educ Technol High Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7800833/,88

Hence, in disaster studies, temporality and spatiality are central, yet often implicit, concepts employed to make sense of the disaster phenomena. In this article we explicitly focus on temporality and spatiality within qualitative disaster studies, particularly those containing ethnographic elements. We use Doreen Massey’s idea of space-time trajectories to analyze and illustrate how in qualitative disaster studies the trajectories of the disaster, research participants, and the researcher entangle in diverse ways. The focus is on how temporality and spatiality are present in the construction of data. The article is mainly conceptual, with illustrations drawn from empirical fieldwork on Valparaíso fire of 2014 in Chile. We interrogate how researchers’ sensitivity to temporality and spatiality challenges the conventional notions and practices of “data” in qualitative disaster studies. The focus in this article is on disaster studies, but it also offers methodological insights to other social sciences that strive to conduct research in the era of “Anthropocene,” with all its shifts and changes, the root causes of which have built over a long time.","Meriläinen, Eija; Koro, Mirka",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883880/,88

The invasion of nuclear magnetic stable isotopes of Mg, Ca, and Zn in enzymatic catalysis disclosed new features of the DNA and gene chemistry; it discovered a new, radical pair mechanism, which substantiated the origin of magnetic effects. This mechanism implies electron transfer between the reaction partners; it is switched on by catalyzing ions and generates magneto-sensitive radical pairs. The key processes of gene functioning – DNA synthesis, DNA damage, and DNA repair – are shown to be magnetically controlled. A new anti-cancer strategy is suggested based on the using of the nuclear magnetic ions of magnesium, calcium, and zinc as a powerful and universal means to selectively kill only cancer cells; they are supposed to be highly promising for medical applications.","Buchachenko, A.

We experimentally show that consumers engage in multitasking behavior as a way to compensate for feelings of low control. Specifically, across five main studies and seven Web Appendix studies using two different multitasking paradigms, we find that consumers feeling low (vs. high) control volitionally choose to multitask more on subsequent tasks, rather than do the tasks sequentially (i.e., one task at a time). Mediation and moderation evidence demonstrate that this effect is driven by increased motivations to use time resources efficiently for those feeling low (vs. high) control. We also find that multitasking generally results in suboptimal consumer decision making and decreased task performance. An intervention that altered consumer lay beliefs regarding multitasking and time efficiency was effective in lowering multitasking behavior for consumers experiencing low control during the COVID-19 pandemic. By investigating a cause of consumer multitasking and the underlying mechanism, our studies contribute to research on consumer multitasking, perceptions of control, and resource allocation with important implications for advertisers and marketing managers.","Han, Jerry J; Broniarczyk, Susan M",J Consum Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136055/,88

While publications are analyzing the bibliometrics on this condition, there are none available specifically for the impact of COVID-19 on trauma and orthopedics. The aim of this study, therefore, was to perform a bibliometric analysis on COVID-19 and trauma and orthopedics to assess its impact on the specialty. A search for articles on COVID-19 concerning trauma and orthopedics, with the keywords: “COVID-19, New coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, Orthopedic*, trauma, bone, and joint” were performed on the June 19, 2020, using SCOPUS and PUBMED and this resulted in 272 and 887 articles, respectively. Later, on the same day, we searched for orthopedic journals exclusively and extracted 258 articles from 58 journals. Furthermore, we analyzed the Altmetric data through the dimensions website to find the most popular articles on social media on this topic. After analyzing the data, we found that review articles were the most commonly published articles. The leading journal publishing this content were; The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (JBJS) American (35), followed by the Journal of Arthroplasty (22). There were 6936 authors involved in publishing 887 articles in 2020. Most articles were published by Vaishya (5) followed by Liang (5), and Iyengar (5). Analysis of Altmetric data showed a total number of citations of 5000 with a mean of 1.98. MedRxiv with 781 publications and 1616 citations was the preprint server with the most publications on dimensions. We studied details of the article with maximum AAS score of 25226 is with 840 citations. We have listed useful protocols from the search and top five cited articles from each search strategy. Publications on COVID-19 commenced from the 9(th) week of this year and have increased exponentially. Review articles (PubMed) and articles (Scopus) were the most published. The JBJS (Am) and J Arthroplasty have published the maximum number of articles on COVID-19. We found that for a fast evolving condition and for the short term, altmetrics may be better indicators than citations to follow directions of research. Publications with a low number of citations could have immense social media attention. This study should help in quantifying the value of research and publications related to orthopedics and trauma aspects of COVID-19 and therefore help the readers, researchers, and health-care providers to use this information effectively.","Kambhampati, Srinivas B.

56927,"Isolation and molecular characterization of GP5 glycoprotein gene of Betaarterivirus suid 2 from Mizoram, India",2021-08-20,"Vitamin D deficiency, if left untreated, is associated with bone disorders, cardiovascular damage, and an increased risk of ischemic stroke. While there are various nutritional options for the natural intake of vitamin D, we hope to elucidate the potential mechanisms dietary vitamin D may play in hemorrhagic stroke pathology. This scoping review outlines findings from studies relevant to the biochemical activity of vitamin D, the impact of vitamin D deficiency on hemorrhagic stroke outcomes, and the potential benefit of nutritional vitamin D on hemorrhagic stroke outcomes. Here, we analyze the relevant factors that can lead to vitamin D deficiency, and subsequently, a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke incidence with worsened subsequent outcomes. The neuroprotective mechanisms through which vitamin D works to attenuate hemorrhagic stroke onset and post-stroke outcomes have not yet been thoroughly examined. However, researchers have proposed several potential protective mechanisms, including reduction of blood brain barrier disturbance by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species, mitigation of inflammation through a reduction of levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and prevention of cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage. While more research is needed and there are limitations to vitamin D supplementation, vitamin D as a whole may play a significant role in the dynamics of hemorrhagic stroke. Further research should focus on expanding our understanding of the neuroprotective capacity and mechanisms of vitamin D, as well as how vitamin D supplementation could serve as an effective course of treatment of hemorrhagic strokes.","Ashouri, Rani; Fangman, Madison; Brielmaier, Jordan; Fields, Zoe A.; Campo, Natalie; Doré, Sylvain",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363078/,88
59398,Functional characterization and proteomic analysis of porcine deltacoronavirus accessory protein NS7.,2019,"Objective: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of containment strategies and mitigation strategies to provide a reference for controlling the ongoing global spread of the pandemic. Methods: We extracted publicly available data from various official websites between January 1 and December 31, 2020, summarized the strategies implemented in China, South Korea, Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and assessed the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures adopted by these countries with the daily new cases and mortality rate per 100,000 population. Results: China, South Korea, and Singapore adopted containment strategies, which maintained a proactive approach by identifying and managing cases, tracking and isolating close contacts. China and Singapore had a similar epidemic curve and the new daily cases. As of December 31, 2020, the new daily cases of China and Singapore were below 100 with the mortality rates per 100,000 population of 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. But the new daily case of South Korea was as high as 1,029, with a mortality rate per 100,000 population of 1.8. In contrast, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France responded with mitigation strategies that focus on treating severe cases and those with underlying conditions. They had similar epidemic curves and mortality rates per 100,000 population. The United States had up to 234,133 new confirmed cases per day, and the mortality rate per 100,000 population was 107, while the United Kingdom had 56,029 new confirmed cases per day and the mortality rate per 100,000 population was 108, and France had 20,042 new cases per day, with a mortality rate per 100,000 population of 99. Conclusions: China, Korea, and Singapore, which implemented strict containment measures, had significant outbreak control. Meanwhile, the successful practices in China, Singapore, and South Korea show that the containment strategies were practices that work especially at the individual level identifying and managing the infected patients and their close contacts. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, which implemented the mitigation policies, the effect of epidemic prevention and control was not significant that the epidemic continued or even increased epidemic relatively quickly.","Chen, Haiqian; Shi, Leiyu; Zhang, Yuyao; Wang, Xiaohan; Jiao, Jun; Yang, Manfei; Sun, Gang",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8515016/,88

60437,Impact on the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of turnip mosaic virus infection.,2012,"Gastric cancer is most common cancer in Korea. Surgery is still the main axis of treatment. Due to early detection of gastric cancer, the innovation of surgical instruments and technological advances, gastric cancer treatment is now shifting to a new era. One of the most astonishing changes is that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is becoming more dominant treatment for early gastric cancer. These MIS are represented by endoscopic resection, laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery, single-port surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Among them, laparoscopic gastrectomy is most actively performed in the field of surgery. Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) for early gastric cancer (EGC) has already gained popularity in terms of the short-term outcomes including patient's quality of life. We only have to wait for the long-term oncologic results of Korean Laparoscopic Gastrointestinal Surgery Study Group. Upcoming top issues following oncologic safety of LADG are function-preserving surgery for EGC, application of laparoscopy to advanced gastric cancer and sentinel lymph node navigation surgery. In the aspect of technique, laparoscopic surgery at present could reproduce almost the whole open procedures. However, the other fields mentioned above need more evidences and experiences. All these new ideas and attempts provide technical advances, which will minimize surgical insults and maximize the surgical outcomes and the quality of life of patients.","Kim, Hyung-Ho; Ahn, Sang-Hoon",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,https://doi.org/10.4174/jkss.2011.81.3.151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22066116/,88

For specific events, such as rare acute poisonings or preliminary reports of new drugs, we posit that case reports/studies and case series (human subjects research with no control group) may provide important evidence for systematic reviews. Our aim, therefore, is to present a protocol that uses rigorous selection criteria, to distinguish high quality case reports/studies and case series for inclusion in systematic reviews. Methods: This protocol will adapt the existing Navigation Guide methodology for specific inclusion of case studies. The usual procedure for systematic reviews will be followed. Case reports/studies and case series will be specified in the search strategy and included in separate sections. Data from these sources will be extracted and where possible, quantitatively synthesized. Criteria for integrating cases reports/studies and case series into the overall body of evidence are that these studies will need to be well-documented, scientifically rigorous, and follow ethical practices. The instructions and standards for evaluating risk of bias will be based on the Navigation Guide. The risk of bias, quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations will be assessed by two independent review teams that are blinded to each other. Conclusion: This is a protocol specified for systematic reviews that use case reports/studies and case series to evaluate the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations in disciplines like clinical toxicology, where case reports/studies are the norm.","Nambiema, Aboubakari; Sembajwe, Grace; Lam, Juleen; Woodruff, Tracey; Mandrioli, Daniele; Chartres, Nicholas; Fadel, Marc; Le Guillou, Adrien; Valter, Remi; Deguigne, Marie; Legeay, Marion; Bruneau, Chloe; Le Roux, Gaël; Descatha, Alexis",Frontiers in medicine,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.708380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552944/,88

The fixation of mesh through penetrating techniques using staples, clips or screws is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing a post-herniotomy pain syndrome. AIM To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the self-fixating anatomical Parietex ProGrip laparoscopic mesh (Sofradim Production, Trévoux France) used with laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair. The incidence of chronic post-herniotomy pain and recurrence rate in the follow-up after 12 months were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data analysis included all patients who underwent inguinal hernia surgery at our Surgical Department within the period from 1.05.2013 to 31.12.2014, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Standard surgical technique was used. Data were prospectively entered and subsequently analyzed on the Herniamed platform. Herniamed is an internet-based register in German and English language and includes all data of patients who underwent surgery for some types of hernia. RESULTS There were 95 patients enrolled in the group and there were in total 156 inguinal hernias repaired. The mean follow-up was 15.52 months. At the assessment at 1 year mild discomfort in the groin was reported in 2 patients (3.51%) (1-3 VAS). No recurrence or chronic postoperative pain was reported. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair using the transabdominal preperitoneal technique with implantation of the ProGrip laparoscopic mesh is a fast, effective and reliable method in experienced hands, which according to our results reduces the occurrence of chronic post-operative inguinal pain with simultaneously a low recurrence rate.","Klobusicky, Pavol; Hoskovec, David",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2015.54222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26649083/,88

An online questionnaire was randomly sent by social media to clinicians in different countries from 24 April, 2020 to May 4, 2020. The survey consisted of a series of questions about demographic characteristics, endodontic emergency diagnoses, approaches to prevent aerosol formation, drug prescriptions in case of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and the ways in which dentists managed endodontic emergencies during the COVID-19 lockdown. A total of 1,058 dentists responded to the questionnaire; 344 (32.6%) of the participants were endodontists. Slightly less than half of the participants (n = 485, 45.8%) worked during the lockdown, but only 303 participants (28.6%) treated endodontic cases/emergencies. The responses showed agreement between endodontists and GDPs regarding the diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP), symptomatic apical periodontitis (SAP), reversible pulpitis, and asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis (AIP). SIP and SAP were considered an emergency, whereas reversible pulpitis and AIP were not considered an emergency (p > 0.05). Non-aerosol-generating procedures and treatment approaches differed between the groups (p < 0.05). One-third of the participants did not use rubber dam (p > 0.05). Ibuprofen and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were the most frequently prescribed drugs for pain associated with SIP.

The objective of this study was to analyze treatment outcomes of this treatment modality. METHODS A retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from all patients undergoing TIPP procedure for symptomatic varicose veins during a recent 12-year period was performed. Pertinent patient demographics, disease classification, perioperative complications, quality of life, and treatment outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 1167 limbs in 1034 patients (mean age, 52.4 years) were treated during the study period. The mean procedure time was 18.4 ± 8.9 minutes (range, 6.0-82.0 minutes). The mean number of incisions for TIPP procedure was 6.3 ± 3.6. All TIPP procedures were technically successful, and no patient required conversion to hook stab phlebectomy. Fifteen (1.5%) patients developed residual or recurrent varicosities, which were treated with sclerotherapy during the follow-up period. Postoperative complications included hematoma at 2 weeks (5.8%), ecchymosis at 2 weeks (32.9%), saphenous neuropathy (0.3%), cellulitis (1.0%), and skin pigmentation (1.9%). There was no postoperative deep vein thrombosis or mortality. CONCLUSIONS Transilluminated powered phlebectomy is an effective method for varicose vein removal and is associated with high clinical success and excellent cosmetic results.

In this study, we have reported the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, the frequency of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations and their apoptosis pattern in Iranian COVID-19 patients. Demographic and clinical data of 61 hospitalized confirmed cases with COVID-19 at Imam Khomeini Hospital were collected and analyzed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from all samples and the apoptosis pattern was evaluated using Annexin V/propidium iodide method. The frequency of lymphocyte subsets including T-CD4+ , T-CD8+ , NK, B cells, and monocytes was measured in all patients and 31 controls by flow cytometry. Our findings demonstrated that the percentage of lymphocytes, CD4+ , and CD8+ T cells were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to control group. Regarding the clinical severity, the number of lymphocytes, CD4+ , CD8+ T cells, and NK cells were also decreased in severe cases when compared to mild cases. Finally, our data have also indicated the increasing in apoptosis of mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients which was more remarkable in severe clinical cases. The frequency of immune cells is a useful indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE We aimed to compare the genders regarding health anxiety and musculoskeletal symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the relationship of musculoskeletal symptoms with physical activity and health anxiety. METHODS Assessments were performed through an online questionnaire. Eighty-five males and eighty-five females were included by matching genders in terms of age, body mass index, education level, number of days spent at home during the pandemic, and physical activity. The Short Health Anxiety Inventory, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form, and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire were used to assess health anxiety, physical activity, and musculoskeletal symptoms, respectively. RESULTS Females had a higher level of health anxiety and more musculoskeletal symptoms than males (p< 0.05). There were weak to moderate correlations in females and weak correlations in males between musculoskeletal symptoms and health anxiety (p< 0.05). Also, a weak negative correlation was found between physical activity and musculoskeletal symptoms in both genders (p< 0.05).

67488,The endoplasmic reticulum provides the membrane platform for biogenesis of the flavivirus replication complex.,2010,"OBJECTIVES Iatrogenic laryngotracheal stenosis (iLTS) is the pathological narrowing of the glottis, subglottis, and/or trachea due to scar tissue. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are over 8 times more likely to develop iLTS and represent 26% to 53% of all iLTS patients. In this investigation, we compared iLTS scar-derived fibroblasts in patients with and without T2DM. STUDY DESIGN Controlled ex vivo study. METHODS iLTS scar fibroblasts were isolated and cultured from subglottic scar biopsies in iLTS patients diagnosed with or without type 2 diabetes (non-T2DM). Fibroblast proliferation, fibrosis-related gene expression, and metabolic utilization of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis were assessed. Contractility was measured using a collagen-based assay. Metabolically targeted drugs (metformin, phenformin, amobarbital) were tested, and changes in fibrosis-related gene expression, collagen protein, and contractility were evaluated. RESULTS Compared to non-T2DM, T2DM iLTS scar fibroblasts had increased α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression (8.2× increased, P = .020), increased contractility (mean 71.4 ± 4.3% vs. 51.7 ± 16% Δ area × 90 minute-1 , P = .016), and reduced proliferation (1.9× reduction at 5 days, P < .01). Collagen 1 (COL1) protein was significantly higher in the T2DM group (mean 2.06 ± 0.19 vs. 0.74 ±.44 COL1/total protein [pg/μg], P = .036). T2DM iLTS scar fibroblasts had increased measures of OXPHOS, including basal respiration (mean 86.7 vs. 31.5 pmol/minute/10 μg protein, P = .016) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation (mean 97.5 vs. 25.7 pmol/minute/10 μg protein, P = .047) compared to non-T2DM fibroblasts. Amobarbital reduced cellular contractility; decreased collagen protein; and decreased expression of αSMA, COL1, and fibronectin. Metformin and phenformin did not significantly affect fibrosis-related gene expression. CONCLUSION T2DM iLTS scar fibroblasts demonstrate a myofibroblast phenotype and greater contractility compared to non-T2DM.

Following more than 100 years of development and improvement, chromatography theory and technology have gradually become sophisticated. It has become a coalition of science, technology, and art. Recently, chromatography has been successfully used in combination with mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and atomic emission spectroscopy. Chromatography and the combination with other techniques has significantly improved the analysis of complex systems, such as the environment, food, petrochemicals, biological specimens, and medicine. As one of the oldest healing systems, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has served to maintain the health of people in China and worldwide for thousands of years. Therefore, it has become a core representative of traditional Chinese culture. In the past two years, TCM has been widely used to treat COVID-19, especially in patients with mild symptoms. Recently, Chinese government emphasized the inheritance and innovation of TCM and stepped up efforts to promote its modernization. TCM includes herbal medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion, massage, food therapy, and physical exercise, such as Tai Chi. In most cases, the patients are administered a mixture of TCM formulas containing more than two herbal medicines, resulting in a highly complicated compound mixture. There is no doubt that long-term clinical practices have demonstrated the safety and therapeutic effect of TCM. However, the compound mixture must be simplified to identify the active compounds. This is mainly because of the existence of carcinogenic compounds, pesticides, and heavy metal residues introduced through plantation and production processes. Moreover, enzymes within the human system generate further new compounds in response to the entry of the TCM containing thousands of components. Consequently, the complex TCM and organism systems interact with each other, constituting a giant complex drug-organism system. The analysis of this giant complex system is acknowledged as a key aspect in the modernization process of TCM. In the last 20 years, many studies have been conducted to screen and identify effective compounds in TCM. These effective compounds can be either the original compounds or new metabolic components generated in vivo. All these efforts are aimed at simplifying the components of TCM and elucidating the therapeutic mechanism. It is well known that chromatography can provide technical support for complex systems owing to its unique advantage of outstanding separation and analysis capabilities. Therefore, chromatography and its combination with other technologies have become mainstream technologies for promoting the compilation of molecular structure, information, digitalization, and modernization of TCM. This paper reviews the research and application of chromatography and combination technologies in a giant complex TCM formula-organism system. Furthermore, the authors briefly introduce and summarize the understanding, research ideas, and activities of the authors' team on the modernization of TCM. ""Liang Guanxi"" and ""He strategy"" are proposed as novel strategies for studying the giant complex drug-organism system. A distinguished technology integrated with mathematical model of causal relation, combined receptor chromatography, identification of chemical molecular structure and evaluating of pharmacological activities was established. It was successfully employed to determine the core effector-response substances of ""Liang Guanxi"" herb pairs in a giant complex drug-organism system. Subsequently, utilizing the proposed technology of Combination of Traditional Chinese Medicine Molecular Chemistry, the author's team designed and developed four series of innovative drugs. Inspired by the hundred years of chromatography history and thousands of years of TCM culture, the future development of chromatographic technology is expected. Furthermore, the mechanisms of TCM in medical healthcare, prevention, and treatment of diseases are likely be explained through chromatography, leading to a new strategy to realize the molecularization and digitalization of TCM, which is beneficial to the development of original new drugs.","Jia, Pu; Bian, Yangyang; Bai, Yajun; Meng, Xue; Gao, Shuomo; Zhao, Ye; Cai, Yujie; Zheng, Xiaohui",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,https://doi.org/10.3724/sp.j.1123.2021.06021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34486834/,88

METHODS From 0 to 12 months, n = 20 females and 3 males; from 12 to 24 months, n = 42 females and 7 males. Paired t-tests and GLM repeated measures examined changes in TAT, SAT, VAT, and IMAT at 12 and 24 months, with sex and age as covariates. RESULTS Changes from 0 to 12 months included weight (-41.9 ± 12.1 kg; -36%), TAT (-33.5 ± 9.6 kg; -56%), SAT (-29.2 ± 8.2 kg; -55%), VAT (-3.3 ± 1.6 kg; -73%), and IMAT (-0.99 ± 0.68 kg; -50%), all P < 0.001. In females, from 12 to 24 months, despite relative weight stability (-1.8 ± 6.5 kg, -2%; P = 0.085), VAT (-0.5 ± 0.7 kg; -30%; P < 0.001) and IMAT (-0.2 ± 0.4 kg; -14%; P = 0.012) decreased further. In males, from 12 to 24 months, weight increased (5.1 ± 5.2 kg; 6%; P = 0.04) with no significant changes in TAT or sub-depots.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes according to age categories. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 6314 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February and 30 June 2020 in the Paris metropolitan area, France; follow-up was recorded until 30 September 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) The main outcome was a composite outcome of mortality and orotracheal intubation in subjects with diabetes compared with subjects without diabetes, after adjustment for confounding variables and according to age categories. RESULTS Diabetes was recorded in 39% of subjects. Main outcome was higher in patients with diabetes, independently of confounding variables (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13 [1.03-1.24]) and increased with age in individuals without diabetes, from 23% for those <50 to 35% for those >80 years but reached a plateau after 70 years in those with diabetes. In direct comparison between patients with and without diabetes, diabetes-associated risk was inversely proportional to age, highest in <50 years and similar after 70 years. Similarly, mortality was higher in patients with diabetes (26%) than in those without diabetes (22%, P < 0.001), but adjusted HR for diabetes was significant only in patients younger than age 50 years (HR 1.81 [1.14-2.87]). CONCLUSIONS Diabetes should be considered as an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in young adults more so than in older adults, especially for individuals younger than 70 years.","Diedisheim, Marc; Dancoisne, Etienne; Gautier, Jean-François; Larger, Etienne; Cosson, Emmanuel; Fève, Bruno; Chanson, Philippe; Czernichow, Sébastien; Tatulashvili, Sopio; Raffin-Sanson, Marie-Laure; Sallah, Kankoé; Bourgeon, Muriel; Ajzenberg, Christiane; Hartemann, Agnès; Daniel, Christel; Moreau, Thomas; Roussel, Ronan; Potier, Louis",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgab393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406396/,88

OBJECTIVE To determine the proportion of patients eligible for endovascular therapy. METHODS In this single center retrospective cohort study, we identified patients with acute ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion (LVO) from January 2014 to December 2015. Selection criteria including LVO location, Alberta stroke program early computed tomography score (ASPECTS) range, hospital arrival time, and the use of intravenous thrombolysis were applied to calculate proportions of patients eligible for endovascular therapy. RESULTS Of 989 patients with acute ischemic stroke, LVO was identified in 224 (23%) cases. Eighty-four percent of patients admitted within 6 h, 75% of patients admitted within 6 to 12 h, and 77% of patients with M1 and internal carotid artery occlusions admitted within 12 to 24 h had favorable ASPECTS for thrombectomy, defined as ASPECTS ≥ 6. Severity of NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) was predictive of favorable ASPECTS (odds ratio [OR] 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.74; P = .014 for NIHSS > 10 and OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.80; P = .014 for NIHSS > 20), whereas time of hospital arrival was not (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.76-4.03; P = .26). Using all class I, Level of Evidence A American Heart Association guidelines criteria, 4% of patients with acute ischemic stroke were eligible for endovascular therapy. Up to 20% of patients were eligible for endovascular therapy with less restrictive criteria (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). CONCLUSION Depending on the sets of selection criteria, between 4% (the most restrictive criteria) and 20% (the least restrictive criteria) of patients with LVO are potentially eligible for endovascular therapy.","Mokin, Maxim; Pendurthi, Aparna; Ljubimov, Vladimir; Burgin, William S; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Primiani, Christopher T",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29106687/,88
70399,Complete genome analysis of three novel picornaviruses from diverse bat species.,2011,"The hallmarks of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), an active and regulated process involving the creation of calcium nodules, lipoprotein accumulation, and chronic inflammation, are the significant changes that occur in the composition, organization, and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the aortic valve (AV). Most research regarding CAVD is based on experiments using two-dimensional (2D) cell culture or artificially created three-dimensional (3D) environments of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Because the valvular ECM has a powerful influence in regulating pathological events, we developed an in vitro AV tissue culture model, which is more closely able to mimic natural conditions to study cellular responses underlying CAVD. AV leaflets, isolated from the hearts of 6-8-month-old sheep, were fixed with needles on silicon rubber rings to achieve passive tension and treated in vitro under pro-degenerative and pro-calcifying conditions. The degeneration of AV leaflets progressed over time, commencing with the first visible calcified domains after 14 d and winding up with the distinct formation of calcium nodules, heightened stiffness, and clear disruption of the ECM after 56 d. Both the expression of pro-degenerative genes and the myofibroblastic differentiation of VICs were altered in AV leaflets compared to that in VIC cultures. In this study, we have established an easily applicable, reproducible, and cost-effective in vitro AV tissue culture model to study pathological mechanisms underlying CAVD. The valvular ECM and realistic VIC-VEC interactions mimic natural conditions more closely than VIC cultures or 3D environments. The application of various culture conditions enables the examination of different pathological mechanisms underlying CAVD and could lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to VIC degeneration and AS. Our model provides a valuable tool to study the complex pathobiology of CAVD and can be used to identify potential therapeutic targets for slowing disease progression.","Weber, Andreas; Pfaff, Melissa; Schöttler, Friederike; Schmidt, Vera; Lichtenberg, Artur; Akhyari, Payam",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9050474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925890/,88

In about one third of patients, epilepsy is uncontrolled with current medications, leaving a vast need for improved therapies. The causes of epilepsy are diverse and not always known but one gene mutated in a small subpopulation of patients is phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Moreover, focal cortical dysplasia, which constitutes a large fraction of refractory epilepsies, has been associated with signaling defects downstream of PTEN. So far, most preclinical attempts to reverse PTEN deficiency-associated neurological deficits have focused on mTOR, a signaling hub several steps downstream of PTEN. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), by contrast, are the direct enzymatic counteractors of PTEN, and thus may be alternative treatment targets. PI3K activity is mediated by four different PI3K catalytic isoforms. Studies in cancer, where PTEN is commonly mutated, have demonstrated that inhibition of only one isoform, p110β, reduces progression of PTEN-deficient tumors. Importantly, inhibition of a single PI3K isoform leaves critical functions of general PI3K signaling throughout the body intact. Here, we show that this disease mechanism-targeted strategy borrowed from cancer research rescues or ameliorates neuronal phenotypes in male and female mice with neuron-specific PTEN deficiency. These phenotypes include cell signaling defects, protein synthesis aberrations, seizures, and cortical dysplasia. Of note, p110β is also dysregulated and a promising treatment target in the intellectual disability Fragile X syndrome, pointing towards a shared biological mechanism that is therapeutically targetable in neurodevelopmental disorders of different etiologies. Overall, this work advocates for further assessment of p110β inhibition not only in PTEN deficiency-associated neurodevelopmental diseases but also other brain disorders characterized by defects in the PI3K/mTOR pathway.","White, Angela R; Tiwari, Durgesh; MacLeod, Molly C; Danzer, Steve C; Gross, Christina",Neurobiology of disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32712265/,88

Little is known, however, about the utility of re-endoscopy. METHODS A retrospective review of 342 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgical resection for CRC from January 2008 to December 2011 was performed. Patients were included if the initial endoscopist was different than the operating surgeon. A localization error was recorded if the final tumor location identified during surgery was in a different anatomical segment than that identified by endoscopy. The Chi-squared test was used to compare categorical variables. An error rate with a 95% confidence interval was obtained using the exact binomial distribution. RESULTS 298 patients were identified, 118 (39.6%) of whom also underwent a preoperative re-endoscopy by the operating surgeon or partner. Nineteen patients had incorrect tumor localization at initial endoscopy, equivalent to a 6.4% error rate (95% CI 3.88-9.78). In comparison, there were two localization errors on re-endoscopy, 1.69% (95% CI 0.21-6.00). Re-endoscopy was found to be protective against localization errors (P < 0.05), correcting 10 of the 12 errors made at the initial endoscopy. The sensitivity of re-endoscopy as a diagnostic tool to detect errors was 83% with a corresponding specificity of 100%. The overall accuracy of re-endoscopy in preventing endoscopic localization errors was 92% (95% CI 81-100). CONCLUSIONS There is a small but important localization error rate in preoperative endoscopic evaluation of colorectal tumors. Re-endoscopy appears to be safe and may potentially identify and correct these errors and help with preoperative planning at the expense of delaying surgery. Further research is necessary to find ways to improve localization and identify which patients would benefit from re-endoscopy.","Saleh, Fady; Abbasi, Thamer Al; Cleghorn, Michelle; Jimenez, M Carolina; Jackson, Timothy D; Okrainec, Allan; Quereshy, Fayez A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3969-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480606/,88

METHODS A system combining flocked swabs to recover viruses dried onto stainless steel carriers and gel filtration to eliminate cytotoxic products has been developed to study the virucidal effect of a quaternary ammonium-based disinfectant towards herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) and feline calicivirus F9 (FCV). The recovery of FCV has been estimated by RT real-time PCR. RESULTS HSV-1, CVB4 and FCV had a titer over 10(4) TCID50 · ml(-1) after 2 h drying and were recovered from the carriers using flocked swabs. HSV-1 was inactivated in suspension and on stainless steel carriers by the disinfectant (a reduction factor of 4 and 2.83 log, respectively) whereas CVB4 was resistant. The reduction of infectious titer was moderate, 1.5 log in 30 min, when FCV was in suspension, whereas it was up to 4 log in 10 min when the virus was dried on a carrier. Dried FCV was efficiently recovered from carriers as demonstrated by RT real-time PCR. CONCLUSION A non-enveloped virus, FCV, applied on a surface, but not in suspension, was inactivated by a quaternary ammonium-based disinfectant.

Although anti-inflammatory therapies are available to treat the problem, very often, these treatments cause immunosuppression. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells serves as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to delineate a SARS-CoV-2-specific anti-inflammatory molecule, we designed a hexapeptide corresponding to the spike S1-interacting domain of ACE2 receptor (SPIDAR) that inhibited the expression of proinflammatory molecules in human A549 lung cells induced by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, but not vesicular stomatitis virus. Accordingly, wild-type (wt), but not mutated (m), SPIDAR inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced activation of NF-κB and expression of IL-6 and IL-1β in human lung cells. However, wtSPIDAR remained unable to reduce activation of NF-κB and expression of proinflammatory molecules in lungs cells induced by TNF-α, HIV-1 Tat, and viral dsRNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, indicating the specificity of the effect. The wtSPIDAR, but not mutated SPIDAR, also hindered the association between ACE2 and spike S1 of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibited the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, but not vesicular stomatitis virus, into human ACE2-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Moreover, intranasal treatment with wtSPIDAR, but not mutated SPIDAR, inhibited lung activation of NF-κB, protected lungs, reduced fever, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice. Therefore, selective targeting of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-to-ACE2 interaction by wtSPIDAR may be beneficial for coronavirus disease 2019.","Paidi, Ramesh K; Jana, Malabendu; Mishra, Rama K; Dutta, Debashis; Pahan, Kalipada",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645689/,88

The patient was given a presumptive diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and was managed conservatively with successful resolution of AHRF and stabilisation of haemoglobin level. Seven days after admission, she passed away due to subsequent complications; hence, follow-up G6PD level could not be obtained. Haemolytic anaemia and methemoglobinemia in the setting of recent rasburicase administration should raise clinical suspicion for G6PD deficiency. In non-emergent cases, patients should be screened prior to receiving rasburicase regardless of risk factors.

We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1β in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that acute pain and CCI-induced chronic pain might aggravate postoperative cognitive dysfunction via neurotransmitters and by changing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-6.","Ding, Xian; Gao, Xiang; Wang, Zhichun; Jiang, Xuliang; Lu, Shunmei; Xu, Jingjing; Qin, Guowei; Gu, Zhengfeng; Huang, Dongxiao",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-020-01673-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901371/,88

76913,Interaction between TIM-1 and NPC1 Is Important for Cellular Entry of Ebola Virus.,2015,"Enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71) has been associated with severe neurological forms of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). EV-A71 infects motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) to invade the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigate the role of peripherin (PRPH) during EV-A71 infection, a type III intermediate neurofilament involved in neurodegenerative conditions. In mice infected with EV-A71, PRPH co-localizes with viral particles in the muscles at NMJs and in the spinal cord. In motor neuron-like and neuroblastoma cell lines, surface-expressed PRPH facilitates viral entry, while intracellular PRPH influences viral genome replication through interactions with structural and non-structural viral components. Importantly, PRPH does not play a role during infection with coxsackievirus A16, another causative agent of HFMD rarely associated with neurological complications, suggesting that EV-A71 ability to exploit PRPH represents a unique attribute for successful CNS invasion. Finally, we show that EV-A71 also exploits some of the many PRPH-interacting partners. Of these, small GTP-binding protein Rac1 represents a potential druggable host target to limit neuroinvasion of EV-A71.","Lim, Ze Qin; Ng, Qing Yong; Oo, Yukei; Chu, Justin Jang Hann; Ng, Shi Yan; Sze, Siu Kwan; Alonso, Sylvie",EMBO reports,https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202051777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871166/,88

METHODS DIA-RAMADAN was a real-world, observational, international, non-comparative study. The global study population was divided into three regional subgroups, with data gathered at inclusion 6-8 weeks prior to Ramadan (V0), during Ramadan (4.5 weeks) and 4-6 weeks after Ramadan (V1). Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients reporting ≥ 1 symptomatic hypoglycaemic events (HE), which were collected using a patient diary along with other adverse events. RESULTS Patient numbers from the three regions were n = 564 (46.5%; Indian sub-continent), n = 354 (29.1%; Middle East) and n = 296 (24.4%; South-East Asia). Patient baseline characteristics, demographics, fasting habits and antidiabetic treatments varied between regions. There were similar proportions of symptomatic HE between regions, with no severe HE.

77239,Evolution and diversity of the human hepatitis d virus genome.,2010,"Dry eye disease (DED) is among the most common eye diseases and is becoming increasingly prevalent. Its symptoms cause a long-term decline in patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL). Inconsistencies often occur between the clinical findings and the subjective symptoms of DED. Therefore, a holistic, balanced, and quantitative evaluation of the subjective symptoms and HRQL using patient-reported outcome questionnaires, in addition to clinical findings, is crucial for accurate DED assessment in patients. This paper reviewed the characteristics of current dry eye questionnaires, including their objectives, number of questions, inclusion of HRQL-related items, and whether they were properly evaluated for psychometric properties. Twenty-four questionnaires were identified; among them, the following six questionnaires that included items assessing HRQL and were properly evaluated for psychometric properties are recommended: the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Impact of Dry Eye in Everyday Life, Dry Eye-Related Quality-of-life Score, University of North Carolina Dry Eye Management Scale, Chinese version of Dry Eye-Related Quality of Life, and 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire. Dry eye questionnaires have different objectives and are available in different languages. Therefore, medical practitioners should confirm the characteristics of applicable questionnaires before selecting the most appropriate ones.","Okumura, Yuichi; Inomata, Takenori; Iwata, Nanami; Sung, Jaemyoung; Fujimoto, Keiichi; Fujio, Kenta; Midorikawa-Inomata, Akie; Miura, Maria; Akasaki, Yasutsugu; Murakami, Akira",Diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10080559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764273/,88
77447,A virion-associated protein kinase induces apoptosis.,2011,"This commentary describes insights from Star Trek's fictional television series to understand how state and non-state actors address conflicts of interest (COIs) through global nutrition governance. I examine the findings of Ralston and colleagues for 44 state and non-state actors who responded to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) consultation for a COI risk-assessment tool, developed for member states to engage effectively with non-state actors to address malnutrition in all forms. Star Trek reveals that actor engagement is inevitable in a shared universe. The Prime Directive is a non-interference principle reflecting a moral commitment to reduce harm, respect autonomy and protect rights. Engagement principles are relevant to all actors who influence nutrition policies and programs, and must be held accountable when their actions undermine healthy and sustainable food systems. Certain actors use COI to justify non-engagement with commercial actors yet competing interests, biases, corruption and regulatory capture are distinct challenges to manage. Finally, Star Trek's characters serve as allegories to understand actors' motives and actions to promote healthy and sustainable food systems. Unlike non-state actors, states are legally required to achieve their commitments and targets in the United Nations' (UN) Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 Agenda.","Kraak, Vivica I",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32861233/,88

For example, Nidovirales and Flaviviridae subvert the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for their replication. However, the absence of conventional ER and secretory pathway markers in virus-induced ER-derived membranes has for a long time hampered a thorough understanding of their biogenesis. Recent reports highlight the analogies between mouse hepatitis virus-, equine arteritis virus-, and Japanese encephalitis virus-induced replication platforms and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) tuning vesicles (or EDEMosomes) that display nonlipidated LC3 at their cytosolic face and segregate the ERAD factors EDEM1, OS-9, and SEL1L from the ER lumen. In this Gem, we briefly summarize the current knowledge on ERAD tuning pathways and how they might be hijacked for viral genome replication. As ERAD tuning components, such as SEL1L and nonlipidated LC3, appear to contribute to viral infection, these cellular pathways represent novel candidate drug targets to combat positive-strand RNA viruses.","Noack, Julia; Bernasconi, Riccardo; Molinari, Maurizio",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00801-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24990995/,88
78225,Uncoupling of Protease trans-Cleavage and Helicase Activities in Pestivirus NS3.,2017,"The central nervous system is simply divided into two distinct anatomical regions based on the color of tissues, i.e. the gray and white matter. The gray matter is composed of neuronal cell bodies, glial cells, dendrites, immune cells, and the vascular system, while the white matter is composed of concentrated myelinated axonal fibers extending from neuronal soma and glial cells, such as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. As neuronal cell bodies are located in the gray matter, great attention has been focused mainly on the gray matter regarding the understanding of the functions of the brain throughout the neurophysiological areas, leading to a scenario in which the function of the white matter is relatively underestimated or has not received much attention. However, increasing evidence shows that the white matter plays highly significant and pivotal functions in the brain based on the fact that its abnormalities are associated with numerous neurological diseases. In this review, we will broadly discuss the pathways and functions of myelination, which is one of the main processes that modulate the functions of the white matter, as well as the manner in which its abnormalities are related to neurological disorders.","Bae, Han-Gyu; Kim, Tai Kyoung; Suk, Ho Young; Jung, Sangyoung; Jo, Dong-Gyu",Archives of pharmacal research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12272-020-01270-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975736/,88

However, it is unknown for other anthropometric indexes in young adults. METHODS A cross-sectional study examined the relationships in 325 military men and women, aged 20-45 years in Taiwan. Anthropometric indexes included BMI, waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). The severity of localized periodontitis was defined as healthy (N = 42), stage I (initial) (N = 228) and stage II/III (moderate/severe) (N = 55) according to the 2017 Periodontal Diseases Classification. Smooth curve fitting and multiple logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, betel nut consumption and smoking were used to determine the threshold effect between various anthropometric and the risk of localized stage II/III periodontitis. RESULTS In the spline smoothing plot, the turning points for BMI, WC and WHtR were 26.1 kg/m2 , 90.0 cm, and 0.50, respectively, and a J-shaped relationship was found for BMI (the likelihood ratio test, p <0.001). In the multiple logistic regressions, BMI ≥27.0 kg/m2 , WC ≥90.0 cm and WHtR ≥0.50 were associated with higher risk of localized stage II/III periodontitis than their counterparts (24.0-26.9 kg/m2 for BMI) (odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals: 4.16 (1.39, 12.49), 2.65 (1.01, 7.11) and 2.95 (1.20, 7.24), respectively; all p-values <0.05). However, the risk for BMI <24.0 kg/m2 was not significant (OR: 1.47 (0.47, 4.54)). CONCLUSION In young adults, obesity defined by various anthropometrics was consistently associated with localized stage II/III periodontitis and a J-shaped association was suggestive for BMI.

78933,Precise triggering and chemical control of single-virus fusion within endosomes.,2020-10-28,"BACKGROUND Routine radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an incompetent perforator vein (IPV) using the standard treatment protocol at 85°C has a treatment time of 6 minutes. To make treatment time more efficient, we sought to determine the effect of a shortened protocol for radiofrequency stylet (RFS) ablation by comparing the early success using three different temperatures: 85°C, 90°C, and 95°C. METHODS A retrospective study examined 642 procedures of IPV closures in 255 patients with varying degrees of venous insufficiency treated with RFA from 2009 to 2015. The Covidien (Mansfield, Mass) RFA system allows the operator to regulate temperature and allows increments in temperature of the RFS to 85°C, 90°C, and 95°C. The RFS probe was angled at four 90-degree angles at the mentioned temperatures with a shorter treatment time at 6, 4, and 3 minutes, respectively. The three different treatment protocols were compared. All patients had comparative preoperative and postoperative duplex ultrasound scans. Postoperative duplex ultrasound scans were performed 3 to 7 days after the procedure. Successful obliteration was defined as lack of color flow on postoperative duplex ultrasound scanning. Clinical correlation with age, gender, laterality, presenting symptoms (Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology [CEAP] classification), location, and vein diameter was also performed. RESULTS Of the 255 patients who underwent RFS ablation, 138 were female, with a mean age of 65 years (standard deviation, ±14.6 years). These patients had CEAP presentations from C1 to C6 (0 C1, 1 C2, 57 C3, 118 C4, 4 C5, 75 C6). The location of the 642 IPVs was distributed as 472 in the calf and 170 in the ankle; 322 of these procedures were performed on the right leg. Use of a shortened protocol had no significant effect on the early obliteration rates with the 85°C, 90°C, and 95°C protocols, which were 66.1%, 61.8%, and 67.1%, respectively. Significant correlation was seen between location of targeted vein and successful obliteration (P < .001). There was a borderline inverse linear association between higher stylet temperature and successful obliteration in the proximal calf at 85°C. After accounting for within-patient correlation, the middle and distal calf continued to show higher nonobliteration compared with the ankle. No clinical correlation with age, gender, laterality, presenting symptoms of CEAP, or vein diameter was observed. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that shortening the protocol time for RFA of the perforator did not make a significant difference in the early success rate, regardless of the temperature. The overall early success rate is still low (65.1%). RFA of perforator veins has a higher successful closure rate in proximal calf and ankle areas compared with the middle and distal calf.","Aurshina, Afsha; Hingorani, Anil; Blumberg, Sheila; Alsheekh, Ahmad; Marks, Natalie; Hingorani, Amrit; Iadagarova, Eleanor; Ascher, Enrico",Journal of vascular surgery.

However, established definitions of vulnerability typically involve only static concepts that are limited to measurement of system characteristics. Advancements in risk modeling, combined with the dynamic nature of data availability, and processing call for the need to understand the various dimensions and time-dependent properties of vulnerability within risk-informed decision making. There is need to: (1) Understand and classify aspects of vulnerability that exist in various systems, such as related to engineering, business, and healthcare, while recognizing both properties of the system and associated knowledge, (2) reconcile these definitions of vulnerabilities with existing concepts, such as sensitivity analysis and fragility, and (3) explore the implications of various types of vulnerability on risk management decisions. The main contributions of this work include classifying dynamic characteristics of system vulnerability and leveraging information about the multidimensional properties of vulnerability within risk management decisions that apply to a collection of risk events. As a proof of concept, we illustrate the vulnerability classification on the COVID-19 pandemic.

81467,Diagnostic uncertainty of herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease and its impact on national enterovirus syndromic monitoring.,2016,"BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a new minimally invasive technique, which has been developed to minimize the surgical access trauma. For colorectal resection, the access trauma can be limited to the one incision, which is needed for specimen extraction anyways, but dissection might be more demanding than in multiport laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of SILS for the treatment of diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. METHODS Between July 2009 and December 2013, a total of 329 consecutive patients with intended SILS sigmoid colectomy for complicated or frequently recurring diverticulitis were studied. Clinical data were collected in a prospective database. Telephone follow-ups were performed to evaluate long-term morbidity and quality of life. RESULTS Of the 329 patients (139 male) with intended SILS sigmoid colectomy, 309 were successfully operated on in SILS technique, while 20 (6.1%) were converted to open surgery. The mean duration of surgery was 153.5 (65-434) min. Total morbidity rate was 18.3%. Anastomotic leakage was the most serious complication occurring in 13 patients (leak rate 4%) with one consecutive death (mortality rate 0.3%). Quality of life had significantly improved 6 months after surgery in comparison with the preoperative value. At a mean follow-up of 18.6 months, 16 patients (4.9%) had incisional hernia and one patient had recurrent diverticulitis. CONCLUSION In spite of almost 5% incisional hernia 6 months after surgery, single-incision sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis is feasible and save and is therefore an alternative to multiport laparoscopic surgery. Further trials are necessary to evaluate its benefits over multiport laparoscopic surgery.","Vestweber, Boris; Vestweber, Karl-Heinz; Paul, Claudia; Rink, Andreas D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4160-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25829061/,88

Other molecular imaging methods may be needed for evaluation of this malignancy. As ILC is nearly always (95%) estrogen receptor (ER) positive, ER-targeting PET tracers such as 16α-[18F]-fluoroestradiol ([18F]FES) may have value. We reviewed prospective trials at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) utilizing [18F]FES PET/CT to evaluate metastatic ILC patients with synchronous [18F]FDG and [18F]FES PET/CT imaging, which allowed a head-to-head comparison of these two PET tracers. Methods: Six prospective clinical trials utilizing [18F]FES PET/CT in patients with metastatic breast cancer were performed at MSK from 2008-2019. These trials included 92 patients, of which 14 (15%) were of ILC histology. Seven of 14 patients with ILC had an [18F]FDG PET/CT performed within 5 weeks of the research [18F]FES PET/CT and no intervening change in management. For these 7 patients, the [18F]FES and [18F]FDG PET/CT studies were analyzed to determine the total number of tracer avid lesions, organ systems of involvement, and SUVmax of each organ system for both tracers. Results: In the seven comparable pairs of scans, there were a total of 254 [18F]FES-avid lesions (SUVmax 2.6 to 17.9) and 111 [18F]FDG-avid lesions (SUVmax 3.3 to 9.9) suspicious for malignancy. For 5 of 7 (71%) of ILC patients, [18F]FES PET/CT detected more metastatic lesions than [18F]FDG PET/CT. In the same 5 of 7 patients, the SUVmax of [18F]FES-avid lesions was greater than the SUVmax of [18F]FDG-avid lesions. One patient had [18F]FES avid metastases with no corresponding [18F]FDG avid metastases. There were no patients with [18F]FDG avid distant metastases without [18F]FES avid distant metastases, although in one patient liver metastases were evident on [18F]FDG but not [18F]FES PET. Conclusion: [18F]FES PET/CT compared favorably with [18F]FDG PET/CT for detection of metastases in patients with metastatic ILC. Larger prospective trials of [18F]FES PET/CT in ILC should be considered to evaluate ER-targeted imaging for clinical value in patients with this histology of breast cancer.","Ulaner, Gary A; Jhaveri, Komal; Chardarlapaty, Sarat; Hatzoglou, Vaios; Riedl, Christopher; Lewis, Jason S; Mauguen, Andrey","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.247882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680923/,88

It leads to significant morbidity and associated health care costs, from readmissions, reoperations, and subsequent poor clinical outcomes. Complications associated with SSI following spine surgery include pseudarthrosis, neurological deterioration, sepsis, and death. Its management can be very challenging. The diagnosis of SSI involves the interpretation of combined clinical, laboratory, and occasionally radiologic findings. Most infections can be treated with an appropriate course of antibiotics and bracing if required. Surgical intervention is usually reserved for infections resistant to medical management, the need for open biopsy/culture, evolving spinal instability or deformity, and neurologic deficit or deterioration. A thorough knowledge of associated risk factors is required and patients should be stratified for risk preoperatively. The multifaceted approach of risk stratification, early diagnosis and effective treatment, is essential for successful prevention and effective treatment and crucial for a satisfactory outcome.","Butler, Joseph S; Wagner, Scott C; Morrissey, Patrick B; Kaye, Ian D; Sebastian, Arjun S; Schroeder, Gregory D; Radcliff, Kristen; Vaccaro, Alexander R",Clinical spine surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/bsd.0000000000000635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29578875/,88

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative importance of several family environment variables (food availability and accessibility, modelling of food consumption, parenting style, and family mealtime environment) in predicting children's consumption of fruit and vegetables in a sample of pre-school children from low income, predominantly ethnic minority families. Two hundred and twenty-nine primary caregivers and their pre-school children were recruited from Head Start programmes in New York and New Jersey. Caregivers gave their consent to the study, completed a series of paper and pencil questionnaires, and had both their height and weight and their children's height and weight measured. Higher availability, accessibility, and parental modelling were associated with higher consumption of fruit and vegetables in children. Availability and Accessibility were the best predictors, but Parental Modelling significantly enhanced prediction over the other variables. Public health interventions should be geared toward helping poorer families increase the availability of fruit and vegetables in their homes, advising parents on how to make them accessible, and encouraging parents to model their consumption.

The optimal doping ratio of AgBr was 10wt% by degrading 20 mg/L of Reactive Blue 19 (RB19) under visible light (λ>420 nm), and 10wt%AgBr/BiPO4/g-C3N4 degraded 20 mg/L of RB19 to 2.59% at 40 min, which is ascribed to synergistic effects at the interface of AgBr, BiPO4 and g-C3N4. The effect of catalyst dosage, initial concentration and initial pH of RB19 solution on photocatalytic efficiency was investigated. Four cycles of experiments were conducted. Finally, through the trapping experiment, we found that the main active factor for degrading RB19 in the photocatalytic process is O2-.

85045,Mass spectrometric determination of disulfide bonds in the biologically active recombinant HBx protein of hepatitis B virus.,2014,"AIM To describe the use of antimicrobial drugs for food animals in New Zealand, based on sales data reported to government for 2005-2018, to provide a baseline to determine the success of measures to reduce antimicrobial use for food animals and to compare usage to selected European countries. METHODS Data were sourced from official government and industry reports to update previous estimates of use (as amount sold) of antimicrobial products applied to animals in New Zealand. The data included antimicrobial sales and animal populations, weighted where appropriate by breed and age class. Antimicrobial use was estimated based on the amount of active ingredient sold, per kg of animal biomass standardised to the probable weight at time of treatment or lifetime average but not slaughter weight (population correction unit; PCU). New Zealand data for 2017 and 2018 were adjusted to account only for antimicrobials used for farm animals by discounting horticulture use, companion animal use and export. RESULTS Between 2014 and 2018 the estimated usage of antimicrobials in animals flattened to a 5-year rolling average of 10.40 mg/PCU. New data on use for companion animals and on exports of zinc bacitracin and tylosin, included previously in the gross New Zealand values, allow a more refined estimate of use of antimicrobials in food animals of 10.21 mg/PCU in 2018, the third lowest rate of use for countries reporting by the same methodology. The intensive industries of pigs and poultry combined use more than 500 mg/PCU whereas the extensive red meat and dairy industries use an estimated 6.25 mg/PCU. New Zealand uses proportionally more cephalosporins and macrolides, two of the critically important antimicrobial groups, when compared with European countries, but less quinolones. The most obvious difference is the extensive use of zinc bacitracin and tylosin fed to pigs and poultry in New Zealand but not in the European Union. CONCLUSIONS Use of antimicrobials in food animals has stabilised to a rate of approximately 10.2 mg/PCU. This baseline should be used by the animal health industry to measure future success in its efforts to reduce and make more refined use of antimicrobial drugs as New Zealand works to deliver the government's Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan. High rates of use of zinc bacitracin and some critically important macrolides represent clear targets in attempts to reduce usage.

From 2017 to 2020, we analyzed 1675 samples using an accredited HPLC method with fluorescence detection. We found out 295 samples (17.6%) were contaminated by aflatoxin B1, 204 by aflatoxins B/G (12.2%), while 75 (4.5%) resulted non-compliant to maximum limits set by the European Union law. Most of the batches tested were unprocessed food; the distribution of contamination levels, incidence of non-compliant samples, inference for different kinds of food are reported. The study focuses on the food more susceptible to contamination by aflatoxins; nuts are the food more controlled, showing the higher number of non-compliant samples. Our study confirms that pistachio nuts, hazelnuts and almonds are the major sources of exposure for consumers. Still, other products, such as chili pepper and Brazil nuts, need to get more information about their contamination levels. The study's findings are discussed in the perspective of the last opinion by EFSA about chronic exposure to aflatoxins. A case study to evaluate not compliance of a composed food to the European Union law is reported.","Gallo, Pasquale; Imbimbo, Samantha; Alvino, Silvana; Castellano, Vincenzo; Arace, Olga; Soprano, Vittorio; Esposito, Mauro; Serpe, Francesco Paolo; Sansone, Donato",Toxins,https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins13060368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067264/,88

Conversely, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) have been suggested to reduce recurrence rates and improve survival in this patient group. AIM To clarify the potential benefit of mTOR-inhibitors in HCC transplant patients by comparing recurrence and survival outcomes with calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. The inclusion criteria were observational or interventional studies reporting the effect of early-initiated (<6 months post-transplant) mTOR-inhibitor-based immunosuppression on survival or tumour recurrence in patients transplanted with HCC, compared to a control of calcineurin-inhibitor-based therapy. RESULTS Meta-analysis demonstrated that compared with calcineurin-inhibitor controls, recurrence-free-survival was significantly increased with mTOR-inhibitor-based therapy at 1-year (Risk-Ratio (RR): 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18) and 3-years (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21) post-transplant, with a nonsignificant increase at 5-years (RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.99-1.35). Overall survival was improved at 1-year (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.12), 3-years (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.02-1.19), and 5-years (RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29). Recurrence-rate was lower in the mTOR-inhibitor arm (RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.82), with no significant increase in acute rejection (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.94-1.28). CONCLUSIONS mTOR-inhibitor-based immunosuppression may be a preferable option in patients transplanted with HCC. It improves recurrence-free-survival over at least three years and reduces the recurrence rate compared with standard calcineurin-inhibitor-based therapy, with no significant increase in the rate of acute rejection. Future research should clarify the effect in higher vs lower risk cohorts.","Grigg, Sam E; Sarri, Gino L; Gow, Paul J; Yeomans, Neville D",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.15253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989721/,88

We herein describe a the clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) features of a child with early-onset DEE caused by the novel KCNQ2 p.G310S variant. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation induces loss-of-function effects on the currents produced by channels incorporating mutant subunits; these effects were counteracted by the selective Kv7 opener retigabine and by gabapentin, a recently described Kv7 activator. Given these data, the patient started treatment with gabapentin, showing a rapid and sustained clinical and EEG improvement over the following months. Overall, these results suggest that gabapentin can be regarded as a precision therapy for DEEs due to KCNQ2 loss-of-function mutations.","Soldovieri, Maria Virginia; Freri, Elena; Ambrosino, Paolo; Rivolta, Ilaria; Mosca, Ilaria; Binda, Anna; Murano, Carmen; Ragona, Francesca; Canafoglia, Laura; Vannicola, Chiara; Solazzi, Roberta; Granata, Tiziana; Castellotti, Barbara; Messina, Giuliana; Gellera, Cinzia; Labalme, Audrey; Lesca, Gaetan; DiFrancesco, Jacopo C; Taglialatela, Maurizio",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942014/,88

An endovascular approach with primary stenting or provisional stenting has become the primary modality of revascularization of subclavian artery stenosis. In-stent restenosis can be treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or repeat stenting and although stents offer superior long-term patency over balloon angioplasty alone for de novo lesions, there are no data regarding primary versus provisional stenting in subclavian in-stent restenosis. Here we describe a case of subclavian in-stent restenosis treated with just balloon angioplasty and demonstrate that provisional stenting with angioplasty alone when the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty results are excellent is a reasonable alternative to primary stent placement for subclavian in-stent restenosis.","Verma, Anil; Reilly, John P; White, Christopher J",Vascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1358863x13509129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24172229/,88

88363,Highlight - viruses and signaling.,2008,"Viruses of the family Coronaviridae have recently emerged through zoonotic transmission to become serious human pathogens. The pathogenic agent responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is a member of this large family of positive-strand RNA viruses that cause a spectrum of disease in humans, other mammals, and birds. Since the publicized outbreaks of SARS in China and Canada in 2002-2003, significant efforts successfully identified the causative agent, host cell receptor(s), and many of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS. With this greater understanding of SARS-CoV biology, many researchers have sought to identify agents for the treatment of SARS. Here we report the utility of the potent antiviral protein griffithsin (GRFT) in the prevention of SARS-CoV infection both in vitro and in vivo. We also show that GRFT specifically binds to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and inhibits viral entry. In addition, we report the activity of GRFT against a variety of additional coronaviruses that infect humans, other mammals, and birds. Finally, we show that GRFT treatment has a positive effect on morbidity and mortality in a lethal infection model using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV and also specifically inhibits deleterious aspects of the host immunological response to SARS infection in mammals.","O'Keefe, Barry R; Giomarelli, Barbara; Barnard, Dale L; Shenoy, Shilpa R; Chan, Paul K S; McMahon, James B; Palmer, Kenneth E; Barnett, Brian W; Meyerholz, David K; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine L; McCray, Paul B",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02322-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032190/,88

Consecutive patients with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from blood samples between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 were included. For each case, three non-ESBL-producing controls matching for date of detection and bacterial species were identified. The main outcome measure was the ability to accurately predict infection with ESBL-PE by measures of discrimination and calibration.ResultsOverall, 376 patients (94 patients, 282 controls) were analysed. Performance measures for prediction of ESBL-PE infection of both prediction models indicate adequate measures of calibration, but poor discrimination (area under receiver-operating curve: 0.627 and 0.651). History of ESBL-PE colonisation or infection was the single most predictive independent risk factor for ESBL-PE infection with high specificity (97%), low sensitivity (34%) and balanced positive and negative predictive values (80% and 82%).ConclusionsApplying published prediction models to institutions these were not derived from, may result in substantial misclassification of patients considered as being at risk, potentially leading to wrong allocation of antibiotic treatment, negatively affecting patient outcomes and overall resistance rates in the long term.

This study analyzes the true impact of RL length by comparing the long-term outcomes of proximal RYGB (PRYGB) and very-very long limb RYGB (VVLL-RYGB). METHODS RL length in PRYGB was 150 cm. In VVLL-RYGB, common channel length was 100 cm. In both groups, biliopancreatic limbs measured 50-60 cm, resulting in equal total alimentary limb lengths. To adjust for pre-operative differences between groups, and to predict the long-term outcome, a mixed model analysis was performed. RESULTS Two hundred thirty-two patients with VVLL-RYGB (73.7% female, mean age 41.1 ± 10 years, initial BMI 45.8 ± 6.3 kg/m2) and 223 with PRYGB (83.9% female, mean age 38.5 ± 11 years, initial BMI 42.9 ± 4.9 kg/m2) were included. Mean follow-up was 9.4 ± 4 years in VVLL-RYGB and 5.3 ± 1.9 years in PRYGB. After 5 years, mean BMI reduction was 15.7 ± 5.9 kg/m2 in VVLL-RYGB and 11.9 ± 4.1 kg/m2 in PRYGB (p < 0.001), and mean %EWL was 78.3 ± 23.1% and 70.2 ± 23.7% (p = 0.002) with a follow-up rate of 78% and 75.9%, respectively. The mixed model analysis showed a significantly higher weight rebound after PRYGB. Frequency of revisional surgery (i.e., limb length alteration, pouch banding) was similar between VVLL-RYGB and PRYGB (25 vs. 29 revisions, p = 0.463). CONCLUSION The VVLL-RYGB has a significantly higher long-term BMI reduction and a significantly lower weight rebound. The length of the Roux limb significantly influences long-term outcome.","Süsstrunk, Julian; Lazaridis, Ioannis I; Köstler, Thomas; Kraljević, Marko; Delko, Tarik; Zingg, Urs",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-05109-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196977/,88

Encephalitis and meningitis are some of the critical immune-related adverse events. Atezolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that inhibits the programmed cell death-ligand. Encephalitis and meningitis were reported in 0.8% of the patients in the atezolizumab versus docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. However, none of the reports have clarified the details concerning atezolizumab-induced encephalitis and meningitis, including their background, time of onset, treatment, and therapeutic course. We herein report about three patients who experienced atezolizumab-induced meningitis in our department. Methods Of the 29 patients who received atezolizumab in our department between October 2015 and September 2018, three developed aseptic meningitis. We retrospectively examined their clinical, radiologic, and cytologic features. Results In all three cases, a depressed level of consciousness followed fever in cycle 1, days 15 and 16 after administration of atezolizumab. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed that the number of cells was not increased despite the protein level being high. No definite malignant cells were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid in any of the three cases. Only one patient exhibited abnormal enhancement along the lines of the corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging. On the basis of these findings, the patients were diagnosed with atezolizumab-induced meningitis. After the administration of methylprednisolone (1000 mg for 3 d), they promptly became conscious and alert. Conclusion Atezolizumab-induced meningitis may have some specific features, such as a characteristic development period, findings in magnetic resonance imaging, and premonitory symptoms.","Toyozawa, Ryo; Haratake, Naoki; Toyokawa, Gouji; Matsubara, Taichi; Takamori, Shinkichi; Miura, Naoko; Yamaguchi, Masafumi; Takenoyama, Mitsuhiro; Seto, Takashi",JTO clinical and research reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtocrr.2020.100012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589914/,88

Currently, there is no effective marker for its early diagnosis. The aim of this study is to analyze the difference of circRNA expression profiles between DFU and normal human wounds (NHW) and to screen serum biomarkers for the early diagnosis of DFU. MATERIALS AND METHODS Differentially expressed circRNAs were screened by bioinformatics analysis, using GSE114248 chip data downloaded from GEO database, including 5 pairs of tissue samples from DFU patients and NHW cases. Accordingly, 20 cases of DFU (Wagner grade 0~2), 20 non-DFU diabetes and 20 healthy controls were selected in the screening test, and the total RNAs of serum and serum-derived exosomes were extracted. The screened circRNAs were verified in the third largest cohort, and the ROC curves were drawn to assess the diagnostic efficiency. RESULTS As discovered by experiment, there were a total of 67 circRNAs presented differential expressions between the two groups, with 28 circRNAs upregulated and 39 circRNAs downregulated in DFU group. Two types of circRNAs, hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362, were selected as candidate biomarkers in current study and validated in a large cohort. The AUCs of serum hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362 to diagnose early DFU were 0.9389 and 0.8792, respectively, and the AUCs of exosomal hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362 to diagnose early DFU were 0.8783 and 0.8481, respectively. Furthermore, the expressions of serum hsa_circ_0000907 and hsa_circ_0057362 were negatively correlated with ankle brachial index (ABI) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) in DFU patients.

94646,The emergence and diversification of panzootic H5N1 influenza viruses.,2013,"BACKGROUND Since the results of the Management of Myelomeningocele Study were published, maternal-fetal surgery for the in utero treatment of spina bifida has become accepted as a standard of care alternative. Despite promise with fetal management of myelomeningocele repair, there are significant complications to consider. Chorioamniotic membrane separation and preterm premature rupture of membranes are known complications of invasive fetal procedures. Despite their relative frequency associated with fetal procedures, few data exist regarding risk factors that may be attributed to their occurrence or the natural history of pregnancies that are affected with chorionic membrane separation or preterm premature rupture of membranes related to the procedure. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to review chorioamniotic membrane separation and preterm premature rupture of membranes in a cohort of patients undergoing fetal management of myelomeningocele repair including identification of risk factors and outcomes. STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective review of patients undergoing fetal management of myelomeningocele repair and subsequent delivery from January 2011 through December 2013 at 1 institution. Patients were identified through the institutional fetal management of myelomeningocele repair database and chart review was performed. Perioperative factors and outcomes among patients with chorioamniotic membrane separation and preterm premature rupture of membranes were compared to those without. Risk factors associated with the development of chorioamniotic membrane separation and preterm premature rupture of membranes were determined. RESULTS A total of 88 patients underwent fetal management of myelomeningocele repair and subsequently delivered during the study period. In all, 21 patients (23.9%) were diagnosed with chorioamniotic membrane separation by ultrasound and preterm premature rupture of membranes occurred in 27 (30.7%). Among the chorioamniotic membrane separation patients, 10 (47.6%) were diagnosed with global chorioamniotic membrane separation and 11 (52.4%) with local chorioamniotic membrane separation. Earlier gestational age at the time of fetal surgery was a significant risk factor for the development of chorioamniotic membrane separation (P = .01) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (P < 0.0001). Chorioamniotic membrane separation was significantly associated with preterm premature rupture of membranes (59.1% vs 21.2%, P = .008) and earlier gestational age at delivery (32.1 ± 4.2 vs 34.4 ± 3.5 weeks, P = .01). The average number of days from chorioamniotic membrane separation to preterm premature rupture of membranes was 11.0 ± 10.1 and from chorioamniotic membrane separation to delivery was 31.0 ± 22.5. The mean time interval between fetal management of myelomeningocele repair and preterm premature rupture of membranes was 47.9 days. Mean latency period from preterm premature rupture of membranes to delivery was 25 days. Gestational age at delivery was significantly lower in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes (31.6 ± 3.4 vs 34.9 ± 3.5 weeks, P = .0001). Using logistic regression analysis, nulliparity, gestational age at fetal management of myelomeningocele repair, and membrane separation remained significant risk factors for preterm premature rupture of membranes. CONCLUSION Chorioamniotic membrane separation after fetal management of myelomeningocele repair is a significant risk factor for subsequent development of preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm delivery. Fetal management of myelomeningocele repair <23 weeks is associated with higher rates of preterm premature rupture of membranes and chorioamniotic membrane separation. Therefore fetal management of myelomeningocele repair should be deferred until ≥23 weeks to mitigate these complications. Nulliparity also appears to increase the risk for preterm premature rupture of membranes.","Soni, Shelly; Moldenhauer, Julie S; Spinner, Susan S; Rendon, Norma; Khalek, Nahla; Martinez-Poyer, Juan; Johnson, Mark P; Adzick, N Scott",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2015.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26692177/,88

The adverse mental health effects caused by COVID-19 may be particularly acute for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the present study, we developed an online survey to investigate how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions to assess multiple facets of how the pandemic has affected individuals with OCD symptoms. Responses were collected from adults with self-identified OCD recruited from OCD-specific forums and websites (n = 252). The majority (76.2 %) of respondents reported that their OCD symptoms had worsened since the outbreak, though there was substantial variability in individual responses. Negative effects of COVID-19 were more strongly linked to contamination and responsibility for harm symptoms than for other symptom dimensions. The self-identified OCD group also reported heightened concerns about COVID-19 compared to a community control sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Lastly, many participants reported that the pandemic had interfered with their OCD treatment, yet they remained mostly satisfied with how their treatment providers had handled the crisis. These results highlight the importance of considering how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community, with possible implications for treatment providers.","Wheaton, Michael G; Ward, Haley E; Silber, Alana; McIngvale, Elizabeth; Björgvinsson, Thröstur",Journal of anxiety disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965747/,88
96627,Fast Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics via Spin-Flip Time-Dependent Density-Functional Tight-Binding Approach: Application to Nonradiative Relaxation of Tetraphenylethylene with Locked Aromatic Rings.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND Indications regarding hernia repair after removal of previously infected prostheses remain unclear. Patients may receive staged primary repair or single-stage reconstructions, neither of which may be ideal. Although animal models have simulated contamination by direct inoculation of implants with bacteria, there remains a paucity of literature, which simulates a field following mesh infection and removal. We aimed to develop a murine model to mimic this complex scenario to allow for further testing of various implants. METHODS Thirty-six female CL57BL/6J mice underwent implantation of a 0.7 × 0.7 cm polyester mesh in the dorsal subcutaneous position. Wounds were closed and inoculated with 100 µL containing 1 × 104 CFU of GFP-labeled MSSA. After 2 weeks, the infected mesh was removed and the cavity was copiously irrigated with saline. Mice were split into four groups: with three groups receiving new polyester, polypropylene, and porcine mesh and remaining as non-mesh controls. Mice were survived for another 2 weeks and underwent necropsy. Gross infection was evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks. Tissue homogenization and direct plating to recover GFP MSSA was completed at 4 weeks. RESULTS At 2 weeks, all mice were noted to have gross mesh infection. One animal died due to overwhelming infection and wound breakdown. At 4 weeks, 5/6 (83 %) control mice who did not have a second mesh implantation had full clearance of their wounds. In contrast, 9/10 (90 %) mice with re-implantation of polypropylene were noted to have pus and recovery of GFP MSSA on plating. This was also observed in 100 % of mice with polyester and porcine mesh. CONCLUSION Our novel murine model demonstrates that mesh re-implantation after infected mesh removal results in infection of the newly placed prosthesis, regardless of the material characteristic or type. This model lays foundation for development and investigation of implants for treatment strategies following infected mesh removal.","Majumder, Arnab; Petro, Clayton C; Liu, Lijia; Fayezizadeh, Mojtaba; Novitsky, Yuri W",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5056-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27351653/,88

The F protein folds initially to form a trimeric metastable prefusion form that is triggered to undergo large-scale irreversible conformational changes to form the trimeric postfusion conformation. It is thought that F refolding couples the energy released with membrane fusion. The F protein is synthesized as a precursor (F0) that must be cleaved by a host protease to form a biologically active molecule, F1,F2. Cleavage of F protein is a prerequisite for fusion and virus infectivity. Cleavage creates a new N terminus on F1 that contains a hydrophobic region, known as the FP, which intercalates target membranes during F protein refolding. The crystal structure of the soluble ectodomain of the uncleaved form of PIV5 F is known; here we report the crystal structure of the cleavage-activated prefusion form of PIV5 F. The structure shows minimal movement of the residues adjacent to the protease cleavage site. Most of the hydrophobic FP residues are buried in the uncleaved F protein, and only F103 at the newly created N terminus becomes more solvent-accessible after cleavage. The conformational freedom of the charged arginine residues that compose the protease recognition site increases on cleavage of F protein.","Welch, Brett D; Liu, Yuanyuan; Kors, Christopher A; Leser, George P; Jardetzky, Theodore S; Lamb, Robert A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1213802109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23012473/,88

Although most people infected with these viruses appear to suffer no ill effects, the viruses are a well-established cause of encephalitis in immunocompromised patients. In this review, we summarize the evidence that the viruses may also be one trigger for febrile seizures (including febrile status epilepticus) in immunocompetent infants and children, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), and, possibly, Alzheimer's disease.

We compared the rates of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after renal transplantation in patients with and without pre-transplant diabetes. Furthermore, we investigated whether transplant era and recipient age affected the association between diabetes status and adverse events. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 691 patients who underwent renal transplantation between 1994 and 2016 at a single tertiary center. We compared the incidences of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE in patients with and without pre-transplant diabetes using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model, and assessed the interactions between diabetes status and transplant era and recipient age. RESULTS Of 691 kidney recipients, 143 (20.7%) had pre-transplant diabetes. The mean follow-up duration was 94.5 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with pre-transplant diabetes had higher incidences of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE compared with those without pre-transplant diabetes (log rank test, p < 0.001 for both). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, pre-transplant diabetes was associated with an increased risk of post-transplant mortality and four-point MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; confidence interval [CI], 1.05-3.44; p = 0.034; and HR, 1.75; CI, 1.02-3.00; p = 0.043, respectively). The associations between pre-transplant diabetes status and all-cause mortality and four-point MACE were not affected by transplant era or recipient age. CONCLUSIONS Pre-transplant diabetes remains a significant risk factor for mortality and four-point MACE in kidney transplant recipients.","Jeon, Ja Young; Kim, Soo Jung; Ha, Kyoung Hwa; Park, Ji Hyun; Park, Bumhee; Oh, Chang-Kwon; Han, Seung Jin",Journal of diabetes investigation,https://doi.org/10.1111/jdi.13397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894649/,88

Current surveillance methods might underestimate the prevalence of occupational injuries and illnesses (2,3). One way to obtain more information on occupational morbidity is to assess workers' perceptions about whether they have ever experienced health problems related to work (4). Occupational exposures might directly cause, contribute to, exacerbate, or predispose workers to various health problems (work-related health problems). CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health estimated the lifetime prevalence of self-reported, work-related health problems for the currently employed population overall and stratified by various demographic and job characteristics using data from the 2018 version of the SummerStyles survey. Overall, 35.1% of employed respondents had ever experienced a work-related health problem (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33.0%-37.3%). The most commonly reported work-related health problem was back pain (19.4%, 95% CI = 17.6%-21.2%). Among industries, construction (48.6%, 95% CI = 36.54%-60.58%) had the highest prevalence of any work-related health problems.

Several in vivo and in vitro BE models were developed with questionable translational relevance when implemented separately. Therefore, we aimed to screen Gene Expression Omnibus 2R (GEO2R) databases to establish whether clinical BE molecular profile was comparable with animal and optimized human esophageal squamous cell lines-based in vitro models. The GEO2R tool and selected databases were used to establish human BE molecular profile.

Racial and economic inequity exert large effects on youth mental health, on treatment efficacy, and on the likelihood of receiving treatment altogether. Yet, these factors are studied less often by clinical psychological scientists. METHOD We conducted a narrative review of literature on racial and economic inequities and their impact on youth mental health. RESULTS First, systemic problems such as racism and poverty increase the risk of developing complex health issues and decrease the likelihood of benefiting from treatment. Second, attitudinal barriers, such as mistrust associated with treatments provided by researchers and government agencies, decrease the likelihood that minoritized groups will engage with or benefit from evidence-based treatments. Third, minoritized and underserved communities are especially unlikely to receive evidence-based treatment. CONCLUSION Clinical psychological science has unique insights that can help address systemic inequities that can decrease treatment efficacy for youth mental health treatment. Psychological scientists can help eliminate disparities in accessing evidence-based treatment and help end violent policies in underserved minoritized communities by at the very least (1) building and supporting scalable community-based treatments as well as (2) publicly advocating for an end to violent policies that impose negative social costs.","Castro-Ramirez, Franckie; Al-Suwaidi, Maha; Garcia, Pedro; Rankin, Osiris; Ricard, Jordyn R; Nock, Matthew K","Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53",https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2021.1941058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339320/,88

All patients were tested with point-of-care (finger-stick) glucose determinations postoperatively and were started on a subcutaneous insulin protocol if they had postoperative stress hyperglycemia of >140 mg/dL when fasting or >180 mg/dL after meals. Insulin was discontinued when blood glucose decreased to <100 mg/dL. Results Of the 489 patients, 301 (62%) qualified for the insulin protocol. Thirty-seven (17%) of the 220 patients for whom the hemoglobin A1c level was available were diabetic, and 21 (11%) of the 187 patients for whom body mass index data were available were morbidly obese (body mass index, ≥40 kg/m2). Diabetes (p < 0.001), revision surgery (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.0110), and obesity (including morbid obesity) (p = 0.0051) were independent factors resulting in significant glycemic elevation. A trend toward hyperglycemia occurred in younger patients but did not reach significance (p = 0.063). The glucose levels of patients in all of these groups responded well to insulin. None of the patients who were managed with the insulin experienced a periprosthetic joint infection. There were no injuries related to hypoglycemia. Conclusions The findings of the present study suggest that hyperglycemia is a common link between seemingly disparate factors related to the increased prevalence of periprosthetic joint infection. The standardized subcutaneous insulin protocol was both safe and effective for the treatment of hyperglycemia for nondiabetic as well as diabetic patients. Patients who have undergone total joint replacement, especially those with revision procedures, male sex, morbid obesity, and diabetes, should be evaluated for hyperglycemia starting in the post-anesthesia care unit and should be managed with the insulin protocol when that risk is identified.

The collective burden of ALD and AUD was large and growing, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. There is accumulating evidence that this pandemic has had a large direct effect on these patients and is likely to produce indirect effects through delays in care, psychological strain, and increased alcohol use. Now a year into the pandemic, it is important that clinicians fully understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with ALD and AUD. To fill existing gaps in knowledge, the scientific community must set research priorities for patients with ALD regarding their risk of COVID-19, prevention/treatment of COVID-19, changes in alcohol use during the pandemic, best use of AUD treatments in the COVID-19 era, and downstream effects of this pandemic on ALD. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has already inflicted disproportionate harms on patients with ALD, and ongoing, focused research efforts will be critical to better understand the direct and collateral effects of this pandemic on ALD.","Moon, Andrew M; Curtis, Brenda; Mandrekar, Pranoti; Singal, Ashwani K; Verna, Elizabeth C; Fix, Oren K",Hepatology communications,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep4.1747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510833/,88

The advantage of this new method is mainly cosmetic, but the risk of the hernia-owing to the larger port-increased. CASE REPORT A 71-year-old man was admitted with a left lateral inguinal hernia and gallbladder stones. After preparation of the sac of the hernia, a single-port was inserted into the lateral ring and a cholecystectomy was performed. The operation was completed by the reconstruction of the abdominal wall using a polypropylene mesh. The total operating time was 85 minutes. CONCLUSION In the case of the combined operation, the defect of the abdominal wall could be used as a location of the single port, and the trauma of the abdominal wall could be avoided. This is the first publication about single-port cholecystectomy where the ring of the inguinal hernia was used as a placement site of the single port.","Lukovich, Peter; Hahn, Oszkar; Tarjányi, Maria",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350610392930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21385757/,88

Using deep learning for face recognition, we present the first evidence that interindividual facial resemblance has been selected to signal paternal kinship. Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) live in matrilineal societies, in which females spend their entire lives not only with maternal half-sisters (MHS) but also with paternal half-sisters (PHS). We show that PHS have more differentiated social relationships compared to nonkin, suggesting the existence of kin recognition mechanisms. We further demonstrate that facial resemblance increases with genetic relatedness. However, PHS resemble each other visually more than MHS do, despite both kin categories sharing similar degrees of genetic relatedness. This paternally derived facial resemblance among PHS indicates selection to facilitate kin recognition. This study also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence to study phenotypic evolution.","Charpentier, M J E; Harté, M; Poirotte, C; de Bellefon, J Meric; Laubi, B; Kappeler, P M; Renoult, J P",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba3274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32537486/,88
113755,Alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus nsp1 protein suppresses protein translation in mammalian cells and in cell-free HeLa cell extracts but not in rabbit reticulocyte lysate.,2011,"BACKGROUND Previous studies have identified the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as a core region in cognitive emotional regulation. Transcranial direct current stimulations of the dlPFC (tDCS) and heart-rate variability biofeedback (BFB) are known to regulate emotional processes. However, the effect of these interventions applied either alone or concomitantly during an anticipatory stress remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE The study investigated the effect of anodal tDCS and BFB, alone or combined, on psychophysiological stress responses and cognitive functioning. METHODS Following a stress anticipation induction, 80 participants were randomized into four groups and subjected to a 15-min intervention: neutral video viewing (ctrl), left dlPFC anodal tDCS (tdcs), heart-rate variability biofeedback (bfb), or a combined treatment (bfb + tdcs). Participants were then immediately confronted with the stressor, which was followed by an assessment of executive functions. Psychophysiological stress responses were assessed throughout the experiment (heart rate, heart-rate variability, salivary cortisol). RESULTS The tdcs did not modulate stress responses. Compared with both ctrl and tdcs interventions, bfb reduced physiological stress and improved executive functions after the stressor. The main finding revealed that bfb + tdcs was the most effective intervention, yielding greater reduction in psychological (P = 0.038) and physiological stress responses than bfb (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Combining preventive tDCS with BFB is a relevant interventional approach to reduce psychophysiological stress responses, hence offering a new and non-invasive treatment of stress-related disorders. Biofeedback may be particularly useful for preparing for an important stressful event when performance is decisive.","Schlatter, Sophie; Guillot, Aymeric; Schmidt, Laura; Mura, Mathilde; Trama, Robin; Di Rienzo, Franck; Lilot, Marc; Debarnot, Ursula",Brain stimulation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2021.08.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438047/,88
114160,NB protein does not affect influenza B virus replication in vitro and is not required for replication in or transmission between ferrets.,2016,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) is the most commonly used methods of laparoscopic gastrectomy for upper and middle gastric cancer. However, totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) is unpopular because reconstruction is difficult, especially for the intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy. We adopted TLTG with various types of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy. In this study, we compared LATG and TLTG to evaluate their outcomes. METHODS From March 2006 to September 2015, 253 patients with upper and middle gastric cancer underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG), 145 patients underwent LATG, and 108 patients underwent TLTG. The clinicopathological characteristics and postoperative outcomes were retrospectively compared between the two groups. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. RESULTS The operation time and estimated blood loss were similar between the groups. There were no significant differences in first flatus, diet initiation, and postoperative hospital stay. The surgical complication rates were 17.2% (25/145) and 13.9% (15/108) in the LATG and TLTG groups, respectively. The meta-analysis also revealed no significant differences in the operation time, estimated blood loss, time to first flatus, length of hospital stay, overall, and anastomosis-related complications among the groups.

The purpoe of this study was to compare feasibility, safety, and short-term outcomes of robotic sigmoid and low anterior resections performed with completely intracorporeal anastomosis (CICA) technique to the traditional extracorporeal assisted anastomosis (ECAA) technique. Consecutive series of patients who underwent elective robotic sigmoid or low anterior resections for benign or malignant disease utilizes either CICA or ECAA between August 2017 and November 2019. Surgical complications were assessed until 30 postoperative days and compared between the two groups. A total of 160 patients were identified; 73 (45.6%) in the CICA group and 87 (54.4%) in the ECAA group. Most of the procedures were performed for malignancy (76%). Estimated blood loss was lower in the CICA group (80.7 mL vs. 110.2 mL; p = 0.048), while operative times were longer (5.9 ± SD hours vs. 4.9 ± SD hours; p = < 0.001). Overall conversion rate was 1.9%, with no conversions in the CICA group. Overall complications occurred in 54 patients (33.8%) with 13 (8.3%) representing major complications. There were no significant differences in 30 day outcomes between the two groups. This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of robotic sigmoid and low anterior resections with CICA. Outcomes for robotic sigmoid and low anterior resections are encouraging regardless of anastomotic technique (CICA vs ECAA).","Achilli, Pietro; Perry, William; Grass, Fabian; Abd El Aziz, Mohamed A; Kelley, Scott R; Larson, David W; Behm, Kevin T",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-021-01061-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993462/,88

Bioinformatics analysis revealed a targeted relationship between miR-203 and SOCS3 mRNA. This study investigated the role of miR-203 in ovarian cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Ovarian cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were collected to detect the expression of miR-203 and SOCS3. Ovarian cancer HO8910 cells were divided into miR-NC group, miR-203 inhibitor group, and miR-203 mimic group followed by the analysis of the expression of miR-203 and SOCS3 mRNA by quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), protein expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 by Western blot, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry, and proliferation by 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining chronologically. RESULTS Compared with adjacent tissues, miR-203 expression was significantly increased in tumor tissues and SCOS3 mRNA expression was decreased. Compared with those with lower miR-203 expression, the prognosis of patients with higher expression of miR-203 was significantly worse. There was a targeted regulatory relationship between miR-203 and SOCS3 mRNA. Compared with IOSE80 cells, miR-203 expression in HO8910 and SKOV3 cells was increased, and its expressions of SOCS3 mRNA and protein were decreased. Compared with miR-NC group, the transfection of miR-203 inhibitor significantly increased SOCS3 expression, and decreased the expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 protein. We draw the conclusion that miR-203 increased cell apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation. However, opposite results were observed after the transfection of miR-203 mimic. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal miR-203 and SOCS3 expression are related to the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. MiR-203 affects the proliferation of JAK-STAT pathway and regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells by targeting the inhibition of SOCS3 expression.","Liu, H-P; Zhang, Y; Liu, Z-T; Qi, H; Zheng, X-M; Qi, L-H; Wang, J-Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201911_19421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31773696/,88

METHODS To analyze the impact of cocaine and cannabis use on levels of markers of monocyte activation (sCD163 and sCD14) and systemic inflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6]) in AUD patients admitted for hospital treatment between 2013 and 2018. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained upon admission. IL-6, sCD163, and sCD14 were measured in frozen plasma samples. We performed logistic regression to detect associations between cocaine and cannabis use and markers of monocyte activation and inflammation in the highest quartile. RESULTS A total of 289 patients (77.5 % male) were included (median age = 50 years). The median alcohol intake upon admission was 142 g/day. The median duration of AUD was 20 years. Of the 289 patients with AUD, 76 % were active smokers, 23.1 % and 22.1 % concomitantly used cocaine and cannabis, respectively The median levels of IL-6, sCD163, and sCD14 were 4.37 pg/mL, 759 ng/mL, and 1.68 × 106 pg/mL, respectively. We did not detect associations between cocaine use and inflammation or monocyte activation. Cannabis use was associated with a higher odds of having sCD163 levels in the highest quartile (adjusted odds ratio = 2.34, 95 % confidence interval = 1.07-5.15, p = 0.03). Cannabis use was not associated with inflammation. CONCLUSION In this series of AUD patients the concomitant use of cannabis use was associated with sCD163 levels that were in the highest quartile, consistent with monocyte activation.","Fuster, Daniel; García-Calvo, Xavier; Bolao, Ferran; Zuluaga, Paola; Rocamora, Gemma; Hernández-Rubio, Anna; Sanvisens, Arantza; Tor, Jordi; Muga, Robert",Drug and alcohol dependence,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818911/,88

METHODS The intensity and proportion of tumor cell expression of ER and PR in ECs were assessed independently and semi-quantitatively by two pathologists using digital images of duplicate tumor tissue microarrays (TMAs). Cases with inconsistent initial assessment were reviewed and final scoring agreed. The association between overall and EC-specific survival and hormone receptor expression (intensity, proportion and combined) was assessed using Cox regression analysis. The C-index was used to evaluate model discrimination with addition of ER and PR status. RESULTS Tumor ER and PR analysis was possible in 659 TMAs from 255 patients, and in 459 TMAs from 243 patients, respectively. Initial ER and PR scoring was consistent in 82% and 80% of cases, respectively. In multivariate analyses decreased ER and PR expression was associated with increased tumor-related mortality. Associations reached statistical significance for ER proportion score (P=0.05), ER intensity score (P=0.003), and PR combined score (P=0.04). Decreased expression of combined ER/PR expression was associated with poorer EC-specific survival than decreased expression of either hormone receptor alone (P=0.005). However, hormone receptor status did not significantly improve mortality prediction in individual cases. CONCLUSION ER and PR expression combined, using cut-points that capture variation in scoring and across cores, is significantly associated with EC-specific survival in analyses adjusting for known prognostic factors. However, at the individual level, ER and PR expression does not improve mortality prediction.","Smith, Deborah; Stewart, Colin J R; Clarke, Edward M; Lose, Felicity; Davies, Claire; Armes, Jane; Obermair, Andreas; Brennan, Donal; Webb, Penelope M; Nagle, Christina M; Spurdle, Amanda B",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2017.11.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29217139/,88

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of retrievable vena cava filters plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone for preventing pulmonary embolism recurrence in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism and a high risk of recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial (PREPIC2) with 6-month follow-up conducted from August 2006 to January 2013. Hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity were assigned to retrievable inferior vena cava filter implantation plus anticoagulation (filter group; n = 200) or anticoagulation alone with no filter implantation (control group; n = 199). Initial hospitalization with ambulatory follow-up occurred in 17 French centers. INTERVENTIONS Full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 months in all patients. Insertion of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in patients randomized to the filter group. Filter retrieval was planned at 3 months from placement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were recurrent pulmonary embolism at 6 months, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, major bleeding, death at 3 and 6 months, and filter complications. RESULTS In the filter group, the filter was successfully inserted in 193 patients and was retrieved as planned in 153 of the 164 patients in whom retrieval was attempted. By 3 months, recurrent pulmonary embolism had occurred in 6 patients (3.0%; all fatal) in the filter group and in 3 patients (1.5%; 2 fatal) in the control group (relative risk with filter, 2.00 [95% CI, 0.51-7.89]; P = .50). Results were similar at 6 months. No difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the other outcomes. Filter thrombosis occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized patients with severe acute pulmonary embolism, the use of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone did not reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. These findings do not support the use of this type of filter in patients who can be treated with anticoagulation.

Benefits of a quick end-of-outbreak declaration, such as reductions in trade/travel restrictions, must be balanced against the chance of flare-ups from undetected residual cases. We show how epidemiological modelling can be used to estimate the surveillance level required for decision-makers to be confident that an outbreak is over. Results from a simple model characterizing an Ebola outbreak suggest that a surveillance sensitivity (i.e. case reporting percentage) of 79% is necessary for 95% confidence that an outbreak is over after 42 days without symptomatic cases. With weaker surveillance, unrecognized transmission may still occur: if the surveillance sensitivity is only 40%, then 62 days must be waited for 95% certainty. By quantifying the certainty in end-of-outbreak declarations, public health decision-makers can plan and communicate more effectively.

This case report describes the interdisciplinary management of an 11-year-old girl with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome exhibiting oligodontia and maxillary hypoplasia. METHODS AND RESULTS An adjunctive orthodontic therapy was performed by taking advantage of bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP) therapy using miniplates and 24-hour traction by intermaxillary Class III elastics. After 6 months of active treatment, the maxilla advanced by approximately 5 mm and upper lip relation improved by 3 mm without any significant changes in vertical relations. All the changes were maintained at 15th-month follow-up. A temporary removable prosthesis was given for immediate esthetics, and the definitive management is discussed. CONCLUSION The BAMP therapy can be a befitting alternative in cases exhibiting complex presentation involving skeletal and dentoalveolar components. An appreciable profile improvement without any dentoalveolar side effects can be achieved with BAMP therapy.","Siddiqui, Hamza Parvez; Sennimalai, Karthik; Samrit, Vilas D; Duggal, Ritu; Yadav, Rahul","Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",https://doi.org/10.1111/scd.12579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719126/,88

Biological and epidemiological evidence has shown that excess iron is associated with beta-cell damage and impaired insulin secretion. AIM In this review, our aim was to assess the association between iron and the risk of T1D. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed and EMBASE in July 2016. Studies investigating the effect of iron status/intake on the risk of developing T1D later were included, and study quality was evaluated. The results have been summarized in narrative form. RESULTS From a total of 931 studies screened, we included 4 observational studies evaluating iron intake from drinking water or food during early life and the risk of T1D. The quality of the studies was moderate to high assessed via the nine-star Newcastle Ottawa Scale. One out of the four studies included in this review found estimates of dietary iron intake to be associated with risk of T1D development, whereas three studies found no such relationship for estimates of iron in drinking water. CONCLUSIONS The limited number of studies included found dietary iron, but not iron in drinking water, to be associated with risk of T1D. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between iron and risk of T1D, especially studies including measurements of body iron status.","Søgaard, Karen L; Ellervik, Christina; Svensson, Jannet; Thorsen, Steffen U",The review of diabetic studies : RDS,https://doi.org/10.1900/rds.2017.14.269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29145537/,88

Altered renal function and lower magnesium levels have been reported to play important roles in the pathophysiology of T2D. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between renal function, serum magnesium levels and mortality in T2D patients with COVID-19. In this retrospective study, we characterized 118 T2D and non-diabetic subjects hospitalized with COVID-19. Patients were clinically characterized and electrolyte, renal function and inflammatory markers were evaluated. Patients were grouped according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2). T2D patients had lower eGFR and serum magnesium levels when compared to non-diabetics (59.7 ± 32.8 vs. 78.4 ± 33.8 mL/min per 1.73 m2, P = 0.008 and 1.9 ± 0.3 vs. 2.1 ± 0.3 mEq/L, P = 0.012). Survival was worse in T2D patients with eGFR levels less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 as estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses (log-rank test <0.0001). The Cox model for T2D patients showed that eGFR (HR 0.970, 95% CI 0.949 to 0.991, P = 0.005) and magnesium (HR 8.025, 95% CI 1.226 to 52.512, P = 0.030) were associated with significantly increased risk of death. Reduced eGFR and magnesium levels were associated with increased mortality in our population. These results suggest that early assessment of kidney function, including magnesium levels, may assist in developing effective treatment strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality among Latin American COVID-19 patients with T2D.","Pulido-Perez, Patricia; Pondigo-de Los Angeles, Jorge Alberto; Hernandez-Hernandez, Maria Elena; Torres-Rasgado, Enrique; Romero, Jose R",Magnesium research,https://doi.org/10.1684/mrh.2021.0481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165438/,88

Drawing on a survey of 565 British adults aged 18-32 collected at the peak of social lockdown restrictions, we document an overall decrease in sexual behaviors consistent with abiding by social restrictions. We found that the levels of sexual desire reported by women (but not men) decreased compared with reports of pre-lockdown levels. Participants in serious relationships reported more increases in sexual activity than people who were single or dating casually, and there were significant differences according to gender and sexual orientation. The perceived impact of subjective wellbeing of people with high sociosexuality scores was disproportionately associated with social lockdown but there was no effect for general health. Thus, the impact on sexuality and general wellbeing should be considered by policymakers when considering future social restrictions related to COVID-19 or other public health emergencies.","Wignall, Liam; Portch, Emma; McCormack, Mark; Owens, Rebecca; Cascalheira, Cory J; Attard-Johnson, Janice; Cole, Terri",Journal of sex research,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2021.1897067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780311/,88

In this study, we present the results of a comparison of four CCVs from market leaders, using a rigorous methodology for the evaluation of use safety and user experience of medical devices. METHODS We carried out a comparative usability study of four CCVs: Hamilton G5, Puritan Bennett 980, Maquet SERVO-U, and Dräger Evita V500. Forty-eight critical care respiratory therapists participated in this fully counterbalanced, repeated measures study. Participants completed seven clinical scenarios composed of 16 tasks on each ventilator. Use safety was measured by percentage of tasks with use errors or close calls (UE/CCs). User experience was measured by system usability and workload metrics, using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). RESULTS Nine of 18 post hoc contrasts between pairs of ventilators were significant after Bonferroni correction, with effect sizes between 0.4 and 1.09 (Cohen's d). There were significantly fewer UE/CCs with SERVO-U when compared to G5 (p = 0.044) and V500 (p = 0.020). Participants reported higher system usability for G5 when compared to PB980 (p = 0.035) and higher system usability for SERVO-U when compared to G5 (p < 0.001), PB980 (p < 0.001), and V500 (p < 0.001). Participants reported lower workload for G5 when compared to PB980 (p < 0.001) and lower workload for SERVO-U when compared to PB980 (p < 0.001) and V500 (p < 0.001). G5 scored better on two of nine possible comparisons; SERVO-U scored better on seven of nine possible comparisons. Aspects influencing participants' performance and perception include the low sensitivity of G5's touchscreen and the positive effect from the quality of SERVO-U's user interface design. CONCLUSIONS This study provides empirical evidence of how four ventilators from market leaders compare and highlights the importance of medical technology design. Within the boundaries of this study, we can infer that SERVO-U demonstrated the highest levels of use safety and user experience, followed by G5. Based on qualitative data, differences in outcomes could be explained by interaction design, quality of hardware components used in manufacturing, and influence of consumer product technology on users' expectations.","Morita, Plinio P; Weinstein, Peter B; Flewwelling, Christopher J; Bañez, Carleene A; Chiu, Tabitha A; Iannuzzi, Mario; Patel, Aastha H; Shier, Ashleigh P; Cafazzo, Joseph A",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-016-1431-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542352/,88

BACKGROUND The CAPTURE 2 trial is an ongoing, prospective, nonrandomized, independently adjudicated, multicenter clinical study enrolling high-surgical-risk patients undergoing CAS. METHODS In this assessment of the CAPTURE 2 study, the American Heart Association carotid endarterectomy guideline limits were used to define acceptable site and physician CAS outcomes; therefore, the resulting population of nonoctogenarian, asymptomatic subjects in this analysis is confined to 3,388 (of the total 5,297) subjects treated at 180 U.S. hospitals by 459 operators between March 2006 and January 2009. RESULTS The rates of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction and death and stroke (DS) at 30 days were 3.5% and 3.3%, respectively, for the full CAPTURE 2 study cohort and 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively, for the asymptomatic, nonoctogenarian subgroup. In this subgroup, two-thirds of sites (118 of 180, 66%) had no DS events. Within the remaining sites, an inverse relationship between event rates and hospital patient volume as well as between event rates and individual operator volume was observed. The DS rates trended lower for interventional cardiologists compared with other specialties. CONCLUSIONS Outcomes from the largest prospectively gathered, independently adjudicated, multicenter CAS study indicate that CAS can be safely performed in a variety of hospital settings by physicians with various specialties. The most important determinant of perioperative CAS outcomes was both site and operator CAS volume. A threshold of 72 cases was found to be necessary for consistently achieving a DS rate below 3% in this later-phase single arm study; background era and non-study operator experience will affect this determination.

Engaging private providers has been proposed as a strategy for increasing access to healthcare in low- and middle-income countries; however, little consensus exists on how to estimate the extent of private sector use. Using research from sub-Saharan Africa, this study systematically compares and critiques quantitative measures of private sector family planning and childbirth service use and synthesizes evidence on the role of the private sector in the region. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the Medline, Global Health, and Popline databases. All studies that estimated use of private sector of family planning or childbirth services in one or more sub-Saharan African countries were included in this review. For each study, we extracted data on the key study outcomes and information on the methods used to estimate private sector use. RESULTS Fifty-three papers met our inclusion criteria; 31 provided outcomes on family planning, and 26 provided childbirth service outcomes. We found substantial methodological variation between studies; for instance, while some reported on service use from any private sector source, others distinguished private sector providers either by their profit orientation or position within or outside the formal medical sector. Additionally, studies measured the use of private sector services differently, with some estimating the proportion of need met by the private sector and others examining the sector's share among the market of service users. Overall, the estimates suggest that the private sector makes up a considerable portion (> 20%) of the market for family planning and childbirth care, but its role in meeting women's need for these services is fairly low (< 10%). CONCLUSIONS Many studies have examined the extent of private sector family planning and childbirth service provision; however, inconsistent methodologies make it difficult to compare results across studies and contexts. Policymakers should consider the implications of both private market share and coverage estimates, and be cautious in interpreting data on the scale of private sector health service provision without a clear understanding of the methodology.","Dennis, Mardieh L; Benova, Lenka; Owolabi, Onikepe O; Campbell, Oona M R",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3514-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200964/,88

We examined the degree of reperfusion with the expanded TICI (eTICI) scale and association with outcomes in the HERMES collaboration of recent endovascular trials. METHODS The HERMES Imaging Core, blind to all other data, evaluated angiography after endovascular therapy in HERMES. A battery of TICI scores (mTICI, TICI, TICI2C) was used to define reperfusion of the initial target occlusion defined by non-invasive imaging and conventional angiography. RESULTS Angiography of 801 subjects was available, including 797 defined by non-invasive imaging (154 internal carotid artery (ICA), 583 M1, 60 M2) and 748 by conventional angiography (195 ICA, 459 M1, 94 M2). Among 729 subjects in whom the reperfusion grade could be established, using eTICI (3=100%, 2C=90-99%, 2b67=67-89%, 2b50=50-66%) of the conventional angiography target occlusion, there were 63 eTICI 3 (9%), 166 eTICI 2c (23%), 218 eTICI 2b67 (30%), 103 eTICI 2b50 (14%), 100 eTICI 2a (14%), 19 eTICI 1 (3%), and 60 eTICI 0 (8%). Modified Rankin Scale shift analyses from baseline to 90 days showed that increasing TICI grades were linked with better outcomes, with significant distinctions between TICI 0/1 versus 2a (p=0.028), 2a versus 2b50 (p=0.017), and 2b50 versus 2b67 (p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS The benefit of endovascular therapy in HERMES was strongly associated with increasing degrees of reperfusion defined by eTICI.

128625,Circulation of at Least Six Distinct Groups of Pigeon-Derived Newcastle Disease Virus in Iran Between 1996 and 2019.,2021-05-18,"The immune system responds to influenza infection by producing neutralizing antibodies to the viral surface protein, hemagglutinin (HA), which regularly changes its antigenic structure. Antibodies that target the highly conserved stem region of HA neutralize diverse influenza viruses and can be elicited through vaccination in animals and humans. Efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines have focused on strategies to elicit such antibodies; however, the concern has been raised that previous influenza immunity may abrogate the induction of such broadly protective antibodies. We show here that prime-boost immunization can induce broadly neutralizing antibody responses in influenza-immune mice and ferrets that were previously infected or vaccinated. HA stem-directed antibodies were elicited in mice primed with a DNA vaccine and boosted with inactivated vaccine from H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (1999 NC) HA regardless of preexposure. Similarly, gene-based vaccination with replication-defective adenovirus 28 (rAd28) and 5 (rAd5) vectors encoding 1999 NC HA elicited stem-directed neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection against unmatched 1934 and 2007 H1N1 virus challenge in influenza-immune ferrets. Indeed, previous exposure to certain strains could enhance immunogenicity: The strongest HA stem-directed immune response was observed in ferrets previously infected with a divergent 1934 H1N1 virus. These findings suggest that broadly neutralizing antibodies against the conserved stem region of HA can be elicited through vaccination despite previous influenza exposure, which supports the feasibility of developing stem-directed universal influenza vaccines for humans.","Wei, Chih-Jen; Yassine, Hadi M; McTamney, Patrick M; Gall, Jason G D; Whittle, James R R; Boyington, Jeffrey C; Nabel, Gary J",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3004273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22896678/,88
128789,Assessment of cross-species transmission of hepatitis C virus-related non-primate hepacivirus in a population of humans at high risk of exposure.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE High resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and correct method for identification of species, such as, microorganism, bacteria, yeast, virus, etc. HRM data are produced using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and unique for each species. Analysis of the HRM data is important for several applications, such as, for detection of diseases (e.g., influenza, zika virus, SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 diseases) in health, for identification of spoiled foods in food industry, for analysis of crime scene evidence in forensic investigation, etc. However, the characteristics of the HRM data can change due to the experimental conditions or instrumental settings. In addition, it becomes laborious and time-consuming process as the number of samples increases. Because of these reasons, the analysis and classification of the HRM data become challenging for species which have similar characteristics. METHODS To improve the classification accuracy of HRM data, we propose to use image (visual) representation of HRM data, which we call HRM images, that are generated using recurrence plots, and propose convolutional neural network (CNN) based models for classifying HRM images. In this study, two different types of recurrence plots are generated, which are black-white recurrence plots (BW-RP) and gray scale recurrence plots (GS-RP) and four different CNN models are proposed for classifying HRM data. RESULTS The classification performance of the proposed methods are evaluated based on average classification accuracy and F1 score, specificity, recall, and precision values for each yeast species. When BW-RP representation of HRM data is used as input to the CNN models, the best classification accuracy of 95.2% is obtained. The classification accuracies of CNN models for melting curve and GS-RP data representations of HRM data are 90.13% and 86.13%, respectively. The classification accuracy of support vector machines (SVM) model that take melting curve representation of HRM data is 86.53%. Moreover, when BW-RP representation of HRM data is used as input to the CNN models, the F1 score, specificity, recall and precision values are the highest for almost all of species. CONCLUSIONS Experimental results show that using BW-RP representation of HRM data improved the classification accuracy of HRM data and CNN models that take these images as input outperformed CNN models that take melting curve and GS-RP representations of HRM data as inputs and SVM model that take melting curve representation of HRM data as input.","Ozkok, Fatma Ozge; Celik, Mete",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029831/,88

RECENT FINDINGS For several decades now, it has been known that AMR among human pathogens is related to high clinical and economic burden.Different strategies have been implemented to control the clinical and economic burden of AMR. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP), environmental cleaning and infection source control have been reported as the most effective interventions. There is a potential role for faecal microbiome transplant (FMT); however, long-term effectiveness and safety remain to be demonstrated. Another promising tool is to develop molecules to chelate or degrade residual antibiotics in the colon. Decolonization has demonstrated impact on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, but there is limited evidence on the clinical impact and effectiveness of decolonization in MDR Gram-negative carriers. SUMMARY A better assessment of AMR rates and the clinical and economic impact is needed. The epidemiology of AMR bacteria varies in different regions with MRSA, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenamase-producing Enterobacterales being the most worrying. ASP and infection control have been increasingly demonstrated to impact on AMR rates. New approaches such as FMT and decolonization have still to demonstrate efficacy and safety.","Calbo, Esther; Boix-Palop, Lucía; Garau, Javier",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074997/,88

Exosomes have emerged as potential molecule-shuttle in intercellular communication, thereby regulating the physiological processes of recipient cells. To date, the effect of exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) on the progression of OSCC has not been fully investigated. In this study, we found that the protein, but not mRNA expression of Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) was decreased in OSCC. The results revealed that miR-130b-3p was an important negative regulator for PTEN expression. Additionally, overexpression and knockdown of miR-130b-3p enhanced and inhibited angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), respectively. Also, miR-130b-3p was transferred by exosomes to HUVECs and then promoted angiogenesis and inhibit the expression of PTEN. Furthermore, exosomal miR-130b-3p derived from OSCC cells promoted tumor growth and blood vessel formation in the xenograft mice model.

132481,Molecular characterization of a new species in the genus Alphacoronavirus associated with mink epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis.,2011,"Dietary intake during pregnancy plays a vital role in determining the health of both mother and baby. Maternal undernutrition affects a large proportion of women in low and lower middle income countries (LLMIC) likely influencing high maternal, infant, and child mortality in these countries. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been proposed as effective solutions to improve maternal and neonatal health. This paper reviews the literature to evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on improving dietary/nutrients intake of pregnant women in LLMIC. Eight electronic databases were searched from inception up to April 2018, including the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Index Medicus, and Maternity and Infant Care. Using Covidence, two reviewers assessed articles for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. Only studies published in English language were included. Data were summarised narratively. In total, 6,778 were identified of which four were included, with three randomised controlled trials and one prepost experimental study. Studies were conducted in India (n = 2), Indonesia (n = 1), and Kenya (n = 1). All articles evaluated the use of nutrient supplements; iron supplements (n = 1), vitamin supplements (composition not mentioned; n = 1), or calcium supplements (n = 1). This review suggests that mHealth interventions can be used to improve intake of micronutrient supplementation and nutritional status of pregnant women in LLMIC. Further studies are needed to address the limited evidence base related to mHealth nutrition interventions targeting dietary intakes of pregnant women in LLMIC.","Saronga, Naomi J; Burrows, Tracy; Collins, Clare E; Ashman, Amy M; Rollo, Megan E",Maternal & child nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.12777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609297/,88

132918,Computational and Functional Analysis of the Virus-Receptor Interface Reveals Host Range Trade-Offs in New World Arenaviruses.,2015,"BACKGROUND The propofol pharmacokinetic model derived by Kataria et al. was recently modified to perform effect-site target-controlled infusion (TCI). Effect-site concentration (Ce) targets to induce general anesthesia with this model in children have not been described. The aim of this study was to identify propofol Ce targets associated with success rates of 50% (Ce50) and 95% (Ce95) among children 3-11 years of age. METHODS Forty-two children were assigned to one of seven groups of six patients each according to propofol target Ce. After fentanyl administration propofol TCI was started with an assigned Ce target. A successful response was defined as loss of eyelash reflex and bispectral index < 50, 45 s after reaching the assigned Ce. Logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate propofol Ce50 and Ce95. RESULTS Twenty-eight children had a successful response with the assigned propofol Ce. In these patients, a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (79-59, P < 0.0001) and in heart rate (95-83, P < 0.0001) was observed. Propofol Ce and age showed a statistically significant effect in the logistic regression model. The overall calculated propofol Ce50 and Ce95 were 3.8 μg·ml(-1) (95% CI: 3.1-4.4 μg·ml(-1) ) and 6.1 μg·ml(-1) (95% CI: 4.6-7.6 μg·ml(-1) ), respectively. CONCLUSION Our results identified useful propofol targets to be used with the Kataria effect-site model to induce anesthesia in children between 3 and 11 years. The recommended targets should be reduced progressively with increasing age most probably due to PK model misspecifications.","Fuentes, Ricardo; Cortínez, Ignacio; Ibacache, Mauricio; Concha, Mario; Muñoz, Hernán",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25880448/,88

An initial focus on structure and process performance measures assessing the quality of medical care is now being supplemented with efficiency measures to quantify the ""value"" of healthcare delivery. This statement, building on prior work that articulated standards for publicly reported outcomes measures, identifies preferred attributes for measures used to assess efficiency in the allocation of healthcare resources. The attributes identified in this document combined with the previously published standards are intended to serve as criteria for assessing the suitability of efficiency measures for public reporting. This statement identifies the following attributes to be considered for publicly reported efficiency measures: integration of the quality and cost; valid cost measurement and analysis; minimal incentive to provide poor quality care; and proper attribution of the measure. The attributes described in this statement are relevant to a wide range of efforts to profile the efficiency of various healthcare providers, including hospitals, healthcare systems, managed-care organizations, physicians, group practices, and others that deliver coordinated care.","Krumholz, Harlan M; Keenan, Patricia S; Brush, John E; Bufalino, Vincent J; Chernew, Michael E; Epstein, Andrew J; Heidenreich, Paul A; Ho, Vivian; Masoudi, Frederick A; Matchar, David B; Normand, Sharon-Lise T; Rumsfeld, John S; Schuur, Jeremiah D; Smith, Sidney C; Spertus, John A; Walsh, Mary Norine",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2008.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19017522/,88
134547,Development of an IPM Strategy for Thrips and Tomato spotted wilt virus in Processing Tomatoes in the Central Valley of California.,2020-08-05,"Surveillance of highly pathogenic viruses circulating in both human and animal populations is crucial to unveil endemic infections and potential zoonotic reservoirs. Monitoring the burden of disease by serological assay could be used as an early warning system for imminent outbreaks as an increased seroprevalance often precedes larger outbreaks. However, the multitude of highly pathogenic viruses necessitates the need to identify specific antibodies against several targets from both humans as well as from potential reservoir animals such as bats. In order to address this, we have developed a broadly reactive multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) for the detection of antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses from both humans and animals. To this aim, nucleoproteins (NP) of Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV) and nucleocapsid proteins (NP) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus and Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus were employed in a 5-plex assay for IgG detection. After optimisation, specific binding to each respective NP was shown by testing sera from humans and non-human primates with known infection status. The usefulness of our assay for serosurveillance was shown by determining the immune response against the NP antigens in a panel of 129 human serum samples collected in Guinea between 2011 and 2012 in comparison to a panel of 88 sera from the German blood bank. We found good agreement between our MMIA and commercial or in-house reference methods by ELISA or IIFT with statistically significant higher binding to both EBOV NP and MARV NP coupled microspheres in the Guinea panel. Finally, the MMIA was successfully adapted to detect antibodies from bats that had been inoculated with EBOV- and MARV- virus-like particles, highlighting the versatility of this technique and potentially enabling the monitoring of wildlife as well as human populations with this assay. We were thus able to develop and validate a sensitive and broadly reactive high-throughput serological assay which could be used as a screening tool to detect antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses.","Surtees, Rebecca; Stern, Daniel; Ahrens, Katharina; Kromarek, Nicole; Lander, Angelika; Kreher, Petra; Weiss, Sabrina; Hewson, Roger; Punch, Emma K; Barr, John N; Witkowski, Peter T; Couacy-Hymann, Emmanuel; Marzi, Andrea; Dorner, Brigitte G; Kurth, Andreas",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33095766/,88
134762,Identification of a virus-specific and conserved B-cell epitope on NS1 protein of Japanese encephalitis virus.,2009,"BACKGROUND Heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) are commonly used in chronically tracheostomized spontaneously breathing patients, to condition inhaled air, maintain lower airway function, and minimize the viscosity of secretions. Supplemental oxygen (O2) can be added to most HMEs designed for spontaneously breathing tracheostomized patients. We tested the efficiency of 7 HMEs designed for spontaneously breathing tracheostomized patients, in a normothermic model, at different minute ventilations (VE) and supplemental O2 flows. METHODS HME efficiency was evaluated using an in vitro lung model at 2 VE (5 and 15 L/min) and 4 supplemental O2 flows (0, 3, 6, and 12 L/min). Wet and dry temperatures of the inspiratory flow were measured, and absolute humidity was calculated. In addition, HME efficiency at 0, 12, and 24 h use was evaluated, as well as resistance to flow at 0 and 24 h. RESULTS The progressive increase in O2 flow from 0 to 12 L/min was associated with a reduction in temperature and absolute humidity. Under the same conditions, this effect was greater at lower VE. The HME with the best performance provided an absolute humidity of 26 mg H2O/L and a temperature of 27.8 °C. No significant changes in efficiency or resistance were detected during the 24 h evaluation. CONCLUSIONS The efficiency of HMEs in terms of temperature and absolute humidity is significantly affected by O2 supplementation and V(E).","Brusasco, Claudia; Corradi, Francesco; Vargas, Maria; Bona, Margherita; Bruno, Federica; Marsili, Maria; Simonassi, Francesca; Santori, Gregorio; Severgnini, Paolo; Kacmarek, Robert M; Pelosi, Paolo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23674812/,88

Biological assays revealed that some constructed 7-thiazoxime quinolones possessed effective antibacterial efficiency. Methyl acetate oxime derivative 6l exhibited 32-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against MRSA, which also possessed rapidly bactericidal ability and low toxicity towards mammalian cells. The combination use of 7-thiazoxime quinolone 6l and ciprofloxacin was able to improve antibacterial potency and effectively alleviate bacterial resistance. The preliminarily mechanism exploration revealed that compound 6l could destroy the cell membrane and insert into MRSA DNA to bind with DNA gyrase, then decrease the expression of gyrB and femB genes. The above results strongly suggested that methyl acetate oxime derivative 6l held a promise for combating MRSA infection.","Chen, Jin-Ping; Battini, Narsaiah; Ansari, Mohammad Fawad; Zhou, Cheng-He",European journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725630/,88

HCV-related end-stage liver disease is one of the most common indications for hepatic transplantation. Chronic hepatitis C is also assimilated to a systemic disease because of multiple extrahepatic manifestations, including lymphoproliferative disorders. The revolution of HCV treatment with the advent of direct-acting antivirals has significantly improved the management with high antiviral efficacy and good safety profile compared with old regimens, thus allowing good outcomes on hepatic and extrahepatic symptoms. However, with the widespread use of these new agents, controversial concerns about unexpected increasing cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were reported. We now report the case of a patient presenting with HCV-related cirrhosis, treated with direct-antiviral therapy and diagnosed with primary hepatic lymphoma shortly after the end of the treatment.","Zaimi, Yosra; Ayari, Myriam; Cherifi, Walid; Letaief Ksontini, Feryel; Ayadi, Shema; Bel Hadj Mabrouk, Emna; Jrad, Myriam",BMJ open gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgast-2021-000721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400439/,88

However, it can be difficult to maintain when deployed and remote from normal training and support structures. There is no literature directly discussing how military doctors in the deployed and remote environment maintain CPD and if practice-based small group learning (PBSGL) could be an appropriate tool to facilitate this in future. AIM To describe the CPD experience of medical officers (MOs) working for the Defence Medical Services (DMS) and assess if offering PBSGL would be welcomed and likely beneficial. DESIGN AND SETTING This is a quantitative survey of doctors working in primary care within the DMS. METHOD A questionnaire was designed to elicit opinions, current practice and previous experience of CPD within the deployed and firm base environments. It also aimed to elicit prior experience of and appetite for PBSGL as a solution. This was then distributed via email to MOs working for the DMS. RESULTS 130 responses (25%) were received. 122 (96%) had heard of PBSGL, 56% had participated in PBSGL in the firm base. 60% agreed or strongly agreed PBSGL was an effective way to maintain CPD. 73% reported eLearning as a mode of maintaining CPD while deployed or working in a remote environment. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that many general practitioners deployed to remote locations feel that CPD provision could be improved and that PBSGL is a potential solution.","Eager, Michael Mathew; Capella, S C; Willman, A; Taylor, N",BMJ military health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2021-001788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34433577/,88

The delay was longer than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tendons were repaired with a 6-strand core suture (M-Tang method) or a double Tsuge suture and a peripheral suture. This was followed by an early, partial-range, active flexion exercise programme. Adhesions in four digits required tenolysis. These patients were not with longest delay. Outcomes of two improved after tenolysis. The other two patients declined further surgery. One finger flexor tendon ruptured in early active motion. This was re-repaired, and final outcome was good. Overall excellent and good results using the Tang criteria were in 27 out of 31 fingers and thumbs (87%).

This study used a content analysis to examine tweets over a two-week period in March 2020 that used #BoomerRemover to discuss COVID-19 among older adults. A total of 1875 tweets were analyzed. Salient themes include: (1) There's a Real Intergenerational Divide, (2) Young People are Affected Too, (3) It's Being Used for Political Gain, and (4) #BoomerRemover is Simply Disrespectful. Findings suggest that many of the tweets employing #BoomerRemover were grounded in either personal or political ageism.

138353,microRNA-222 Attenuates Mitochondrial Dysfunction During Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Infection.,2019,"This is the first research to examine a potential relation between stock market volatility and mental disorders. Using data on daily incidences of mental disorders in Taiwan over 4000 days from 1998 through 2009 to assess the time-series relation between stock price movements and mental disorders, we observe that stock price fluctuation clearly affects the hospitalization of mental disorders. We find that during a 12-year follow-up period, a low stock price index, a daily fall in the stock price index and consecutive daily falls in the stock price index are all associated with greater of mental disorders hospitalizations. A 1000-point fall in the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) increases the number of daily mental disorders hospitalizations by 4.71%. A 1% fall in the TAIEX in one single day increases daily hospitalizations for mental disorders by 0.36%. When the stock price index falls one consecutive day, it causes a daily increase of approximately 0.32% hospitalizations due to mental disorders on that day. Stock price index is found to be significant for both gender and all age groups. In addition, daily change is significant for both gender and middle-age groups, whereas accumulated change is significant for males and people aged 45-64. Stockholdings can help people accumulate wealth, but they can also increase mental disorders hospitalizations. In other words, stock price fluctuations do drive people crazy.","Lin, Chung-Liang; Chen, Chin-Shyan; Liu, Tsai-Ching",Health policy and planning,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czu007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526705/,88

The aim of the study was to validate three DSs (Hasegawa, Halls and Kawaguchi) and compare their ability to predict technical difficulty and postoperative outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients who underwent LLR from January 2006 to January 2019 were analyzed. Exclusion criteria were cyst fenestrations, thermal ablation, missing data for the computation of the DS and a follow-up < 90 days. RESULTS The population comprised 300 patients. The DS distribution in the study population was: Halls low 55 (18.3%), moderate 82 (27.3%), high 111 (37%) and extremely high 52 (17.3%); Hasegawa low 130 (43.3%), medium 105 (35%) and high 65 (21.7%); Kawaguchi Grade I 194 (64.7%), Grade II 47 (15.7%) and Grade III 59 (19.7%). Hasegawa and Kawaguchi showed the strongest correlation (r = 0.798, p < 0.001). Technical complexity, evaluated using the Pringle maneuver, Pringle time, blood loss and operative time, increased significantly with Hasegawa and Kawaguchi score classes (p < 0.001 for all comparisons).

These participants spent a total of 48 days locked at home, a period during which a significant worsening in all the variables assessed except for the risk of developing eating disorders, was observed: weight (kg), 67.3 ± 14.8 vs 67.7 ± 15.1, p = 0.012; physical activity (MET minutes per week), 8515.7 ± 10260.0 vs 5053.5 ± 5502.0, p < 0.001; sleep problems (total score), 6.2 ± 3.5 vs 7.2 ± 3.9, p < 0.001; self-perceived well-being (score), 4 (3-4) vs 3 (3-4), p < 0.001. The confinement had a significant differential effect on physically active participants, who experienced a significant decline (p < 0.05) on their physical activity levels, quality of sleep and well-being; whereas physically inactive participants did not experience significant changes. Findings from this longitudinal study indicate that a lockdown period due to COVID-19 had a negative impact on the physical activity levels, sleep quality and well-being in a group of physically active Spanish adults. Public health authorities should be aware that people who usually lead an active lifestyle, might be particularly susceptible to such disruptions.","Martínez-de-Quel, Óscar; Suárez-Iglesias, David; López-Flores, Marcos; Pérez, Carlos Ayán",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.105019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161046/,88

All consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (Shanghai, China) between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020, were enrolled, and their clinical data were retrospectively collected. Binary logistic regression was used to screen the factors associated with disease aggravation, and multivariable analyses with the Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the effects of prognostic factors on the improvement time and PCR conversion days in throat swabs and stool swabs. A total of 616 patients, including 50 (8.11%) severe and 18 (2.92%) critical patients, were enrolled in our retrospective cohort study. The early use of hydroxychloroquine was a protective factor associated with disease aggravation (95% CI: 0.040-0.575, p = 0.006). Clinical improvement by 20 days was significantly different between patients with hydroxychloroquine used early and those with hydroxychloroquine not used (p = 0.016, 95% CI: 1.052-1.647). The median time to clinical improvement was 6 days in the hydroxychloroquine used early group, compared with 9 days in the without hydroxychloroquine used group and 8 days in the with hydroxychloroquine not used early group (p < 0.001). Hydroxychloroquine used early was associated with earlier PCR conversion in both throat swabs (HR = 1.558, p = 0.001) and stool swabs (HR = 1.400, p = 0.028). The use of hydroxychloroquine at an early stage is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients before irreversible severe respiratory complications occur. The early use of hydroxychloroquine decreased the improvement time and the duration of COVID-19 detection in throat and stool swabs.","Su, Yi; Ling, Yun; Ma, Yuyan; Tao, Lili; Miao, Qing; Shi, Qingfeng; Pan, Jue; Lu, Hongzhou; Hu, Bijie",Bioscience trends,https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.03340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33342929/,88

The generated model was cross-verified and non-cross-verified by Topomer CoMFA and HQSAR methods; the independent test set was verified by PLS method; the Topomer search technology was used for virtual screening and molecular design; and the Surflex-Dock method and ADMET technology were used for molecular docking, pharmacology and toxicity prediction of the designed drug molecules. The Topomer CoMFA and HQSAR cross-validation coefficients q2 are 0.783 and 0.784, respectively, and the non-cross-validation coefficients r2 are 0.978 and 0.934, respectively. Ten new drug molecules have been designed using Topomer search technology. The results of molecular docking and ADMET show that the newly designed drug molecules are effective. The docking situation, pharmacology and toxicity prediction results are good. The model can be used to predict the bioactivity of the same type of new compounds and their derivatives. The prediction results of molecular design, molecular docking and ADMET can provide some ideas for the design and development of novel mIDH1 inhibitor anticancer drugs, and provide certain theoretical basis of the experimental verification of new compounds in the future. Newly designed molecules after docking with corresponding proteins in the PDB library, it can explore the targets of drug molecules acting with large proteins and the related force, which is very helpful for the design of new drugs and the mechanism of drug action.","Tong, Jian-Bo; Bian, Shuai; Zhang, Xing; Luo, Ding",Molecular diversity,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11030-021-10222-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974175/,88

BACKGROUND Few data exist on AKI following CAS. METHODS This study evaluated 126 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who underwent CAS. The risk for contrast-induced AKI was defined by the Mehran score. Hemodynamic depression (i.e., periprocedural systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or heart rate <60 beats/min), AKI (i.e., an increase of ≥0.3 mg/dl in the serum creatinine concentration at 48 h), and 30-day major adverse events (including death, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction) were assessed. RESULTS AKI occurred in 26 patients (21%). Although baseline kidney function and contrast volume were similar in the AKI group and the non-AKI group, the risk score was higher (10 ± 3 vs. 8 ± 3; p = 0.032), and hemodynamic depression (mostly due to hypotension) (65.5% vs. 35%; p = 0.005) was more common in the AKI group. The threshold of hemodynamic depression duration for AKI development was 2.5 min (sensitivity 54%, specificity 82%). Independent predictors of AKI were hemodynamic depression (odds ratio [OR]: 4.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 15.03; p = 0.009), risk score (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.60; p = 0.024), and male sex (OR: 6.07; 95% CI: 1.18 to 31.08; p = 0.021). Independent predictors of 30-day major adverse events that occurred more often in the AKI group (19.5% vs. 7%; p = 0.058) were AKI (HR: 4.83; 95% CI: 1.10 to 21.24; p = 0.037) and hemodynamic depression (HR: 5.58; 95% CI: 1.10 to 28.31; p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS AKI in CKD patients undergoing CAS is mostly due to hemodynamic depression and is associated with a higher 30-day major adverse events rate.","Donahue, Michael; Visconti, Gabriella; Focaccio, Amelia; Selvetella, Lucio; Baldassarre, Maria; Viviani Anselmi, Chiara; Briguori, Carlo",JACC.

To date, effective treatment remains elusive. Chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ), well-known antimalarial drugs effective in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, porphyria cutanea tarda, and chronic Q fever, are currently under investigation. The United States Food and Drug Administration recently issued an Emergency Use Authorization for CQ and HCQ use in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With spikes in HCQ use and demand, ethical considerations encompassing appropriate use, patient autonomy, nonmaleficence, and distributive justice abound. As drug experts, pharmacists are uniquely positioned to advocate for patients with chronic conditions necessitating HCQ use, assist in the appropriate prescribing of HCQ for COVID-19, and ensure patients and health care professionals are continually educated during this public health crisis. This review highlights the worldwide pandemic, describes appropriate HCQ use for chronic conditions, highlights available alternatives, and deliberates evolving ethical questions. With assistance from colleagues, state boards of pharmacy, and national organizations, pharmacists ensure the just distribution of valuable pharmaceuticals to patients having COVID-19 while supporting the needs of patients requiring HCQ for chronic conditions.","Husayn, Sameeha S; Brown, Jeremy D; Presley, Colby L; Boghean, Kelsey; Waller, Jacquelyn D",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/0897190020942658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734810/,88

147751,Homology Modeling and Protein Interaction Map of CHRNA7 Neurogenesis Protein.,2017,"OBJECT Significant haemorrhage following intracranial tumour resection may occur in 1-2% of cases and the majority occur within the first few hours post-operatively. Implantation of carmustine wafers has been associated with increased operative site complications in some series, but post-operative haematoma is not routinely reported. We analyzed the characteristics of post-operative haemorrhage after carmustine wafer insertion. METHODS We performed a retrospective audit of surgical site haematoma after tumour resection and insertion of carmustine wafers in two neurosurgical units in the UK (University Hospital of North Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, March 2003 - July 2012; Wessex Neurological Centre, Southampton, October 2005 - January 2013). RESULTS During the specified time periods, carmustine wafers were inserted in 181 operations in 177 patients. We identified acute operative site haematomas after carmustine wafer insertion in 8 (4.4%) patients. All presented in a delayed fashion on or after Day 2 post-operatively. In contrast, acute operative site haematoma was present in 4/491 (0.81%) of patients who underwent resection without gliadel wafer insertion. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the expected timing of bleeding following intracranial tumour resection, all carmustine wafer patients who experienced haemorrhage presented in a delayed fashion on or after Day 2 post-operatively. The causative factors for universally delayed post-operative haematoma after carmustine wafer insertion are unclear and further studies are required to characterize this phenomenon.","Shah, Rahul Surendra; Homapour, Bobak; Casselden, Elizabeth; Barr, James Geoffrey; Grundy, Paul L; Brydon, Howard L",British journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3109/02688697.2013.861387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24313309/,88

One capability that is both essential and consistently challenging is information sharing between responding organizations, particularly between public health agencies and health care providers. This policy analysis reviews the threat that infectious diseases continue to pose to the United States, and the role that the Hospital Preparedness Program can play in countering such threats. Current strategies for preparing for, and responding to, infectious disease outbreaks are also reviewed, noting some gaps that need to be addressed. Particular attention is given to challenges in information sharing that continue to hinder effective surveillance and response, despite advances in technology. The study looks at recommendations from biodefense organizations and experts in the field. It concludes with our recommendation that regulatory requirements and funding opportunities for health care institutions emphasize the importance of communication and training in relation to high consequence pathogens.

COVID-19 outbreaks have already been identified in New York City and Cook County, Illinois, jails, with infection rates at the Rikers Island jail complex far exceeding community rates. In response, correctional systems are implementing changes to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including reducing jail and prison admissions and releasing people from facilities. In tandem, jails and prisons must also initiate facility-level policies to help stop the spread of COVID-19. (Am J Public Health.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate whether laparoscopic placement of a prophylactic, dual-component, intraperitoneal onlay mesh around a colostomy is safe and prevents parastomal hernia formation after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. DESIGN This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTINGS This study was conducted at 2 university and 3 central Finnish hospitals. PATIENTS From 2010 to 2013, 83 patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer were recruited. After withdrawals and exclusions, the outcome of 70 patients, 35 patients in each study group, could be examined. INTERVENTIONS In the intervention group, an end colostomy was created with placement of a intraperitoneal, dual-component onlay mesh and compared with a group with a traditional stoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures were the incidence of clinically and radiologically detected parastomal hernias and their extent 12 months after surgery. Stoma-related morbidity and the need for surgical repair of parastomal hernia were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Parastomal hernia was observed by clinical inspection in 5 intervention patients (14.3%) and in 12 control patients (32.3%; p = 0.049). Surgical repair of parastomal hernia was performed in 1 control patient (3.2%) and in none of the patients in the intervention group. CT detected parastomal hernia in 18 intervention patients (51.4%) and in 17 control patients (53.1%; p = 1.00). The extent of hernias was similar according to European Hernia Society classification (p = 0.41). Colostomy-related morbidity (32.3% vs 14.3%; p = 0.140) did not differ between the study groups. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by its small size and short follow-up time. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic laparoscopic placement of intraperitoneal onlay mesh does not significantly reduce the overall risk of radiologically detected parastomal hernia after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. However, prophylactic mesh repair was associated with significantly lower risk of clinically detected parastomal hernia.","Vierimaa, Mika; Klintrup, Kai; Biancari, Fausto; Victorzon, Mikael; Carpelan-Holmström, Monika; Kössi, Jyrki; Kellokumpu, Ilmo; Rauvala, Erkki; Ohtonen, Pasi; Mäkelä, Jyrki; Rautio, Tero",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0000000000000443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26347966/,88

METHOD A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded and Cochrane was performed in order to identify studies reporting on TaTME. RESULTS Thirty-six studies (eight case reports, 24 case series and four comparative studies) were identified, reporting 510 patients who underwent TaTME. The mean age ranged from 43 to 80 years and the mean body mass index from 21.7 to 31.8 kg/m(2) . The mean distance of the tumour from the anal verge ranged from 4 to 9.7 cm. The mean operation time ranged from 143 to 450 min and mean operative blood loss from 22 to 225 ml. The ratio of hand-sewn coloanal to stapled anastomoses performed was 2:1. One death was reported and the peri-operative morbidity rate was 35%. The anastomotic leakage rate was 6.1% and the reoperation rate was 3.7%. The mean hospital stay ranged from 4.3 to 16.6 days. The mesorectal excision was described as complete in 88% cases, nearly complete in 6% and incomplete in 6%. The circumferential resection margin was negative in 95% of cases and the distal resection margin was negative in 99.7%. CONCLUSION TaTME is a feasible and reproducible technique, with good quality of oncological resection. Standardization of the technique is required with formal training.

Although an increased likelihood of significant brain lesions with age has been identified in neurologically normal dogs with epileptic seizures, the underlying aetiology of epileptic seizures in cats that present with normal physical and neurological examinations remains unknown. In this cross-sectional study, the authors examined MRI findings in a large population of cats with a normal interictal physical and neurological examination. They hypothesised that age would have an impact on the prevalence of detectable lesions. First, following the guidelines for dogs and in accordance with previous studies, the authors divided the cats into three age groups (aged one year or younger, between one and six, and older than six) and calculated the proportion of cats with a detectable lesion on MRI in these groups. In the first group, 3/32 cats (9.4 per cent) had significant MRI abnormalities that were all consistent with congenital malformation; in the second group, only 5/92 (5.4 per cent) MRI scans were abnormal and in the third group, 15/ 65 (23.1 per cent) cats showed abnormal findings that were predominantly lesions of neoplastic origin. Second, to investigate the impact of age further, data were investigated as a continuous variable using receiver operating characteristic analysis. This indicated an optimal cut-off age of five years, above which MRI abnormalities were more likely, with an increase in the odds of a significant structural lesion increasing by 14 per cent per year.","Raimondi, F; Shihab, N; Gutierrez-Quintana, R; Smith, A; Trevail, R; Sanchez-Masian, D; Smith, P M",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.104142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28386032/,88

We investigated the brain morphometry and memory performance modifications within the same group of severe non-missile traumatic brain injury patients (nmTBI) after about ∼1 year and at ∼ 9 years from the head trauma. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements were carried out with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to determine changes in the cerebral grey and white matter (GM and WM). Contemporarily memory tests were also administered. In comparison with normal control subjects, nmTBI patients showed a significant reduction in the GM and WM after ∼1 year; conversely ∼9 years after the neuropathological event, neurodegenerative changes spared the GM, but a prominent loss was detected in the WM, such as the superior longitudinal fasciculi, the body of the corpus callosum, the optic radiation and the uncinate fasciculus. Memory performance at ∼1 year in comparison with ∼9 years was stable with a subtle but significant trend towards recovery. These data demonstrate that nmTBI patients undergo neurodegenerative processes during the chronic stage affecting mainly the cerebral WM rather than GM. Despite these anatomical brain parenchyma losses, memory performance tends to be stable or even slightly recovered. These neuroanatomical results indicate the possible root for the cognitive disorders on survey traumatic brain injury patients and support new possible treatments to prevent long term WM degeneration of these patients.

HCT is a curative option for a wide range of hematologic malignancies and advances in transplantation medicine have resulted in an increase in HCT survivors. It is anticipated that the number of HCT survivors will more than double from 242,000 in 2020 to approximately 500,000 in 2030. Survivors of HCT are at an increased risk of developing late complications due to exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation in the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT phases and these cumulative exposures have the potential to damage normal tissue. This tissue damage leads to the early onset of chronic health conditions resulting in premature mortality in HCT survivors, who have a 15-year cumulative incidence of severe or life-threatening chronic health conditions exceeding 40%. Due to the significant burden of morbidity in HCT survivors and the delay in the development of long-term complications, this delicate patient population requires life-long monitoring due to the risk for neuropsychological, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, ocular, skeletal, cardiac, endocrine, fertility, and sexual health complications as well as secondary neoplasms. This review will focus on recent advances in screening, monitoring, and therapeutics for late-occurring or long-term complications in HCT survivors.","Saunders, Ila M; Tan, Marisela; Koura, Divya; Young, Rebecca",Pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.2443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32652612/,88

BACKGROUND It is recognized that nursing care delivered by RNs results in better outcomes; however, more evidence is needed to support a change to an all-RN unit. METHODS A mixed unit with RNs and unlicensed assistive personnel was compared with an all-RN unit. Each unit had similar resources. Patient complications and patient and staff satisfaction were measured. Patient complications were reported in terms of 1,000 patient days over the study period to minimize noise fluctuations; t test and χ compared means and frequencies, respectively. RESULTS The all-RN unit had a lower prevalence of patient complications. Patients reported better pain management, and nurse explanation, and reported higher satisfaction on the all-RN unit. CONCLUSIONS An all-RN unit provided superior outcomes compared with a mixed-skill unit without additional costs.","Dzikowicz, Dillon J; Schmitt, Linda A; Gastle, Karen; Skermont, Amanda; Carey, Mary G",The Journal of nursing administration,https://doi.org/10.1097/nna.0000000000000954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181604/,88

This study was designed to laparoscopically examine the real-time behavior of three composite meshes incorporating a chemical adhesion barrier when placed in contact with the visceral peritoneum. MATERIAL AND METHODS The defects of 7 × 5 cm were created in the ventral abdominal wall of 18 New Zealand White rabbits and repaired using Parietex Composite® (n = 6), Sepramesh® (n = 6), or Proceed® (n = 6). At 24 hr, 3, 7, and 14 days postimplant, adhesion formation was quantified by subjecting photographs obtained during laparoscopy to image analysis. At 14 days, specimens of the implants and surrounding host tissue were obtained for histologic, morphometric, and immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS There were no cases of infection and/or rejection of the implant. Adhesion formation followed by laparoscopy 3, 7, and 14 days after implant was significantly lower for Parietex® than the other biomaterials. Degradation of the chemical barrier occurred earliest in Sepramesh®, this barrier being most stable at 14 days for the Parietex® implants. Macrophage counts were significantly greater for Sepramesh®. The thickness of the neoformed peritoneum formed on the three implants varied significantly (p < .05): 276.89 ± 38.87 μm, 84.49 ± 19.05 μm, and 161.97 ± 47.05 μm, respectively for Paritex®, Sepramesh®, and Proceed®. CONCLUSIONS (a) The most stable barrier against biodegradation was that of Parietex®; (b) the first postimplant week was the most critical period for adhesion formation; and (c) all three biomaterials showed good intraperitoneal behavior.","Rodríguez, Marta; Pascual, Gemma; Sotomayor, Sandra; Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Cifuentes, Alberto; Bellón, Juan M",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.3109/08941939.2011.555059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21524177/,88

They can be derived from both human activities and natural processes, and can be found in an indoor and outdoor environment. This paper's fundamental question is possible role of the SAS in stabilizing respiratory aerosols in the closed space. In that context, we discuss results of preliminary measurements of the SAS and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the water-soluble fractions of PM2.5 and PM10 that were sampled simultaneous in primary school inside and outside of the building. The concentrations of SAS were determined using highly sensitive electrochemical measurements. It was observed that SAS and DOC concentrations have been enhanced indoor in both PM fractions. Consistent with these results, a discussion arises on the possibility that SAS could play a crucial role in respiratory droplet dispersion as stabilizers, especially in a closed space. At the same time, we assume that they could prolong lifetime of respiratory aerosols and as well viability of some (possible SARS-CoV-2) virus inside of the droplets.","Ciglenečki, Irena; Orlović-Leko, Palma; Vidović, Kristijan; Tasić, Viša",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33939977/,88

A number of modifications to the ETT are available, aimed at reducing the incidence of VAP. We review here available systems and devices, and clinical data regarding their efficacy. RECENT FINDINGS Three main modifications of ETTs have been developed: coating with antimicrobials, adding a suction channel for the removal of oro-pharyngeal secretions, and modifying the design of the cuff. Each of these interventions has been shown to limit bacterial colonization of the distal airways and to decrease the incidence of VAP. Data on their ultimate effect on related clinical outcomes are still lacking. SUMMARY Modifications of ETTs aimed at decreasing the onset of VAP show promising results. However, the lack of a significant effect on outcomes prompts us to use caution before recommending their widespread use.","Coppadoro, Andrea; Berra, Lorenzo; Bigatello, Luca M",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0b013e328343b733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21252657/,88

For preterm infants, current understanding favours allowing the initial changes to occur prior to cord clamping. Amongst other improved outcomes, systematic reviews have indicated a significant reduction in neonatal blood transfusions following delayed cord clamping. This may be due to a placental transfusion, facilitated by the onset of respiration. If breathing is compromised, placental transfusion may be reduced, resulting in a greater red cell transfusion rate. We designed a randomised trial to investigate whether assisting respiration in this high-risk group of babies would decrease blood transfusion and improve outcomes. The Assisted Breathing before Cord Clamping (ABC) study is a single-centre randomised controlled trial. Preterm infants < 31 weeks that have not established regular breathing before 15 s are randomised to a standard or intervention group. The intervention is intermittent positive pressure ventilation via T piece for 30 s, whilst standard management consists of 30 s of positioning and gentle stimulation. The cord is clamped at 50 s in both groups. The primary outcome is the proportion of infants in each group receiving blood transfusion during the neonatal admission. Secondary outcomes include requirement for resuscitation, the assessment of circulatory status and neonatal outcomes.","Meyer, Michael P; Nevill, Elizabeth",Children,https://doi.org/10.3390/children8050336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925838/,88

M. oleifera flowers are source of protein, fiber, and antioxidants, and are used to treat inflammation and tumors. This work evaluated the antitumor activity of the M. oleifera flower trypsin inhibitor (MoFTI) in sarcoma 180-bearing mice. Swiss female mice were inoculated with sarcoma 180 cells. Seven days later, the animals were treated intraperitoneally for 1 week with daily doses of PBS (control) or MoFTI (15 or 30 mg/kg). For toxicity assessment, water and food consumption, body and organ weights, histological alterations, and blood hematological and biochemical parameters were measured. Treatment with MoFTI caused pronounced reduction (90.1%-97.9%) in tumor weight. The tumors of treated animals had a reduced number of secondary vessels and lower gauge of the primary vessels compared to the control. No significant changes were observed in water and food consumption or in body and organ weights. Histopathological analysis did not indicate damage to the liver, kidneys, and spleen. In conclusion, MoFTI showed antitumor potential, with no clear evidence of toxicity.","Leite de Siqueira Patriota, Leydianne; de Brito Marques Ramos, Dalila; Lima Amorim Dos Santos, Angela Caroline; Silva, Yasmym Araújo; Gama E Silva, Mariana; Lira Torres, Diego José; Procópio, Thamara Figueiredo; Macário de Oliveira, Alisson; Breitenbach Barroso Coelho, Luana Cassandra; Pontual, Emmanuel Viana; Nunes da Silva, Diego César; Guedes Paiva, Patrícia Maria; Barros de Lorena, Vírginia Maria; Mendes, Rosemairy Luciane; Napoleão, Thiago Henrique",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2020.111691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810586/,88

We aimed to describe the relationship between these 2 measurements in mechanically ventilated children and their significance in cases of ARDS. METHODS From June 2013 to December 2013, mechanically ventilated children with various respiratory conditions were included in this study. Demographic data, medical history, and ventilatory parameters were recorded. Volumetric capnography indices (NM3 monitor) were obtained over a period of 5 min preceding a blood sample. Bohr's and Enghoff's dead space, S2 and S3 slopes, and the S2/S3 ratio were calculated breath-by-breath using dedicated software (FlowTool). This study was approved by Ste-Justine research ethics review board. RESULTS Thirty-four subjects were analyzed. Mean VD/VT Bohr was 0.39 ± 0.12, and VD/VT Enghoff was 0.47 ± 0.13 (P = .02). The difference between VD/VT Bohr and VD/VT Enghoff was correlated with PaO2 /FIO2 and with S2/S3. In subjects without lung disease (PaO2 /FIO2 ≥ 300), mean VD/VT Bohr was 0.36 ± 0.11, and VD/VT Enghoff was 0.39 ± 0.11 (P = .056). Two children with status asthmaticus had a major difference between VD/VT Bohr and VD/VT Enghoff in the absence of a low PaO2 /FIO2 . CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that VD/VT Bohr and VD/VT Enghoff are not different when there is no hypoxemia (PaO2 /FIO2 > 300) except in the case of status asthmaticus. In subjects with a low PaO2 /FIO2 , the method to measure VD/VT must be reported, and results cannot be easily compared if the measurement methods are not the same.","Bourgoin, Pierre; Baudin, Florent; Brossier, David; Emeriaud, Guillaume; Wysocki, Marc; Jouvet, Philippe",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.05108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28223465/,88

Both stapling devices were applied to the ultra-low rectum in coronal and sagittal configurations. Extensive measurements were recorded of anatomic landmarks for each cadaver pelvis along with various aspects of access, visibility, and ease of placement for each device. RESULTS The RR reached significantly lower into the pelvis in both the coronal and sagittal positions compared to the CC. The median distance from the pelvic floor was 1.0 cm compared to 2.0 cm in the coronal position, and 1.0 cm versus 3.3 cm placed sagitally, p < 0.0001. Surgeons gave a higher visibility rating with less visual impediment in the sagittal plane using the RR Stapler. Impediment of visibility occurred in only 10% (5/48) of RR applications in the coronal position, compared to a rate of 48% (23/48) using the CC, p = 0.0002. CONCLUSIONS The RR device performed significantly better when compared to the CC stapler in regards to placing the stapler further into the deep pelvis and closer to the pelvic floor, while causing less obstructing of visualization.","Rivadeneira, David E; Verdeja, Juan Carlos; Sonoda, Toyooki",Annals of surgical innovation and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-1164-6-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148602/,88

The goal of this study was to make endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke safer through an in-depth review of the major periprocedural complications observed in the Solitaire FR With Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT) trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS The SWIFT data base was searched for major peri-procedural complications defined as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours, SAH, air emboli, vessel dissection, major groin complications, and emboli to new vascular territories. RESULTS Major peri-procedural complications occurred in 18 of 144 patients (12.5%) as follows: symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 4.9%; air emboli, 1.4%; vessel dissection, 4.2%; major groin complications, 2.8%; and emboli to new vascular territories, 0.7%. Rates of symptomatic intracranial bleeding by subtype were PH1, 0.7%; PH2, 0.7% (PH1 indicates hematoma within ischemic field with some mild space-occupying effect but involving ≤ 30% of the infarcted area; PH2, hematoma within ischemic field with space-occupying effect involving >30% of the infarcted area); intracranial hemorrhage remote from ischemic zone, 0%; intraventricular hemorrhage, 0.7%; and SAH, 3.5%. We did not observe any statistically significant associations of peri-procedural complications with age; type of treatment center; duration of stroke symptoms; NIHSS score, IV thrombolytics, atrial fibrillation, site of vessel occlusion; rescue therapy administered after endovascular treatment; or device. Comparing the Merci with the Solitaire FR retrieval device, we observed symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage (10.9% versus 1.1%; P = .013); symptomatic SAH (7.3% versus 1.1%; P = .07), air emboli (1.8% versus 1.1%; P = 1.0), emboli to new vascular territories (1.8% versus 0%; P = .38), vessel dissection (1.8% versus 4.5%; P = .65), and major groin complications (3.6% versus 7.9%; P = .48). Angiographic vasospasm was common but without clinical sequelae. CONCLUSIONS Understanding of procedural complications is important for treatment of patients with stroke after endovascular treatment. We observed fewer endovascular complications with the Solitaire FR device treatment compared with Merci device treatment, particularly symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage.","Akins, P T; Amar, A P; Pakbaz, R S; Fields, J D",AJNR.

METHODS Patients undergoing curative-intent resection for primary liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) between 2005 and 2017 were analyzed using a large, international multi-institutional dataset. Rates of TO were assessed over time. Factors associated with achieving a TO and the impact of TO on long-term survival were examined. RESULTS Among 1829 patients, 944 (51.6%) and 885 (48.4%) individuals underwent curative-intent resection for HCC and ICC, respectively. Over time, patients were older, more frequently had ASA class > 2, albumin-bilirubin grade 2/3, major vascular invasion and more frequently underwent major liver resection (all p < 0.05). Overall, a total of 1126 (62.0%) patients achieved a TO. No increasing trends in TO rates were noted over the years (ptrend = 0.90). In addition, there was no increasing trend in the TO rates among patients undergoing either major (ptrend = 0.39) or minor liver resection (ptrend = 0.63) over the study period. Achieving a TO was independently associated with 26% and 37% decreased hazards of death among ICC (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.56-0.97) and HCC patients (HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.46-0.85), respectively. CONCLUSION Approximately 6 in 10 patients undergoing surgery for primary liver tumors achieved a TO. While TO rates did not increase over time, TO was associated with better long-term outcomes following liver resection for both HCC and ICC.","Tsilimigras, Diamantis I; Sahara, Kota; Moris, Dimitrios; Mehta, Rittal; Paredes, Anghela Z; Ratti, Francesca; Marques, Hugo P; Soubrane, Olivier; Lam, Vincent; Poultsides, George A; Popescu, Irinel; Alexandrescu, Sorin; Martel, Guillaume; Workneh, Aklile; Guglielmi, Alfredo; Hugh, Tom; Aldrighetti, Luca; Weiss, Matthew; Bauer, Todd W; Maithel, Shishir K; Pulitano, Carlo; Shen, Feng; Koerkamp, Bas Groot; Endo, Itaru; Pawlik, Timothy M",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08548-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388742/,88

163666,Mutation bias implicates RNA editing in a wide range of mammalian RNA viruses,2021-02-10,"The progress of an epidemic in a small closed community is simulated by an agent-based model which allows vaccination and variation. The attributes of the virus are governed by two genetic loci: the P-locus, which determines growth, and the M-locus, which determines immune characteristics. Mutation at either locus modifies the attributes of the virus and leads to evolution through natural selection. For both loci the crucial variable is the potential mutation supply UPot, because evolution is likely to happen when UPot > 1. Mutation at the P-locus causes a limited increase in virulence, which may be affected by vaccine design. Mutation at the M-locus may cause a qualitative shift of dynamic regime from a simple limited epidemic to a perennial endemic disease by giving rise to escape mutants which may themselves mutate. A broad vaccine that remains efficacious despite several mutations at the M-locus prevents this shift and provides protection despite the evolution of the virus. Escape variants may nevertheless arise through recombination after coinfection, and can be suppressed by timely revaccination, using the prevalent strain to design the vaccine.","Bell, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.19.21262307v1?rss=1,88

In addition, the literature also points to an unfavorable perspective on co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, considered an important comorbidity and a predictor of a worse clinical outcome. Description: female child, nine years old, with Down Syndrome, congenital heart disease and prematurity, with significant weight loss and intermittent fever for six months. A week ago, she had an intensification of fever, productive cough and mild respiratory distress. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detectable in nasopharynx swab, chest X-ray with diffuse alveolar infiltrate, chest CT with consolidations, excavation, solid micronodules in a sprouting tree pattern mainly in the right upper and lower lobes. Molecular rapid test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis detectable in gastric lavage. After specific treatment, the patient progressed well and was discharged from the hospital after 72 hours without fever and improvement in her breathing pattern. Discussion: despite the extensive pulmonary involvement, the patient did not require invasive ventilatory support and presented a satisfactory short-term outcome. Therefore, the relevance of the association of Tuberculosis and COVID-19 and other comorbidities in the pediatric age group still remains uncertain.","Stefanuto, Pedro Pollini Gonçalves; Fernandes, Carla Jéssica da Silva; Cruz, Camilla Gomes da; Leite, Robério Dias; Tavares, Lohanna Valeska de Sousa",Rev.

Consequently, it is necessary to define the most relevant blockchain platforms and analyze them taking into consideration a variety of features. Also, there is a need to investigate the logistics growth and the price of Bitcoin on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. The authors have examined modern technologies used by manufacturing companies in the field of fintech in the context of the 2019-2024 period. The results show that sensors and automatic identification take the leading position both at present and in 2024. Artificial intelligence and blockchain are also in demand by manufacturers today, however in the nearest future their ranking positions will increase sixfold from 10% to 60%. In the current paper the authors review the largest companies that effectively use blockchain technology in their businesses. The conducted survey shows that 18% of companies use blockchain technology based on Bitcoin. The authors have analysed a number of Bitcoin transactions for the period from January 2017 to February 2021 and concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a favourable effect on the indicator data. A maximum number of transactions equal to 10.15 million was carried out in July 2020. Using the method of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and statistical estimation methods the authors have revealed an underestimation of the equilibrium state of the empirical distribution of price data and the volume of daily trading of Bitcoin on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange through the channel of the right-hand confidence interval. The blockchain technology based on Bitcoin has positively reacted to the macroeconomic factors such as the COVID-19 pandemics and further growth in Bitcoin transactions is expected.

There is a need to benchmark such models for targeted NLP tasks, and to explore effective pretraining strategies to improve machine learning performance. Results In this work, we addressed the task of health-related social media text classification. We benchmarked five models-RoBERTa, BERTweet, TwitterBERT, BioClinical_BERT, and BioBERT on 22 tasks. We attempted to boost performance for the best models by comparing distinct pretraining strategies-domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT), source-adaptive pretraining (SAPT), and topic-specific pretraining (TSPT). RoBERTa and BERTweet performed comparably in most tasks, and better than others. For pretraining strategies, SAPT performed better or comparable to the off-the-shelf models, and significantly outperformed DAPT. SAPT+TSPT showed consistently high performance, with statistically significant improvement in one task. Our findings demonstrate that RoBERTa and BERTweet are excellent off-the-shelf models for health-related social media text classification, and extended pretraining using SAPT and TSPT can further improve performance.","Guo, Y.; Ge, Y.; Yang, Y.-C.; Al-Garadi, M.

The results indicate the following: students accept myths about domestic violence at the lesser level, they believe that measures to combat coronavirus have led to an increase in all analyzed forms of domestic violence, they do not think that the policingin those cases is well or that victims receive sufficient help and support in pandemics. Differences in students' attitudes towards gender and knowledge of the victim were found, as well as the correlation between attitudes and basic political orientation. The correlations between students' attitudes and acceptance of myths about domestic violence were also established.","Vukadin, I. K.; Skarica, D.",Temida,https://doi.org/10.2298/tem2101025k,88

In attempt to ensure coordination in business relationships, scholars have proposed relational and contractual governance mechanisms. Hence, this study aims to examine the effects of governance mechanisms on coordination in the pharmaceutical business ecosystem (BE), with the potential mediating effects of closeness and opportunistic behavior.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted quantitative approach with cross-sectional survey research design to collect data from the business ecosystem of pharmaceutical company X in Ghana. A structured questionnaire based on a five-point Likert scale was employed to collect data. Analysis was based on 173 institutions (both local and international) selected from pharmaceutical BE. Various validity and reliability checks were conducted before the presentation of the actual analysis, which was conducted using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression in Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS).FindingsThe results of the study revealed that both relational and contractual governance have a direct positive effect on coordination between pharmaceutical BE members and the focal firm. The effect of contractual governance on coordination is however, partially mediated by opportunistic behavior. Finally, closeness also fully mediated the effect of relational governance on coordination.Originality/valueThe study builds on the governance mechanisms in exchange relationship, which was hitherto largely limited to the dyadic and triadic business network, partnerships and strategic alliances studies. The contribution to BE literature provides further understanding into transaction cost economics and relational exchange theory, which was dominantly applied in dyadic relationships ties such as partnerships, alliances and networks.","Wisdom Wise Kwabla, Pomegbe Li Wenyuan Courage Simon Kofi Dogbe Charles Oduro Acheampong Otoo",Cross Cultural & Strategic Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ccsm-01-2020-0013,88

Despite various microfluidics-based separation strategies have been developed, a simple, reliable, and multiplexing separation device that can process a large volume of blood is still missing. Here we show a microbead packed deformable microfluidic system that can efficiently separate highly purified plasma from whole blood as well as retrieve blocked blood cells from the device. Combining microscope imaging, optical tomography scanning, and computational fluidic modeling, a highly accurate model is constructed to understand the link between the mechanical properties of the microfluidics, flow rate, and microbeads packing/leaking, which supports and rationalizes the experimental observations. This deformable nano-sieve device establishes a key technology for centrifuge-free diagnosis and treatment of bloodborne diseases and may be important for the design of next-generation deformable microfluidics for separation applications.","Chen, Xinye; Zhang, Shuhuan; Gan, Yu; Liu, Rui; Wang, Ruo-Qian; Du, Ke",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.444053,88

Traditionally, physical activity has been recognized for its robust modulatory effects on cardiometabolic, neuromusculoskeletal, and immunological health and function. However, a sufficient quantity of emerging studies lends credence to its inclusion to improving mental health, warranting consideration as an adjuvant modality in treating mental illnesses and emotional and behavioral disorders. A series of studies evaluating the impact of physical activity on mental health revealed that achieving physical activity guidelines jointly set forth by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can reduce onset, incidence, and severity of depression as well as mitigating stress and anxiety. The findings of our review lend further support for physical activity as a means to bolster mental health and serve as a powerful resource for working populations. © 2021 The Author(s).

Global policymakers are imposing many measures to slow and reduce the rapid growth of the infections. On the other hand, the healthcare system is encountering significant challenges for a massive number of COVID-19 confirmed or suspected individuals seeking treatment. Therefore, estimating the number of confirmed cases is necessary to provide valuable insights into the growth of the outbreak and facilitate policy making process. In this study, we apply ARIMA models as well as LSTM-based recurrent neural network to forecast the daily cumulative confirmed cases. The LSTM architecture generates more precise forecasting by leveraging both short- and long-term temporal dependencies from the pandemic time series data. Due to the stochastic nature in optimization and random initialization of weights in neural network, the LSTM based model produce less reproducible outcome. In this paper, we propose a reproducible-LSTM (r-LSTM) framework that produces a reproducible and robust results leveraging z-score outlier detection method. We performed five round of nested cross validation to show the consistency in evaluating model performance. The experimental results demonstrate that r-LSTM outperformed the ARIMA model producing minimum MAPE, RMSE, and MAE.","Masum, M.; Shahriar, H.; Haddad, H. M.; Alam, M.

Prior studies in our lab demonstrated that glycosyltransferases in the GT-B structural class, which are characterized by their connection of two Rossman-like domains by a linker region, have conservation of both structure and dynamical motions, despite low sequence conservation, therefore making discoveries found in HepI transferable to other GT-B enzymes. Through a series of 100 nanosecond Molecular Dynamics simulations of HepI in apo enzyme state, and also in the binary and ternary complexes with the native substrates/products. Ligand free energy analysis allowed determination of an anticipated enzymatic path for ligand binding and release. Principle component, dynamic cross correlation and network analyses of the simulation trajectories revealed that there are not only correlated motions between the N- and C-termini, but also that residues within the N-terminal domain communicate via a path that includes substrate proximal residues of the C-terminal domain. Analysis of structural changes, energetics of substrate/products binding and changes in pKa have elucidated a variety of inter- and intradomain interactions that are critical for catalysis. These data corroborate and allow visualization of previous experimental observations of protein conformational changes of HepI. This study has provided valuable insights into the regions involved in HepI conformational rearrangement upon ligand binding, and are likely to enhance efforts to develop new dynamics disrupting enzyme inhibitors for GT-B structural enzymes in the future.","Hassan, Bakar A.; Milicaj, Jozafina; Sham, Yuk Y.; Taylor, Erika A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.16.448588,88

The strong association between the mosque and the Muslim society could not be denied as a mosque is regarded as the pillar and center of Muslim activities. In handling the impact of the pandemic of covid-19 or coronavirus which hit the world in 2020, the government of Malaysia had enforced the Movement Control Order (MCO) in April 2020. The implementation of MCO had directly affected most residents in the country due to the discontinuation of certain economic activities. In dealing with the difficult situation, there is a question of whether the mosque had duly provided its kariah members with the necessary financial support and other assistance. In relation to the issue, research was carried out with the main objective of studying the effectiveness of the roles played by the mosque in taking care of the affairs of their kariah members during the period of MCO. Suggestions for improvements that should be duly considered by the mosque were also highlighted. A field study was undertaken by using questionnaires developed by the researchers. The questionnaires were distributed by using a random sampling technique to the respondents in the state of Melaka. Analysis of the data obtained from the questionnaires was made quantitatively, and it was also supported by qualitative explanations to enable the strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations for improvements to be described in detail.

This complex control is important and not yet sufficiently understood, due to its malfunction in serious diseases like diabetes. Due to the involvement of numerous organs and sub-systems, each with their own intra-cellular control, we have developed a multi-level mathematical model, for glucose homeostasis, which integrates a variety of data. Over the last 10 years, this model has been used to insert new insights from the intra-cellular level into the larger whole-body perspective. However, the original cell-organ-body translation has during these years never been updated, despite several critical shortcomings, which also have not been resolved by other modelling efforts. For this reason, we here present an updated multi-level model. This model provides a more accurate sub-division of how much glucose is being taken up by the different organs. Unlike the original model, we now also account for the different dynamics seen in the different organs. The new model also incorporates the central impact of blood flow on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Each new improvement is clear upon visual inspection, and they are also supported by statistical tests. The final multi-level model describes >300 data points in >40 time-series and dose-response curves, resulting from a large variety of perturbations, describing both intra-cellular processes, organ fluxes, and whole-body meal responses. We hope that this model will serve as an improved basis for future data integration, useful for research and drug developments within diabetes.","Herrgårdh, Tilda; Li, Hao; Nyman, Elin; Cedersund, Gunnar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.21.344499,88

However, this process creates highly self-reactive cells that must be properly selected to suppress autoimmunity. The RAG1 protein contains a ubiquitin ligase domain that stabilizes RAG1 and stimulates RAG endonuclease activity in vitro. We report that mice with a mutation that inactivates the RAG1 ubiquitin ligase in vitro exhibit modestly decreased assembly and altered repertoires of T cell receptor (TCR) β and α genes in thymocytes and impaired thymocyte developmental transitions that require assembly of these genes and signaling by their proteins. The mice also exhibit a combined phenotype of: 1) decreased expression of TCR signaling proteins in thymocytes, 2) less efficient positive selection of conventional αβ T cells and agonist selection of iNKT cells, 3) impaired superantigen-mediated negative selection of highly self-reactive thymocytes, and 4) CD4+ αβ T cells with elevated autoimmune potential. Our findings demonstrate that the RAG1 ubiquitin ligase domain functions in vivo to stimulate TCRβ and TCRα gene assembly and αβ TCR selection, thereby establishing replete αβ TCR diversity and αβ T cell lineages while restraining the inherent autoimmune hazard of creating diverse antigen specificities. Key Points The RAG1 ubiquitin ligase domain stimulates TCR α and β gene assembly in vivo. The RAG1 ubiquitin ligase domain enhances αβ TCR selection of thymocytes. The RAG1 ubiquitin ligase domain limits autoimmune potential of αβ T cells.","Burn, Thomas N.; Miot, Charline; Gordon, Scott; Culberson, Erica J.; Diamond, Tamir; Kreiger, Portia; Hayer, Katharina E.; Bhattacharyya, Anamika; Jones, Jessica M.; Bassing, Craig H.; Behrens, Edward M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425211,88

180066,Local and substrate-specific S-palmitoylation determines subcellular localization of Gαo,2021-08-31,"Sensorimotor synchronization (SMS), the rhythmic coordination of perception and action, is a fundamental human skill that supports many behaviors, from daily repetitive routines to the most complex behavioural coordination, including music and dance (Repp 2005; Repp & Su, 2013). Research on SMS has been mostly conducted in the laboratory using finger tapping paradigms, where participants typically tap with their index finger to a rhythmic sequence of auditory stimuli. However, these experiments require equipment with high temporal fidelity to capture the asynchronies between the time of the tap and the corresponding cue event. Thus, SMS is particularly challenging to study with online research, where variability in participants’ hardware and software can introduce uncontrolled latency and jitter into recordings. Here we present REPP (Rhythm ExPeriment Platform), a novel technology for measuring SMS in online experiments that can work efficiently using the built-in microphone and speakers of standard laptop computers. The audio stimulus (e.g., a metronome or a music excerpt) is played through the speakers and the resulting signal is recorded along with participants’ responses in a single channel. The resulting recording is then analyzed using signal processing techniques to extract and align timing cues with high temporal accuracy. In this paper, we validate REPP through a series of calibration and behavioural experiments. We demonstrate that our technology achieves high temporal accuracy (latency and jitter within 2 ms on average), high test-retest reliability both in the laboratory (r = .87) and online (r = .80), and high concurrent validity (r = .94). We also show that REPP is fully automated and customizable, enabling researchers to monitor experiments in real time and to implement a wide variety of SMS paradigms. We discuss methods for ensuring high recruiting efficiency and data quality, including pre-screening tests and automatic procedures for quality monitoring. REPP can therefore open new avenues for research on SMS that would be nearly impossible in the laboratory, reducing experimental costs while massively increasing the reach, scalability and speed of data collection.","Anglada-Tort, Manuel; Harrison, Peter M.

The aim of our study was to reveal positive personality resources that contribute to buffering the negative effects and its consequences on individual lives. 474 adults 18-81 years old from Siberia (Russia) participated in May 2020 in a survey about the impact of the pandemic and self-isolation and also filled out psychometric measures of well-being and psychological resources (PANAS, PWI, Value of Life Scale, MHC, MSTAT-I, LOT, GSE, Hardiness Survey, SOC, Personal Life Position inventory). One in three respondents reported worsening emotional condition through the previous two weeks and poor adherence to governmental self-isolation recommendations, and 43.6% reported increased financial difficulties. Taking into account not only the negative but also positive subjective effect of the pandemic enabled the improved accuracy in prediction of both well-being and adherence to the governmental measures. The less a person mentioned the positive side of the pandemic, the more strongly their adherence to the governmental measures depended on perceived negative effects (worries and threats). Tolerance for ambiguity, the challenge component of hardiness, harmony with life predicted perceived positive effects after adjusting for negative effects. Psychological resources could play a buffering role as regards the vulnerability to negative psychological effects of the pandemic and help to find positive opportunities.","Bokhan, T.

Results: The number of outpatient visits at ORL-HNS Departement, Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung from March to July was 3723 patients with 1796 of them are oncology outpatients. There was a significant decrease in the number of ORL-HNS outpatient in April and May and began to increase steadily in June and July. This is in line with the start of the big-scale social restriction at the end of March and the start of the ‘new normal’ era in early June. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on oncological care. During COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment of HNC patients has been severely disrupted and caused a decrease in the number of procedures at Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung.","Dewi, Y.

Open green spaces, parks, forests, and gardens-green infrastructure-were instead utilized by citizens as a substitute for stimulating social interactions, sustainable tourism, and green growth. (1) The purpose of this research is to understand whether the availability of green infrastructure relates to the Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor (CCCM) benchmarking project developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission performance. Does new evidence suggest revising the CCCM conceptual framework and related urban policies, especially in relation to the EU Green Deal? (2) Data from OpenStreetMap was used to count the amount of green infrastructure in 184 European Cities covered by the CCM and was then correlated with the sub-indices of the CCCM. (3) We found a moderately positive correlation of green infrastructure with the cultural vibrancy of a city and a weak positive correlation with the enabling environment of a city. (4) In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU Green Deal and several other policy initiatives aimed at urban greening, we recommend that the CCCM include an Urban Nature sub-index as one of the performance indicators of the CCCM. An Urban Nature sub-index will broaden the goal of the CCCM by providing policymakers with a better understanding of actions and strategies to allow culture to contribute to social inclusion and green growth strategies in cities.","Kumar, V.; Vuilliomenet, A.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13148052,88

The cloud-based part of the system makes storing and processing easier, especially that the data generated by ambient assisted living systems are huge, particularly with patients suffering from chronic diseases and require more frequent readings. On the other hand, the local part of the system monitors the patients in case of any sudden interruptions on the internet or any failure in the cloud system. The proposed model uses context-aware techniques by monitoring different physiological signals, surrounding ambient conditions, along with the patient activities simultaneously to build a better understanding of the health status of the COVID-19 patient in real-time, as the system will help doctors to detect if the patient has symptoms of the COVID-19. The results obtained experimentally prove how our proposed model can effectively monitor patients and detect emergencies accurately in imbalanced datasets through a case study on a patient with normotensive disorder. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Waleed, A.; Elghamrawy, S.

A baseline model was previously developed and calibrated for pre-COVID conditions as MATSim-NYC. A new COVID model is calibrated that represents travel behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic by recalibrating the population agendas to include work-from-home and re-estimating the mode choice model for MATSim-NYC to fit observed traffic and transit ridership data. Assuming the change in behavior exhibits inertia during reopening, we analyze the increase in car traffic due to the phased reopen plan guided by the state government of New York. Four reopening phases and two reopening scenarios (with and without transit capacity restrictions) are analyzed. A Phase 4 reopening with 100% transit capacity may only see as much as 73% of pre-COVID ridership and an increase in the number of car trips by as much as 142% of pre-pandemic levels. Limiting transit capacity to 50% would decrease transit ridership further from 73% to 64% while increasing car trips to as much as 143% of pre-pandemic levels. While the increase appears small, the impact on consumer surplus is disproportionately large due to already increased traffic congestion. Many of the trips also get shifted to other modes like micromobility. The findings imply that a transit capacity restriction policy during reopening needs to be accompanied by (1) support for micromobility modes, particularly in non-Manhattan boroughs, and (2) congestion alleviation policies that focus on reducing traffic in Manhattan, such as cordon-based pricing.","Wang, Ding; He, Brian Yueshuai; Gao, Jingqin; Chow, Joseph Y.

In January 2020, when the world was fearing a major war between USA and Iran, who knew that a micro-object would create such destruction that would lock the entire globe. In December 2019, Chinese city of Wuhan reported an increase in the number of patients showing pneumonia-like symptoms and the researchers identified it to be ""novel- Corona virus"". This was a new virus strain that has not previously affected the human body. It did not discriminate between people on the basis of boundaries, financial status, race, religion, gender, age and any other aspect which a human can identify as a basis of discrimination. This virus has now wrecked almost two-hundred countries across the globe and has taken a heavy toll on the global economy. The pandemic has changed the lifestyle globally as work from home has become the new normal. The devastating situation has generated new challenges in the financial and technical activities of the power sector and hence most of the utilities around the world initiated a disaster management plan to tackle the threats. The report seeks to provide a comprehensive coverage of the prevailing untoward situation particularly in the energy sector, the challenges which have occurred and the various opportunities to uplift the countries by the use of renewable and green resources.

184365,Pokeweed antiviral protein inhibits brome mosaic virus replication in plant cells.,2005,"Background: Airborne particulate matter has been suggested as a co-factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides the deleterious effect this pollutant has on pulmonary immunity and the propagation of respiratory ACE-2 receptors (angiotensin converting enzyme II), the SARS-CoV-2 point of entry, particulate matter has also been proposed as a vector for this virus transmission. Particulate matter may also be a marker for anthropogenic activity acting as a surrogate for increased human to human contact, increasing both transmission and the mutagenic viral load. Genes coding for SARS-CoV-2 have been detected on airborne particulate matter and its proximity to the virus, may have caused this pollutant to act as a mutagen causing the inception of SARS-CoV-2 variants and simultaneously being genotoxic to the progenitor viruses, differentially favouring variant emergence. Since the initial phases of the pandemic, a multitude of SARS-CoV-2 variants have been detected, but the few that survive to promulgate human infection have increased transmissibility. It also appears that there is a limited set of persistent mutations SARS-CoV-2 can produce. This set of mutations has been found in widely disparate and distant regions. This may suggest that besides intra-host mutation in an inflammatory ambience, an ubiquitous factor such as an environmental mutagen, may have resulted in convergent evolution leading to the emergence of similar variants. This paper examines a possible association in a multi-modal manner between the airborne pollutant PM2.5 and the emergence of ten of the most clinically and epidemiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods: The daily average levels of PM2.5 of a number of cities, where variants were detected, were obtained from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI), a real-time assessment of atmospheric pollution. PM2.5 levels were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 variants including Variants of Concern (VOC) or Variants of Interest (VOI). These variants included the G614 variant in Beijing, the 20A.EU1 variant in Valencia, the B.1.351 variant in South Africa, the B.1.1.7 variant in the UK, the USA variants B.1.429 in Los Angeles, B.1.2 in Louisiana and New Mexico, the B.1.526 variant found in New York, the variant B.1.1.248 in Brazil. During mid-March 2021, the B.1.617 variant first detected in October 2020, surged in Nagpur, India and the R.1 variant was detected in Kentucky U.S.A. The average daily PM2.5 levels were assessed, the evaluation initiating just before the occurrence of the first spike/s in this pollutant s atmospheric concentration, till after the emergence of the variants. Where available the daily number of new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed was matched to the PM2.5 levels. Results: There appears a common pattern of PM2.5 in most of the regions prior and during the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variants. An initial spike/s of PM2.5 were noted on average 50 days prior to the emergence of the variants and another smaller spike/s in PM2.5 were noted just before or contemporaneous with the emergence of the variant. Prior to the emergence of to the G614 variant in Beijing, the average PM2.5 level during its peaks was 153.4mug/m3 (SD+/-63.9) to settle to a baseline of 94.4mug/m3 (SD+/-47.8)(p<0.001). Before the appearance of the 20A.EU1 variant in Valencia, the PM2.5 spikes averaged at 61.3mug/m3 (SD+/-21.8) to decrease to a mean of 41.2mug/m3 (SD+/-15.5) (p<0.04). In Kent, U.K. a solitary PM2.5 spike averaged 82mug/m3 (SD+/-29) before the detection of the B.1.1.7 and following the PM2.5 spike the baseline level of this pollutant was 27.8mug/m3 (SD+/-18.0) (p<0.03). In Nelson Mandela Bay South Africa, where B.1.351 was first detected, the PM2.5 mean baseline level was reported as 40.4mug/m3 (SD+/-14.0), while prior to this variant s emergence, the PM2.5 spike averaged 85.1mug/m3 (SD +/-17.3)(p<0.0001). In Brazil the average PM2.5 during its spike was 107.4mug/m3 (SD+/-34.2) before B.1.1.248 variant emerged and after the spike the baseline PM2.5 was 48.3mug/m3 (SD+/-18) (p<0.0001). In the USA the average PM2.5 peak levels prior to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variants were 118mug/m3 (SD+/-28.8) in Los Angeles (baseline 66.1mug/m3 (SD+/-25.1), 75+/-27.8mug/m3 (baseline 43.3(SD+/-14.4)mug/m3 in Louisiana, 71.4+/-11.3mug/m3 (baseline 43.6(SD+/-12.4)mug/m3 New Mexico, 54.3+/-13.8mug/m3 (baseline 34.4(SD+/-11.6)mug/m3 in New York and 37.7+/-7mug/m3 (baseline 28.5 SD+/-6.8)mug/m3 in Eastern Kentucky. All the spike patterns of PM2.5 levels noted in the USA were significantly higher when compared to their respective baselines (p<0.0001). Prior to the surge of the variant in India, the PM2.5 spike in Nagpur averaged 166.8+/-10.8mug/m3 (baseline 123.2SD+/-16.9mug/m3) (p<0.0001). In the regions where the quantity of daily new cases was available, a number of significant correlations were obtained between PM2.5 levels and the number of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 in most of the regions reviewed. Conclusion: There appears to be an association between the levels of atmospheric PM2.5 and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. In most regions two groups of spike/s of PM2.5 were noted prior to the emergence of these variants. The first PM2.5 spike/s approximately 50 days before the variant emergence may suggest that anthropogenic activity was increased possibly reflecting augmented human to human contact, consequently increasing the viral burden of the progenitor virus. The first PM2.5 spike may also have made populations more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 through the propagation of the respiratory ACE receptor. There is the potential that coronavirus-laden, PM2.5 induced mutagenesis in the SARS-CoV-2 genome resulted in establishing persistent variants and contemporaneously was genotoxic to the progenitor virus, expediting the latter s disappearance. PM2.5 may have further diminished the pulmonary immunity inviting further viral invasion. The second spike/s prior to the emergence of variants, may suggest another anthropogenic spike in human activity. With the second spike/s in PM2.5, this airborne pollutant may have acted as a viral vector encouraging variant emergence. This may have not only led to increasing viral transmission, catalysed by the preceding risk factors, but resulted in an overwhelming viral load, providing fertile ground for variant emergence. The above findings suggest that antecedent spikes in PM2.5 prior to variant emergence not only contributed to transmission, but also impacted the immediate viral environs which resulted in its natural selection, effecting SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Feeding increased serum levels of LPS, which is known to induce multiple genes in immune cells. Notably, LPS together with insulin potently induced IL-10 in macrophages, which could also be detected in the postprandial portal vein in vivo. In cultured hepatocytes, physiological levels of insulin alone did not suppress gluconeogenic gene expression, although when added together with medium from macrophages stimulated with LPS and insulin, they were markedly suppressed. This suppression was not seen in medium from macrophages of IL-10 knockout mice, showing this to be an IL-10 dependent process. Plasma glucose concentration ad libitum was elevated in mice injected with adenovirus encoding shRNA targeting the IL-10 receptor, and the normal postprandial suppression of gluconeogenic genes in liver was compromised, showing the importance of the IL-10 signal in postprandial glucose metabolism. Furthermore, myeloid-specific knockout of Akt1 and Akt2 resulted in similar phenotypes that were rescued by incrementing mTOR signaling, pointing to an Akt-mTOR dependent mechanism. As whole-body deficiency of IL-10 has been reported to decrease body weight and increase insulin sensitivity, we assessed the effect of myeloid deficiency of IL-10 by conducting bone marrow transfer from IL-10 knockout mice to wild type mice. While these phenotypes were recapitulated, postprandial glucose production was not improved despite markedly increased whole-body insulin sensitivity. These results pointed to the differential actions of myeloid IL-10 where baseline production maintains normal body weight, while postprandial increases in the hepatic-portal system suppresses hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression, collectively showing the need for context-dependent administration of IL-10 based therapies.

185056,Coronavirus JHM: a virion-associated protein kinase.,1981,"Accreditation has become an important benchmark for healthcare organisations, and accordingly, many government hospitals in Kerala got accredited with national level (NABH) and state level (KASH) accreditation programmes. This study examined the quality of public healthcare delivery in these accredited hospitals while having a comparison with the non-accredited hospitals. It also compared the impact of national and state-level accreditation programmes in Kerala public healthcare settings. This cross-sectional study conducted between July 2017 and July 2018, employing a positivist approach using stratified random sampling. In total, 621 samples were collected from in-patients of both accredited (NABH and KASH) (312) and nonaccredited (309) public healthcare institutions in Kerala. Nine constructs overarching the quality of healthcare delivery and patient satisfaction construct are used in the study. The study found that patient satisfaction is identical in both accredited and nonaccredited hospitals (M=4.28). Patient satisfaction in NABH accredited hospital (M=4.27{+/-}0.67874) is lower than that of KASH accredited hospital (M=4.30{+/-}1.25417). The mean score of six constructs of quality healthcare delivery of KASH accredited hospitals is higher than NABH accredited. Thus, the study concluded that accreditation, regardless of its type, has no impact on patient satisfaction even though the accreditation process slightly improved different dimensions of quality healthcare delivery.","Joseph, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.22.20170837v1?rss=1,88

In general, employees participate in job crafting to alter or redefine their tasks and relationships to enhance their meaningfulness. Drawing on Weick?s sensemaking theory, this article explores how nurses working directly with COVID-19 patients participate in job crafting amid a pandemic crisis. It proposes an iterative conceptual framework in which sensemaking via the cycle of enactment, selection, and retention informs job crafting, thus contributing to emergent organizing. This enactment of emergent organizing provides fodder for further sensemaking, which highlights the symbiotic relationship between sensemaking and job crafting. Practically speaking, in order to facilitate sensemaking, job crafting, and organizing, management must acknowledge and impart flexibility, and must be open to impromptu thinking by nurses.","Sahay, Surabhi Dwyer Maria",Management Communication Quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1177/08933189211034170,88

As we all know Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still a global issue for entire world and people are expressing their emotions, thoughts, and opinions about this issue with help of Twitter, Facebook, and other Media. In this paper we have collected public tweets from Twitter which are talked about the COVID-19 global pandemic and applied a Convolutional Neural Network with Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-Bi-LSTM) hybrid Deep Learning algorithm to detect the user's outlook on this pandemic whether they have positive feelings, negative feelings, or neutral feelings. The proposed method used preprocessing techniques to clean the data and used a word embedding pre-trained model to extract word embedding for rare words in our corpus with the help of FastText and Globe pre-trained models. The CNN-Bi-LSTM hybrid model evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 evaluation techniques. The experimental result has been shown 99.33% accuracy using CNN-Bi-LSTM with FastText pre-trained model, and 97.55% accuracy using CNN-Bi-LSTM with GloVe pre-trained model.","Mengistie, T.

However, as responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US showed, political partisanship and mistrust of science can reduce public willingness to adopt recommended behaviors such as wearing a mask or receiving a vaccination. To better understand this phenomenon, we explored attitudes toward science using social media posts (tweets) that were linked to counties in the US through their locations. The data allowed us to study how attitudes towards science relate to the socioeconomic characteristics of communities in places from which people tweet. Our analysis revealed three types of communities with distinct behaviors: those in large metro centers, smaller urban places, and rural areas. While partisanship and race are strongly associated with the share of anti-science users across all communities, income was negatively and positively associated with anti-science attitudes in suburban and rural areas, respectively. We observed that emotions in tweets, specifically negative high arousal emotions, are expressed among suburban and rural communities by many anti-science users, but not in communities in large urban places. These trends were not apparent when pooled across all counties. In addition, we found that anti-science attitudes expressed five years earlier were significantly associated with lower COVID-19 vaccination rates. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using spatially resolved social media data to monitor public attitudes on issues of social importance.","Hu, M.

185510,Molecular determinants of substrate specificity for Semliki Forest virus nonstructural protease.,2006,"Since 2019, the world has been affected by COVID-19. The tourism industry, in particular, has suffered greatly. For instance, widespread travel restrictions have directly led to unemployment among tourism practitioners, especially tour leaders engaged in leading overseas tour groups. In the current environment, tour companies are limited to training only, and as such have chosen to focus on strengthening three critical areas: the leadership, psychological, and professional skills of their tour operators. This study contributes to the tourism literature by examining the direct and indirect effects of accountability on ownership of organization behavior (OOB) and tour leader personality in the context of the tourism industry, in order to expand the sustainable development of the tourism industry. The definition of OOB is that the psychological influence of the tour leader will affect their behavior, and the psychological consequences of the tour leader will be affected by experience (such as seniority of the team leader or number of tour groups). A structured questionnaire was used to survey tour leaders who hold an international license in Taiwan. The direct mediating influences of competence and having a place (psychological antecedents) on their accountability was confirmed. OOB also partially mediated the direct positive effect of the practice mechanism on their accountability. Our results also confirmed that competence and having a place are important predictors of the practice mechanism, and are better predictors of accountability than OOB. These findings should enhance the organizational design and marketing options available to travel agency businesses, as well as offering guidance to managers attempting to shape and mold their organizational culture and the behaviors of tour leaders associated with the implementation of OOB, in order to improve accountability in the sustainable business model of tourism.","Rong-Ho, Lin Yu-Chuan Huang Nai-Wen Chang Shih-Wei Wu Yu-Chang Ke",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137136,88
185530,Characterization of a torovirus main proteinase.,2006,"Proteostatic stress initiates a transcriptional response that is unique to the stress condition, yet the regulatory mechanisms underlying the distinct gene expression patterns observed in stressed cells remains unknown. Using a functional genomic approach, we investigated how activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key transcription factor in the unfolded protein response (UPR), regulates target genes. We first designed a computational strategy to define Atf6 target genes based on the evolutionary conservation of predicted ATF6 binding in gene promoters, identifying 652 conserved putative Atf6 target (CPAT) genes. CPATs were overrepresented for genes functioning in the UPR, however, the majority functioned in cellular processes unrelated to proteostasis, including small molecule metabolism and development. Functional studies of stress-independent and toxicant based Atf6 activation in zebrafish livers showed that the pattern of CPAT expression in response to Atf6 overexpression, alcohol and arsenic was unique. Only 34 CPATs were differentially expressed in all conditions, indicating that Atf6 is sufficient to regulate a small subset of CPATs. Blocking Atf6 using Ceapins in zebrafish demonstrated that Atf6 is necessary for activation of these genes in response to arsenic. We investigated CPAT during physiologically mediated hepatocyte stress using liver regeneration in mice as a model. Over half of all CPATs were differentially expressed during this process. This was attributed to the permissive chromatin environment in quiescent livers on the promoters of these genes, characterized by the absence of H3K27me3 and enrichment of H3K4me3. Taken together, these data uncover a complex transcriptional response to Atf6 activation and implicate a permissive epigenome as a mechanism by which distinct transcriptional responses are regulated by Atf6.","Nair, Anjana Ramdas; Lakhiani, Priyanka; Zhang, Chi; Macchi, Filippo; Sadler, Kirsten C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.10.434889,88

Objectives: to evaluate the frequency of anxiety-depressive symptoms and stress levels in patients with various rheumatic diseases (RD) and hospital workers of the Moscow Institute of Rheumatology in Russia Methods: 148 RD inpatients, mostly with rheumatoid arthritis (44 (30%)), spondyloarthritis (31 (21%)), systemic lupus erythematosus (28 (19%)), systemic sclerosis (10 (7%)), primary Sjögren syndrome (7 (5%)), polymyositis (6 (4%)), and 32 hospital workers of the Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology were screened using the DASS-21 (The Depression, Anxiety, Stress scales-21, Lovibond S.H. & Lovibond P.F. (1995)) in the period from July to November 2020. The majority of RD-patients and hospital workers were women (73 and 93% resp). The mean age (M±SD) of RD-patients and hospital workers was 43,2±16,2 and 40,7±14,6 years resp. Results: The frequency of depression (34,5% vs 34,4%), anxiety (41,9% vs 34,4%) and post-traumatic stress (27,7% vs 25,0%) in RD-patients were found to be comparable to that found among the hospital workers, and the level of anxiety was statistically significantly higher in patients (2,0 [1,0;6,0] vs 1,0 [0;4,5], p=0,038). There was no association of depression, anxiety and stress with RD activity. There was a weak positive correlation between the level of depression (R=0,30), anxiety (R=0,26) and stress (R=0,33) with a higher dose of glucocorticoids taken by patients, as well as a negative correlation between the severity of depression (R=-0,7) and stress (R=-0,17) with the age of patients and hospital workers. 19 (12,8%) of RD-patients and 7 (21,9%) of hospital workers had contracted COVID-19 in previous months. Survivors of the COVID-19, both among RD-patients and hospital workers, were more likely to experience symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress: accordingly, depression had 31,6% vs 27,9%, anxiety -47,4% vs 41,9% and stress -26,3% vs 28,7% RD-patients who had been ill or not, and among hospital workers: depression -28,6% vs 36,0%, anxiety -42,8% vs 28,0%, stress -42,8% vs 20,0%. 66,4% of RD-patients and 71,9% of hospital workers reported that the pandemic had a psychological impact on them. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a significant negative psychological impact on both RD-patients and hospital workers. About 25-47% of patients and hospital workers experienced significant level of depression, anxiety and stress, and their frequency was higher in those who had contracted COVID-19.","Lisitsyna, T.; Veltishchev, D.; Borisova, A.; Nasonov, E.; Lila, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1335,88

Since the start of the pandemic, sectoral unevenness of growth, employment inequality, and corporate liquidity preferences have been accelerated. These patterns reflect a continuation of trends that have been developed since the 1997 Asian crisis. As the main approach in examining the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis and the government policy implemented to cope with them, I focus on the unequal distribution of output and employment shocks across businesses, workers, and households, through which I derive the macroeconomic implications of the pandemic crisis for the Korean economy. Throughout 2020, South Korea has been witnessing income redistribution favorable to big corporations and banks and away from small businesses, non-standard workers, and low-income households. These widening disparities have important macroeconomic implications.Alternate abstract:En este trabajo se examinan los principales impactos del COVID-19 en la economía de Corea del Sur en 2020.

Design Service delivery evaluation. Setting All primary and secondary care providers in the South West of England, approximate population 4 million. Participants 3890 patients aged [≥]50 years presenting in primary care with low-risk symptoms of colorectal cancer, following NICE NG12 and DG30, with a FIT (HM-JACKarc assay) analysed from 01/06/2018 to 31/12/2018. Main outcome measures Diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Results 618 (15.9%) patients tested positive at a threshold of 10g Hb/g faeces (median 36g Hb/g faeces (IQR 17 to 149)); 458 (74.1%) of these had an urgent referral to specialist lower gastrointestinal (GI) services within three months. 43 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. 3272 patients tested negative; 324 (9.9%) were referred on an urgent lower GI pathway in secondary care within three months. 8 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. The positive predictive value of FIT for colorectal cancer in the low-risk symptomatic population was 7.0% (95% CI 5.1% to 9.3%) and the negative predictive value was 99.8% (CI 99.5% to 99.9%). Sensitivity was 84.3% (CI 71.4% to 93.0%), and specificity 85.0% (CI 83.8% to 86.1%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (CI 0.86 to 0.96). A threshold of 37g Hb/g faeces would identify patients with an individual 3% risk of cancer. Conclusions FIT performs exceptionally well to triage patients with low-risk symptoms of colorectal cancer in primary care. The threshold value of 10g Hb/g faeces represents a risk of cancer below 3% used in current NICE guidance; however, this lower value may be appropriate to meet the national aspiration of improving cancer diagnostics.","Bailey, S.

By analysis of Ii-transferrin receptor (TR) chimera trafficking, we have identified sorting signals in the Ii cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane region that mediate this process. Two non-tyrosine-based sorting signals in the Ii cytoplasmic tail were identified that mediate localization to plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits and promote rapid endocytosis. Leu7 and Ile8 were required for the activity of the signal most distal to the cell membrane whereas Pro15 Met16 Leu17 were important for the membrane-proximal signal. The same or overlapping non- tyrosine-based sorting signals are essential for delivery of Ii-TR chimeras, either by an intracellular route or via the plasma membrane, to an endocytic compartment where they are rapidly degraded. The Ii transmembrane region is also required for efficient delivery to this endocytic processing compartment and contains a signal distinct from the Ii cytoplasmic tail. More than 80% of the Ii-TR chimera containing the Ii cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane region is delivered directly to the endocytic pathway by an intracellular route, implying that the Ii sorting signals are efficiently recognized by sorting machinery located in the trans-Golgi.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2200027/,88

A. Khromykh and E. G. Westaway, J. Virol. 71:1497-1505, 1997]) was used for rescue and propagation of KUN viruses defective in the RNA polymerase gene (NS5). A new infectious full-length KUN virus cDNA clone, FLSDX, prepared from our previously described cDNA clone pAKUN (A. A. Khromykh and E. G. Westaway, J. Virol. 68:4580-4588, 1994) and possessing approximately 10(5)-fold higher specific infectivity than that of pAKUN, was used for preparation of defective mutants. Deletions of the predicted RNA polymerase motif GDD (producing FLdGDD) and of one of the predicted methyltransferase motifs (S-adenosylmethionine [SAM] binding site, producing FLdSAM) were introduced separately into FLSDX. Transcription and transfection of FLdGDD and FLdSAM RNAs into repBHK cells but not into normal BHK cells resulted in their replication and the recovery of defective viruses able to replicate only in repBHK cells. Reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing analyses showed retention of the introduced deletions in the genomes of the recovered viruses. Retention of these deletions, as well as our inability to recover viruses able to replicate in normal BHK cells after prolonged incubation (for 7 days) of FLdGDD- or FLdSAM-transfected repBHK cells, excluded the possibility that recombination had occurred between the deleted defective NS5 genes present in transfected RNAs and the functional NS5 gene present in the repBHK cells. An RNA with a point mutation in the GDD motif (FLGVD) was also complemented in transfected repBHK cells, and defective virus was recovered by day 3 after transfection. However, in contrast to the results with FLdGDD and FLdSAM RNAs, prolonged (4 days or more) incubation of FLGVD RNA in normal BHK cells allowed recovery of a virus in which the GVD mutation had reverted via a single base change to the wild-type GDD sequence. Overall, these results represent the first demonstration of trans-complementation of defective flavivirus RNAs with deleterious deletions in the flavivirus RNA polymerase gene NS5. The complementation system described here may prove to be useful for the in vivo complementation of deletions and mutations affecting functional domains or the essential secondary structure in any of the other flavivirus nonstructural proteins.","Khromykh, A A; Kenney, M T; Westaway, E G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9696822/,88

RECENT FINDINGS Following the introduction of nucleic acid testing for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, the American Red Cross estimates the risk of transfusion-transmitted human immunodeficiency virus to be 1:1,215,000 (per unit transfused) and 1:1,935,000 for transfusion-transmitted hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis B virus nucleic acid testing has not been implemented, and the risk of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis B virus in the United States remains relatively high at an estimated 1:205,000. The risk of transfusion-transmitted human T-cell leukemia virus I/II is 1:2,993,000, based on Red Cross estimates.

187377,Coronavirus species specificity: murine coronavirus binds to a mouse-specific epitope on its carcinoembryonic antigen-related receptor glycoprotein.,1992,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease for which no simple antemortem diagnostic assay is available. A new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has recently been developed that targets the spike protein region of the FIP virus (FIPV) and can identify specific mutations (M1030L or S1032A), the presence of which indicates a shift from feline enteric coronavirus (FeCV) to FIPV. This test will only be useful in the geographical region of interest, however, if the FIP viruses contain these mutations. The primary objective of this study was to determine the presence of the M1030L or S1032A mutations in FeCV derived from stool samples from a selected group of healthy cats from households and shelters and determine how many of these cats excrete FeCV. The secondary objective was to evaluate how often these specific FIPV mutations were present in tissue samples derived from cats diagnosed with FIP at postmortem examination. Feline enteric coronavirus (FeCV) was detected in 46% of fecal samples (86/185), all were FeCV type 1, with no difference between household or shelter cats. Only 45% of the FIPV analyzed contained the previously reported M1030L or S1032A mutations. It should be noted that, as the pathological tissue samples were opportunistically obtained and not specifically obtained for PCR testing, caution is warranted in interpreting these data.","McKay, Laura A; Meachem, Melissa; Snead, Elisabeth; Brannen, Terri; Mutlow, Natasha; Ruelle, Liz; Davies, Jennifer L; van der Meer, Frank",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31949325/,88
187503,Crystal structure of infectious bursal disease virus VP2 subviral particle at 2.6A resolution: implications in virion assembly and immunogenicity.,2006,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Neonatal respiratory disease, particularly bronchopulmonary dysplasia, remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in newborn infants. Recent evidence suggests nosocomially acquired viral respiratory tract infections (VRTIs) are not uncommon in the NICU. The goal of this study was to assess the association between nosocomial VRTIs, neonatal respiratory disease, and the health care related costs. METHODS A matched case-control study was conducted in 2 tertiary NICUs during a 6-year period in Nottingham, United Kingdom. Case subjects were symptomatic neonatal patients with a confirmed real-time polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of a VRTI. Matched controls had never tested positive for a VRTI. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test for associations with key respiratory outcomes. RESULTS There were 7995 admissions during the study period, with 92 case subjects matched to 183 control subjects. Baseline characteristics were similar, with a median gestation of 29 weeks. Rhinovirus was found in 74% of VRTIs. During VRTIs, 51% of infants needed escalation of respiratory support, and case subjects required significantly more respiratory pressure support overall (25 vs 7 days; P < .001). Case subjects spent longer in the hospital (76 vs 41 days; P < .001), twice as many required home oxygen (37%; odds ratio: 3.94 [95% confidence interval: 1.92-8.06]; P < .001), and in-hospital care costs were significantly higher (£49 664 [$71 861] vs £22 155 [$32 057]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Nosocomial VRTIs in neonatal patients are associated with significant greater respiratory morbidity and health care costs. Prevention efforts must be explored.","Zinna, Shairbanu; Lakshmanan, Arthi; Tan, Shin; McClaughry, Rebecca; Clarkson, Martin; Soo, Shiu; Szatkowski, Lisa; Sharkey, Don",Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940783/,88

187648,Persistence and transmission of natural type I feline coronavirus infection.,2003,"Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) is a ribosome-inactivating protein isolated from the pokeweed plant (Phytolacca americana) that inhibits the proliferation of several plant and animal viruses. We have shown previously that PAP and nontoxic mutants of PAP can directly depurinate brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA in vitro, resulting in reduced viral protein translation. Here we expand on these initial studies and, using a barley protoplast system, demonstrate that recombinant PAP and nontoxic mutants isolated from E. coli are able to reduce the accumulation of BMV RNAs in vivo. Pretreatment of only BMV RNA3 with PAP prior to transfection of barley protoplasts reduced the accumulation of all BMV RNAs, with a more severe effect on subgenomic RNA4 levels. Using in vitro RNA synthesis assays, we show that a depurinated template causes the BMV replicase to stall at the template nucleotide adjacent to the missing base. These results provide new insight into the antiviral mechanism of PAP, namely that PAP depurination of BMV RNA impedes both RNA replication and subgenomic RNA transcription. These novel activities are distinct from the PAP-induced reduction of viral RNA translation and represent new targets for the inhibition of viral infection.","Picard, Daniel; Kao, C Cheng; Hudak, Katalin A",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15764597/,88

METHODS A 55-year old female patient with critical ill COVID-19 was admitted in Taizhou Hospital on January 19, 2020. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 80 mg on the 2nd day after admission. Thereafter, the dose was adjusted in a timely manner and the therapy lasted for 13 days. The peripheral lymphocyte subsets (CD3+T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK cells, B cells), as well as serum levels of lymphocyte factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ) were dynamically monitored. RESULTS On D1 of admission, the numbers of peripheral blood CD3+ T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells were significantly lower than the normal range. With the improvement of the disease, the numbers of CD3+ T, CD8+ T and CD4 + T cells gradually recovered and showed a linear growth trend (linear fitting equation: Y=18.59X+109.4, P<0.05). On D2 of admission, the patient's IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher than normal values, IFN-γ was at a normal high value, and then rapidly decreased; IL-2, IL-4, and TNF-α were all in the normal range. On the D6 and D7, the IL-6 and IL-10 decreased to the normal range for the first time. On the D18, the sputum virus nucleic acid test was negative for the first time, and the fecal virus nucleic acid test was still positive; on the D20 the sputum and fecal virus nucleic acid test were both negative. On D34, the patient recovered and was discharged. At the discharge the muscle strength score of the patient was 44 and the daily life ability evaluation was 90. CONCLUSIONS In the absence of effective antiviral drugs, early use of appropriate doses of corticosteroids in critically ill patient with COVID-19 can quickly alleviate inflammatory response and improve clinical symptoms, however, it may reduce the number of T cells, and to adjust the dose in time is necessary.","Zhagn, Sheng; Li, Danping; Chen, Huazhong; Zheng, Dan; Zhou, Yiping; Chen, Baoguo; Shi, Weiwu; Lin, Ronghai",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Five boars were inoculated intranasally with CSFV isolate propagated in PK15 cells. Two boars inoculated with the supernatant of noninfected PK15 cells were kept as controls. Semen and serum samples were collected twice weekly for 63 days postinoculation (dpi). Samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to CSFV by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for the presence of CSFV nucleic acid by seminested RT-PCR. Antibodies to CSFV could be detected as early as 7 dpi in 1 boar, and all 5 infected boars were found positive by 14 dpi. CSFV from boar semen was infrequently identified by virus isolation compared with seminested RT-PCR. CSFV nucleic acid was detected in semen by seminested RT-PCR as early as 7 dpi in 3 infected boars and persistently thereafter in all 5 infected boars until 63 dpi. When separated fractions of CSFV-contaminated semen were analyzed by the seminested RT-PCR, the CSFV nucleic acid was detected mainly in seminal fluid and occasionally in nonsperm cells. CSFV antigen was also detected in nonsperm cells from semen smear by immunohistochemistry. Thus, infection via semen, specially through CSFV-infected seminal fluid, seems to be a major route of transmission of CSFV.","Choi, Changsun; Chae, Chanhee","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12580293/,88

We analyzed the scientific output related to pre-hospital emergency in the past two decades, aiming to evaluate the publication status of the literature related to pre-hospital emergency through bibliometrics analysis, and hope to provide enlightenment of trends and hotspots for the development of pre-hospital emergency. METHOD By web of science, all literature on pre-hospital emergency from 2000 to 2 October 2020 was retrieved and screened by two researchers. Excel, Social Sciences Statistics Package (SPSS, version 24) and software GraphPad Prism 8 were used to analyze the publication trend in related fields. Besides, VOSviewer, Citespace were also applied to visualize the research trends and study the co-occurring keywords in pre-hospital emergency. RESULTS As of 2 October 2020, a total of 1839 pre-hospital emergency publications with total citation of 32800 times were identified. The United States accounted for the largest number of publications (36.7%) and the highest number of citations (12825), but its H-index was fourth (20.17). In the aspects of journals and articles, Prehospital Emergency Care is the most published journal in pre-hospital emergency (256), while the articles from Smith K presented the highest citation frequency (751). We can also obtain the information that the overall trend is upward, and developed countries contribute most. ""Complications"" is a hot research field in intensive care. In the identification research cluster, ""acute ischemic stroke"" was determined to be the hotspot, while ""secondary outcome"" was the new trend in the first-aid cluster. As for the management, ""embase"" was noted as new topics. CONCLUSION In the past decade, researches on pre-hospital emergency has increased rapidly. However, the related articles were mainly published in developed countries, the United States has absolute advantages especially. Moreover, first-aid studies may become hotspots in the near future.","Xu, Li; Tang, Fen; Wang, Yunyun; Cai, Qi; Tang, Shuhui; Xia, Demeng; Xu, Xianghua; Lu, Xiaoying",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841643/,88

METHODS We used a breathing mannequin programmed to deliver minute volumes of 25 L/min and 40 L/min. We measured the baseline protection factor of the PAPR with its motor operational and then deactivated (to simulate mechanical or battery failure). We tested 3 replicates of 3 different N95 models. We glued each N95 to the breathing mannequin and obtained a minimum protection factor of 100 at 25 L/min. We then placed the PAPR on the mannequin and took protection factor measurements with the N95-plus-PAPR combination, at 25 L/min and 40 L/min, with the PAPR operational and then deactivated. RESULTS The N95 significantly increased the PAPR's protection factor, even with the PAPR deactivated. The effect was multiplicative, not merely additive.

187959,Recombination between nonsegmented RNA genomes of murine coronaviruses.,1985,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW In the past 2 years, at least three distinct human coronaviruses have been discovered, including the etiological agent associated with severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS). These recently discovered viruses, with the exception of the SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), are likely to be common respiratory viruses and may be responsible for a substantial proportion of respiratory tract disease. RECENT FINDINGS The SARS-CoV first appeared in 2002 and spread rapidly around the globe. Although the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV may have been halted, the emergence of this new virus demonstrates the potential threat represented by species-to-species transmission of coronaviruses. NL63, initially isolated from a young child with lower respiratory tract disease, represents a group of newly described group I coronaviruses that have been identified worldwide, which are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease, particularly in young children. The distribution of HKU1, a newly identified group II coronavirus, is not yet established. NL63 and HKU1 are related to the common human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, respectively. SUMMARY The discovery of at least three new human coronaviruses represents significant advances in the investigation of human respiratory tract disease. Further studies are required to fully define the impact of these new pathogens.","Kahn, Jeffrey S",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16470161/,88

Blood, feces, nasal swabs, tears, saliva, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected from each calf prior to inoculation and then weekly for 5 post-inoculation weeks. An ELISA was used to quantitate the immunoglobulin isotype titers of BCV antibodies in all samples. An immunoblot assay was used to determine the antibody isotype responses to BCV structural proteins in all the samples, except saliva. At postinoculation days 2 to 3, all calves had severe watery diarrhea, shed BCV in their feces, and had evidence of BCV replication in their upper respiratory tract. After challenge exposure, no calves became ill and no evidence of BCV replication in the respiratory or intestinal tracts was detected. At postinoculation week 1, IgM responses to the N protein were seen in mucosal secretions (except nasal fluid) and feces. At postinoculation weeks 2 and 3, IgA was predominant in mucosal secretions and feces directed toward all the BCV proteins (except the E2 protein in BAL fluid). After challenge exposure, an increase (or failure to decrease) in most IgA and some IgG1 titers to BCV proteins was seen. The increases in IgA titers were to all viral proteins in all mucosal secretions and feces, except to the N and E1 viral proteins in feces. The IgG1 titer increases were to the E2 proteins in tears and BAL fluid and to the E3 protein in BAL fluid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Heckert, R A; Saif, L J; Mengel, J P; Myers, G W",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1649562/,88

188679,"Induction of apoptosis in MRC-5, diploid human fetal lung cells after infection with human coronavirus OC43.",2001,"INTRODUCTION The diagnosis and management of congestive heart failure at the primary care level is difficult. Despite advances in medical therapy, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, congestive heart failure remains a common cause of hospital visits. The extent to which these advances have been implemented in primary care is uncertain. We therefore sought to assess current practice patterns of primary care physicians and identify obstacles to optimal diagnosis and management of congestive heart failure in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS Telephone interviews of 100 primary care physicians using structured questionnaires. RESULTS Primary care physicians diagnose congestive heart failure based on the presence of breathlessness (92.5%), lung crackles (52.5%), peripheral oedema (55.0%) and findings on chest radiography (76.8%). Only 1 in 3 mentioned raised jugular venous pressure as a useful diagnostic sign. Echocardiography was not commonly obtained (5%), mainly due to inaccessibility. While many (47.5%) were aware of the importance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, few (16.2%) knew of the impact of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality. Instead, diuretics were thought to be most important for prolonging survival in congestive heart failure (47.5%). The main obstacle to widespread angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors usage was dry cough. Patient compliance (57.5%) and cost (82.5%) were the main obstacles to optimising care. CONCLUSIONS Local primary care physicians diagnose congestive heart failure using non-specific symptoms and signs. Obstacles to optimal congestive heart failure management were identified. We hope our results will lead to strategies to improve patient care.","Soon, S R; Yong, R; Chew, Z H; Lee, J M J; Lam, C S P","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15329750/,88
188710,Generation of coronavirus spike deletion variants by high-frequency recombination at regions of predicted RNA secondary structure.,1997,"Suicide is a major problem for psychiatry. Depression is the most common mental disorder related to suicidal behavior. The present study aimed at investigating the relationship between the symptomatology related to death, dying, and suicide and neurobiological factors in depressed patients. Fifty patients aged 21-60 years suffering from major depression were investigated. Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry version 2.0 and the International Personality Disorder Examination were used to assist the clinical diagnosis. The psychometric assessment included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the 1965 and 1971 Newcastle Depression Diagnostic Scales, the Diagnostic Melancholia Scale, the General Assessment of Functioning Scale, and the Personality Deviance Scale. Psychophysiological methods included electro-oculogram, flash electroretinogram under photopic and scotopic conditions, and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials. Biological markers included the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, the 30-mg dexfenfluramine challenge test, and brain (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT. Statistical analysis included one-, two-, and three-way Manova and Mancova and the Scheffé test as post hoc test. Patients without thoughts of death had higher self-confidence levels and less overdependency on others and intropunitiveness. The suicidal patients had a significantly prolonged pattern-reversal visual evoked potential latency in comparison with the other patients. The findings of this were related to the status of the patient at the time of the interview but not to his/her history. They also provide neurobiological data to support the need for a combined presence of self-directed aggression and a higher arousal level or disinhibition of self-directed aggressive thoughts in order for a patient to become suicidal. Further study is needed to test whether psychophysiological methods, which are noninvasive and easy to perform, are of value in the therapeutic planning and monitoring of responses.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Iacovides, Apostolos; Fotiou, Fotis; Nimatoudis, John; Bascialla, Fransesca; Ioannidou, Christina; Kaprinis, George; Bech, Per",Neuropsychobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14730200/,88
188824,Recognition of mRNA cap structures by viral and cellular proteins.,2005,"BACKGROUND/AIM Pathogen inactivation in blood and blood products is one of the major means to achieve a zero risk blood supply and improve transfusion safety. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) activated by ultraviolet (UV) light, produces active oxygen which damages cell membrane and prevents replication of the carrier of diseases (viruses, bacteria, protozoa) in all blood products. The aim of this study was to establish the influence of the process of pathogens photoinactivation using riboflavin and UV rays on the biochemical and functional characteristics of platelet concentrates prepared from ""buffy coat"". METHODS The examination included 80 platelet concentrates prepared from ""buffy coat"", which was separated from whole blood donated by voluntary blood donors around 6 hours from the moment of collection. Concentrates were pooled, filtered and separated unton two groups: one consisted of 10 control units and the other of 10 examined units (pooled platelet concentrates). Examined units of the platelets were treated by riboflavin (35 mL) and UV rays (6.24 J/mL, 265-370 nm) on Mirasol aparature (Caridian BCT Biotechnologies, USA) in approximate duration of 6 min. A total of 35 mL of saline solution was added to the control units. The samples for examining were taken from the control and examined units initially (K0, I0), after the addition of saline (K1) and riboflavin (I1), after illumination (I2), first day of storage (K3, I3) and the fifth day of storage (K4, I4). The following parameters were measured: platelet count and platelet yield, residual erythrocyte and leukocyte count, pH, pO2, pCO2 and bacterial contamination. RESULTS All the measured parameters showed a statistically significant decrease comparing to K0 and I0; all the results of the first day of platelet storage showed statistically significant decrease comparing to K1 and I1, and all the results of the fifth day of platelet storage (K4, I4) showed a statistically significant decrease comparing to K1 and K3 and to I1 and I3. There was no the mentioned difference in the measured parameters between K4 and I4 (the end of storage--the fifth day). All the platelet units were sterile till the seventh day, when the investigation ended. CONCLUSION Platelet concentrates inactivated by riboflavin and UV rays (Mirasol PRT sistem, Caridian BCT, USA) keep all the characteristics assessed by the Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components (Council of Europe), during the whole storage period (five days). The obtained data were correlated with existing up to date literature and demonstrated that Mirasol treated platelets were safe and could be incorporated effectively in the routine blood bank and transfusion setting.","Stanojković, Zoran; Antić, Ana; Stojanović, Miodrag",Vojnosanitetski pregled,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21818915/,88

On occasion they have been deployed oppressively, disproportionately and without proper regard to their ramifications. It is important that they not be used during a pandemic unless there is sufficient medico-scientific reason to conclude that they will serve a constructive purpose and that they are the least restrictive available governmental response. Inevitably, they impact adversely on a variety of human rights, particularly freedom of movement. They isolate and inhibit human connection. However, in the context of a worldwide pandemic causing terrible loss of life, there are occasions where they may be a necessary adjunct to these restrictions. This article identifies a variety of scenarios in which curfews have been imposed on different populations and identifies legal challenges that have been made to them. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it reviews the Kenyan judgment of Law Society of Kenya v Mutyambai [2020] eKLR and the Victorian Supreme Court judgment of Loielo v Giles [2020] VSC 722.

189532,Coronavirus M proteins accumulate in the Golgi complex beyond the site of virion budding.,1994,"Negative-stranded virion RNA and oligonucleotide primers complementary to fusion (F) protein gene sequences were used to generate cDNA clones, revealing that the gene 5'-proximal to the F protein corresponded to the M2 (22K) gene, as in respiratory syncytial (RS) virus. The transcription start signal, GGGACAAGU, was identical to that of the F and matrix (M) proteins of turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV). There were two sequences with the potential to function as transcription termination/poly(A) signals, located at nucleotides 751 to 762 and 777 to 787; 15 clones derived from mRNA indicated that the first of these sequences formed the major signal. Part of the next downstream (5') gene was sequenced; unlike mammalian pneumoviruses the TRTV M2 gene did not overlap the beginning of the 5'-proximal gene. Northern blotting indicated that infected Vero cells contained less M2 mRNA than F mRNA and that about half of the M2 mRNA was present as a F-M2 dicistronic mRNA. The M2 gene contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs 1 and 2), as with RS virus. ORF 1 comprised 558 nucleotides with the coding potential for a 186 amino acid polypeptide, M(r) 20959, eight or nine residues shorter than for human RS virus strains. The overall amino acid identity was 40%, the N-terminal one-third of the proteins sharing 62% of residues, the remainder 29%. A hydropathy plot of the TRTV M2 protein had close similarity to that of the M2 or RS virus. The protein was predicted to have a basic character with no N-terminal signal sequence or other major highly hydrophobic sequences. In vitro translation of a transcript comprising both ORFs 1 and 2 produced a single product of apparent M(r) 23000, corresponding to the M2 product of ORF 1. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that this product was derived from ORF 1 and that frameshifting was not involved. The second ORF was expressed only from a transcript which lacked the AUG codons of ORF 1 and, although occupying a similar position to that in the RS virus M2 gene, had virtually no amino acid identity in its 73 residue length and was approximately 25% shorter than the corresponding RS virus ORF 2. The hydropathy plot of the potential products of the second ORFs of TRTV and RS virus showed little resemblance. Taken together these results suggest that ORF 2 is unlikely to be expressed in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Yu, Q; Davis, P J; Brown, T D; Cavanagh, D",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1607858/,88

These droplets from the upper airway may infect the inhalation sedation mask and tubing. The authors determined the adequate measures needed to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 by nitrous-oxide (N2O) system during inhalation sedation in dentistry and provided evidence on mask and tubing sterilization. Additional measures to protect patients and healthcare workers from COVID-19 that may be transmitted by the inhalation sedation system are discussed. The authors recommend minimal use of a N2O system during inhalation sedation in dentistry. In case of need, the practitioners should have more than one scavenger kit and nasal masks for each N2O/O2 mixer. Biologic barriers should be mounted between the scavenger's tubing and the central evacuation system. Strict cleansing and sterilization should be performed for all parts of the N2O system. The use a disposable scavenger system and nasal mask should be considered as a viable option.","Yanko, Robert; Klitinich, Valeri; Haviv, Yaron; Gozal, David; Aframian, Doron J; Ratman, Andra",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070480/,88

Planning for an influenza pandemic will improve the ability of healthcare facilities to respond successfully. RECENT FINDINGS Planning activities involve determining the role of the facility during an influenza pandemic, estimating resources necessary to fulfil this role and developing the infrastructure, material and human resources surge capacity necessary to meet the estimated needs. Plans to perform surveillance for potentially contagious individuals, handle clinical specimens, increase social distancing during a pandemic and the development of personal preparedness plans may be beneficial.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence emerge naturally as tools for analyzing and summarizing data, supporting clinical decisions with data-driven insights and further unlocking genetically driven mechanisms underlying individualized risk. While these computational tools allow modeling of complex relations in large datasets, they pose new challenges especially because a patient's health is at stake. Due to an often black-box nature and high reliance on the training data, these new tools are prone to biases and most commonly provide correlational rather than causal insights. Results of these analyses have been difficult to validate, interpret, and explain to practitioners, and most genetic studies have struggled to encompass the full spectrum of human diversity. In this work, we summarize recent research trends in addressing these issues with examples from submissions to the ""Computational Challenges and Artificial Intelligence in Precision Medicine"" session at Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing 2021. We observe growing research interest in identifying biases, deriving causal and interpretable relations, tuning parameters of models for production, and using artificial intelligence for quality control. We expect further upsurge in work on interpretability and low-risk applications of advanced computational tools.","Afanasiev, Olga; Berghout, Joanne; Brenner, Steven E; Bulyk, Martha L; Crawford, Dana C; Chen, Jonathan H; Daneshjou, Roxana; Kidziński, Łukasz",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

Three of them died from the infection. This study monitors the antibodies formation in group of seniors who have overcome the infection. Between April and November (1-8 months after the infection), the antibodies were measured repeatedly within the period of several weeks. The virus neutralizing tests was used as well as the ECLIA assay by Roche (total immunoglobulins), CMIA assay by Abbott (IgG) and ELISA assay by Euroimmun (IgG and IgA). Six months from the infection, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 18 out of 20 seniors. High levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with higher levels of immunoglobulins and were a good predictor of an increase of IgG in the autumn during the second wave of the epidemic in the Czech Republic. During the autumn wave, neither any of the clients, nor any staff contracted the virus, although the prevalence of PCR positivity in the Vysočina region reached around 5 %. The antigen tests also came out all negative. This study shows that in the senior population, the production of protective antibodies follows a normal pattern, and the seniors are probably immune to a repeated infection for at least 8 months from the first infection. Based on these results, we would like to open the discussion on the testing for seroprevalence in nursing homes, possible changes to the epidemiologic regime in relation to the risk of infection, and about vaccination schemes in these centers.","Fejt, Václav; Krátká, Zuzana; Zelená, Hana; Fürst, Tomáš",Casopis lekaru ceskych,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445937/,88

Influenza B was generally predominant in the 'western' parts of Europe (Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and Ireland) and influenza A (H3N2) in the 'central' and 'eastern' areas (Germany, Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, Poland, Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Netherlands). A number of countries experienced mixed seasons, first experiencing activity associated with influenza B and then with influenza A (Belgium, France and Spain). Generally, countries where influenza B was predominant had low (compared to historical data) levels of intensity (a mild season) and longer periods of influenza activity compared to countries where influenza A (H3N2) was predominant. A number of countries, all where influenza A (H3N2) was predominant, reported high levels of intensity compared to historical data: the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany and Poland. In the six countries where age-specific incidence rates were available, the highest rates were observed among those aged 0-14 years. The influenza virus strains circulating in Europe had a good match with the virus strains in the influenza vaccine. A small number of isolates (A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like) were reported at the end of the season that had a reduced reactivity to anti-sera of the vaccine strain. The composition of the 2003-2004 influenza vaccine is the same as during the 2002-2003 season.","Paget, W J; Meerhoff, T J; Rebelo de Andrade, H",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14724332/,88

First, the fusion protein can bridge both membranes tethered by two membrane anchors. Second, refolding or domain rearrangement steps lead to the positioning of both anchors into close proximity at the same end of an elongated structure. Although these two steps are in principle sufficient to pull two opposing membranes together and initiate membrane fusion, accumulating evidence suggests that the process requires the concerted action of a number of fusion proteins at and outside the contact sites. This review will focus on the structures of viral class I and class II fusion proteins and their similarities in facilitating membrane fusion.","Schibli, David J; Weissenhorn, Winfried",Molecular membrane biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15764366/,88

Dutch professionals are concerned about the mental consequences, and in particular that during and after hospitalization little attention is paid to psychological problems. AIM To monitor the short-term course and severity of (neuro)psychiatric symptoms after hospitalization for COVID-19. To make a recommendation regarding whether or not to follow-up these patients psychiatrically to optimize care. METHOD In an observational cohort-study screening questions and additional questionnaires were used during two follow-up contacts to monitor cognition (MoCA), affective symptoms (HADS and IES) and overall functioning. RESULTS More than half of the 29 included patients showed (neuro)psychiatric problems at both follow-up moments. Two weeks after discharge, we mainly saw symptoms related to anxiety and depression. Except for complaints related to the traumatic experience of the COVID-19, these seemed to have a favorable natural course. A negative time effect was seen for complaints consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. Two months after discharge limitations in cognition and overall functioning appeared to be the main complaints after COVID-19. CONCLUSION (Neuro)psychiatric symptoms after a COVID-19 are common. The natural course for affective complaints is more favorable than for cognitive functions. Specialist follow-up of patients with post-COVID psychological problems is recommended.","van Helvoort, M A; Pop-Purceleanu, M; Tendolkar, I; Everaerd, D S",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523701/,88

DESIGN Long-term cohort of randomly selected adults. PATIENTS One thousand five hundred and forty-eight subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study who did not have the metabolic syndrome by the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) or International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria at baseline. MEASUREMENTS Waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL). RESULTS After a median interval of 6.4 years, there were 219 and 143 new cases (21.9 and 14.3 per 1000 person-years) of the metabolic syndrome by the NCEP and IDF criteria, respectively. The odds ratio for the NCEP metabolic syndrome was highest for low HDL, 4.08 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.90-5.73] and that for the IDF metabolic syndrome was highest for central obesity, 5.94 [95% CI: 3.98-8.87]. Low HDL, found in 27.8% men and 34.3% women, had the highest sensitivity for the NCEP metabolic syndrome (48% in men and 57% in women) and the IDF metabolic syndrome (41% in men and 54% in women). Central obesity had the highest positive predictive values except that triglycerides had the highest positive predictive value for the NCEP metabolic syndrome in women. The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve for waist circumference, triglycerides and HDL were similar. A model that included waist circumference and HDL predicted the metabolic syndrome as well as a model that included all five metabolic syndrome components. CONCLUSION Obese Chinese adults should be periodically screened for the metabolic syndrome and have waist and HDL measurement.","Cheung, Bernard M Y; Wat, Nelson M S; Tam, Sidney; Thomas, G Neil; Leung, Gabriel M; Cheng, Chun Ho; Woo, Jean; Janus, Edward D; Lau, Chu Pak; Lam, Tai Hing; Lam, Karen S L",Clinical endocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17980012/,88

We draw attention to the trend of inverse relative COVID-19 mortality in Europe versus the states of the Southern Hemisphere (Australia, Brazil, South Africa) in dependence on season, which may be associated with intensity of ultraviolet radiation and consequent seasonal fluctuation of serum vitamin D levels. Although we cannot yet confirm causal role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 positivity or COVID-19, we recommend consumption of vitamin D rich food or vitamin D supplementation in the non-sunny season to prevent vitamin D deficiency.","Kopeček, Miloslav; Höschl, Cyril",Casopis lekaru ceskych,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445938/,88

Yount, K. M. Curtis, and R. S. Baric, J. Virol. 74:10600-10611, 2000). Using this construct, a recombinant TGEV was constructed that replaced open reading frame (ORF) 3A with a heterologous gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Following transfection of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, a recombinant TGEV (TGEV-GFP2) was isolated that replicated efficiently and expressed GFP. Replicon constructs were constructed that lacked either the ORF 3B and E genes or the ORF 3B, E, and M genes [TGEV-Rep(AvrII) and TGEV-Rep(EcoNI), respectively]. As the E and M proteins are essential for TGEV virion budding, these replicon RNAs should replicate but not result in the production of infectious virus. Following cotransfection of BHK cells with the replicon RNAs carrying gfp, GFP expression was evident by fluorescent microscopy and leader-containing transcripts carrying gfp were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Subsequent passage of cell culture supernatants onto permissive swine testicular (ST) cells did not result in the virus, GFP expression, or the presence of leader-containing subgenomic transcripts, demonstrating the single-hit nature of the TGEV replicon RNAs. To prepare a packaging system to assemble TGEV replicon particles (TGEV VRP), the TGEV E gene was cloned into a Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) replicon expression vector and VEE replicon particles encoding the TGEV E protein were isolated [VEE-TGEV(E)]. BHK cells were either cotransfected with TGEV-Rep(AvrII) (E gene deletion) and VEE-TGEV(E) RNA transcripts or transfected with TGEV-Rep(AvrII) RNA transcripts and subsequently infected with VEE VRPs carrying the TGEV E gene. In both cases, GFP expression and leader-containing GFP transcripts were detected in transfected cells. Cell culture supernatants, collected approximately 36 h posttransfection, were passed onto fresh ST cells where GFP expression was evident approximately 18 h postinfection. Leader-containing GFP transcripts containing the ORF 3B and E gene deletions were detected by RT-PCR. Recombinant TGEV was not released from these cultures. Under identical conditions, TGEV-GFP2 spread throughout ST cell cultures, expressed GFP, and formed viral plaques. The development of infectious TGEV replicon particles should assist studies of TGEV replication and assembly as well as facilitate the production of novel swine candidate vaccines.","Curtis, Kristopher M; Yount, Boyd; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11773416/,88

Clinically, severe dehydration, yellowish-green to brown coloured diarrhoea and death were observed. Mortality rates were 10-30% in the examined flocks. The most common agent was C. parvum diagnosed in 20 animals as a single causative agent, whereas G. intestinalis was found in 5 of 30 animals. These two protozoa were detected together in 4 animals upon faeces examination. Fifteen of 24 cases of C. parvum and 3 of 11 cases of G. intestinalis were also confirmed histopathologically. Following immunohistochemical examination, all cryptosporidiosis cases were confirmed by positive immunostaining of intestinal sections. Two additional Giardiosis cases with negative results upon parasitological and histopathological examinations were diagnosed by means of immunohistochemical examination.

Expression of the cGM-CSF protein in the recombinant Lactobacillus was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting methods. For the in vivo study, 18 Beagle puppies of 7 weeks of age were divided into three groups; the control group was fed only on a regular diet and the two treatment groups were fed on a diet supplemented with either 1 x 10(9) colony forming units (CFU)/day of L. casei or L. casei expressing cGM-CSF protein for 7 weeks. Body weight was measured, and fecal and blood samples were collected from the dogs during the experiment for the measurement of hematology, fecal immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG, circulating IgA and IgG, and canine corona virus (CCV)-specific IgG. There were no differences in body weights among the groups, but monocyte counts in hematology and serum IgA were higher in the group receiving L. casei expressing cGMCSF than in the other two groups. After the administration of CCV vaccine, CCV-specific IgG in serum increased more in the group supplemented with L. casei expressing cGM-CSF than the other two groups. This study shows that a dietary L. casei expressing cGM-CSF enhances specific immune functions at both the mucosal and systemic levels in puppies.","Chung, Jin Young; Sung, Eui Jae; Cho, Chun Gyu; Seo, Kyoung Won; Lee, Jong-Soo; Bhang, Dong Ha; Lee, Hee Woo; Hwang, Cheol Yong; Lee, Wan Kyu; Youn, Hwa Young; Kim, Chul Joong",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19996694/,88

The IEL from SPF mice expressed significantly less Thy-1, Lyt-1, and Lyt-2 antigens than their conventional counterparts. The local cell-mediated immune response of mucosal lymphocytes to an enteric murine coronavirus (MHV-Y) was studied in inbred strains of naive SPF mice.

The cytotoxicity was not restricted by the major histocompatibility complex. Targets infected with Pichinde virus, an enveloped nonenterotropic virus, were not lysed by these cells. The phenotype of the IEL effector cell was asialo GM1+, Thy-1-, Lyt-1-, Lyt-2-. This cell represents a small subpopulation of the total IEL. After the in vivo administration of anti-asialo GM1 sera, the virus-specific cytotoxic function of the IEL was markedly diminished in in vitro assays, and there was enhanced persistence of virus in gut tissues in vivo. The IEL effector population is defined as a natural killer-like cell that appears to be active in the defense of the gut epithelium to a murine enteric coronavirus.","Carman, P S; Ernst, P B; Rosenthal, K L; Clark, D A; Befus, A D; Bienenstock, J",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3005395/,88

The levels of sickness and mortality, while important, can be quickly overshadowed by cascading risk implications that affect the global economy, threaten societal confidence, weaken the rule of law, present a risk to food security, and can lead to inter- and intra-state conflict. When multiple countries are concurrently impacted, the provision of life-saving and time-sensitive aid and humanitarian assistance can also be affected, leading to isolation and a domino effect of collapsing societies. When nations start from a low baseline level of resilience, then the speed of government and infrastructure failure may be swift.

However, to our knowledge, there are no reports to date of the utilization or results of repeat testing to help guide this practice. METHODS The authors searched the institutional laboratory information system for consecutive patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal specimen over a 1-month period. Characteristics and results of patients who received a single or multiple tests were documented and analyzed. RESULTS Six thousand three (6003) tests were performed on 5757 patients; 272 (4.7%) patients were positive based on their initial test results. Two hundred thirty-six (4%) patients were tested more than once, with 226 (96%) tested twice. The largest proportion of these patients (n=160, 71%) were those who had an initial negative test followed by a repeat test for persistent symptoms. This group included all 7 patients who had discordant positive results on their second test; the result concordance rate within this group was 96%. CONCLUSION In a population of patients with a low positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing, repeat nasopharyngeal testing of negative patients who have persistent symptoms still yields a negative result in 96% of the cases.","Kovacs, S Krisztian; Palmer, Jill; Chen, Derrick J; Rehrauer, William; Yang, David T",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33091285/,88

ACE2 counteracts ACE and angiotensin II in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and has critical functions in the lung and cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV was found to down-regulate ACE2, leaving angiotensin II unbalanced in affected organs. A similar effect of SARS-CoV-2 could partly explain risk factors and symptoms, and could potentially be treatable.","Lundström, Annika; Sandén, Per",Lakartidningen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314329/,88

Although much has been learned about the novel coronavirus since its emergence, there are many open questions related to tracking its spread, describing symptomology, predicting the severity of infection, and forecasting healthcare utilization. Free-text clinical notes contain critical information for resolving these questions. Data-driven, automatic information extraction models are needed to use this text-encoded information in large-scale studies. This work presents a new clinical corpus, referred to as the COVID-19 Annotated Clinical Text (CACT) Corpus, which comprises 1,472 notes with detailed annotations characterizing COVID-19 diagnoses, testing, and clinical presentation. We introduce a span-based event extraction model that jointly extracts all annotated phenomena, achieving high performance in identifying COVID-19 and symptom events with associated assertion values (0.83-0.97 F1 for events and 0.73-0.79 F1 for assertions). In a secondary use application, we explored the prediction of COVID-19 test results using structured patient data (e.g. vital signs and laboratory results) and automatically extracted symptom information. The automatically extracted symptoms improve prediction performance, beyond structured data alone.","Lybarger, Kevin; Ostendorf, Mari; Thompson, Matthew; Yetisgen, Meliha",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299904/,88

192122,The effect of two closely inserted transcription consensus sequences on coronavirus transcription.,1995,"Most cellular and eukaryotic viral mRNAs have a cap structure at their 5' end that is critical for efficient translation. Cap structures also aid in mRNA transport from nucleus to cytoplasm and, in addition, protect the mRNAs from degradation by 5' exonucleases. Cap function is mediated by cap-binding proteins that play a key role in translational control. Recent structural studies on the cellular cap-binding complex, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E and the vaccinia virus protein 39, suggest that these three evolutionary unrelated cap-binding proteins have evolved a common cap-binding pocket by convergent evolution. In this pocket the positively charged N(7)-methylated guanine ring of the cap structure is stacked between two aromatic amino acids. In this review, the similarities and differences in cap binding by these three different cap-binding proteins are discussed. A comparison with new functional data for another viral cap-binding protein--the polymerase basic protein (PB2) of influenza virus--suggests that a similar cap-binding mechanism has also evolved in influenza virus.","Fechter, Pierre; Brownlee, George G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15831934/,88

RESULTS In 162 serum samples, 90.2% (55/61) became N protein positive in 1 - 5 days and 92.8% (13/14) became positive IgM and IgG in 15 - 18 days after the onset of disease, respectively. On 82 gorgling samples, the positive rates of F-PCR were 56.3% (14/24) in 1 - 5 days and 71.4% (10/14) in 6 - 9 days after the onset.

Beginning at 6 to 8 weeks of age, pups were given a subcutaneous vaccination every 21 days (range, 18-24 days) in the dorsal region of the neck or shoulder area. Pups vaccinated with vaccine A(a) received three vaccinations and completed the vaccination series by 12 to 14 weeks of age. Pups vaccinated with vaccine Bb received four vaccinations and completed the vaccination series by 15 to 17 weeks of age. Antibody titers against CPV in both vaccine groups were similar before vaccination. Pups in the vaccine-A group seroconverted significantly earlier than those in the vaccine-B group. After the first vaccination, more pups with a CPV-2b hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of < or = 1:80 responded to vaccine A than to vaccine B. In addition, CPV-2b HI titers after vaccination were also significantly (P < or = 0.05) higher for the pups in the vaccine-A group after first, second, and third vaccinations, compared with those of pups in the vaccine-B group.","Coyne, M J",Veterinary therapeutics : research in applied veterinary medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19757563/,88
192468,"A conserved coronavirus epitope, critical in virus neutralization, mimicked by internal-image monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies.",1991,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) known as SARS-CoV, is a contagious and life-threatening respiratory illness with pneumocytes as its main target. A full understanding of how SARS-CoV would interact with lung epithelial cells will be vital for advancing our knowledge of SARS pathogenesis. However, an in vitro model of SARS-CoV infection using relevant lung epithelial cells is not yet available, making it difficult to dissect the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in the lungs. Here, we report that SARS-CoV can productively infect human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells, causing cytopathic effects, a process reflective of its natural course of infection in the lungs. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed a preferential expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV, on the apical surface. Importantly, both ACE-2 and viral antigen appeared to preferentially colocalize at the apical domain of infected cells. In highly polarized Calu-3 cells grown on the membrane inserts, we found that cells exposed to virus through the apical rather than the basolateral surface showed high levels of viral replication. Progeny virus was released into the apical chamber at titers up to 5 logs higher than those recovered from the basolateral chambers of polarized cultures. Taken together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV almost exclusively entered and was released from the apical domain of polarized Calu-3 cells, which might provide important insight into the mechanism of transmission and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.","Tseng, Chien-Te K; Tseng, Jennifer; Perrone, Lucy; Worthy, Melissa; Popov, Vsevolod; Peters, Clarence J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16014910/,88
192635,Mouse model to study the replication of primate foamy viruses.,1997,"In a model system to study factors involved in the establishment of a persistent viral infection that may lead to neurodegenerative diseases, Indiana and New Jersey variants of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with different capacities to infect and persist in human neural cells were studied. Indiana matrix (M) protein mutants and the wild-type New Jersey strain persisted in the human neural cell line H4 for at least 120 days. The Indiana wild-type virus (HR) and a non-M mutant (TP6), both unable to persist, induced apoptosis more strongly than all the other variants tested, as indicated by higher levels of DNA fragmentation and caspase-3-like activity. Transfection of H4 cells with mRNA coding for the VSV M protein confirmed the importance of this protein in the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk maintained cell survival to about 80%, whereas inhibition of caspase-8, caspase-9, or both only partially protected the cells against death, consistent with the fact that anti-apoptotic molecules from the Bcl-2 family also protect cells from death only partially. These results suggest that VSV activates many pathways of cell death and that an inefficient induction of caspase-3-related apoptosis participates in the establishment of a persistent infection of human neural cells by less virulent VSV variants.","Desforges, Marc; Despars, Geneviève; Bérard, Stéphane; Gosselin, Myriam; McKenzie, Margie O; Lyles, Douglas S; Talbot, Pierre J; Poliquin, Laurent",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12033766/,88

192800,A sorting motif localizes the foamy virus glycoprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum.,1997,"Gene therapy approaches based on liver-restricted and regulated alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) expression, recently shown to be effective in different murine hepatitis models, appear promising alternatives to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in patients and minimize side effects. Tamarins (Saguinus species) infected by GB virus B (GBV-B) are considered a valid surrogate model for hepatitis C to study the biology of HCV infection and the development of new antiviral drugs. To test the efficacy of local delivery and expression of IFN-alpha in this model, we have developed HD-TET-tIFN, a helper-dependent adenovirus vector expressing tamarin IFN-alpha (tIFN) under the control of the tetracycline-inducible transactivator rtTA2s-S2. Expression of tIFN was successfully induced both in vitro and in vivo in rodents by doxycycline administration with consequent activation of IFN-responsive genes. More importantly, tIFN efficiently inhibited GBV-B replicon in a Huh-7 hepatoma cell line at low HD-TET-tIFN doses. A certain degree of transcriptional control of tIFN was achieved in tamarins injected with HD-TET-tIFN, but under the conditions used in this study, infection and replication of GBV-B were only delayed and not totally abrogated upon virus challenge. Hepatic delivery and regulated expression of IFN-alpha appear to be a possible approach for the cure of hepatitis, but this approach requires more studies to increase its efficacy. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a regulated gene expression in a nonhuman primate hepatitis model.","Aurisicchio, Luigi; De Tomassi, Amedeo; La Monica, Nicola; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Traboni, Cinzia; Palombo, Fabio",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15890916/,88
192832,Development of a focus-reduction neutralizing test for detecting equine herpesvirus type-1-neutralizing antibodies.,2013,"The prevailing hypothesis is that the intracellular site of budding of coronaviruses is determined by the localization of its membrane protein M (previously called E1). We tested this by analyzing the site of budding of four different coronaviruses in relation to the intracellular localization of their M proteins. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) grown in Sac(-) cells, and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) grown in CrFK cells, all budded exclusively into smooth-walled, tubulovesicular membranes located intermediately between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, identical to the so-called budding compartment previously identified for MHV. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of the infected cells showed that all four M proteins accumulated in a perinuclear region. Immunogold microscopy localized MHV M and IBV M in the budding compartment; in addition, a dense labeling in the Golgi complex occurred, MHV M predominantly in trans-Golgi cisternae and trans-Golgi reticulum and IBV M mainly in the cis and medial Golgi cisternae. The corresponding M proteins of the four viruses, when independently expressed in a recombinant vaccinia virus system, also accumulated in the perinuclear area. Quantitative pulse-chase analysis of metabolically labeled cells showed that in each case the majority of the M glycoproteins carried oligosaccharide side chains with Golgi-specific modifications within 4 h after synthesis. Immunoelectron microscopy localized recombinant MHV M and IBV M to the same membranes as the respective proteins in coronavirus-infected cells, with the same cis-trans distribution over the Golgi complex. Our results demonstrate that some of the M proteins of the four viruses are transported beyond the budding compartment and are differentially retained by intrinsic retention signals; in addition to M, other viral and/or cellular factors are probably required to determine the site of budding.","Klumperman, J; Locker, J K; Meijer, A; Horzinek, M C; Geuze, H J; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8083990/,88

As the liver is a major target organ of Lassa virus, gene expression in Lassa virus-infected HuH-7 cells, a differentiated human hepatoma cell line, was studied. Cellular mRNA levels were measured at the late phase of acute infection, when virtually all cells expressed large amounts of nucleoprotein, and virus RNA concentration had reached>10(8) copies (ml supernatant)-1. Two types of transcription array were used: cDNA-based macroarrays with a set of 3500 genes (Atlas Human 1.2 arrays; Clontech) and oligonucleotide-based microarrays covering 18,400 transcripts (Human Genome U133A array; Affymetrix). Data analysis was based on statistical frameworks controlling the false-discovery rate. Atlas array data were considered relevant if they could be verified by U133A array or real-time RT-PCR. According to these criteria, there was no evidence for true changes in gene expression. Considering the precision of the U133A array and the number of replicates tested, potential expression changes due to Lassa virus infection are probably smaller than twofold. To substantiate the array data, beta interferon (IFN-beta) gene expression was studied longitudinally in Lassa virus-infected HuH-7 and FRhK-4 cells by using real-time RT-PCR. IFN-beta mRNA levels increased only twofold upon Lassa virus infection, although there was no evidence that the virus inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IFN-beta gene expression. In conclusion, Lassa virus interferes only minimally with gene expression in HuH-7 cells and poorly induces IFN-beta gene transcription.","Müller, Stefanie; Geffers, Robert; Günther, Stephan",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17412988/,88

There is a concerted effort within the global scientifi c community to identify (and thereby potentially mitigate) the possible modes of transmission through which the virus spreads throughout populations. OBJECTIVE Summarize the ways in which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted and provide scientifi c support for the prevention and control of COVID-19. EVIDENCE AQUISITION We conducted an extensive literature search using electronic databases for scientifi c articles addressing SARSCoV-2 transmission published from December 28, 2019 through July 31, 2020. We retrieved 805 articles, but only 302 were included and discussed in this review. The report captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) viral survival, 2) transmission period and transmissibility, and 3) routes of viral spread. DEVELOPMENT Currently available evidence indicates that SARSCoV-2 seems to have variable stability in different environments and is very sensitive to oxidants, such as chlorine. Temperature and humidity are important factors infl uencing viral survival and transmission. SARSCoV-2 may be transmitted from person to person through several different routes. The basic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets, or via indirect contact. Aerosolized transmission is likely the dominant route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in healthcare facilities. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood and breast milk, their role in transmission remains uncertain. A complicating factor in disease control is viral transmission by asymptomatic individuals and through what would otherwise be understood as innocuous human activities. CONCLUSIONS This article provides a review of the published research regarding human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and insights into developing effective control strategies to stop viral propagation.

METHODS This is a 24-week nationwide prospective multi-centre cohort with a control group without RD and not using HCQ. All participants were monitored through scheduled phone interviews performed by health professionals. Details regarding COVID-19 symptoms, and epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data were recorded on a specific web-based platform. COVID-19 was defined according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health criteria and classified as mild, moderate or severe. RESULTS A total of 9,585 participants, 5,164 (53.9%) RD patients on HCQ and 4,421 (46.1%) HC were enrolled from March 29th, 2020 to September 30th, 2020, according to the eligibility criteria. COVID-19 confirmed cases were higher in RD patients than in cohabitants [728 (14.1%) vs. 427 (9.7%), p<0.001] in a 24-week follow-up. However, there was no significant difference regarding outcomes related to moderate/ severe COVID-19 (7.1% and 7.3%, respectively, p=0.896). After multiple adjustments, risk factors associated with hospitalisation were age over 65 (HR=4.5; 95%CI 1.35-15.04, p=0.014) and cardiopathy (HR=2.57; 95%CI 1.12-5.91, p=0.026). The final survival analysis demonstrated the probability of dying in 180 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis was significantly higher in patients over 65 years (HR=20.8; 95%CI 4.5-96.1) and with 2 or more comorbidities (HR=10.8; 95%CI 1.1-107.9 and HR=24.8; 95%CI 2.5-249.3, p=0.006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Although RD patients have had a higher COVID-19 incidence than individuals from the same epidemiological background, the COVID-19 severity was related to traditional risk factors, particularly multiple comorbidities and age, and not to underlying RD and HCQ.","Pinheiro, Marcelo M; Pileggi, Gecilmara S; Kakehasi, Adriana M; Gomides Reis, Ana Paula M; Reis-Neto, Edgard Torres; Abreu, Mirhelen M; Albuquerque, Cleandro P; Araújo, Nafice C; Bacchiega, Ana Beatriz; Bianchi, Dante V; Bica, Blanca; Bonfa, Eloisa; Borba, Eduardo F; Egypto Brito, Danielle C S; Calderaro, Debora C; Pinto Duarte, Ângela L B; Espírito Santo, Rafaela C; Fernandes, Paula R; Guimarães, Mariana P; Poti Gomes, Kirla W; Faustino Ilana, Gabriela G; Klumb, Evandro M; Marques, Claudia D L; Guedes de Melo, Ana Karla; Monticielo, Odirlei A; Mota, Licia M H; Munhoz, Gabriela A; Paiva, Eduardo S; Pereira, Helena L Alves; Provenza, José Roberto; Ribeiro, Sandra L Euzébio; Rocha, Laurindo F; Sato, Emilia I; Skare, Telma; de Souza, Viviane A; Valim, Valeria; Lacerda, Marcus V G; Xavier, Ricardo M; Ferreira, Gilda A",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251312/,88

METHODS Four hundred and two SARS patients were selected based on the diagnostic criteria for SARS from Ministry of Health, China. Of them, 358 SARS patients were selected as their clinical manifestations conformed to the diagnostic criteria of serious SARS. The study subjects were divided into two groups. One group consisted of the patients with serious SARS (358 patients), and they either underwent invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation or died of the disease. The remaining 44 SARS patients constituted the non-serious SARS group. Taking the lowest value of oxygen index (OI) as the main index, the OI was categorized into 3 classes, namely< or =200 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) as 1,200-300 mm Hg as 2, and >300 mm Hg as 3. According to this index, the seriousness and the prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS OI less than 300 mm Hg were identified as the unequivocal serious SARS patients, and the mistake judgement rate was 6.800%. Furthermore mortality and complications were compared with Logistic regression, and questionable SARS patients were excluded. The results showed that the patients identified with OI less than 300 mm Hg had worse outcome than the original ones diagnosed with criteria of Ministry of Health. CONCLUSION OI less than 300 mm Hg in patients with ALI meet the diagnostic criteria of serious SARS better, and it can be taken as a prognostic criterion in clinic.","Xu, Yuan-da; Jiang, Mei; Chen, Rong-chang; Fang, Ji-qian; Xiao, Zheng-lun; Zhong, Nan-shan",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16784560/,88

This protein, which has a helix and flexible structure, and capable of binding on to the viral genomic RNA, is a non-structural protein (nsp3). Many studies suggest that the N protein interaction with nsp3 plays a critical role in the virus replication early in infection. Therefore, it is necessary to know the definition of the interaction mechanism of N and nsp3 protein in terms of the CoV replication transcription mechanism. We report on the homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and docking studies to explain the structure-function relationship and the interaction mechanism. In addition, the prototype MHV is preferred in the wet experiment, so we also based our study on the MHV N and nsp3 proteins that belong to the experimental study. The amino acid sequences of MHV N and nsp3 proteins have similarity between human and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Therefore, the 3D structure models of these proteins were built with using the crystal structure of the CoV family members as a template. By following these models, molecular dynamics simulations were applied to attain the most stable conformation. Finally, protein-protein docking was performed to prove accuracy of model structures of the MHV N and to clarify the interaction with nsp3. As a result, Lys 113, Arg 125, Tyr 127, Glu 173, Tyr 190 residues that play an important role in virus replication were determined.","Tatar, Gizem; Tok, Tugba Taskin",Current computer-aided drug design,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26916649/,88

These various cholesterol levels had no effect on the binding of viral spike (S) proteins to cellular carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) receptors, rather they correlated directly with S-protein-mediated membrane fusion activities. We considered whether cholesterol was indirectly involved in membrane fusion by condensing CEACAMs into ""lipid raft"" membrane microdomains, thereby creating opportunities for simultaneous binding of multiple S proteins that subsequently cooperate in the receptor-triggered membrane fusion process. However, the vast majority of CEACAMs were solubilized by cold Triton X-100 (TX-100), indicating their absence from lipid rafts. Furthermore, engineered CEACAMs appended to glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors partitioned with TX-100-resistant lipid rafts, but cells bearing these raft-associated CEACAMs were not hypersensitive to MHV infection. These findings argued against the importance of cholesterol-dependent CEACAM localizations into membrane microdomains for MHV entry, instead suggesting that cholesterol had a more direct role. Indeed, we found that cholesterol was required even for those rare S-mediated fusions taking place in the absence of CEACAMs. We conclude that cholesterol is an essential membrane fusion cofactor that can act with or without CEACAMs to promote MHV entry.","Thorp, Edward B; Gallagher, Thomas M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14990688/,88

The samples were collected from clinically normal and sick cats. The sera were tested for the presence of antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus by a commercial immunoassay, to a coronavirus by an indirect fluorescent antibody test, and to Toxoplasma gondii by a commercial latex agglutination test and for the presence of feline leukemia virus antigen with one of 3 different commercial assay kits. Ten percent of the sera had antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus, 35% had antibodies to a coronavirus, and 22% had antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Feline leukemia virus antigen was detected in 15% of the sera. Thirty-two percent of the sera had evidence of exposure to 2 or more of the agents.","Rodgers, S J; Baldwin, C A","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1965583/,88

However, these approaches are compatible. In this correspondence, a hybrid model that combines these two techniques is considered. To be precise, it is based on the interleaved execution of both approaches. Since the requirements of time and memory in BnB techniques are generally conflicting, a truncated exact search, namely, beam search, has opted to be carried out. Therefore, the resulting hybrid algorithm has a heuristic nature. The multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem and the shortest common supersequence problem have been chosen as benchmarks. As will be shown, the hybrid algorithm can produce better results in both problems at the same computational cost, especially for large problem instances.","Gallardo, José E; Cotta, Carlos; Fernández, Antonio J","IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics.

However, the side effects of this approach have not been well described. Here we report that DNA-mediated immunization by intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA encoding HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) induced long-term persistence of HBsAg and HBsAg-specific antibody (anti-HBs) in the sera of the immunized BALB/c mice and resulted in liver and kidney lesions. The lesions persisted for 6 months after injection. Lesions were also found in normal mice injected with the sera from immunized mice, and in HBV-transgenic mice injected with anti-HBs antibody, or sera from immunized mice. Furthermore, lesions were accompanied by deposition of circulating immune complex (CIC) of HBsAg and anti-HBs antibody in the damaged organs. These results indicate that long-term persistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs in the immunized mice can result in deposited CIC in liver and kidney, and in development of lesions. The use of DNA containing mammalian replication origins, such as the plasmids used in this study, is not appropriate for human vaccines due to safety concerns relating to persistence of DNA; nevertheless, the safety of DNA-mediated immunization protocols still needs to be carefully evaluated before practical application.","Zi, Xiao-Yuan; Yao, Yu-Cheng; Zhu, Hai-Ying; Xiong, Jun; Wu, Xiu-Ju; Zhang, Nan; Ba, Yue; Li, Wen-Lin; Wang, Xin-Ming; Li, Jian-Xiu; Yu, Hong-Yu; Ye, Xu-Ting; Lau, Joseph T Y; Hu, Yi-Ping",European journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16552712/,88

However, the epidemiology, natural history, and appropriate management of the aneurysms associated with bAVMs are not completely understood due to the paucity of large and uniform studies. We performed a systematic review of published series examining the association between aneurysms and bAVMs with the purpose of clarifying the prevalence, risk of hemorrhage, and appropriate management of these lesions. METHOD PRISMA/MOOSE guidelines were followed. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of three databases (PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid EMBASE) on aneurysms associated with bAVMs. Only studies examining consecutive case series of aneurysms associated with bAVMs were included. From the collected studies, we extracted data regarding prevalence of bAVM-associated aneurysms, risk of aneurysm rupture in relation to bAVM location and aneurysm characteristics, and treatment-related outcomes. RESULTS Our systematic review included 44 articles with a total of 10,093 bAVMs. The proportion of bAVMs with an associated aneurysm was 20.2 % (95 % CI = 19.4-20.9 %). Among ruptured bAVMs with associated aneurysms, the aneurysm was the source of hemorrhage in 49.2 % (95 % CI = 43.7-54.7 %) of cases. Flow-related aneurysms were the most common source of aneurysm rupture (78.5 %, 95 % CI = 70.6-84.9 %). Infratentorial bAVM-associated aneurysms presented a higher risk of rupture (60 %, 95 % CI = 47.4-71.9 %) when compared with supratentorial lesions (29 %, 95 % CI = 21.4-38.5 %). Endovascular treatment of aneurysms associated with bAVMs had a cure rate of 80.0 % (95 % CI = 73.3-85.3 %), complication rate of 8.7 % (95 % CI = 5.5-13.1 %), and a good neurological outcome rate of 78.8 % (95 % CI = 72.5-83.9 %). CONCLUSIONS Twenty percent of bAVMs harbored arterial aneurysms. The presence of aneurysm increases the risk of bleeding of the bAVM, especially when flow-related or infratentorially located. Aneurysms associated with bAVMs should be treated promptly. Selective endovascular treatment of bAVM-associated aneurysms appears safe and effective.","Cagnazzo, Federico; Brinjikji, Waleed; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Acta neurochirurgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27644700/,88

Both Tdap vaccines are licensed for single-dose use to add protection against pertussis and to replace the next dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td). Available evidence does not address the safety of Tdap for pregnant women, their fetuses, or pregnancy outcomes sufficiently. Available data also do not indicate whether Tdap-induced transplacental maternal antibodies provide early protection against pertussis to infants or interfere with an infant's immune responses to routinely administered pediatric vaccines. Until additional information is available, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that pregnant women who were not vaccinated previously with Tdap: 1) receive Tdap in the immediate postpartum period before discharge from hospital or birthing center, 2) may receive Tdap at an interval as short as 2 years since the most recent Td vaccine, 3) receive Td during pregnancy for tetanus and diphtheria protection when indicated, or 4) defer the Td vaccine indicated during pregnancy to substitute Tdap vaccine in the immediate postpartum period if the woman is likely to have sufficient protection against tetanus and diphtheria. Although pregnancy is not a contraindication for receiving Tdap vaccine, health-care providers should weigh the theoretical risks and benefits before choosing to administer Tdap vaccine to a pregnant woman.

Gender differences in cannabinoid-related disorders are highlighted by different research fields (preclinical, clinical, socio-demographic studies), but few studies focused on differential symptom expression in cannabinoid-induced psychosis. This study aims at investigating qualitative and quantitative gender differences in specific psychopathological domains in a clinical sample of subjects affected by cannabinoid-induced psychotic disorder, without psychiatric comorbidity. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study was carried out at the Psychiatric Inpatient Service of General Hospital of Perugia (Italy). In this cross-sectional gender study, 28 inpatients were enrolled, 14 males (M) and 14 females (F). Participants were administered a psychometric battery consisting of 7 tests (PANSS, NDS-I, YMRS, HAM-D, HAM-A, AQ, SSI) in order to investigate 7 psychopathological domains (Psychosis, Dysphoria, Mania, Depression, Anxiety, Aggressive Behaviour and Suicide Ideation). Scores obtained at each test were compared between male and females by using Mann-Whitney U test (p<0.05). RESULTS In this study, we observed that males present higher severity of psychotic symptoms, with prominent scores in PANSS positive and general psychopathology scale (p<0.001), and an important expression of aggressive behavior (p<0.001) compared with females. Female sample, instead, shows a greater expression of dysphoria and depressive domains (p<0.001) and a lower, but statistically significant, prevalence in the anxiety domains expression (p=0.01). By these observations, we could assert that in male group thought disorders are prominent. On the other hand, in female group affective disorder are prominent.

197113,Assembly of vaccinia virus: the second wrapping cisterna is derived from the trans Golgi network.,1994,"The enveloped alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infects cells via a low pH-triggered membrane fusion reaction mediated by the E1 protein. E1 is a class II fusion protein that contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide loop and converts to a stable homotrimer during the fusion reaction. Intriguingly, the fusion loop is closely associated with a loop connecting the i and j beta-strands. This ij loop plays a role in the cholesterol dependence of membrane fusion and is specifically susceptible to proteolysis in the protease-resistant E1 homotrimer. The SFV ij loop contains a histidine residue at position 230. Sequence comparisons revealed that an analogous histidine is completely conserved in all alphavirus and flavivirus fusion proteins. An E1 H230A mutant was constructed using the SFV infectious clone. Although cells infected with H230A RNA produced virus particles, these virions were completely noninfectious and were blocked in both cell-cell fusion and lipid mixing assays. The H230A virions efficiently bound to cell surface receptors and responded to low pH by undergoing acid-dependent conformational changes including dissociation of the E1/E2 dimer, exposure of the fusion loop, association with target liposomes, exposure of acid-conformation-specific epitopes, and formation of the stable E1 homotrimer. Studies with a soluble fragment of E1 showed that the mutant protein was defective in lipid-dependent conformational changes. Our results indicate that the E1 ij loop and the conserved H230 residue play a critical role in alphavirus-membrane fusion and suggest the presence of a previously undescribed late intermediate in the fusion reaction.","Chanel-Vos, Chantal; Kielian, Margaret",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564465/,88

One of the most used strategies that can be used to control the spread of COVID-19 is the 3T (test, trace, and treatment) strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the 3T strategy to control COVID-19 infection in a COVID-19 Referral Hospital in Depok, West Java, Indonesia. METHODS this is a cross-sectional study conducted at the University of Indonesia Hospital. The study was conducted in June 2020 with 742 participants (staff members) using secondary data from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results. We presented data in the descriptive form and performed bivariate analysis using the chi-square/Fischer test for categorical data. RESULTS the PCR test results were positive in 83 (11.1%) participants, with a case-per-tracing ratio of 1:24 and 1:2 in the first and third phases of tracing, respectively. The COVID-19 case graph for the participants decreased along with the implementation of the 3T strategy. The positivity rate in the first phase of tracing was 20% and decreased to 5% in the third phase of tracing. Staff with confirmed positive test results were advised to isolate themselves (hospital or self-isolation). Hospital isolation was found to be associated with the duration of PCR test conversion (p<0.001). CONCLUSION the 3T strategy is effective for controlling the spread of COVID-19. The strategy should be implemented simultaneously with other health precautions to reduce the risk of spreading infection.","Hidayat, Rakhmad; Aini, Nurul; Ilmi, Azizah Fitriana Nurul; Azzahroh, Faiza; Giantini, Astuti",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020332/,88

The measurement results show that the noise level in the wards and stations was between 50.3 and 68.1 dB which exceeded the suggested hospital ward sound level. The quietest units were the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and recovery rooms with a noise level lower than 50 dB during the night. The higher noise levels were in the hall and pharmacy which were highly populated areas. This study analyzed the causes of this excessive noise and used noise reduction methods. The paired t test was performed and the results showed improvement methods were successful. This study found the noise levels reached 98.5-107.5 dB in power generator rooms and air-conditioning facilities, and suggests employees use ear plugs.","Pai, Jar-Yuan",International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17362661/,88

Primary cultures of skeletal muscle cells (for fibroblasts) were prepared by routine typsinization techniques. The ostrich embryo fibroblasts were tested for their ability to propagate stock avian viruses of infectious bronchitis virus, paramyxiovirus-1 (PMV-1), PMV-2, PMV-3, infectious bursal disease virus, quail bronchitis virus, avian reovirus, turkey coronavirus, and two ostrich-originating specimens (one of which was a possible coronavirus identified by electron microscopy). Cytopathic effects were seen by light microscopy in cell cultures inoculated with PMV-1, turkey coronavirus, and the two ostrich specimens. Hemaglutinating titers of 4 or more were determined for PMV-1, turkey coronavrius, and the two ostrich specimens after inoculation onto monolayers of ostrich embryo fibroblasts. Hemagglutination-inhibition tests confirmed the identification of PMV-1 when homologous antisera were used as the specific inhibitor. Bovine coronavirus antisera inhibited the hemagglutination of one of the cultured ostrich specimens.","Rodgers, S J; Vanhooser, S L; Welsh, R D; Silkwood, T G",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7702522/,88

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional survey of Sydney residents during WHO Phase 5 of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Members of the public were approached in shopping and pedestrian malls in seven areas of Sydney between 2 May and 29 May 2009 to undertake the survey. The survey was also made available by email. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Perceived personal risk and seriousness of the disease, opinion on the government and health authorities' response, feelings about quarantine and infection control methods, and potential compliance with antiviral prophylaxis. RESULTS Of 620 respondents, 596 (96%) were aware of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, but 44% (273/620) felt they did not have enough information about the situation. More than a third (38%; 235/620) ranked their risk of catching influenza during a pandemic as low. When asked how they felt pandemic influenza would affect their health if they were infected, only a third (33%; 206/620) said ""very seriously"". Just over half of the respondents (58%; 360/620) believed the pandemic would be over within a year. Respondents rated quarantine and vaccination with a pandemic vaccine as more effective than hand hygiene for the prevention of pandemic influenza. CONCLUSIONS Emphasising the efficacy of recommended actions (such as hand hygiene), risks from the disease and the possible duration of the outbreak may help to promote compliance with official advice.","Seale, Holly; McLaws, Mary-Louise; Heywood, Anita E; Ward, Kirsten F; Lowbridge, Chris P; Van, Debbie; Gralton, Jan; MacIntyre, C Raina",The Medical journal of Australia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740048/,88
198018,Canine distemper virus and measles virus fusion glycoprotein trimers: partial membrane-proximal ectodomain cleavage enhances function.,2004,"Five strains of infectious bronchitis virus isolated from commercial chickens from the state of Pennsylvania, USA during the years 1998 and 1999 were studied. The strains were selected for cross-challenge in specific pathogen free chickens and virus neutralization in chick embryos on the basis of partial S1 sequence amino acid identity values. The partial sequences analysed spanned the hypervariable amino terminus region of S1 from amino acid residues 48 to 219, based on the Beaudette strain. Using their S1 identity values, the strains represented a continuum of genetic, and thus antigenic, relationships. When compared with strain PA/5083/99, strain PA/Wolgemuth/98 had high sequence identity (96%) followed by PA/171/99 (85%), PA/5344/98 (70%) and PA/1220/98 (34%). The method of Archetti and Horsfall was used for calculating antigenic relatedness values of virus neutralization tests. The same formula was also applied to the percentage protection values of cross-challenge tests to derive protective relatedness values among the strains. The antigenic relatedness values, protective relatedness values, and the partial S1 sequence identity values were then analysed. The findings indicated partial S1 sequence identity values were more strongly correlated with protective relatedness values and than antigenic relatedness values.","Ladman, Brian S; Loupos, Alison B; Gelb, Jack",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16595305/,88
198425,Isolation and characterization of Chlamydophila psittaci isolated from laying hens with cystic oviducts.,2008,"Heterogeneity in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with complex interactive operations of genetic and environmental factors, is expressed in a variety of disorder manifestations: severity, co-morbidities of symptoms, and the effects of genes on phenotypes. Neurodevelopmental influences of genomic imprinting have set the stage for the structural-physiological variations that modulate the cognitive, affective, and pathophysiological domains of ADHD. The relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors provide rapidly proliferating insights into the developmental trajectory of the condition, both structurally and functionally. Parent-of-origin effects seem to support the notion that genetic risks for disease process debut often interact with the social environment, i.e., the parental environment in infants and young children. The notion of endophenotypes, markers of an underlying liability to the disorder, may facilitate detection of genetic risks relative to a complex clinical disorder. Simple genetic association has proven insufficient to explain the spectrum of ADHD. At a primary level of analysis, the consideration of epigenetic regulation of brain signalling mechanisms, dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline is examined. Neurotrophic factors that participate in the neurogenesis, survival, and functional maintenance of brain systems, are involved in neuroplasticity alterations underlying brain disorders, and are implicated in the genetic predisposition to ADHD, but not obviously, nor in a simple or straightforward fashion. In the context of intervention, genetic linkage studies of ADHD pharmacological intervention have demonstrated that associations have fitted the ""drug response phenotype,"" rather than the disorder diagnosis. Despite conflicting evidence for the existence, or not, of genetic associations between disorder diagnosis and genes regulating the structure and function of neurotransmitters and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), associations between symptoms-profiles endophenotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms appear reassuring.","Archer, Trevor; Oscar-Berman, Marlene; Blum, Kenneth",Journal of genetic syndromes & gene therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22224195/,88

Chief among such threats are influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), because of their risk of high transmissibility and acuity of illness. Annual epidemics of seasonal influenza cause an estimated 3-5 million cases of severe illness and more than 500 000 deaths, with the prospect of pandemic influenza viruses causing far greater impact. In addition, the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, widespread and continued outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) since 2004, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and emergence of MERS CoV in 2012 reflect the seriousness of public health challenges posed by influenza and emerging respiratory infections.","Mandil, Ahmed; Bresee, Joseph; Tageldin, Mohamed Awad; Azad, Talat Mokhtari; Khan, Wasiq",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30387111/,88

METHODS In vivo measurements of muscle function, assessed using surface electromyography (EMG), were made on 25 patients prior to and after a session of hemodialysis (HD) treatment, along side in vitro measurements of muscle function in isolated rat muscles incubated in normal or uremic conditions approximating to those found in uremic rats (rat uremic: RU) or uremic humans (human uremic: HU). RESULTS HD significantly affected plasma values, e.g. reducing urea (69%), creatinine (62%), potassium (23%) and phosphate (48%) concentrations in patients (all p < 0.01). Treatment also improved the EMG frequency of 2nd dorsal interosseous (fast-twitch) (p < 0.01), although no change was noted for vastus lateralis (slow-twitch). In isolated rat muscles, a uremic environment had no significant effect on slow-twitch soleus during field stimulation, however, in fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus, a significant 23% (RU) and 22% (HU) faster rate of decline in force was measured, compared to controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION It is concluded that (1) muscle weakness and its electrophysiological correlates may be rapidly induced by uremic solutes and rapidly reversed when the solutes are removed by dialysis, and (2) fast-twitch muscles are more readily affected by uremic conditions than slow-twitch muscles.","Harrison, A P; Nielsen, A H; Eidemak, I; Molsted, S; Bartels, E M",Nephron.

The results presented here indicate that mutation to lysine of the arginine found at the envelope precursor cleavage site results in a precursor which is cleaved with an efficiency at least 10-fold lower than the efficiency with which the wild-type protein is cleaved. This mutation has been used to investigate the requirement for envelope protein processing in various aspects of retroviral infection. Viruses produced by cells transfected with mutant proviral clones are approximately 10-fold less infectious than wild-type viruses. Mutant viruses are incapable of inducing XC cell syncytium formation and are 100-fold less efficient than wild-type viruses at rendering cells resistant to superinfection. Envelope glycoproteins bearing the lysine mutation are found in reduced amounts on the surface of infected cells, and as a result mutant virions contain significantly less envelope protein than do wild-type virions. The phenotypic effects of the processing mutation described here are most likely the result of this paucity of envelope glycoproteins in virions carrying the mutation.","Freed, E O; Risser, R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3039173/,88

DESIGN: This descriptive ecological observational study. SETTING: 224 cantons (geographical area) of Ecuador with secondary data sources of hospital information. PARTICIPANTS: The unit of measurement was 224 cantons of Ecuador, in which analysed morbidity and lethality rates for SARI using hospital release data (2016-2018). MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Eight sociodemographic indicators were structuralized, and correlation tests applied for a multiple regression model. The priorization index was created with criteria of efficiency, efficacy, effect size (IRR) and equity. Using the sum of the index for each indicator, the priorization score was calculated and localized in a territorial map. RESULTS: Morbidity associated factors where: school attendance years, urbanization and population density; for mortality resulted: school attendance and ethnics (indigenous) IRR: 1.09 (IC95%:1.06-1.15) and IRR: 1.024 (IC95%:102-1.03) respectively. With lethality where related cantons, with population older than 60 years, IRR: 1.049 (IC95%: 1.03-1.07); 87 cantons had high priority mostly localized in the mountain region and the Morona Santiago Province. CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity and mortality of SARI in Ecuador are associated to social and demographic factors. Priorization exercises considering these factors permit the identification of vulnerable territories facing respiratory disease propagation. The social determinants characteristic for each territory should be added to known individual factors to analyse the risk and vulnerability for COVID in the population.","Ríos Quituizaca, Paulina; Calderón, Lilian; Piedra, Santiago; Guerrero, Jhon; Narváez, Alberto",Aten Primaria,,88

In addition, sepsis survival patients also exhibit a very high death rate after hospital discharge compared to patients with any other disease. The addressed question is then: why septic patients remain ill after hospital discharge? The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the high rate of septic patient deaths are still unknown. We described herein the studies that investigated the percentage of septic patients that died after hospital discharge ranging from 90 days up to 5 years. We also reported the symptoms of septic patients after hospital discharge and the development of the recently called post-sepsis syndrome (PSS). The most common symptoms of the PSS are cognitive disabilities, physical functioning decline, difficulties in performing routine daily activities, and poor life quality. The PSS also associates with quite often reinfection and re-hospitalization. This condition is the cause of the high rate of death mentioned above. We reported the proportion of patients dying after hospital discharge up to 5 years of followed up and the PSS symptoms associated. The authors also discuss the possible cellular and metabolic reprogramming mechanisms related with the low survival of septic patients and the occurrence of PSS.","Gritte, Raquel Bragante; Souza-Siqueira, Talita; Curi, Rui; Machado, Marcel Cerqueira Cesar; Soriano, Francisco Garcia",Front.

We synthesize the literature on broader health and social impacts on people with disabilities arising from lockdown-related measures. METHODS: Scoping review with thematic analysis. Up to mid-September 2020, seven scientific databases and three pre-print servers were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Snowballing searches and experts' consultation also occurred. Two independent reviewers took eligibility decisions and performed data extractions. RESULTS: Out of 1026 unique references, 85 addressed lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Ten primary and two central themes were identified: (1) Disrupted access to healthcare (other than for COVID-19); (2) Reduced physical activity leading to health and functional decline; (3) From physical distance and inactivity to social isolation and loneliness; (4) Disruption of personal assistance and community support networks; (5) Children with disabilities disproportionally affected by school closures; (6) Psychological consequences of disrupted routines, activities, and support; (7) Family and informal caregiver burden and stress; (8) Risks of maltreatment, violence, and self-harm; (9) Reduced employment and/or income exacerbating disparities; and (10) Digital divide in access to health, education, and support services. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and structural, pre-pandemic disparities were the central themes. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown-related measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic can disproportionally affect people with disabilities with broader impact on their health and social grounds. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and pre-pandemic disparities created structural disadvantages, exacerbated during the pandemic. Both structural disparities and their pandemic ramifications require the development and implementation of disability-inclusive public health and policy measures.","Jesus, Tiago S; Bhattacharjya, Sutanuka; Papadimitriou, Christina; Bogdanova, Yelena; Bentley, Jacob; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos; Kamalakannan, Sureshkumar",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,88

236331,Virucidal activity of slightly acidic hypochlorous acid water toward influenza virus and coronavirus with tests simulating practical usage,2021,"PROBLEM: In March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly within the United States and began overwhelming the health care system. To conserve PPE, reduce the spread of the virus, and keep student learners safe, leaders of medical schools across the country made the difficult decision to suspend in-person clinical experiences. As medical students were sent home and hospital systems ramped up their response to the virus, many essential health care workers (HCWs) faced an immediate challenge. As ""non-essential"" services such as schools and daycare centers abruptly closed, HCWs serving on the frontlines in inpatient settings needed a way to both fight the pandemic and care for their children. APPROACH: Medical students at Oregon Health & Science University were able to rapidly organize to provide childcare for essential HCWs. For roughly eight weeks following the state of emergency (March 13 through May 15, 2020) students used Twitter and emerging technology to match families in need of childcare with a trainee volunteer. OUTCOMES: By May 15th, the service had successfully fulfilled 181 of the 202 requests for childcare (90%) over the course of 8 weeks. Of the 181 completed childcare requests, 172 (95%) were fulfilled by an individual (1:1 volunteer-to-household pairing), and 9 (5%) were fulfilled by two or more volunteers. NEXT STEPS: The trainees who provided childcare will apply the skills learned (e.g., clear communication, grassroots organizing, triaging, leveraging new technology) to patient care. Broader applications for this system include organizing volunteers to conduct contract tracing or to provide public health information in languages other than English. Future research includes examining the effect of the service on the productivity, morale, and mental health of both those who provided and received childcare.","Lane, Emily C A; Tran, Audrey A; Graulty, Christian J; Bumsted, Tracy",Acad. med,,88

This review presents an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, and then focuses on the potential efficacy of ruxolitinib in this infection. The potential targets of ruxolitinib were determined by using genetic alterations that have been reported in COVID-19 patients. The potential effectiveness of ruxolitinib is suggested by evaluating the interactions of these potential targets with ruxolitinib or JAK/STAT pathway.","Goker Bagca, Bakiye; Biray Avci, Cigir",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,88

Some statistical reports have shown that men have a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and suffer from worse outcomes than females. While there are many factors that can explain the high prevalence of COVID-19 in men, such as lifestyle habits and the different profile of comorbidities among sexes, the distinctions between male and female immune systems cannot be ignored. It has been sufficiently shown that sex differences have a critical influence on the shaping of immune response, which then leads to different pathogenesis in infectious diseases. Compared with males, females typically have a more effective innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections in COVID-19. What's more, there is a growing body of evidence showing that estrogen exerts an effect on the regulation of immune response.

Upon the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government dispatched about 42 000 HCWs to Wuhan City and Hubei Province to fight this pandemic. This study briefly examines front-line nurses who experienced burnout, with the main objective of investigating the mediating roles of positive and negative affect in the relationship between resilience and burnout in Wuhan hospitals at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 180 front-line nurses voluntarily participated via a social media group. They completed the online questionnaires, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), demographics, and work-related characteristics. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was used to examine the mediating effect of positive and negative affect on the relationship between resilience and burnout. The total prevalence of burnout was 51.7%, of which 15.0% were severe burnout. These preliminary results revealed that positive and negative affect fully mediated the effects of resilience on burnout, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment of front-line nurses. It is necessary to know the impact of resilience on HCWs with burnout through the positive and negative affect of individual backgrounds and situations, and how policymakers can deploy resilience interventions to support front-line HCWs.","Zhang, Xiaoning; Jiang, Xue; Ni, Pingping; Li, Haiyang; Li, Chong; Zhou, Qiong; Ou, Zhengyan; Guo, Yuqing; Cao, Junli",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,88

Recent publications show that IMID patients and its treatments do not worsen the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with IMID who required hospital admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients who required hospital admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection with IMID and those who were not affected. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective cohort study, including admitted patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, treated according to medical criteria and local protocols based on the best available scientific evidence. Clinical data were collected from their electronical clinical history. Statistical analysis determined the differences in the characteristics and clinical outcome of the infection in IMID patients. RESULTS: Of a total number of 612 revised patients, 23 had an IMID and 9 of them were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did not observe a correlation between these two disorders. There was a higher frequency of obesity and cardiovascular disease among IMID patients, but without statistical significance. The clinical outcomes were no different between hospitalized IMID and non IMID patients. CONCLUSION: IMID and its treatments do not determine the outcome of patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Robustillo-Villarino, Montserrat; Álvarez-Arroyo, Laura; Carrera-Hueso, Francisco Javier; Barreda-Altaba, Inés; Nieto-Cid, María; Girona-Sanz, Ana María; El-Qutob, David",Reumatol. clin.

The findings show that a higher likelihood of compliance is linked to socioeconomic status, awareness of the pandemic, reliance on a plurality of information sources, adherence to liberal values, and fear of the disease, but being male, young, employed, religious, fatalistic, and in denial of the severity of the pandemic lower this likelihood - all consistent with the results reported in the literature. In addition, this study highlights the link between compliance and such attributes of nationalism as national identity, national pride, the perception of the pandemic as a national event, and the willingness to sacrifice one's human right to combat the spread of the disease. Drawing on these factors, this paper suggests building societal consensus around the theme of national unity against the microparasitic invasion is the key to an effective strategy to combat the spread of the virus.","Moaddel, Mansoor; El-Zanaty, Fatma; Hamed, Rashad; Saeed, Abdelhamid",Sociol. health illn,,88

The aim of this study was to examine the potentially facilitating role of perceived social support vis-à-vis hope as well as the mediating role of loneliness between perceived social support and hope. This mediating model was tested concurrently in the UK, the USA, and Israel. METHODS: In April 2020, as the first wave of the virus struck the three aforementioned countries, we assessed perceived social support, loneliness, and hope in 400 adults per country (N = 1,200). Assessments in the UK/USA were conducted via the Prolific platform, whereas in Israel they were conducted via Facebook/WhatsApp. RESULTS: In all three countries, perceived social support predicted elevated hope, although the effect was smallest in the UK. Loneliness mediated this effect in all three countries, although full mediation was attained only in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived social support may facilitate hope in dire times, possibly through the reduction of loneliness. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Findings are consistent with respect to the potentially protective role of perceived social support vis-à-vis hope. Perceived social support may increase hope through decreasing loneliness. In the UK, the above-noted mediating effect of loneliness appears to be stronger than in Israel and the USA. Elevated levels of perceived social support should serve as a desired outcome in individual and group psychotherapy, as well as in community based interventions.","Bareket-Bojmel, Liad; Shahar, Golan; Abu-Kaf, Sarah; Margalit, Malka",Br. j. clin. psychol,,88

Of course, I am speaking primarily of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and the massive civil unrest that followed the murders of Breonna Taylor, Daniel Prude, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and Jacob Blake. As we are all aware, higher education made unprecedented adjustments and tried to give a semblance of continuity and stability to students. But it is clear that the events of 2020 referred to here, affected and continues to affect students in different ways, and to hugely different extents. On one side, some students are actually thriving with more time to focus on their work and fewer distractions that are sometimes part of campus life. On the other side, we have students who have had family members die, have been separated from family, live in fear of being in a vulnerable population. Students have lost their jobs, struggled to pay for food, been scared to walk alone, have been attacked for simply who they are. Mental health crises in this already vulnerable population increased significantly. The achievement gaps that we all knew existed before 2020, have widened and continue to do so. What can we as educators do to eliminate, or more realistically perhaps, minimize these achievement gaps? Here, I show data from Summer 2020 and Fall 2020 classes showing that 93% and 88%, respectively, of the assignments that were summited more than 5 days late were from students who voluntarily disclosed that they were experiencing a significant life event, general stress, anxiety, or other illness. The overall number of late assignments over these periods was increased by more than 500% compared to the same periods in 2019. Having grade penalties up to and including refusal to accept any late work is not unusual in higher education. Furthermore, time- and project-management are certainly valuable and critical skills we should impart on our students to help prepare them for success after graduation. However, I propose that imposing such standards during times of high stress (even acknowledging the increased stress we educators are also operating under), is ineffective at best, and unethical in many instances. I will discuss alternate strategies for maintaining academic rigor, including peer-evaluations, involving students in their own grading/assessment, and allowing students creative and flexible ways to demonstrate learning outcomes.","Hart, Orla",The FASEB Journal,,88
275382,Proximity labeling approaches to study protein complexes during virus infection,2021,"(1) Background: Dialysis patients and recipients of a kidney allograft are at high risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2. It has been shown that the development of potent neutralizing humoral immunity against SARS CoV-2 leads to an increased probability of survival. However, the question of whether immunocompromised patients develop antibodies has not yet been sufficiently investigated;(2) Methods: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were examined in hemodialysis patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation as well as patients after kidney transplantation. Patients were interviewed about symptoms and comorbidities, BMI, and smoking history;(3) Results: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 16 out of 259 patients (6%). The trend of infections here reflects the general course of infection in Germany with a peak in November/December of 2020. Remarkably, patients on the waiting list experienced only mild disease. In contrast, transplanted patients had to be hospitalized but recovered rapidly from COVID-19. Most interesting is that all immunosuppressed patients developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after infection;(4) Conclusions: Even with extensive hygiene concepts, an above-average number of patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave of infections in Germany. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the formation of antibodies even in these immunocompromised patients, we expect vaccination to be effective in this group of patients. Thus, dialysis patients and patients after kidney transplantation should be given high priority in vaccination programs.","Boedecker, S. C.; Klimpke, P.; Kraus, D.; Runkel, S.; Galle, P.

Our findings are based on the analysis of 232 survey results, where we tested the effects of AI adoption on workers' psychological contract, engagement and trust. We find that psychological contracts had a significant, positive effect on job engagement and on trust. Yet, with AI adoption, the positive effect of psychological contracts fell significantly. A further re-examination of the extant literature leads us to posit that AI adoption fosters the creation of a third type of psychological contract, which we term ""Alienational"". Whereas SDG 8 is premised on strengthening relational contracts between an organization and its employees, the adoption of AI has the opposite effect, detracting from the very nature of decent work.","Braganza, Ashley; Chen, Weifeng; Canhoto, Ana; Sap, Serap",,,88
279766,Immunization with human cytomegalovirus core fusion machinery and accessory envelope proteins elicit strong synergistic neutralizing activities,2020,"PURPOSE: The prognosis of patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains dismal. New cytotoxic agents such as nab-paclitaxel and liposomal irinotecan (nal-Iri) have extended the armamentarium of therapeutic options in the last years. Nowadays, sequential therapeutic strategies with moderately toxic chemotherapeutic protocols can be administered to the patients. However, prognostic and predictive biomarkers are still missing to identify those patients, which profit most from a ""continuum of care"" concept rather than receiving intensive first-line protocols such as FOLFIRINOX. To this end, we retrospectively evaluated the impact of the systemic inflammation as one essential hallmark of cancer in patients with advanced PDAC treated with sequential systemic. METHODS: A cohort of 193 PDAC patients treated at our center from January 2005 to August 2011 were retrospectively evaluated for the following systemic inflammatory response (SIR) markers: neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) C-reactive protein (CRP), and the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS). SIR markers were correlated with clinico-pathological findings, response to chemotherapy and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional models. RESULTS: All evaluated SIR markers were significantly associated with OS in patients with metastatic disease but not in patients with locally advanced PDAC. Interestingly, all SIR markers were only prognostic in patients not receiving antibiotics as surrogate marker for systemic bacterial infections. Based on the evaluated SIR markers, we propose a new Systemic Inflammation Score (SIS), which significantly correlated with reduced OS (HR: 3.418 (1.802-6.488, p < 0.001)) and the likelihood of receiving further-line systemic therapies (p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Routinely assessed SIR biomarkers have potential to support therapeutic decision making in patients with metastatic PDAC.","Markus, M; Abendroth, A; Noureddine, R; Paul, A; Breitenbuecher, S; Virchow, I; Schmid, K W; Markus, P; Schumacher, B; Wiesweg, M; Wendling, J; Mende, B; Siveke, J T; Schuler, M; Kasper, S",J. cancer res. clin. oncol,,88

Thirteen students responded and reported that the moral and practical consequences of a sudden forced move to the “new normal” of online working and assessment raised serious issues about the boundary between home and work life, and about the relationship-based nature of the career they thought they were entering. Experiences of moral and practical support from agencies were mixed, and a lack of consistency across different placement agencies led to feelings of unfairness in the students’ experience. Opportunities for incidental and tacit forms of learning were lacking in online working environments and students were strong of the belief that the future of social work would entail a permanent locus shift from community work to online interaction regarding the people (service users and carers) with whom they worked. This shift was largely perceived in terms of loss and a further diminution in relationship-based practice in English social work services, which have increasingly been dominated by a task and performance management culture before the onset of COVID-19. © Copyright © 2021 Sarbu and Unwin.","Sarbu, R.; Unwin, P.",Frontiers in Education,,88

This study investigates patient perceptions concerning attendance for planned orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 250 adult patients from the elective orthopaedic waiting list at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board were telephoned during lockdown. They were risk stratified for COVID-19 based on British Orthopaedic Association guidance and a discussion was held to determine patient willingness to proceed with surgery. The primary outcome measure was patients' willingness to proceed. RESULTS: Of the total number telephoned, 196 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 57.4 years; 129 patients were willing to attend for surgery, leaving over one-third wishing to cancel or defer. The most frequent reason given for not wishing to attend was fear of contracting COVID-19. There was a statistically significant difference in the willingness to proceed observed with increasing clinical risk (&#967;2(3) = 50.073, p = .000) with almost double the expected count of unwilling to proceed in the high and very high risk groups, equalled by half the expected count in the low risk group. DISCUSSION: This study illustrates the variable and personal decisions that patients are making about orthopaedic care because of COVID-19. It highlights the need for change to departmental processes regarding recommencement of planned surgical lists. It also reconfirms the importance of regular communication and shared decision making between a well-informed patient and a holistic orthopaedic team.","Kinghorn, A F; Mercer, S T; Yasin, T; John, A; Trickett, R W",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,88
293410,Extinction and emergence of genomic haplotypes during the evolution of Avian coronavirus in chicken embryos,2020,"BACKGROUND: Limited access to mental health resources has challenged clinicians in delivering early behavioral health interventions to perinatal populations. We describe telepsychiatry consultations to a rural hospital's labor and delivery unit. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how consultation-liaison services during peripartum hospitalization could meet this need. METHODS: One-year data from electronic medical records of women who were at risk of postpartum syndromes and offered a telepsychiatry consult was extracted and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 85 consults were conducted via telepsychiatry primarily for depression, anxiety, and medication management. Bedside psychotherapeutic interventions and education were provided to 63 patients, medications were initiated for 32 patients, and outpatient referrals were made for 47 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that consultation-liaison telehealth can successfully engage at-risk mothers in psychiatric treatment. Given accelerated telemedicine efforts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, improving access to telepsychiatry for rural, peripartum populations is an important area of development.","Gopalan, Priya; Auster, Lauren; Brockman, Ida; Shenai, Neeta",,,88

Due to factors such as history of prescription for other infectious diseases, availability, and relatively low cost, the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tested in vivo and in vitro for the ability to inhibit the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, even though investigators noted the therapeutic potential of these drugs, it is important to consider the toxicological risks and necessary care for rational use of CQ and HCQ. This study provides information on the main toxicological and epidemiological aspects to be considered for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 using CQ but mainly HCQ, which is a less toxic derivative than CQ, and was shown to produce better results in inhibiting proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 based upon preliminary tests.","Pereira, Boscolli Barbosa",J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev,,88

The contribution of nursing professionals to sustainability of the system during this health crisis has been vital, not only in specialized care but, in a more understated way, in primary care. The objective of the present study was to describe the perceptions and lived experiences of primary care nurses during the COVID-19 health emergency. A qualitative study taking a phenomenological approach was carried out, triangulating data collected through non-participant observations, eight in-depth interviews, and two discussion groups with community nurses and case managers. A total sample of 20 key informants was obtained during the month of May, 2020. The key informants expressed strong positive perceptions of the recognition received from service users and satisfaction when acknowledging that they have been an important source of emotional support. Informants identify the importance of their work in sustaining the system, particularly outlining team cohesion and communication, whilst also evaluating the empowering position in which service users and society itself has put them.","Rojas-Ocana, M.

Changes in consumption and waste disposal patterns and behaviours during the lockdown period have produced new challenges for solid waste management and waste diversion activities. This paper develops a conceptual model that reflects short-term changes in waste flows from households that are due to COVID-19 disruptions, focusing on the case of multi-residential buildings in Toronto, Canada. Multi-residential buildings are of interest because they differ from single family homes in several key ways that can produce some slightly different impacts of COVID19 on waste flows and practices. Primary research for the study included interviews with 19 staff, residents and property managers of ten multi-residential buildings. All of the research took place while Toronto was still in partial-lockdown. Analysis of the interviews revealed five themes around the impact of COVID-19: (1) changes in garbage, recycling and organics flows, (2) new health and safety concerns, (3) changes in reuse and reduction practices, (4) changes in special waste and deposit-return bottle collections, and (5) changes in waste diversion and reduction education. Given the time frame of our study, we recognize these as short-term impacts and call for future research to determine how many of the changes are likely to perpetuate over the medium and longer term.","Ikiz, Ece; Maclaren, Virginia W; Alfred, Emily; Sivanesan, Sayan",Resour Conserv Recycl,,88

The purpose of this article is to report our experience for rescheduling nonemergent imaging and procedures during the pandemic at our tertiary, academic institution. METHODS: We rescheduled the nonemergent imaging and procedures in our hospitals and outpatient centers from March 16 to May 4, 2020. We created a tiered priority system to reschedule patients for whom imaging could be delayed with minimal clinical impact. The radiologists performed detailed chart reviews for decision making. We conducted daily virtual huddles with discussion of rescheduling strategies and issue tracking. RESULTS: Using a snapshot during the rescheduling period, there was a 53.4% decrease in imaging volume during the period of March 16 to April 15, 2020, compared with same time period in 2019. The total number of imaging studies decreased from 38,369 in 2019 to 17,891 in 2020 during this period. Although we saw the largest reduction in outpatient imaging (72.3%), there was also a significant decrease in inpatient (40.5%) and emergency department (48.9%) imaging volumes.

For the local government, the behavioral pattern is prone to blame-avoiding instead of making decision following scientific evidence and experts’ advice. However, such behavior is not based on completely subjective judgment but a rational choice for the local government. Some consequences associated with China’s response to COVID-19 reveals an inflexible administrative system. Therefore, China’s governance reform should focus on empowering local governments with more flexibility and resilience, which enables local governments to make independent and scientific decisions in an emergency.","Zhang, Liwei; Chen, Kelin; Zhao, Ji",Am.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study performed in an academic setting. A survey was generated and administered to REI fellows and attendings practicing in programs across the United States. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify results regarding clinical volume, academic responsibilities, clinical safety, and fellowship education. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 23%. Eighty-four percent of respondents self-identified as fellows, and 16% identified as program directors or other REI academic instructors. Overall, the survey responses confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic tremendously affected clinical volume, with 91% of participants reporting their clinical volume decreased by at least half. Although 67% of attendings believed that the changes related to COVID-19 have or will have significantly affected the clinical skills of fellows, 66% of fellows did not believe that their clinical training had been significantly impacted. Sixty-seven percent of fellows and 78% of attendings do not believe that changes related to COVID-19 will affect the ability of fellows to practice independently. CONCLUSION: Even though most attendings surveyed believed that the changes related to COVID-19 would affect the clinical skills of fellows, the cessation of clinical and research activities was short-lived, likely tempering the overall effect on clinical training. Overall, most respondents did not believe that the pandemic significantly affected fellow education.","Ghidei, Luwam; Gannon, Alexandra; Schutt, Amy",J Assist Reprod Genet,,88

A total of 33 severe confirmed cases (20 male patients and 13 female patients) were enrolled in the present study between January 31, 2020 and March 10, 2020. Chest imaging findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The median age was 65 years (age range, 25­90 years). As of April 7, 2020, 24 patients were discharged, and 9 patients died. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 28 patients had fever, 17 patients had a cough and 15 patients had shortness of breath. Of these, 29 patients had underlying health conditions. Ground glass opacities, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening were the most common and typical chest computerized tomography (CT) scan abnormalities. A total of 6/33 (18.2%) patients had 1 affected lobe, 6/33 (18.2%) patients had 2 affected lobes, 5/33 (15.2%) patients had 3 affected lobes, 9/33 (27.3%) patients had 4 affected lobes and 7/33 (21.2%) patients had 5 affected lobes in the initial chest CT scan. The mean interval time between two consecutive CT examinations was 4.5 days (range, 3­9 days). Most severe patients exhibited some degree of aggravation based on the CT findings in the 3 weeks from illness onset. After 3 weeks from illness onset, these severe survivors demonstrated improvements in the chest CT findings, which included complete absorption or only a few remaining fibrous stripes. Chest CT manifestations of patients infected with novel coronavirus pneumonia were diverse and varied. Severe patients had imaging features of rapid progression and slow absorption.

325787,miRNA repertoire and host immune factor regulation upon avian coronavirus infection in eggs,2020,"We analyzed the nucleocapsid and surface proteins from several Coronaviridae viruses using an alignment-free computer program. Three isolates of novel, human coronavirus (SARS0CoV-2) (2019) that are responsible for the current pandemic and older SARS strains of human and animal coronaviruses were examined. The nucleocapsid and glycoprotein sequences are identical for the three novel 2019 human isolates and they are closely related to these sequences in six bat and human SARS coronaviruses. This strongly supports the bat origin of the pandemic, novel coronavirus. One surface glycoprotein fragment of 111 amino acids is the largest, conserved, common permutation in the examined bat SARS-like and human SARS viruses, including the Covid-19 virus. BLAST analysis confirmed that this fragment is conserved only in the human and bat SARS strains. This fragment likely is involved in infectivity and is of interest for vaccine development. Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein sequence homologies of 58.9% and 82.5%, respectively, between the novel SARS0CoV-2 strains and the human SARS (2018) virus suggest that existing anti-SARS vaccines may provide some protection against the novel coronavirus.","Basu, Babu V; Brown, Olen R",Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),,88

332803,Recombination events are concentrated in the spike protein region of Betacoronaviruses,2020,"Clinical recognition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is delayed or missed entirely in a substantial proportion of patients. In the LUNG SAFE study, the largest international cohort of patients with ARDS, investigators were able to determine if ARDS was present, and at what stage the clinician made the diagnosis of ARDS. The diagnosis of ARDS was delayed or missed in two-thirds of patients, with the diagnosis missed entirely in 40% of patients, while ARDS recognition ranged from 51% in mild ARDS to 79% in severe cases. Failure to recognize ARDS in a timely fashion leads to failure to use strategies that improve survival in ARDS. Early diagnosis of ARDS may facilitate measures to abrogate progression of the lung injury, including protective mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and adjunctive measures proven to improve survival such as prone positioning. Information overload and a complex 'syndrome' diagnosis likely play key roles in ARDS under-recognition. Clinical under-recognition has important consequences particularly in terms of therapeutic options not considered. The development of approaches to enable more timely recognition has the potential to save lives.","Bellani, Giacomo; Pham, Tài; Laffey, John G",Intensive Care Med,,88

Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms. SCPH obtained the choir's member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among confirmed cases and 86.7% among all cases). Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7%), and two died (3.7%). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice. The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5). These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.","Hamner, Lea; Dubbel, Polly; Capron, Ian; Ross, Andy; Jordan, Amber; Lee, Jaxon; Lynn, Joanne; Ball, Amelia; Narwal, Simranjit; Russell, Sam; Patrick, Dale; Leibrand, Howard",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,88

Many recently released point-of-care (PoCT) serological assays have been distributed with little premarket validation. METHODS: Performance characteristics for 5 PoCT lateral flow devices approved for use in Australia were compared to a commercial enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and a recently described novel surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). RESULTS: Sensitivities for PoCT ranged from 51.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.1%-60.4%) to 67.9% (95% CI, 59.4%-75.6%), and specificities from 95.6% (95% CI, 89.2%-98.8%) to 100.0% (95% CI, 96.1%-100.0%). ELISA sensitivity for IgA or IgG detection was 67.9% (95% CI, 59.4%-75.6%), increasing to 93.8% (95% CI, 85.0%-98.3%) for samples >14 days post symptom onset. sVNT sensitivity was 60.9% (95% CI, 53.2%-68.4%), rising to 91.2% (95% CI, 81.8%-96.7%) for samples >14 days post symptom onset, with specificity 94.4% (95% CI, 89.2%-97.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Performance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays were generally lower than those reported by manufacturers.

It is disappointing that there are no specific drugs until now. The combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medication seems to be the current more effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients in China. In this review, we mainly discussed the relationship between COVID-19 and gut microbiota (GM), as well as the possible impact of TCM combined with western medication on GM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, aiming to provide references for the possible role of GM in TCM against COVID-19. The available data suggest that GM dysbiosis did occur in COVID-19 patients, and the intervention of GM could ameliorate the clinical condition of COVID-19 patients. In addition, TCMs (e.g., Jinhua Qinggan granule, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, Qingjin Jianghuo decoction, Toujie Quwen granules, and MaxingShigan) have been proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in Chinese clinic. Among them, Ephedra sinica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Bupleurum chinense, Lonicera japonica,Scutellaria baicalensi, and Astragalus membranaceus are common herbs and have a certain regulation on GM, immunity, and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

338767,"Genetic diversity and structure of landrace accessions, elite lineages and cultivars of common bean estimated with SSR and SNP markers",2020,"Introduction Patients and policy makers alike have high expectations for the use of digital technologies as tools to improve health care service quality at a sustainable cost Many countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are investing in telemedicine initiatives, and a large and growing body of peer-reviewed studies on the topic has developed, as a consequence Nonetheless, telemedicine is still not used at scale within the OECD Seeking to provide a snapshot of the evidence on the use of telemedicine in the OECD, this umbrella review of systematic reviews summarizes findings on four areas of policy relevance: clinical and cost-effectiveness, patient experience, and implementation Methods This review followed a prior written, unregistered protocol Four databases (PubMed/Medline, CRD, and Cochrane Library) were searched for systematic reviews or meta-analyses published between January 2014 and February 2019 Based on the inclusion criteria, 98 systematic reviews were selected for analysis Due to substantial heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not conducted The quality of included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool Results Most reviews (n = 53) focused on effectiveness, followed by cost-effectiveness (n = 18), implementation (n = 17) and patient experience (n = 15) Eighty-three percent of clinical effectiveness reviews found telemedicine at least as effective as face-to-face care, and thirty-nine percent of cost-effectivenss reviews found telemedicine to be cost saving or cost-effective Patients reported high acceptance of telemedicine and the most common barriers to implementation were usability and lack of reimbursement However, the methodological quality of most reviews was low to critically low which limits generalizability and applicability of findings Conclusion This umbrella review finds that telemedicine interventions can improve glycemic control in diabetic patients;reduce mortality and hospitalization due to chronic heart failure;help patients manage pain and increase their physical activity;improve mental health, diet quality and nutrition;and reduce exacerbations associated with respiratory diseases like asthma In certain disease and specialty areas, telemedicine may be a less effective way to deliver care While there is evidence that telemedicine can be cost-effective, generalizability is hindered by poor quality and reporting standards This umbrella review also finds that patients report high levels of acceptance and satisfaction with telemedicine interventions, but that important barriers to wider use remain","Eze, Nkiruka D.; Mateus, Céu Tiago Cravo Oliveira; Hashiguchi,",PLoS One,,88

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted movement behaviours for children, with evidence indicating a decrease in physical activity. The aim of this study was to explore experiences of CIM and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of children and their parents. We completed 21 family (at least one parent and one child aged 7-12) semi-structured interviews with 45 participants living in small urban and rural areas of British Columbia, Canada. Three themes were identified through a reflexive thematic analysis: (1) keeping everyone safe from COVID-19; (2) change in pattern and types of activity; (3) social impacts with family, friends, and community. Participants expressed a perceived increase in unstructured activity and a decrease in structured physical activity during the pandemic, which many parents viewed as a positive change. Parents and children indicated negative feelings due to spending less time with peers and reflected positively about spending more time with family. Parents and children expressed fear and anxiety in trying to keep their families safe from virus spread and creativity in adapting play behaviours. Findings highlight the impact of the pandemic on social friendship networks for families and a shift in activity patterns for children toward unstructured play.","Pelletier, Chelsea A; Cornish, Katie; Sanders, Caroline",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,88

This study aimed to review evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding plans and how these relate to women's psychological outcomes. Searches were conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for studies in English, Spanish, and Portuguese between January 2020 and January 2021. All study designs and pre-prints were considered. Twelve studies were included. Reports suggest that COVID-19 impacts differently on breastfeeding plans, which in turn leads to distinctive mental health outcomes. Positive breastfeeding experiences have been observed when mothers perceive that they have more time for motherhood, which may be associated with better mental health outcomes. Negative breastfeeding experiences have been observed when mothers are separated from their newborns, when mothers struggle with breastfeeding, or when mothers perceive decreased family and professional support, which seems to be associated with worse mental health outcomes. These preliminary results highlight the need for further research into the association between COVID-19, breastfeeding expectations, and maternal mental health. Filling this gap will foster the development of guidelines and interventions to better support mothers experiencing the obstacles of COVID-19 pandemic.","Pacheco, Francisca; Sobral, Mónica; Guiomar, Raquel; de la Torre-Luque, Alejandro; Caparros-Gonzalez, Rafael A; Ganho-Ávila, Ana",,,88

The fatal outcomes by COVID-19 are accompanied by cytokine storm syndrome. The cytokine storm is determined by serum ferritin. Aims and Objective: To determine the role of Serum ferritin in assessing the severity and outcome of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A single-center, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from March 2020 to May 2020. The diagnosis was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum ferritin levels were compared with the treatment outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients. Results: A total of 1977 COVID-19 patients were studied. The mean age was 43.89±15.58 years and had male preponderance of 61.56% of the total subjects. The mean serum ferritin levels among recovered and expired patients were 1225.6 ± 2502.91 ng/ml and 285.71 ± 391.99 ng/ml, respectively. Conclusion: Serum ferritin was markedly increased in COVID-19 patients who could not survive as compared to the patients who finally recovered from the infection, proving it as a useful marker for assessing the severity of COVID-19.

This may have led to a decreased presentation to hospital of patients with acute medical conditions and time-dependent management, such as stroke. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study using administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), transient ischemic attack, or intracerebral hemorrhage. Data from a total of 1463 hospitals in Germany were included. We compared case numbers and treatment characteristics of pandemic (March 16 to May 15, 2020) and prepandemic (January 16 to March 15, 2020) cases and also with corresponding time period in 2019. RESULTS: We identified a strong decline for hospitalization of AIS (-17.4%), transient ischemic attack (-22.9%), and intracerebral hemorrhage (-15.8%) patients during the pandemic compared with prepandemic period. IVT rate in patients with AIS was comparable (prepandemic versus pandemic: 16.4% versus 16.6%, P=0.448), whereas mechanical thrombectomy rate was significantly higher during the pandemic (8.1% versus 7.7%, P=0.044). In-hospital mortality was significantly increased in patients with AIS during the pandemic period (8.1% versus 7.6%, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Besides a massive decrease in absolute case numbers, our data suggest that patients with AIS who did seek acute care during the pandemic, continued to receive acute recanalization treatment in Germany.","Richter, Daniel; Eyding, Jens; Weber, Ralph; Bartig, Dirk; Grau, Armin; Hacke, Werner; Krogias, Christos",Stroke,,88
367299,Oligo(l-glutamic acids) in Calcium Phosphate Precipitation: Mechanism of Delayed Phase Transformation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer in Chile reports 500 new cases each year of which 85% are treated in the public health system. Governmental programs ensure access to diagnosis, treatment, follow up and palliative care, whereas Fundación Nuestros Hijos (FNH) provides supportive care for non-covered medical and psychosocial needs. Common financial difficulties in families of children and adolescents with cancer increased considerably when a wave of social unrest arose in October 2019 and the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 hit the country, leaving families of children with cancer facing greater challenges. AIMS: We report here the support activities and interventions carried out by FNH to help the families during the crisis of these months. METHODS: A socioeconomic survey was conducted among FNH's beneficiary families to know their needs. During these months of acute crisis for many families, support activities and interventions were developed and varied types of aid were allocated to help the families. RESULTS: The main results of the survey in which 525 (70%) of FNH's beneficiary families participated showed that 75% of them had only one breadwinner, and 52% had one unemployed family member. Almost 90% of job loss happened during the months of social unrest and pandemic. Four main interventions: (a) safe transportation, (b) food, (c) heating, (d) internet connectivity, were organized to support important needs of the families and prevent children to miss treatment appointments. Additionally, some families who did not access governmental emergency aid were guided in the process. CONCLUSIONS: The aid provided helped the families to relieve some of their needs, facilitated the continuation of treatment during the pandemic, and made the caregivers feel supported and listened.","Zuleta, Verónica; Berliner, Josefina; Rossell, Nuria; Zubieta, Marcela",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),,88

The objective of this study was to describe the association between neighborhood factors and number of COVID-19 cases. We hypothesized an association between disadvantaged neighborhoods and clusters of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We analyzed data on patients presenting to a large health care system in Boston during February 5-May 4, 2020. We used a bivariate local join-count procedure to determine colocation between census tracts with high rates of neighborhood demographic characteristics (eg, Hispanic race/ethnicity) and measures of disadvantage (eg, health insurance status) and COVID-19 cases. We used negative binomial models to assess independent associations between neighborhood factors and the incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 9898 COVID-19 patients were in the cohort. The overall crude incidence in the study area was 32 cases per 10 000 population, and the adjusted incidence per census tract ranged from 2 to 405 per 10 000 population. We found significant colocation of several neighborhood factors and the top quintile of cases: percentage of population that was Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, without health insurance, receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and living in poverty. Factors associated with increased incidence of COVID-19 included percentage of population that is Hispanic (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.23-1.28) and percentage of households living in poverty (IRR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.32).

380419,Using Yeast to Identify Coronavirus-Host Protein Interactions,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Emergency nurses are at risk for secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue, and burnout as a result of witnessing the trauma and suffering of patients. The traumatic events perceived as being most stressful for emergency nurses involve sudden death, children, and adolescents. Multicasualty, school-associated shooting events are, therefore, likely to affect emergency nurses, and recent reports indicate an increase in multicasualty, school-associated shootings. This research is necessary to learn of emergency nurses' experiences of caring for patients from a school shooting event in an effort to benefit future preparedness, response, and recovery. This manuscript describes these experiences and provides opportunities for nurses, peers, and leaders to promote mental health and resilience among emergency nurses who may provide care to patients after such events. METHODS: A qualitative case series approach, a theory of secondary traumatic stress, and the compassion fatigue resilience model guided the research. The emergency nurses who provided care to patients who were injured during a 2018 multicasualty, school-associated shooting in the Southeastern United States were invited to participate. RESULTS: The themes identified by this research with 7 participants were preparation and preparedness, coping and support mechanisms, and reflections and closure. DISCUSSION: The results identified through this research may be translated to policies and practice to improve emergency nurses' welfare, coping, resilience, and retention. Patient outcomes may also be improved through planning and preparedness.","McCall, W Travis",J Emerg Nurs,,88

Discussions during an International Association for Dental Research symposium in London, United Kingdom, in 2018, followed by a workshop in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2019, concluded that there are few birth cohort studies that consider oral health and that a broader discussion on similarities and differences among those studies would be valuable. This article aims to 1) bring together available long-term data of oral health birth cohort studies from the low, middle, and high-income countries worldwide and 2) describe similarities and differences among these studies. This work comprises 15 studies from all 5 continents. The most studied dental conditions and exposures are identified; findings are summarized; and methodological differences and similarities among studies are presented. Methodological strengths and weaknesses are also highlighted. Findings are summarized in 1) the negative impact of detrimental socioeconomic status on oral health changes over time, 2) the role of unfavorable patterns of dental visiting on oral health, 3) associations between general and oral health, 4) nutritional and dietary effects on oral health, and 5) intergenerational influences on oral health. Dental caries and dental visiting patterns have been recorded in all studies. Sources of fluoride exposure have been documented in most of the more recent studies. Despite some methodological differences in the way that the exposures and outcomes were measured, some findings are consistent. Predictive models have been used with caries risk tools, periodontitis occurrence, and permanent dentition orthodontic treatment need. The next steps of the group's work are as follows: 1) establishing a consortium of oral health birth cohort studies, 2) conducting a scoping review, 3) exploring opportunities for pooled data analyses to answer pressing research questions, and 4) promoting and enabling the development of the next generation of oral health researchers.","Peres, K G; Thomson, W M; Chaffee, B W; Peres, M A; Birungi, N; Do, L G; Feldens, C A; Fontana, M; Marshall, T A; Pitiphat, W; Seow, W K; Wagner, Y; Wong, H M; Rugg-Gunn, A J",J Dent Res,,88
384077,Topoisomerase III-ß is required for efficient replication of positive-sense RNA viruses,2020,"Purpose: Romance fraud refers to situations where an individual is deceived for financial gain by someone with whom the victim perceives to be in a romantic relationship. With the increase in internet use, the growth in loneliness and the increasing engagement in online dating sites during COVID-19, opportunities for romance fraud may have suffered an important increase. This paper aims to analyse changes in romance fraud, loneliness and internet use during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Data about romance fraud reported to the police in the UK, and survey data recorded by the Understanding Society longitudinal survey, are used to address our research questions. Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling is used to analyse whether temporal changes observed are an effect of social changes associated with lockdown and stay-at-home orders. Findings: The analysis shows that cyber-enabled romance fraud experienced a large increase after April 2020, which is greatly above any expected crime variation considering known pre-COVID trends. The increase in romance fraud was more abrupt among young adults than older persons. The results also indicate that only young adults experienced a significant increase in loneliness, while older adults reported a large increase in internet use during COVID. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is a first-of-its-kind paper analysing the effect of rapid social changes on a growing type of cyber-enabled fraud. It is likely that the growth in romance fraud during COVID is due to a combined effect of an increase in internet use and growing loneliness rates experienced by many people during the pandemic. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buil-Gil, D.; Zeng, Y.",Journal of Financial Crime,,88
385062,Rational Engineering of the DNA Walker Amplification Strategy by Using a Au@Ti3C2@PEI-Ru(dcbpy)32+ Nanocomposite Biosensor for Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp Gene,2021,"As the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic engulfs millions worldwide, the quest for vaccines or drugs against the virus continues. The helicase protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents an attractive target for drug discovery since inhibition of helicase activity can suppress viral replication. Using in silico approaches, we have identified drugs that interact with SARS-CoV-2 helicase based on the presence of amino acid arrangements matching binding sites of drugs in previously annotated protein structures. The drugs exhibiting an RMSD of &#8804; 3.0 Å were further analyzed using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and post-MD analyses. Using these approaches, we found 12 drugs that showed strong interactions with SARS-CoV-2 helicase amino acids. The analyses were performed using the recently available SARS-CoV-2 helicase structure (PDB ID: 5RL6). Based on the MM-GBSA approach, out of the 12 drugs, two drugs, namely posaconazole and grazoprevir, showed the most favorable binding energy, - 54.8 and - 49.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, of the amino acids found conserved among all human coronaviruses, 10/11 and 10/12 were targeted by, respectively, grazoprevir and posaconazole. These residues are part of the crucial DEAD-like helicase C and DEXXQc_Upf1-like/ DEAD-like helicase domains. Strong interactions of posaconazole and grazoprevir with conserved amino acids indicate that the drugs can be potent against SARS-CoV-2. Since the amino acids are conserved among the human coronaviruses, the virus is unlikely to develop resistance mutations against these drugs. Since these drugs are already in use, they may be immediately repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Abidi, Syed Hani; Almansour, Nahlah Makki; Amerzhanov, Daulet; Allemailem, Khaled S; Rafaqat, Wardah; Ibrahim, Mahmoud A A; la Fleur, Philip; Lukac, Martin; Ali, Syed",Sci Rep,,88
387621,"Enteroviruses and T1D: Is It the Virus, the Genes or Both which Cause T1D",2020,"BACKGROUND: Like with all cancers, multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings are the norm in bone and soft tissue tumour (BST) management too. Problem in attendance of specialists due to geographical location is the one of the key barriers to effective functioning of MDTs. To overcome this problem, virtual MDTs involving videoconferencing or telemedicine have been proposed, but however this has been seldom used and tested. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the implementation of virtual MDTs in the Oxford sarcoma service in order to maintain normal service provision. We conducted a survey among the participants to evaluate its efficacy. METHODS: An online questionnaire comprising of 24 questions organised into 4 sections was circulated among all participants of the MDT after completion of 8 virtual MDTs. Opinions were sought comparing virtual MDTs to the conventional face-to-face MDTs on various aspects. A total of 36 responses were received and were evaluated. RESULTS: 72.8% were satisfied with the depth of discussion in virtual MDTs and 83.3% felt that the decision-making in diagnosis had not changed following the switch from face-to-face MDTs. About 86% reported to have all essential patient data was available to make decisions and 88.9% were satisfied with the time for discussion of patient issues over virtual platform. Three-fourths of the participants were satisfied (36.1% - highly satisfied; 38.9% - moderately satisfied) with virtual MDTs and 55.6% of them were happy to attend MDTs only by the virtual platform in the future. Regarding future, 77.8% of the participants opined that virtual MDTs would be the future of cancer care and an overwhelming majority (91.7%) felt that the present exercise would serve as a precursor to global MDTs involving specialists from abroad in the future. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the forced switch to virtual MDTs in sarcoma care following the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic to be a viable and effective alternative to conventional face-to-face MDTs.

389424,In-Yeast Assembly of Coronavirus Infectious cDNA Clones Using a Synthetic Genomics Pipeline,2020,"This paper describes a study designed to investigate the current and emergent impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK horticultural businesses. Various characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and import dependence, make it an important sector for policymakers concerned to understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into 2021. The study design prioritised timeliness, using a rapid survey to gather information from a relatively small (n = 19) but indicative group of producers. The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry (89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option (32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently, automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK's horticultural workforce shortage due to economic and socio-political uncertainties. The conclusion highlights policy recommendations and future investigative intentions, as well as suggesting methodological and other discussion points for the research community.","Korir, Lilian; Drake, Archie; Collison, Martin; Camacho-Villa, Tania Carolina; Sklar, Elizabeth; Pearson, Simon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11551v1.pdf,88

398137,Oligomannose N-Glycans 3D Architecture and Its Response to the FcÎ³RIIIa Structural Landscape,2021,"Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a novel viral agent that quickly spread worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and had an immeasurable toll on the economy. Currently, most clinical cases are identified by qualitative molecular testing. However, the need for quantitative assessment is gaining traction.Areas covered: In this review, the current state and future perspective of SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification is presented.Expert opinion: Viral load quantification is a critical measure that informs clinicians of treatment response, actionable viral load levels, and guidance on patient management. Additionally, for pathogens with epidemiological consequences, viral load can provide information to guide infection control measures and policies. While qualitative detection is sufficient to identify cases and initiate containment and mitigation measures in the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, in certain situations, SARS-CoV-2 quantification is needed to assess viral load trending. However, there are obstacles to quantification, including variability in respiratory specimen collection and the lack of commutable reference material. At the same time, the need for quantification for clinical and epidemiological management is growing, especially concerning individuals with prolonged RNA shedding.","Lee, Mark J",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,,88

METHODS: Using multiple public data sources, we created an enhanced open-source surveillance dataset of all MERS-CoV cases between 20 September 2012 and 31 December 2018 in Saudi Arabia including available risk factor data. RESULTS: Of the 1791 cases of MERS-CoV identified, 30 cases (1.7%) were aged under 18 years and 1725 cases (96.3%) were aged 18 years and over. Three paediatric cases were fatal, aged 0, 2 and 15 years. The odds of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection among cases under 18 years (n = 10/23; 44%) was significantly higher (odds ratio (OR) = 4.98; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-11.51; P = 0.001) compared to adults (n = 199/1487; 13%). The odds of hospitalisation were significantly lower (OR = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.08-0.39; P < 0.001) among cases under 18 years (n = 12/24; 50%) compared to adults (n = 1231/1443; 85%). Children were more likely to have a known source of exposure compared to adults (OR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.29-5.56; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically severe illness is less common in children, although death can occur, and the proportion of paediatric cases (1.7%) is similar to that reported for COVID-19. Age-specific differences in the clinical presentation of MERS-CoV cases could have implications for transmission for other betacoronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Children may be at risk within the household with an infected adult. More studies are required on the role of children in transmission of betacoronaviruses.","MacIntyre, Chandini R; Chen, Xin; Adam, Dillon C; Chughtai, Abrar A",J Paediatr Child Health,,88

We conducted a scoping review of the available literature on COVID-19 to assess the potential effect on neurologists in terms of prevalent comorbidities and incidence of new neurologic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Scopus databases for adult patients with preexisting neurologic disease who were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19 or reported incidence of secondary neurologic events following diagnosis of COVID-19. Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined. RESULTS: Among screened articles, 322 of 4,014 (8.0%) of hospitalized patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 had a preexisting neurologic illness. Four retrospective studies demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (incidence of 6%, 20%, and 36.4%, respectively). Inconsistent reporting and limited statistical analysis among these studies did not allow for assessment of comparative outcomes. CONCLUSION: Emerging literature suggests a daunting clinical relationship between COVID-19 and neurologic illness. Neurologists need to be prepared to reorganize their consultative practices to serve the neurologic needs of patients during this pandemic.","Herman, Collin; Mayer, Kirby; Sarwal, Aarti",Neurology,,88

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study (performed by the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium-ISARIC-4C) in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited after model development between 21 May and 29 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (age &#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 at least four weeks before final data extraction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 35 463 patients were included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 32.2%) and 22 361 in the validation dataset (mortality rate 30.1%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea level, and C reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C Score showed high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.79; validation cohort: 0.77, 0.76 to 0.77) with excellent calibration (validation: calibration-in-the-large=0, slope=1.0). Patients with a score of at least 15 (n=4158, 19%) had a 62% mortality (positive predictive value 62%) compared with 1% mortality for those with a score of 3 or less (n=1650, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range 0.61-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73). CONCLUSIONS: An easy-to-use risk stratification score has been developed and validated based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups. The score should be further validated to determine its applicability in other populations.

We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence and the duration of shedding of fecal RNA in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese databases Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data up to June 2020 were searched for studies evaluating fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including anal and rectal samples, in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in patients with detectable respiratory RNA was estimated. The days of shedding and days to loss of fecal and respiratory RNA from presentation were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (N = 1,636) met criteria. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in COVID-19 patients was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34%-52%). Higher proportion of patients with GI symptoms (52.4% vs 25.9%, odds ratio = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.7) compared with no GI symptoms, specifically diarrhea (51.6% vs 24.0%, odds ratio = 3.0, 95% CI 1.9-4.8), had detectable fecal RNA. After loss of respiratory RNA, 27% (95% CI 15%-44%) of the patients had persistent shedding of fecal RNA. Days of RNA shedding in the feces were longer than respiratory samples (21.8 vs 14.7 days, mean difference = 7.1 days, 95% CI 1.2-13.0). Furthermore, days to loss of fecal RNA lagged respiratory RNA by a mean of 4.8 days (95% CI 2.2-7.5). DISCUSSION: Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA is commonly detected in COVID-19 patients with a 3-fold increased risk with diarrhea. Shedding of fecal RNA lasted more than 3 weeks after presentation and a week after last detectable respiratory RNA.","Zhang, Yawen; Cen, Mengsha; Hu, Mengjia; Du, Lijun; Hu, Weiling; Kim, John J; Dai, Ning",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,,88
416044,Cross-Species Transmission of Deltacoronavirus and the Origin of Porcine Deltacoronavirus,2020,"Strict lockdown strategies to stop the spread of COVID-19 have caused a decrease in environmental noise levels and introduced new noise conditions in dwellings. The present study has investigated the impact of the forced lockdown in Turkey on noise annoyances due to traffic, neighbors, and personal dwellings, as well as the concern of being heard by neighbors, and overall dwelling satisfaction in an online questionnaire. The stress and anxiety levels of respondents were also investigated. The survey obtained 1053 respondents. Additionally, environmental noise levels were measured over 24-h at two locations and compared with results before the pandemic. The results clearly exhibit that environmental noise levels and annoyance due to the noise levels dropped significantly. The annoyance drop was larger in previously noisier environments than previously tranquil locations. Noise annoyance due to neighbor noise did not change significantly; however, noise annoyance due to one's own dwelling increased. The results also confirmed an overall increase in dwelling satisfactions indicating a correlation between dwelling satisfaction and lower environmental noise levels. Although the results confirmed that noise annoyance was positively correlated with stress and anxiety levels, the change of annoyance between before and during lockdown was shown to be independent from the stress and anxiety level.","Sentop Dümen, Ayça; Saher, Konca",J Acoust Soc Am,,88

418720,The mechanism and energetics of a ligand-controlled hydrophobic gate in a mammalian two pore channel,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on human society. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from patients' feces on human cell line raised concerns of possible transmission through human feces including exposure to aerosols generated by toilet flushing and through the indoor drainage system. Currently, routes of transmission, other than the close contact droplet transmission, are still not well understood. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted to estimate the health risks associated with two aerosol exposure scenarios: 1) toilet flushing, and 2) faulty connection of a floor drain with the building's main sewer pipe. SARS-CoV-2 data were collected from the emerging literature. The infectivity of the virus in feces was estimated based on a range of assumption between viral genome equivalence and infectious unit. The human exposure dose was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of viral concentrations in aerosols under each scenario and human breathing rates. The probability of COVID-19 illness was generated using the dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003. The results indicate the median risks of developing COVID-19 for a single day exposure is 1.11 × 10-10 and 3.52 × 10-11 for toilet flushing and faulty drain scenario, respectively. The worst case scenario predicted the high end of COVID-19 risk for the toilet flushing scenario was 5.78 × 10-4 (at 95th percentile). The infectious viral loads in human feces are the most sensitive input parameter and contribute significantly to model uncertainty.","Shi, Kuang-Wei; Huang, Yen-Hsiang; Quon, Hunter; Ou-Yang, Zi-Lu; Wang, Chengwen; Jiang, Sunny C",Sci Total Environ,,88

The correlation analysis between cumulative number of reported cases and the migration index from Hubei was performed, and the imported risks from Hubei to different provinces across China were further evaluated.@*Results@#A total of 49 970 confirmed cases were reported nationwide, of which 37 884 were in Hubei Province. The average daily migration index from Hubei to other provinces was 312.09, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei were 117.95 and 194.16, respectively. The cumulative NCP cases of provinces was positively correlated with the migration index derived from Hubei province, also in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei, with correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.84, and 0.81. In linear model, population migration from Hubei Province, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei account for 71.2%, 70.1%, and 66.3% of the variation, respectively. The period of high exported risk from Hubei occurred before January 27, of which the risks before January 23 mainly came from Wuhan, and then mainly from other cities in Hubei. Hunan Province, Henan Province and Guangdong Province ranked the top three in terms of cumulative imported risk (the cumulative risk indices were 58.61, 54.75 and 49.62 respectively).@*Conclusion@#The epidemic in each province was mainly caused by the importation of Hubei Province. Taking measures such as restricting the migration of population in Hubei Province and strengthening quarantine measures for immigrants from Hubei Province may greatly reduce the risk of continued spread of the epidemic.","Jianxiong, HU; Guanhao, HE; LIU, Tao; XIAO, Jianpeng; RONG, Zuhua; GUO, Lingchuan; ZENG, Weilin; ZHU, Zhihua; GONG, Dexin; YIN, Lihua; WAN, Donghua; ZENG, Lilian; Wenjun, MA",Chinese Journal of Preventive Medicine,,88

Age, gender, and comorbidities are known to be risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are generally considered independently without accurate knowledge of the magnitude of their effect on risk, potentially resulting in incorrect risk estimation. There is an urgent need for accurate prediction of the risk of severe COVID-19 for use in workplaces and healthcare settings, and for individual risk management. Clinical risk factors and a panel of 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from published data. We used logistic regression to develop a model for severe COVID-19 in 1,582 UK Biobank participants aged 50 years and over who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus: 1,018 with severe disease and 564 without severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A model incorporating the SNP score and clinical risk factors (AUC = 0.786; 95% confidence interval = 0.763 to 0.808) had 111% better discrimination of disease severity than a model with just age and gender (AUC = 0.635; 95% confidence interval = 0.607 to 0.662). The effects of age and gender are attenuated by the other risk factors, suggesting that it is those risk factors-not age and gender-that confer risk of severe disease. In the whole UK Biobank, most are at low or only slightly elevated risk, but one-third are at two-fold or more increased risk. We have developed a model that enables accurate prediction of severe COVID-19. Continuing to rely on age and gender alone (or only clinical factors) to determine risk of severe COVID-19 will unnecessarily classify healthy older people as being at high risk and will fail to accurately quantify the increased risk for younger people with comorbidities.","Dite, Gillian S; Murphy, Nicholas M; Allman, Richard",PLoS One,,88

439963,High-Efficiency Down-Conversion Radiation Fluorescence and Ultrafast Photoluminescence (1.2 ns) at the Interface of Hybrid Cs4PbBr6-CsI Nanocrystals,2021,"BACKGROUND: Integrated utilisation of digital health data has the power to transform healthcare to deliver more efficient and effective services, and the learning health system (LHS) is emerging as a model to achieve this. The LHS uses routine data from service delivery and patient care to generate knowledge to continuously improve healthcare. The aim of this project was to explore key features of a successful and sustainable LHS to inform implementation in an Academic Health Science Centre context. METHODS: We purposively identified and conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with leaders, experienced in supporting or developing data driven innovations in healthcare. A thematic analysis using NVivo was undertaken. RESULTS: Analysis of 26 interviews revealed five themes thought to be integral in an effective, sustainable LHS: (1) Systematic approaches and iterative, continuous learning with implementation into healthcare contributing to new best-practice care; (2) Broad stakeholder, clinician and academic engagement, with collective vision, leadership, governance and a culture of trust, transparency and co-design; (3) Skilled workforce, capability and capacity building; (4) Resources with sustained investment over time and; (5) Data access, systems and processes being integral to a sustainable LHS. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study provides insights into the elements of a sustainable LHS across a range of leaders in data-driven healthcare improvement. Fundamentally, an LHS requires continuous learning with implementation of new evidence back into frontline care to improve outcomes. Structure, governance, trust, culture, vision and leadership were all seen as important along with a skilled workforce and sustained investment. Processes and systems to optimise access to quality data were also seen as vital in an effective, sustainable LHS. These findings will inform a co-designed framework for implementing a sustainable LHS within the Australian healthcare and Academic Health Science Centre context. It is anticipated that application of these findings will assist to embed and accelerate the use of routine health data to continuously generate new knowledge and ongoing improvement in healthcare delivery and health outcomes.","Enticott, Joanne; Braaf, Sandra; Johnson, Alison; Jones, Angela; Teede, Helena J",BMC Health Serv Res,,88
444109,Artificial Intelligence in Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data to Foster Precision Oncology,2021,"COVID-19 is appearing as one of the most fetal disease of the world's history and has caused a global health emergency. Therefore, this study was designed with the aim to address the issue of public response against COVID-19. The literature lacks studies on social aspects of COVID-19. Therefore, the current study is an attempt to investigate its social aspects and suggest a theoretical structural equation model to examine the associations between social media exposure, awareness, and information exchange and preventive behavior and to determine the indirect as well as direct impact of social media exposure on preventive behavior from the viewpoints of awareness and information exchange. The current empirical investigation was held in Pakistan, and the collected survey data from 500 respondents through social media tools were utilized to examine the associations between studied variables as stated in the anticipated study model. The findings of the study indicate that social media exposure has no significant and direct effect on preventive behavior. Social media exposure influences preventive behavior indirectly through awareness and information exchange. In addition, awareness and information exchange have significant and direct effects on preventive behavior. Findings are valuable for health administrators, governments, policymakers, and social scientists, specifically for individuals whose situations are like those in Pakistan. This research validates how social media exposure indirectly effects preventive behavior concerning COVID-19 and explains the paths of effect through awareness or information exchange. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work at present that covers this gap, for this reason the authors propose a new model. The conceptual model offers valuable information for policymakers and practitioners to enhance preventive behavior through the adoption of appropriate awareness strategies and information exchange and social media strategies.","Nazir, Mehrab; Hussain, Iftikhar; Tian, Jian; Akram, Sabahat; Mangenda Tshiaba, Sidney; Mushtaq, Shahrukh; Shad, Muhammad Afzal",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,88

We analyzed diagnostic, clinical and post-SARS-CoV-2 scenarios in patients from three German cancer centers with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sixty-three patients with SARS-CoV-2 and hematologic or solid neoplasms were included. Thirty patients were initially asymptomatic, 10 of whom developed COVID-19 symptoms subsequently. Altogether 20 (32%) patients were asymptomatic, 18 (29%) had mild, 12 (19%) severe and 13 (20%) critical courses. Lymphocytopenia increased risk of severe/critical COVID-19 three-fold (p = 0.015). Asymptomatic course was not associated with age, remission status, therapies or co-morbidities. Secondary bacterial infection accompanied more than one third of critical COVID-19 cases. Treatment was delayed post-SARS-CoV-2 in 46 patients, 9 of whom developed progressive disease (PD). Cancer therapy was modified in 8 SARS-CoV-2 survivors because of deteriorating performance or PD. At the last follow-up, 17 patients had died from COVID-19 (n = 8) or PD (n = 9) giving an estimated 73% four-month overall survival rate. SARS-CoV-2 infection has a heterogenous course in cancer patients. Lymphocytopenia carries a significant risk of severe/critical COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 disruption of therapy is as serious as SARS-CoV-2 infection itself. Careful surveillance will allow early restart of the anti-cancer treatment.","Shumilov, E.; Hoffknecht, P.; Koch, R.; Peceny, R.; Voigt, S.; Schmidt, N.; Peeck, M.; Bacher, U.; Scheithauer, S.; Trümper, L.; Lenz, G.; Kerkhoff, A.; Bleckmann, A.",Cancers,,88
457041,Skin Sensitization Tests: The LLNA and the RhE IL-18 Potency Assay,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now still an emerging, evolving pandemic, causing more than 64 million people infected. Hypertension, a common cardiovascular condition, has been reported as a risk factor for higher mortality. In order to a better management, it is necessary to know the clinical course and identify the factors associated with clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.Methods and results: A total of 148 COVID-19 cases who had pre-existing hypertension with clarified outcomes (discharge or deceased) were included in this study. Medical history, clinical manifestation, epidemiological, and laboratory data were analyzed. 45 (30.4%) patients had died during hospitalization, multivariate COX regression analysis revealed some predicted factors at admission for in-hospital death including elevated level of hs-cTn (HR: 3.98, 95% CI:1.95-8.16) and IL-6 (HR: 3.31, 95% CI: 1.42-7.72). Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (n = 52) which were defined as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg for more than once (≥ 2 times) during hospitalization, were more likely to have ICU admission (P=0.037), invasive mechanical ventilation(P=0.028), and renal injury(P=0.005). With a stricter criterion which was defined as systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 80 mmHg for more than once (≥ 2 times) during hospitalization, 105 (70.9%) patients with uncontrolled BP had higher mortality rate (P=0.046). In our study, there were 35 (23.6%) patients taking renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) suppressor including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and spironolactone. Patients with these RAAS suppressors treatment were less likely to be admitted to ICU (P = 0.048). And treatment with RAAS suppressors didn't have an obvious influence in mortality.Conclusion: Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, elevated hs-cTn and IL-6 at admission were associated with higher mortality, suggesting that they could possibly be used as predictors for fatal outcomes. Blood pressure control with a stricter criterion of less than 130/80mmHg during hospitalization is associated with better prognosis. And treatment with RAAS suppressors didn't not contribute to a higher mortality.","Wang, T.; Chen, R.; Ruan, H.; Tang, R.; Zhang, Z.; Sang, L.; Yi, S.; Ni, Z.; Hu, Y.; Liu, L.; Shan, H.; Lei, C.; Peng, Y.; Liu, C.; Li, J.; Hong, C.; Zhang, N.; Li, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,88

468734,Macrophage Polarization Modulated by Porcine Circovirus Type 2 Facilitates Bacterial Coinfection,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected almost all hospital departments, including transfusion services. However, the demand for transfusions in a general hospital designated to deal with COVID-19 patients has not been analysed before. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate blood transfusion practices from 15 March to 14 April 2020 at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor (Madrid, Spain). During this month, with few exceptions, the hospital became a 'COVID-19' centre. In addition, transfusion rates during this time frame and the same period over the last 4 years were compared. RESULTS: From 15 March to 14 April 2020, only 254 blood components were transfused, resulting in a 49·3% reduction over the previous year. Interestingly, in critically ill patients, the red blood cell (RBC) transfusion/bed ratio significantly decreased during this period (0·92) compared to the same ratio over the past 4 years (2·70) (P = 0·02). Of note, 106 blood components (95 RBC; 11 platelet concentrates) were transfused to only 36 out of 1348 COVID-19 patients (2·7%). The main reason for RBC transfusion in COVID-19 patients was a previous underlying disease (44%) followed by bleeding (25%) and inflammatory anaemia (25%). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report a decrease in blood transfusions during the COVID-19 pandemic in a general hospital and especially in the intensive care unit. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19 does not generally induce transfusion requiring anaemia, being the main causes for transfusion in these patients underlying conditions or bleeding.","Marín-Mori, Karen; González-Gascón Y Marín, Isabel; Foncillas-García, María-Ángeles; Muñoz-Novas, Carolina; Infante, María; Churruca-Sarasqueta, Juan; Landete-Hernández, Elena; Bueno-García, Begoña; Duffort-Falco, Mercedes; Hernández-Rivas, José-Ángel",Vox Sang,,88
468923,The Missing Expression Level-Evolutionary Rate Anticorrelation in Viruses Does Not Support Protein Function as a Main Constraint on Sequence Evolution,2021,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 infection has resulted in a global pandemic with survival statistics 95–99%, however severe disease has been described. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients &amp;gt;age 18 admitted to Henry Ford Health System in Detroit from March 1 - June 1, 2020 for COVID-19 infection with aims to: 1. Determine the incidence of poor outcomes (mechanical ventilation (MV), ICU admission, death, and venous thromboembolism (VTE)), 2. Describe the clinical characteristics of this group, and 3. Evaluate relationships between demographics, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and inflammatory markers on outcomes. We hypothesized that older age, male gender, African American ethnicity, DM, obesity, and elevated inflammatory markers would predict poor outcomes. 8751 inpatients were included, of whom 682 (7.79%) required MV, 867 (9.91%) were admitted to the ICU, 753 (8.6%) died, and 430 (4.91%) had VTE. 4447 (50.8%) were African American, 4951 (56.6%) female, 5152 (58.9%) &amp;gt;age 50, and 2068 (23.6%) had DM. Of those who had BMI and A1c recorded, 2556 (50.2%) had BMI &amp;gt;30 kg/m2 and 1138 (74.3%) had A1c &amp;gt;5.7%. Analyses controlling for demographics and comorbidities found that age and male gender were significant predictors of MV (OR = 1.031;CI= 1.025–1.037;P &amp;lt;0.0001, OR =2.023;CI= 1.700–2.407;P&amp;lt;0.0001), ICU admission (OR 1.024;CI= 1.018–1.029;P&amp;lt;0.0001, OR 1.824;CI= 1.561–2.130;P&amp;lt;0.001), death (OR 1.077;CI= 1.069–1.085;P&amp;lt;0.0001, OR 1.823;CI= 1.521–2.185;P&amp;lt;0.0001), and VTE (OR 1.021;CI= 1.014–1.028;P&amp;lt;0.001, OR 1.293;CI= 1.043–1.603;P=0.0193). African American, compared to Caucasian ethnicity, was significantly associated with MV (OR 1.437;CI= 1.131–1.825;P=0.0009) and ICU admission (OR 1.428;CI= 1.150–1.773;P=0.0002), but not VTE. African Americans had significantly lower odds of death relative to Caucasians (OR 0.765;CI=0.604–0.969;P=0.0200). DM predicted MV (OR 1.999;CI= 1.677–2.383;P&amp;lt;0.0001), ICU admission (OR 2.014;CI= 1.717–2.364;P&amp;lt;0.0001), death (OR 1.501;CI= 1.250–1.803;P&amp;lt;0.0001), and VTE (OR 1.468;CI= 1.171–1.840;P=0.0009). Obesity predicted MV (OR 1.540;CI= 1.284–1.847;P&amp;lt;0.0001) and ICU admission (OR 1.395;CI= 1.186–1.642;P&amp;lt;0.0001) but not death or VTE. All inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ferritin, CRP, IL-6 and procalcitonin) were significantly correlated with MV and death. 3 of the 5 markers were also predictive of both ICU admission and VTE. This large retrospective study of a diverse population with a significant proportion of African Americans highlights the importance of taking age, male gender, African American ethnicity, presence of DM and obesity into account when determining risk of poor outcomes. These results contribute to the growing data on disparities in health care which have become more evident during this pandemic and the need to address this when designing public policy.","Hehar, Jaspreet Todter Erika Lahiri Sharon Wu",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,88

It explores the observation of students as participants in the online learning of using Personal Protective Equipment and simulation-based learning of perinatal emergency management. This was followed by their mutual interaction and reflections. This paper aims to understand the role of synchronous remote learning through simulation and its impact on interprofessional interactions. We describe the experience of medical and midwifery students with the ONE-Sim workshop, facilitated by medical (obstetric and neonatal) and midwifery educators. Formal thematic analysis will be performed as part of the ongoing study; however, initial direct observation demonstrated that students reacted positively to the online ONE-Sim workshop and engaged well with facilitators and peers. Students mutually interacted amongst themselves, shared their previous experiences, knowledge of roles as medical and midwifery practitioners and how they see themselves in those roles in a perinatal emergency setting. The initial observations demonstrate that interprofessional education delivered in an e-learning format can be useful and meaningful, and may be utilized across a number of specialties.","Prasad, Namrata; Fernando, Shavi; Willey, Sue; Davey, Kym; Kent, Fiona; Malhotra, Atul; Kumar, Arunaz",J Interprof Care,,88

Lack of specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is a major concern and the development of vaccines is another important aspect in managing the infection effectively. The first step in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is the viral entry and it is mediated by its densely glycosylated spike protein (S-protein). Similar to the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell entry receptor. In addition to ACE2, several recent studies have implicated the crucial role of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as a necessary assisting cofactor for ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was also identified to use both endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the pivotal role of S-protein priming mediating viral entry. As the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mandatory for viral infection, it becomes an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. In this regard, this review will focus on the therapeutic targeting of the crucial steps of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry like S-protein/ACE2 interaction and S-protein priming by host cell proteases. In addition, this review will also give insights to the readers on several therapeutic opportunities, pharmacological targeting of the viral-entry facilitators like S-Protein, ACE2, cell surface HS, TMPRSS2, and CatB/L and evidence for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies.","Muralidar, Shibi; Gopal, Gayathri; Visaga Ambi, Senthil",J. med. virol,,88

Obstetricians and midwives, among other medical staff, are tackling COVID-19 and are under immense psychological stress. AIMS: We aimed to survey the mental health of non-infectious disease specialist staff, specifically obstetricians and midwives, working in officially designated hospitals treating patients with COVID-19. METHOD: A nationwide online survey was conducted from 7 March to 17 March 2020 investigating the mental health of obstetricians and midwives (who were not themselves infected with COVID-19) working in hospitals treating patients with COVID-19. We used the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to assess their symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. RESULTS: A total of 885 (41.6%), 609 (28.6%) and 729 (34.3%) obstetricians and midwives reported depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 5), anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 5) and insomnia (ISI &#8805; 8), respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of whether or not they had direct contact with patients with COVID-19, obstetricians and midwives were more likely to report mild and moderate depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with before the pandemic. Those who had direct contact with patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report depression and insomnia than those who did not. Those who had sufficient protective equipment or training were less likely to report depression, anxiety and insomnia than those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that non-infectious disease specialist staff have experienced varying, but increased levels of depression, anxiety and insomnia during this COVID-19 pandemic, which could be reduced by sufficient levels of protective equipment and occupational COVID-19 workplace training.","Liu, Tao; Zheng, Zheng; Sha, Xiaoyan; Liu, Huishu; Zheng, Wenjing; Su, Huanxing; Xu, Guiyun; Su, Kuan-Pin; So, Kwok-Fai; Lin, Kangguang",BJPsych Open,,88

There are no reports of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in these patients. AIMS: To investigate prevalence of COVID-19 cases and seroprevalence among rheumatologic patients and the risk factors for infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a rheumatologic population. An online questionnaire was sent on 31 April 2020. Blood samples from 20% sample of patients were drawn for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were divided based on autoimmune (AI) diagnosis. Prevalence of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab and by serology (seroprevalence) was compared to national data. Risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2 were assessed. RESULTS: The study group included 1204 patients, 74.5% had an AI diagnosis. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.16% in the rheumatologic patient population and 0.22% in the AI group, which was not different from prevalence in Israel on 4 May 2020 (0.18%, P = 0.912 and P = 0.759 respectively). Serologic tests were performed in 242 patients, of which five were found positive pointing to a seroprevalence of 2.07%. Exposure to a known COVID-19 patient was the only significant risk factor for being positive by swab or by serology. AI diagnosis, immunosuppression, corticosteroid, hydroxychloroquine did not influence the risk. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in a population of rheumatologic patients was similar to that of the general population. Mild/asymptomatic cases may be prevalent according to serologic tests. The major risk factor for infection is exposure to a known case of COVID-19, and immunosuppression did not play a role in the risk of infection.","Eviatar, Tali; Elalouf, Ofir; Furer, Victoria; Goldstein-Lahat, Yael; Paran, Yael; Pel, Sara; Nevo, Sharon; Zisapel, Michael; Alcalay, Yifat; Elkayam, Ori",Intern Med J,,88

The sample included 108 patients who died due to COVID-19 disease and 215 controls who recovered from it (1:2 ratio). The chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression were used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Mortality was higher in older age patients with COVID-19 (mean = 65.4 years, standard deviation [SD] = 15.6) compared to recovered patients (mean = 39.5 years, SD = 14.8) (p<0.001) with a moderate effect size (eta squared = 0.06). Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] = 9.4), hypertension (OR = 8.6), cardiovascular disease (OR = 7.4), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.3), and obesity (OR = 2.0) were significantly associated with death due to COVID-19. Using logistic regression analysis, older age and diabetes mellitus were the primary independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. However, there was no significant association between a specific ABO blood group and mortality risk (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Older age and the presence of co-morbidities, especially diabetes mellitus, increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Establishing the causality of death in patients with COVID-19 should be a key aim of future studies.","Badedi, Mohammed; Makrami, Ali; Alnami, Awaji",J Infect Public Health,,88

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the analytic performance and handling of four rapid Antigen Point of Care Tests (AgPOCTs) I-IV (Distributors: (I) Roche, (II) Abbott, (III) MEDsan and (IV) Siemens). METHODS: 100 RT-PCR negative and 84 RT-PCR positive oropharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and used to determine performance and accuracy of these AgPOCTs. Handling was evaluated by 10 healthcare workers/users through a questionnaire. RESULTS: The median duration from symptom onset to sampling was 6 days (IQR 2-12 days). The overall respective sensitivity were 49.4 % (CI95 %: 38.9-59.9), 44.6 % (CI95 %: 34.3-55.3), 45.8 % (CI95 %: 35.5-56.5) and 54.9 % (CI95 %: 43.4-65.9) for tests I, II, III and IV, respectively. In the high viral load subgroup (containing >106 copies of SARS-CoV-2 /swab, n = 26), AgPOCTs reached sensitivities of 92.3 % or more (range 92.3 %-100 %). Specificity was 100 % for tests I, II (CI95 %: 96.3-100 for both tests) and IV (CI95 %: 96.3-100) and 97 % (CI95 %: 91.5-98.9) for test III. Regarding handling, test I obtained the overall highest scores, while test II was considered to have the most convenient components. Of note, users considered all assays, with the exception of test I, to pose a significant risk for contamination by drips or spills. DISCUSSION: Besides some differences in sensitivity and handling, all four AgPOCTs showed acceptable performance in high viral load samples. However, due to the significantly lower sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, a careful consideration of pro and cons of AgPOCT has to be taken into account before clinical implementation.","Olearo, Flaminia; Nörz, Dominik; Heinrich, Fabian; Sutter, Jan Peter; Roedl, Kevin; Schultze, Alexander; Wiesch, Julian Schulze Zur; Braun, Platon; Oestereich, Lisa; Kreuels, Benno; Wichmann, Dominic; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J Clin Virol,,88

METHODS: To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specimens would be missed after 10:1 pooling, we identified 10 specimens with midrange (ie, 25-34 cycles) and 10 with late (ie, >34-45 cycles) crossing threshold (Ct) values and tested these both neat and after 10:1 pooling. Final test results and Ct changes were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 17 of 20 specimens that contained SARS-CoV-2 were detected after 10:1 pooling with the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Cepheid), rendering an 85% positive percentage of agreement. All 10 of 10 specimens with an undiluted Ct in the mid-Ct range were detected after 10:1 pooling, in contrast to 7 of 10 with an undiluted Ct in the late-Ct range. The overall Ct difference between the neat testing and the 10:1 pool was 2.9 cycles for the N2 gene target and 3 cycles for the E gene target. The N2 gene reaction was more sensitive than the E gene reaction, detecting 16 of 20 positive specimens after 10:1 pooling compared with 9 of 20 specimens. CONCLUSIONS: An 85% positive percentage of agreement was achieved, with only specimens with low viral loads being missed following 10:1 pooling.

Analyses were carried out on the number of publications as (a) function of time (day), (b) journals and (c) authors. Doubling time of the number of publications was analyzed for PubMed “all articles” and Elsevier published articles. Analyzed databases were (1A) PubMed “all articles” (01/12/2019-12/06/2020) (1B) PubMed Review articles (01/12/2019-2/5/2020) and (1C) PubMed Clinical Trials (01/01/2020-30/06/2020) (2) Elsevier all publications (01/12/2019-25/05/2020) (3) RG (Article, Pre Print, Technical Report) (15/04/2020–30/4/2020).

Four compounds that have been registered by the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) were included to study their abilities to induce the fermentation of Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), a bacterial species abundant in the human skin. Liquid coco-caprylate/caprate (LCC), originally used as an emollient, effectively initiated the fermentation of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and provoked robust electricity. Application of LCC plus electrogenic S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 on mouse skin significantly reduced ultraviolet B (UV-B)-induced injuries which were evaluated by the formation of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), and skin lesions. A S. epidermidis S2 isolate with low expressions of genes encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh), and phosphate acetyltransferase (pta) was found to be poorly electrogenic. The protective action of electrogenic S. epidermidis against UV-B-induced skin injuries was considerably suppressed when mouse skin was applied with LCC in combination with a poorly electrogenic S. epidermidis S2 isolate. Exploring new indication of LCC for promoting S. epidermidis against UV-B provided an example of repurposing INCI-registered compounds as skin prebiotics.","Balasubramaniam, Arun; Adi, Prakoso; Tra My, Do Thi; Keshari, Sunita; Sankar, Raman; Chen, Chien-Lung; Huang, Chun-Ming",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78132-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299009/,88

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explain any ethnic differentials in COVID-19 hospitalization based on socioeconomic, lifestyle, mental and physical health factors. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with national registry linkage to hospitalisation for COVID-19. SETTING: Community-dwelling. PARTICIPANTS: 340,966 men and women (mean age 56.2 (SD=8.1) years; 54.3% women) residing in England from the UK Biobank study. EXPOSURES: Ethnicity classified as White, Black, Asian, and Others. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission in England from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. RESULTS: There were 640 COVID-19 cases (571/324,306 White, 31/4,485 Black, 21/5,732 Asian, 17/5,803 Other). Compared to the White study members and after adjusting for age and sex, Black individuals had over a 4-fold increased risk of being hospitalised (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: =4.32; 3.00-6.23), and there was a doubling of risk in the Asian group (2.12; 1.37, 3.28) and the ‘other’ non-white group (1.84; 1.13, 2.99). After controlling for 15 confounding factors which included neighbourhood deprivation, education, number in household, smoking, markers of body size, inflammation, and glycated haemoglobin, these effect estimates were attenuated by 33% for Blacks, 52% for Asians and 43% for Other, but remained raised for Blacks (2.66; 1.82, 3.91), Asian (1.43; 0.91, 2.26) and other non-white groups (1.41; 0.87, 2.31).

Moreover, the deep and pervasive history of medical racism in the U.S. has created a context in which some racial and ethnic groups exhibit greater levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy; yet few researchers have attempted to determine whether these patterns persist with time. The purpose of this study was twofold: (a.) assess the role of time in COVID-19 vaccine intentions from April 2020 to January 2021, and (b.) examine whether race and ethnicity shape COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories. Data were drawn from 9 waves of the Understanding America Study (n = 5023), a national probability panel study of U.S. adults. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to assess overall COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories and trajectories by race and ethnicity. Results demonstrate intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine significantly decreased from April 2020 to November 2020, but by January 2021, intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine slightly increased. Findings also show trajectories significantly differed by racial and ethnic background. Asian/Pacific Islanders had the highest probability of likely getting a COVID-19 vaccine at baseline, followed by Whites and Latina/os. Black Americans exhibited the lowest probability of likely getting vaccinated, and, in most cases, the gap between Black Americans and other racial groups grew over time. Key findings from this study demonstrate that, among U.S. adults, time and race and ethnicity play significant roles in COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Understanding the role of time and race and racism in shaping COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories can help government agencies and public health experts tasked with administrating vaccines better understand disparities in vaccine uptake.","Niño, Michael D.; Hearne, Brittany N.; Cai, Tianji",SSM Popul Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352827321000999; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827321000999?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075337/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100824,88

Aerosol-generating procedures have led to change in safety practices among HCPs. We thus evaluated the efficacy of the endoscopic safety measures among HCPs posted in the endoscopy unit. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, all endoscopic procedures performed over a period of 4 months, from 1 April to 31 July 2020 were included. We noted indications and number of COVID-positive procedures as well as comprehensive screening of HCPs posted in our endoscopy unit. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 among HCPs. RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred and sixty procedures were included in the analysis. Indications were divided as urgent (n = 190, 5.49%), semi-urgent (n = 553, 16%) and non-urgent group (n = 2717, 78.52%). Thirty-four procedures (0.98%) were done on diagnosed COVID-19 patients. The most common indications were gastrointestinal bleed (n = 12/34, 35.30%) followed by biliary sepsis (n = 9/34, 26.5%). Among the HCPs, the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 6.58% (n = 5/76). All HCPs recovered with excellent outcomes. A comprehensive screening showed 7.90% (n = 6/76) HCPs having Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in their sera. CONCLUSION: Addition of safety measures in endoscopy leads to low risk of transmission among HCPs.

However, initiation of these treatments requires adequate healthcare access. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in restrictions to healthcare services in March 2020. We examined the impact of COVID-19 on the number of individuals dispensed DAAs. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study examining the number of individuals dispensed DAAs in Ontario, Canada, from 2018 to 2020. Time-series models determined the impact of healthcare restrictions on DAA dispensations. RESULTS: Healthcare restrictions resulted in a 49.3% decrease in DAA dispensations (P = 0.026). DISCUSSION: COVID-19-related healthcare restrictions significantly affected access to DAAs. Studies exploring the long-term effects on reduced treatment are needed.","Konstantelos, Natalia; Shakeri, Ahmad; McCormack, Daniel; Feld, Jordan J; Gomes, Tara; Tadrous, Mina",Am J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34587128/; https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000001287,88

Relying on a synthesis of work across pediatric and adult primary care, this article shows some of the main ways that patients and parents pressure physicians for antibiotics, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and how physicians combat that pressure. All data are from video recordings of community-based clinical encounters allowing us to see what is happening “on the ground.” Strategies that physicians actually use are documented; however, untutored physicians do not rely on these reliably or strategically, leaving substantial room for the deployment of a three-pronged communication strategy that can reduce patient pressure and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.","Stivers, Tanya",Paediatr Drugs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40272-021-00466-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34410633/,88

The vast majority of these deaths are in resource-limited areas. Deaths due to infection have been associated with lack of access to clean water, overcrowded nurseries, and improper disinfection (reprocessing) of equipment, including vital resuscitation equipment. Reprocessing has recently come to heightened attention, with the COVID-19 pandemic bringing this issue to the forefront across all economic levels; however, it is particularly challenging in low-resource settings. In 2015, Eslami et al. published a letter to the editor in Resuscitation, highlighting concerns about the disinfection of equipment being used to resuscitate newborns in Kenya. To address the issue of improper disinfection, the global health nongovernment organization PATH gathered a group of experts and, due to lack of best-practice evidence, published guidelines with recommendations for reprocessing of neonatal resuscitation equipment in low-resource areas. The guidelines follow the gold-standard principle of high-level disinfection; however, there is ongoing concern that the complexity of the guideline would make feasibility and sustainability difficult in the settings for which it was designed. Observations from hospitals in Kenya and Malawi reinforce this concern. The purpose of this review is to discuss why proper disinfection of equipment is important, why this is challenging in low-resource settings, and suggestions for solutions to move forward.","White, Anne M.; Mutai, Dominic; Cheruiyot, David; Rule, Amy R.

While the numbers of infected patients and death toll keep vigorous increasing, curbing the progression of the pandemic is an urgent goal. Efforts have been made to search for prophylactic and therapeutic approaches including neutralizing antibodies development. By reviewing dozens of studies on anti-spike antibodies identification, we concluded that (1) promising therapeutic antibodies are being fished out by various approaches, such as screening of single B cells of convalescent patients, recombinant antibody library and B cells of immunized animals; (2) the epitopes are mainly RBD, but also some non-RBD domains, without the requisite of overlapping with ACE2 binding sites; (3) Neutralizing antibodies are convergent to a few germline genes, including IGHV3-30, IGHV3-53, IGHV3-66, with varying levels of somatic mutations. This review summarizes the progress in neutralizing antibodies development and the germline enrichment of effective antibodies, which will shed light on COVID-19 treatment and vaccine design.","Xiaojie, Shi; Yu, Li; lei, Yan; Guang, Yang; Min, Qiang",Stem Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33341604/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873506120304268?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scr.2020.102125; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1873506120304268,88

METHODS: Hospitalised patients with moderate (n = 5) and severe (n = 5) COVID-19 were recruited and transfused with CP from donors who recovered from mild (n = 5), moderate (n = 5), or severe (n = 1) COVID-19. Neutralising antibodies (NAbs) to the virus were measured at the end of the study using a surrogate virus neutralisation test as an alternative to the plaque reduction assay. Clinical improvement was assessed based on the modified World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint six-point scale, Brixia Chest-X-Ray scoring, and laboratory parameters. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04407208). FINDINGS: CP transfusion in three doses of 3 mL/kg of recipient body weight at 2-day intervals was well tolerated. Good clinical improvement was achieved in all patients with moderate disease and in two patients with severe disease. Most patients at baseline had detectable NAbs with median inhibition rates comparable to those of the donors (90·91% vs. 86·31%; p = 0·379). This could be due to the unavailability of pre-donation NAb testing and postponed CP administration that required communal consent. INTERPRETATION: This study highlights the safety of CP therapy. Although improvements were observed, we could not conclude that the outcomes were solely due to CP treatment. Further randomised controlled trials that cover different disease stages with pre-donation NAb measurements using locally applicable strategies are warranted. FUNDING: The study was supported by PT Bio Farma, Indonesia.","Rejeki, Marliana S.; Sarnadi, Nana; Wihastuti, Retno; Fazharyasti, Vininta; Samin, Wisvici Y.; Yudhaputri, Frilasita A.; Johar, Edison; Nurainy, Neni; Bachtiar, Novilia S.; Muljono, David H.",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104878/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S258953702100211X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258953702100211X,88

Lipid-based nanoparticles have played a pivotal role in the successes of COVID-19 vaccines and many other nanomedicines, such as Doxil(®) and Onpattro(®), and have therefore been considered as the frontrunner in nanoscale drug delivery systems. In this review, we aim to highlight the progress in the development of these lipid nanoparticles for various applications, ranging from cancer nanomedicines to COVID-19 vaccines. The lipid-based nanoparticles discussed in this review are liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers. We particularly focus on the innovations that have obtained regulatory approval or that are in clinical trials. We also discuss the physicochemical properties required for specific applications, highlight the differences in requirements for the delivery of different cargos, and introduce current challenges that need further development. This review serves as a useful guideline for designing new lipid nanoparticles for both preventative and therapeutic vaccines including immunotherapies.","Thi, Thai Thanh Hoang; Suys, Estelle J.

To facilitate vaccine acceptance via effective health communication, it is key to understand levels of vaccine scepticism and the demographic, psychological and political predictors. To this end, we examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine in large online surveys from eight Western democracies that differ in terms of the severity of the pandemic and their response: Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Italy, UK and USA (total N=18 231). Survey respondents were quota sampled to match the population margins on age, gender and geographical location for each country. The study was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, allowing us to assess changes in acceptance and predictors as COVID-19 vaccine programmes were rolled out. OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome of the study is self-reported acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine approved and recommended by health authorities. RESULTS: The data reveal large variations in vaccine acceptance that ranges from 83% in Denmark to 47% in France and Hungary. Lack of vaccine acceptance is associated with lack of trust in authorities and scientists, conspiratorial thinking and a lack of concern about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most national levels of vaccine acceptance fall below estimates of the required threshold for herd immunity. The results emphasise the long-term importance of building trust in preparations for health emergencies such as the current pandemic. For health communication, the results emphasise the importance of focusing on personal consequences of infections and debunking of myths to guide communication strategies.","Lindholt, Marie Fly; Jørgensen, Frederik; Bor, Alexander; Petersen, Michael Bang",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130963/,88

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different strategies, based either on an interleukin-1 inhibitor, anakinra, or on a JAK inhibitor, such as baricitinib, on the survival of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Individuals admitted to two hospitals because of COVID-19 were included if they fulfilled the clinical, radiological, and laboratory criteria for moderate-to-severe disease. Patients were classified according to the first immunomodulatory drug prescribed: anakinra or baricitinib. All subjects were concomitantly treated with corticosteroids, in addition to standard care. The main outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital death. Statistical analysis included propensity score matching and Cox regression model. Results: The study subjects included 125 and 217 individuals in the anakinra and baricitinib groups, respectively. IMV was required in 13 (10.4%) and 10 (4.6%) patients, respectively (p = 0.039). During this period, 22 (17.6%) and 36 (16.6%) individuals died in both groups (p = 0.811). Older age, low functional status, high comorbidity, need for IMV, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and use of a high flow of oxygen at initially were found to be associated with worse clinical outcomes. No differences according to the immunomodulatory therapy used were observed. For most of the deceased individuals, early interruption of anakinra or baricitinib had occurred at the time of their admission to the intensive care unit. Conclusions: Similar mortality is observed in patients treated with anakinra or baricitinib plus corticosteroids.","García-García, José A; Pérez-Quintana, Marta; Ramos-Giráldez, Consuelo; Cebrián-González, Isabel; Martín-Ponce, María L; del Valle-Villagrán, José; Navarro-Puerto, María A; Sánchez-Villegas, Jorge; Gómez-Herreros, Rocío; Manoja-Bustos, Isabel; León-Martí, Daniel; Serrano-Rodríguez, Lucía; de Miguel-Albarreal, Alejandra; Velasco-Romero, María J; Mula-Falcón, Francisco; Fernández-Pérez, Pilar; Melguizo-Moya, Isabel; Pérez-Quintana, María J; Romero-Molina, Guillermo; Vergara-López, Salvador; Marenco-de la Fuente, José L; Marín-Martín, Jorge; Mira-Escarti, José A",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10174019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501467/,88

At a mechanistic level the chronic inflammatory environment of obesity predisposes to life threatening events such as cytokine storm and enhanced coagulopathy. Obesity and its management are affected by diverse factors manifested at societal, educational, racial, and nutritional levels. A multidisciplinary approach is required to manage obese and type 2 diabetic patients, not only during the current COVID-19 crisis, but to decrease the growing burden of cardiometabolic disease and associated cardiovascular complications impacting future viral pandemics.

One Health offers the opportunity to acknowledge shared interests, set common goals, and drive toward team work to benefit the overall health of a nation. As in most countries, the health of Rwanda's people and economy are highly dependent on the health of the environment. Recently, Rwanda has developed a One Health strategic plan to meet its human, animal and environmental health challenges. This approach drives innovations that are important to solve both acute and chronic health problems and offers synergy across systems, resulting in improved communication, evidence-based solutions, development of a new generation of systems-thinkers, improved surveillance, decreased lag time in response, and improved health and economic savings. Several factors have enabled the One Health movement in Rwanda including an elaborate network of community health workers, existing rapid response teams, international academic partnerships willing to look more broadly than at a single disease or population, and relative equity between female and male health professionals. Barriers to implementing this strategy include competition over budget, poor communication, and the need for improved technology.

Here, we have evaluated such an RDT. METHODS: We have assessed the Xiamen AmonMed Biotechnology COVID-19 IgM/IgG test kit (Colloidal gold) and the EUROIMMUN benchtop assay with serum samples from patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 disease. Samples from patients with Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) infection and blood donors were used for specificity testing. RESULTS: For the colloid gold rapid test and the EUROIMMUN assay, the study indicated overall sensitivity of 15.2% and 67.4%, respectively, while specificity of 99.0% and 97.9% with the blood donor sera, as well as 100% and 96.8% with the EBV-patients, were observed, respectively. An association of the time period between positive PCR results and serum acquisition with serological test positivity could be observed for the immunologlobulin G subclass of the EUROIMMUN assay only. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of acceptable specificity of the assessed RDT, the detected poor sensitivity leaves room for improvement.

However, en masse mitigation has come with substantial socioeconomic costs. In this paper we demonstrate how individualized policies based on disease status can reduce transmission risk while minimizing impacts on economic outcomes. We design feedback control policies informed by optimal control solutions to modulate interaction rates of individuals based on the epidemic state. We identify personalized interaction rates such that recovered/immune individuals elevate their interactions and susceptible individuals remain at home before returning to pre-lockdown levels. As we show, feedback control policies can yield similar population-wide infection rates to total shutdown but with significantly lower economic costs and with greater robustness to uncertainty compared to optimal control policies. Our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","Li, Guanlin; Shivam, Shashwat; Hochberg, Michael E.; Wardi, Yorai; Weitz, Joshua S.",iScience,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004221006787; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102710; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221006787?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127957/,88

Specifically, 13 Macro-Hubs were identified to deliver timely optimal care to patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Aim of this paper is to present the results of this experience. Methods and Results This is a multicenter, observational study. A total of 953 patients were included, presenting with STEMI in 57.7% of the cases. About 98% of patients received coronary angiography with a median since first medical contact to angiography of 79 (IQR 45-124) minutes for STEMI and 1262 (IQR 643-2481) minutes for NSTEMI. A total of 107 patients (11.2%) had SARS-CoV2 infection, mostly with STEMI (74.8%). The time interval from first medical contact to cath-lab was significant shorter in patients with COVID-19, both in the overall population and in STEMI patients (87 (IQR 41-310) versus 160 (IQR 67-1220) minutes, P = 0.001, and 61 (IQR 23-98) versus 80 (IQR 47-126) minutes, P = 0.01, respectively).

Conclusions During the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, the redefinition of ACS network according to enlarged Macro-Hubs allowed to continue with timely ACS management, while reserving a high number of intensive care beds for the pandemic. Patients with ACS and COVID-19 presented a worst outcome, particularly in case of STEMI.","Carugo, Stefano; Ferlini, Marco; Castini, Diego; Andreassi, Aida; Guagliumi, Giulio; Metra, Marco; Lombardi, Carlo; Cuccia, Claudio; Savonitto, Stefano; Piatti, Luigi; D'Urbano, Maurizio; Lettieri, Corrado; Vandoni, Pietro; Lettino, Maddalena; Marenzi, Giancarlo; Montorfano, Matteo; Zangrillo, Alberto; Castiglioni, Battistina; De Ponti, Roberto; Oltrona Visconti, Luigi",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352906720303602?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352906720303602; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcha.2020.100662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173807/,88

A preliminary study indicated that reverse passive haemagglutination (RPHA) was at least as sensitive as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These two immunoassays were compared with the detection of viral RNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 209 field samples. Of the 77 samples in which at least one test gave a positive result, 69 were positive by both RPHA and PAGE, but only 49 were also positive by ELISA, indicating a lower sensitivity for the latter test. The overall agreement between RPHA and PAGE was 96%.

To gauge the effectiveness of these measures at the University of Pennsylvania, we conducted a longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity and seroconversion in patients presenting to infusion centers for cancer-directed therapy between 5/21/2020 and 10/8/2020. Participants completed questionnaires and had up to five serial blood collections. Of 124 enrolled patients, only two (1.6%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative patients developed newly detectable antibodies on subsequent blood draw(s), corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 0% (95%CI 0.0-4.1%) over 14.8 person-years of follow up, with a median of 13 healthcare visits per patient. These results suggest that cancer patients receiving in-person care at a facility with aggressive mitigation efforts have an extremely low likelihood of COVID-19 infection.","Sun, L.; Surya, S.; G., N.; Le, A.

METHODS: A Twitter survey was sent to 230 likely urology applicants connected through the UroResidency platform. It asked about the relative value of components of the virtual open house and areas for suggested improvement. RESULTS: 70 responded. Most potential applicants valued virtual open houses that discussed strengths and weaknesses of the program, had time to interact directly with the faculty, and included resident led presentations or discussions. Most agreed programs needed to have more direct time with residents to better understand the culture of the program.

Co-infection of MA-104 cells with two culture-adapted North American PRRSV strains resulted in recombinant viral particles containing chimeric ORF 3 and ORF 4 proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned recombinant PCR products, encompassing 1182 bases of the 15.4 kb viral genome, revealed six independent recombination events. Recombinant products persisted in culture for at least three passages, indicating continuous formation of recombinant viruses, growth of recombinant viruses in competition with parental viruses, or both. The frequency of recombination was estimated from <2% up to 10% in the 1182 b fragment analyzed, which is similar to recombination frequencies observed in coronaviruses. An apparent example of natural ORF 5 recombination between naturally occurring wild type viruses was also found, indicating that recombination is likely an important genetic mechanism contributing to PRRSV evolution.","Yuan, Shishan; Nelsen, Chris J.; Murtaugh, Michael P.; Schmitt, Beverly J.; Faaberg, Kay S.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10426212/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170299000295; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170299000295,88

It includes information regarding infection control measures, administrative and professional support. This was followed by evaluation of psychological factor that can act as a barrier in effective management of these patients. METHODS: The survey was conducted on line using Google Form. After approval from hospital ethical committee survey link was disseminated to HCPs using social media. RESULTS: Four hundred fifteen HCPs were participated. Most of them were younger than 30 years and majority of them were postgraduate trainees. Results showed gaps in the knowledge about basic infection control measure like donning/doffing and understanding about high-risk procedures. On job training, professional and administrative support is compromising. Many of HCPs are anxious nowadays, having symptoms related to burn out with logical reasons behind. Even with all those hurdles they are committed and ready to volunteer themselves. CONCLUSION: The HCPs of Pakistan needs urgent attention for providing them Formal training regarding infection control measure. Administrative and professional support is required from institutions and scientific societies. Online teaching modules and webinar is a suitable option.

603389,"Coinfection modulates inflammatory responses, clinical outcome and pathogen load of H1N1 swine influenza virus and Haemophilus parasuis infections in pigs",2017-12-04,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a host cell membrane protein (receptor) that mediates the binding of coronavirus, most notably SARS coronaviruses in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Although SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is mainly confined to humans, there have been numerous incidents of spillback (reverse zoonoses) to domestic and captive animals. An absence of information on the spatial distribution of ACE2 in animal tissues limits our understanding of host species susceptibility. Here, we describe the distribution of ACE2 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on histological sections derived from carnivores, ungulates, primates and chiroptera. Comparison of mink (Neovison vison) and ferret (Mustela putorius furo) respiratory tracts showed substantial differences, demonstrating that ACE2 is present in the lower respiratory tract of mink but not ferrets. The presence of ACE2 in the respiratory tract in some species was much more restricted as indicated by limited immunolabelling in the nasal turbinate, trachea and lungs of cats (Felis catus) and only the nasal turbinate in the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). In the lungs of other species, ACE2 could be detected on the bronchiolar epithelium of the sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos taurus), European badger (Meles meles), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), tiger and lion (Panthera spp.). In addition, ACE2 was present in the nasal mucosa epithelium of the serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) but not in pig (Sus scrofa domestica), cattle or sheep. In the intestine, ACE2 immunolabelling was seen on the microvillus of enterocytes (surface of intestine) across various taxa. These results provide anatomical evidence of ACE2 expression in a number of species which will enable further understanding of host susceptibility and tissue tropism of ACE2 receptor‐mediated viral infection.","Lean, Fabian Z.

604074,Rna Viruses Redirect Host Factors to Better Amplify Their Genome,2005-12-29,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 patients who present with strokes but without typical COVID-19 symptoms have been described in small numbers. Despite the paucity of fever and respiratory symptoms, they remain capable of infecting others. The patient we discuss herein highlights the important issues of strokes as presenting events of COVID-19 infections, and how testing for COVID-19 in stroke patients, even when asymptomatic for COVID-19, can play an important role in infection control, clinical management and outcomes amidst this global pandemic. CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old male resident of a dormitory presented to our unit with acute vertigo and left-sided dysmetria. NIHSS was 2. The initial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated infarction of the left cerebellar hemisphere, middle cerebellar peduncle and hemipons. An extensive work-up for stroke etiologies was unremarkable. Despite having no fever, respiratory symptoms, anosmia or ageusia, he was isolated and screened for COVID-19 due to his epidemiologic risks, with multiple residents from his dormitory being recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Confirming our suspicion, his respiratory samples returned positive for COVID-19. His D-dimer levels returned normal. Thereafter, the patient underwent posterior decompression surgery due to worsening edema caused by the cerebellar infarct. He was started on antiplatelet therapy and recovered significantly a month from presentation with an modified Rankin Sore of 2. He remained without typical COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our patient’s case clearly supports the screening for COVID-19 in stroke patients who are without COVID-19 symptoms, appreciating the significant value it adds to infection control, clinical management, and outcomes amidst this global pandemic.","Tan, You-Jiang; Narasimhalu, Kaavya; Chan, Yvonne; De Silva, Deidre A.",Neurologist,https://doi.org/10.1097/nrl.0000000000000305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646994/,88

DESIGN: Cohort study with a mean follow-up of 12.8 days. SETTING: Public university hospital (Madrid, Spain). PARTICIPANTS: 499 patients 80 and above consecutively admitted to a Spanish public university hospital between 4 March 2020 and 16 May 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Mortality was the main outcome. Data of sociodemographic variables (age, sex, living), comorbidities, polypharmacy, functional status, date of hospital admission and length of stay was recorded. Clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings were collected at time of admission. For multivariant analysis, logistic regressions were performed to identify risk factors for death. RESULTS: Mean age was 86.7±4.4 with 37% of death. Mortality was associated with male gender [odds ratio (OR) 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–2.24], with a 5-points increase on Barthel Index [OR 1.01 (95%CI 1.00–1.02)], higher Charlson Index score [OR 1.13 (95%CI 1.02–1.26)] and comorbidities [OR 1.28 (95%CI 1.06–1.53)], hyperpolipharmacy [OR 2.00 (95%CI 1.04–3.82)], unilateral pneumonia [OR 1.83 (95%CI 1.01–3.30)], higher levels of C-reactive protein [OR 1.09 (95%CI 1.06–1.12)] and creatine [OR 1.48 (95%CI 1.15–1.89)]. Higher oxygen levels were a protective factor [OR 0.92 (95%CI 0.89–0.95)]. CONCLUSIONS: Functional status, being male, a higher burden of comorbidities, hyperpolipharmacy, unilateral pneumonia and some laboratory parameters predict in-hospital mortality in this older population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n=12), severe cases(group B, n=15) and critical cases (group C, n=24) were retrospectively enrolled. The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher's exact test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H test and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases. Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A(69% sensitivity, 83% specificity and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C. Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these three groups with high sensitivity(B+C vs. A, 90%; C vs. B, 92%), specificity(100%, 87%) and accuracy(92%, 90%). Critical cases had higher total severity score(>10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation(>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density(>-779HU) and full width at half maximum(>128HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density(≦50%) than ordinary/severe cases. In our critical cases, eight patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and two of them had died. CONCLUSION: A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.","Lyu, Peijie; Liu, Xing; Zhang, Rui; Shi, Lei; Gao, Jianbo",Invest Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304402/; https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000689,88

They are typically assessed using validated, self-completed questionnaires known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs are used in healthcare settings to support care planning, clinical decision-making, patient–practitioner communication and quality improvement. PROMs have a potential role in the delivery of social care where people often have multiple and complex long-term health conditions. However, the use of PROMs in this context is currently unclear. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the evidence relating to the use of PROMs in adult social care. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The electronic databases Medline (Ovid), PsychInfo (Ovid), ASSIA (ProQuest), Social Care Online (SCIE), Web of Science and EMBASE (Ovid) were searched on 29 September 2020 to identify eligible studies and other publically available documents published since 2010. A grey literature search and hand searching of citations and reference lists of the included studies will also be undertaken. No restrictions on study design or language of publication will be applied. Screening and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. Quality appraisal of the included documents will use the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and AACODS (Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance) checklists. A customised data charting table will be used for data extraction, with analysis of qualitative data using the framework method. The review findings will be presented as tables and in a narrative summary. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical review is not required as scoping reviews are a form of secondary data analysis that synthesise data from publically available sources. Review findings will be shared with service users and other relevant stakeholders and disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical data. SETTING: Single-center rural community-based medical center in Grand Island, NE. PATIENTS: One hundred five nonintubated, coronavirus disease-infected patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After patients were educated on the benefits of awake self-proning, compliance was voluntary. The primary outcome was need for intubation during the hospital stay; secondary outcomes included serial peripheral capillary oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry to the Fio(2) ratios, in-hospital mortality, and discharge disposition. Of 105 nonintubated, coronavirus disease-infected patients, 40 tolerated awake self-proning. Patients who were able to prone were younger and had lower disease severity. The risk of intubation was lower in proned patients after adjusting for disease severity using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.09–0.96; p = 0.043) or Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10–0.91; p = 0.034). No prone patient died compared with 24.6% of patients who were not prone (p < 0.001; number needed to treat = 5; 95% CI, 3–8). The probability of being discharged alive and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry to the Fio(2) ratios were statistically similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Awake self-proning was associated with lower mortality and intubation rates in coronavirus disease 2019-infected patients. Prone positioning appears to be a safe and inexpensive strategy to improve outcomes and spare limited resources. Prospective efforts are needed to better delineate the effect of awake proning on oxygenation and to improve patients’ ability to tolerate this intervention.","Jagan, Nikhil; Morrow, Lee E.; Walters, Ryan W.; Klein, Lauren P.; Wallen, Tanner J.; Chung, Jacqueline; Plambeck, Robert W.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063033/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000229,88

Most previous applications of HFE related to occupational ergonomics rather than healthcare safety. METHODS: The paper details how the reputation of HFE is being developed within healthcare communities of Latin America (LatAm), through increasing awareness and understanding of its role as safety science in the healthcare sector. It starts by articulating the need for HFE and then provides examples from Mexico, Colombia and Peru. RESULTS: The practical examples for research and education illustrate a developing awareness of the relevance of HFE to the healthcare sectors in LatAm and an appreciation of its worth to improve health service quality and patient safety through healthcare community engagement. A new LatAm Network of HFE in Healthcare Systems (RELAESA) was formed in 2019, which has provided a platform for HFE advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a real opportunity in LatAm and other LMIC health services to make more rapid and sustainable progress in healthcare-embedded HFE than has been experienced within healthcare services of more developed nations.","Aceves-González, Carlos; Rodríguez, Yordán; Escobar-Galindo, Carlos Manuel; Pérez, Elizabeth; Gutiérrez-Moreno, Beatriz; Hignett, Sue; Lang, Alexandra Rosewall",Int J Qual Health Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33432981/; https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa135,88

Understanding how demographic cues impact networks of creative collaborators is critical for elevating creative performances therein. We conducted a randomized experiment to investigate how the knowledge of peers’ gender and racial identities distorts people’s connection patterns and the resulting creative outcomes in a dynamic social network. Consistent with prior work, we found that creative inspiration links are primarily formed with top idea-generators. However, when gender and racial identities are known, not only is there (1) an increase of [Formula: see text] in the odds of same-gender connections to persist (but not for same-race connections), but (2) the semantic similarity of idea-sets stimulated by these connections also increase significantly compared to demography-agnostic networks, negatively impacting the outcomes of divergent creativity. We found that ideas tend to be significantly more homogeneous within demographic groups than between, taking away diversity-bonuses from similarity-based links and partly explaining the results.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created substantial stress for pregnant women. PURPOSE: To understand whether stress experienced by women pregnant at the beginning of the pandemic was associated with a greater prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant women across the USA aged ≥18 years old enrolled in a prospective cohort study during the pandemic onset (T1) in April–May 2020. This report focuses on the 1,367 participants who gave birth prior to July–August 2020 (T2). Hierarchical logistic regression models predicted preterm birth, small for gestational age infants, and unplanned operative delivery from T1 stress, sociodemographic, and medical factors. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors, preterm birth was predicted by high prenatal maternal stress, delivering an infant small for gestational age was predicted by interpersonal violence and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic, and unplanned cesarean or operative vaginal delivery was predicted by prenatal appointment alterations, experiencing a major stressful life event, and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic. Independent of these associations, African American women were more likely than other groups to deliver preterm. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women who are experiencing high stress during the COVID-19 pandemic are at risk of poorer perinatal outcomes. A longitudinal investigation is critical to determine whether prenatal maternal stress and resulting outcomes have longer-term consequences for the health and well-being of children born in the midst of the current pandemic.","Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Pati, Susmita; Heiselman, Cassandra; Lobel, Marci",Ann Behav Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaab005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33724334/,88

The model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free and a unique endemic equilibrium. The existence and local stability of the disease free and endemic equilibria are explored in terms of the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text]. It is observed that media coverage does not affect the effective reproduction number, but it helps to mitigate disease burden by lowering the number of infectious individuals at the endemic steady state and also lowering the infection peak. A new approach is proposed to estimate the coefficient of media coverage. Using the results of central manifold theory, it is established that as [Formula: see text] passes through unity, transcritical bifurcation occurs in the system and the unique endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable. It is observed that the population level impact of quarantine and isolation depend on the level of transmission by the isolated individuals. Moreover, the higher level of pre-existing immunity in the population decreases the infection peak and causes its early arrival. Theoretical findings are supported by numerical simulation. Sensitivity analysis is performed for [Formula: see text] and state variables at endemic steady state with respect to model parameters.","Sahu, Govind Prasad; Dhar, Joydip",J Math Anal Appl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X14007586; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmaa.2014.08.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022247X14007586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226134/,88

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen with a 100 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen in patients with acute PTE. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted in which 118 patients with acute PTE and either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction were randomly assigned to receive a treatment regiment of either rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h (n = 65) or 100 mg/2 h (n = 53). The efficacy was determined by observing the improvements of right ventricular dysfunctions (RVDs) on echocardiograms, lung perfusion defects on ventilation perfusion lung scans, and pulmonary artery obstructions on CT angiograms. The adverse events, including death, bleeding, and PTE recurrence, were also evaluated. RESULTS: Progressive improvements in RVDs, lung perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery obstructions were found to be similarly significant in both treatment groups. This is true for patients with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. Three (6%) patients in the rt-PA 100 mg/2 h group and one (2%) in the rt-PA 50 mg/2 h group died as the result of either PTE or bleeding. Importantly, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen resulted in less bleeding tendency than the 100 mg/2 h regimen (3% vs 10%), especially in patients with a body weight < 65 kg (14.8% vs 41.2%, P = .049). No fatal recurrent PTE was found in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the 100 mg/2 h regimen, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen exhibits similar efficacy and perhaps better safety in patients with acute PTE. These findings support the notion that optimizing rt-PA dosing is worthwhile when treating patients with PTE.

In order to improve oxygenation and survival, patients admitted to intensive care units and intubated may undergo prone position mechanical ventilation. Prolonged prone positioning may cause meralgia paraesthetica due to lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment between the inguinal ligament and the anterior superior iliac spine. Reports of the first two cases have been recently published. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 52-year-old man with respiratory failure during COVID-19 infection, who underwent prone position ventilation for 16 hours a day over 19 days and developed persistent burning pain and dysaesthesia on the lateral surface of the thigh bilaterally, diagnosed as meralgia paraesthetica. CONCLUSION: This is the second report describing meralgia paraesthetica following prone position ventilation in COVID-19. Given the ongoing pandemic and the inevitability of more patients with severe respiratory distress requiring prone position ventilation, this disabling entrapment condition should be considered and possibly prevented. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 may require intubation and mechanical ventilation because of respiratory distress. Prone position ventilation improves oxygenation, but may cause lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment and meralgia paraesthetica. Medical personnel should be aware of the risk of meralgia paraesthetica as a disabling condition potentially affecting more patients as the COVID-19 pandemic persists.","Marinelli, Lucio; Mori, Laura; Avanti, Chiara; Cotellessa, Filippo; Fabbri, Sabrina; Schenone, Cristina; Trompetto, Carlo",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,https://doi.org/10.12890/2020_002039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313017/,88
609919,Glycosylation of Zika Virus is Important in Host–Virus Interaction and Pathogenic Potential,2019-10-21,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide health emergency which calls for an unprecedented race for vaccines and treatment. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, S-2P. To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of neutralizing antibodies in sera of immunized mice against pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018 and alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","Kuo, Tsun-Yung; Lin, Meei-Yun; Coffman, Robert L.; Campbell, John D.; Traquina, Paula; Lin, Yi-Jiun; Liu, Luke Tzu-Chi; Cheng, Jinyi; Wu, Yu-Chi; Wu, Chung-Chin; Tang, Wei-Hsuan; Huang, Chung-Guei; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Chen, Charles",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208827/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77077-z,88

610714,"Swine interferon-induced transmembrane protein, sIFITM3, inhibits foot-and-mouth disease virus infection in vitro and in vivo",2014-06-26,"Background: As countries begin to ease the lockdown measures instituted to control the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of a resurgence of the pandemic, and early reports of this are already emerging from some countries. Unlike many other countries, the UK started easing lockdown in England when levels of community transmission were still high, and this could have a major impact on case numbers and deaths. However thus far, the likely impacts of easing restrictions at this point in the pandemic have not been quantified. Using a Bayesian model, we assessed the potential impacts of successive lockdown easing measures in England, focussing on scenarios where the reproductive number (R) remains <1 in line with the UK governments stated aim. Methods: We developed a Bayesian model to infer incident cases and R in England, from incident death data from the Office of National Statistics. We then used this to forecast excess cases and deaths in multiple plausible scenarios in which R increases at one or more time points, compared to a baseline scenario where R remains unchanged by the easing of lockdown. Findings: The model inferred an R of 0.752 on the 13th May when England first started easing lockdown. In the most conservative scenario where R increases to 0.80 as lockdown was eased further on 1st June and then remained constant, the model predicts an excess 257 (95% 108-492) deaths and 26,447 (95% CI 11,105-50,549) cumulative cases over 90 days. In the scenario with maximal increases in R (but staying <1) with successive easing of lockdown, the model predicts 3,174 (95% 1,334-6,060) excess cumulative deaths and 421,310 (95% 177,012-804,811) excess cases. Results: When levels of transmission are high, even small changes in R with easing of lockdown can have significant impacts on expected cases and deaths, even if R remains <1. This will have a major impact on population health, tracing systems and health care services in England. Following an elimination strategy rather than one of maintenance of R below 1 would substantially mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic within England. This study provides urgently needed information for developing public health policy for the next stages of the pandemic.","Ziauddeen, H.; Subramaniam, N.; Gurdasani, D.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.21.20136853; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.21.20136853v1?rss=1,88

At the early stages of the pandemic, Ecuador was one of the most affected countries in Latin America. The objective of this study was to assess the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in the Ecuadorian general population during the social isolation period due to COVID-19. METHODS: A web-based survey consisting of 31 short-answer and multiple-choice questions was administered to the general population from April 22–May 3, 2020. Mental health status was assessed through the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire. Ordinal logistic analyses were used to identify potential risk factors associated with the severity of mental health issues. RESULTS: A total of 626 individuals were included. Most of them were females (60.5%), and their mean age was 29.6 ± 11.7 years. Approximately 17.7% of the respondents had moderate to very severe levels of depression, 30.7% had similar levels of anxiety, and 14.2% experienced stress. Female sex, younger age, student status, and having a relative diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Ordinal regression models showed that being a student was a risk factor for having more severe levels of depression (OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.56–5.26, p: 0.0001), anxiety (OR= 1.86; 95% CI= 1.35–2.55, p: 0.0001), and stress (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.47–3.19, p: 0.0001). Having a relative with COVID-19 was also found to be a risk factor only for depression (OR= 1.70; 95% CI= 1.03–2.80, p: 0.036) and anxiety (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.35–3.47, p: 0.001). Additionally, male sex, older age, and having more children were found to be protective factors for the three conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that social isolation due to the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the mental health of the general population in Ecuador. We identified potential risk and protective factors that could serve as a foundation from which to develop psychological strategies to safeguard the mental health of our population during the current pandemic.

Herein, we performed phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), tissue and immune-cell specific expression/splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTL/sQTL), and colocalization analyses for genetic risk loci suggestively associated with severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure. Thirteen phenotypes/traits were associated with the severe COVID-19-associated loci at the genome-wide significance threshold, including monocyte counts, fat metabolism traits, and fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In addition, we identified tissue and immune subtype-specific eQTL associations affecting 48 genes, including several that may directly impact host immune responses, colocalized with the severe COVID-19 GWAS associations, and showed altered expression in single-cell transcriptomes.

Understanding differences in the way patients interact with these communication platforms can inform their use and design for hypertension management. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to explore the unique phenotypes of patient interactions with an automated text messaging platform for BP monitoring. Our secondary aim was to estimate associations between interaction phenotypes and BP control. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial for adults with poorly controlled hypertension. A total of 201 patients with established primary care were assigned to the automated texting platform; messages exchanged throughout the 4-month program were analyzed. We used the k-means clustering algorithm to characterize two different interaction phenotypes: program conformity and engagement style. First, we identified unique clusters signifying differences in program conformity based on the frequency over time of error alerts, which were generated to patients when they deviated from the requested text message format (eg, ###/## for BP). Second, we explored overall engagement styles, defined by error alerts and responsiveness to text prompts, unprompted messages, and word count averages. Finally, we applied the chi-square test to identify associations between each interaction phenotype and achieving the target BP. RESULTS: We observed 3 categories of program conformity based on their frequency of error alerts: those who immediately and consistently submitted texts without system errors (perfect users, 51/201), those who did so after an initial learning period (adaptive users, 66/201), and those who consistently submitted messages generating errors to the platform (nonadaptive users, 38/201). Next, we observed 3 categories of engagement style: the enthusiast, who tended to submit unprompted messages with high word counts (17/155); the student, who inconsistently engaged (35/155); and the minimalist, who engaged only when prompted (103/155). Of all 6 phenotypes, we observed a statistically significant association between patients demonstrating the minimalist communication style (high adherence, few unprompted messages, limited information sharing) and achieving target BP (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified unique interaction phenotypes among patients engaging with an automated text message platform for remote BP monitoring. Only the minimalist communication style was associated with achieving target BP. Identifying and understanding interaction phenotypes may be useful for tailoring future automated texting interactions and designing future interventions to achieve better BP control.","Davoudi, Anahita; Lee, Natalie S; Chivers, Corey; Delaney, Timothy; Asch, Elizabeth L; Reitz, Catherine; Mehta, Shivan J; Chaiyachati, Krisda H; Mowery, Danielle L",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270032/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22493,88

Here we report alterations in the plasma metabolome reflecting the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients with mild (ambulatory) diseases, moderate disease (radiologically confirmed pneumonitis, hospitalization and oxygen therapy), and critical disease (in intensive care). This analysis revealed major disease- and stage-associated shifts in the metabolome, meaning that at least 77 metabolites including amino acids, lipids, polyamines and sugars, as well as their derivatives, were altered in critical COVID-19 patient’s plasma as compared to mild COVID-19 patients. Among a uniformly moderate cohort of patients who received tocilizumab, only 10 metabolites were different among individuals with a favorable evolution as compared to those who required transfer into the intensive care unit. The elevation of one single metabolite, anthranilic acid, had a poor prognostic value, correlating with the maintenance of high interleukin-10 and -18 levels. Given that products of the kynurenine pathway including anthranilic acid have immunosuppressive properties, we speculate on the therapeutic utility to inhibit the rate-limiting enzymes of this pathway including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase.","Danlos, François-Xavier; Grajeda-Iglesias, Claudia; Durand, Sylvère; Sauvat, Allan; Roumier, Mathilde; Cantin, Delphine; Colomba, Emeline; Rohmer, Julien; Pommeret, Fanny; Baciarello, Giulia; Willekens, Christophe; Vasse, Marc; Griscelli, Frank; Fahrner, Jean-Eudes; Goubet, Anne-Gaëlle; Dubuisson, Agathe; Derosa, Lisa; Nirmalathasan, Nitharsshini; Bredel, Delphine; Mouraud, Séverine; Pradon, Caroline; Stoclin, Annabelle; Rozenberg, Flore; Duchemin, Jérôme; Jourdi, Georges; Ellouze, Syrine; Levavasseur, Françoise; Albigès, Laurence; Soria, Jean-Charles; Barlesi, Fabrice; Solary, Eric; André, Fabrice; Pène, Frédéric; Ackerman, Félix; Mouthon, Luc; Zitvogel, Laurence; Marabelle, Aurélien; Michot, Jean-Marie; Fontenay, Michaela; Kroemer, Guido",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707411/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03540-y,88

It was widely reported that the GI for COVID-19 is as short as 5 days. However, many works in top journals used longer LP or IP with the sum (i.e., GI), e.g., >7 days. This discrepancy will lead to overestimated basic reproductive number and exaggerated expectation of infection attack rate (AR) and control efficacy. We argue that it is important to use suitable epidemiological parameter values for proper estimation/prediction. Furthermore, we propose an epidemic model to assess the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 for Belgium, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We estimated a time-varying reproductive number [R(0)(t)] based on the COVID-19 deaths data and we found that Belgium has the highest AR followed by Israel and the UAE.","Tang, Xiujuan; Musa, Salihu S.; Zhao, Shi; Mei, Shujiang; He, Daihai",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.691262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34291032/,88

Data on all infections, including asymptomatic infection, are needed to guide state testing and prevention programs. To minimize biases in estimates from seroprevalence surveys and reported cases, we conducted a state-wide probability survey of Georgia households and estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections adjusted for antibody waning. Methods: From August to December 2020, we mailed kits to self-collect specimens (nasal swabs and blood spots) to a random sample of Georgia addresses. One randomly-selected adult household member completed a survey and returned specimens for virus and antibody testing. We estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections adjusted for waning antibodies, reported fraction, and infection fatality ratio (IFR). Differences in seropositivity among demographic, geographic and clinical subgroups were explored with weighted prevalence ratios (PR). Results: Among 1,370 Georgia adult participants, adjusted cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was 16.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 13.5-19.2%) as of November 16, 2020. The reported fraction was 26.6% and IFR was 0.78%. Non-Hispanic Black (PR: 2.03, CI 1.0, 4.1) and Hispanic adults (PR: 1.98, CI 0.74, 5.31) were more likely than non-Hispanic White adults to be seropositive. Seropositivity in metropolitan Atlanta's Fulton and DeKalb counties was similar to seropositivity elsewhere in Georgia (7.8% vs. 8.8%). Conclusions: As of mid-November 2020, one in 6 adults in Georgia had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The scope of the COVID-19 epidemic in Georgia is likely substantially underestimated by reported cases.","Chamberlain, A. T.; Toomey, K. E.; Bradley, H.; Hall, E. W.; Fahimi, M.; Lopman, B.

Interestingly, not all interactions between these receptors and pathogenic ligands have beneficial outcomes, and it appears that some pathogens have evolved immunoevasive or immunosuppressive activities through receptors such as DC-SIGN. In addition to this, recent data indicate that the well-characterised macrophage mannose receptor is not essential to host defence against fungal pathogens, as previously thought, but has an important role in regulating endogenous glycoprotein clearance. New studies have also demonstrated that different ligand binding and/or sensing receptors collaborate for full and effective immune responses.","McGreal, Eamon P; Miller, Joanna L; Gordon, Siamon",Curr Opin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15653305/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791504001931; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952791504001931,88

The purpose of the study was to investigate thiol status in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 587 subjects (517 patients/70 healthy controls) were enrolled in the study.The patients were categorized into the groups regarding to the severity of disease (mild, moderate, severe, and critical).Thiol status of all groups were compared. RESULTS: The patients had significantly diminished thiol levels compared to controls. Thiol levels were gradually decreased as the severity of the disease increased. Logistic regression analyses identified that thiol concentrations were an independent risk factor for the disease severity in each phase (mild group OR 0.975, 95%CI 0.965-0.986; moderate group, OR 0.964, 95%CI 0.953-0.976; severe group OR 0.953, 95%CI 0.941-0.965; critical group OR 0.947, 95%CI 0.935-0.960).Thiol test exhibited the largest area under the curve at 0.949, with the highest sensitivity (98.6%) and specificity (80.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Depleted thiol status was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Decline of the thiol levels by degrees while the severity of infection increased was closely related to the progression of the disease. This outcome highlights that thiols could be an impressible biomarker for predicting of the severity of COVID-19.","EREL, Özcan; NEŞELİOĞLU, Salim; ERGİN TUNÇAY, Merve; FIRAT OĞUZ, Esra; EREN, Funda; AKKUŞ, Meryem Sena; GÜNER, Rahmet; ATEŞ, İhsan",Turk J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306332/; https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2011-139,88

This study was aimed to assess orthodontic emergency occurrence and psychological states of Chinese orthodontic patients during this pandemic. METHODS: Orthodontic patients in China were invited to answer an anonymous online questionnaire from February 20, 2020 to March 5, 2020, when routine dental care was suspended in China. The questionnaire included self-assessment of oral hygiene and compliance, orthodontic emergencies, perceptions and feelings about COVID-19 and anxiety self-rating scale, etc. Collected data was statistically analyzed with Chi-square, independent t test and univariable generalized estimating equations regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1078 respondents (292 male; 786 female) from 30 provinces of China were included in this study. About one-third (33.67%) of patients reported that they encountered orthodontic problems during the pandemic. Patients with clear aligners reported fewer orthodontic problems than those with fixed appliances or removable appliances. Female patients, elder patients and patients who encountered orthodontic emergencies were more anxious than other patients. CONCLUSIONS: The compliance and occurrence of orthodontic emergencies differed in patients with different orthodontic appliances. Patients with orthodontic emergencies exhibited higher anxiety states.","Quan, Shuqi; Guo, Yutong; Zhou, Jiawei; Zhang, Guanning; Xing, Ke; Mei, Hongxiang; Li, Juan",BMC Oral Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579698/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-021-01834-3,88

As a key variable contributing to positive family functioning, family hardiness can protect against HF-related harm. Thus, recognizing factors associated with family hardiness could promote strategies that enable successful adaptation to HF. This study aimed to explore protective factors linked to family hardiness among HF patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in 2020 among 167 HF patients in Nanjing, China. The study measures comprised a self-designed general information questionnaire, the Family Hardiness Index, the Mutuality Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. The data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS, version 25 and comprised Pearson’s correlation analysis, a multiple linear regression model, and an analysis of mediating effects. RESULTS: The average Family Hardiness Index score for the 167 HF patients was 57.95 ± 11.41. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that mutuality, active coping style, and positive emotions of HF patients positively predicted family hardiness (β = 0.359, 0.308, and 0.215, respectively; all P ˂ 0.05). Mutuality between patients and family members had partial mediating effects between active coping style, positive emotions, and family hardiness. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that patients’ active coping styles, positive emotions, and mutuality were protective factors associated with family hardiness. In light of our findings, we suggest that active coping strategies, positive emotions, and, especially, closer relationships within families should be encouraged during the rehabilitation and follow-up care of HF patients.","Peng, Yuanyuan; Wang, Jie; Sun, Guozhen; Liu, Shenxinyu",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s301765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33790667/,88

Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed decontamination strategies to prolong the lifespan of single use respirators. Battelle and Duke University have validated hospital protocols to decontaminate respirators using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) at 30%-35% concentrations. To prolong our supply of respirators, we evaluated and implemented VHP decontamination at 59% hydrogen peroxide concentration while detailing the effects of this process on the filtration efficiency and quantitative fit of single-use respirators. This study may help other health systems develop local solutions to their N95 mask shortage during this COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: N95 respirators (3M 8211 FF and 9210 FF) that were treated with 5 and 10 cycles of VHP by the V-PRO® maX Low Temperature Sterilization System were evaluated quantitatively for filtration efficiency as well as with quantitative fit testing per Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. A decontamination protocol was concurrently implemented at our institution. This process involved depositing used masks, reprocessing, and re-distributing treated masks efficiently back to frontline providers. Furthermore, we implemented patient safety officers (PSO) on COVID-19/person under investigation (PUI) units to ensure optimized donning/doffing of respirators through frontline provider education. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes in mean filtration efficiency between the control and VHP-treated respirators. Furthermore, both treated and untreated respirators demonstrated fit factors above the minimum pass requirement. CONCLUSION: We have successfully demonstrated that N95 respirator decontamination with VHP at 59% hydrogen peroxide can be safely utilized to decontaminate single-use N95 respirators without significant effects on filtration efficiency or quantitative fit testing. With the COVID-19 pandemic and N95 respirator shortage, health systems without access to commercial decontamination processes should investigate the viability of such a process in their facilities.","Jatta, Maimuna; Kiefer, Carolyn; Patolia, Harsh; Pan, Jin; Harb, Charbel; Marr, Linsey C.; Baffoe-Bonnie, Anthony",Am J Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599102/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320305769; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320305769?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.06.194,88
614285,The virus doesn’t go on vacation,2021-08-05,"As the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) progresses, many physicians in a wide variety of specialties continue to play pivotal roles in diagnosis and management. In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. [1]; Chung et al. [2]). However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities. In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]). Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing.

This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. This result has important implications for the efficacy of Spike-based vaccines currently under development in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.","Daniloski, Zharko; Jordan, Tristan X.; Ilmain, Juliana K.; Guo, Xinyi; Bhabha, Gira; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Sanjana, Neville E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.151357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32587969/,88

Case-based teaching formats under expert supervision can be used as a substitute for practical bedside teaching, where the focus is on teaching clinical reasoning skills. Methods: For medical students of LMU and TU Munich, the interactive, case-based, and supervised teaching format of Clinical Case Discussion (CCD) was digitised and implemented as dCCD in their respective curricula. Case discussions were realised as videoconferences, led by a student moderator, and took place under the supervision of a board-certified clinician. To prevent passive participation, additional cognitive activations were implemented. Acceptance, usability, and subjective learning outcomes were assessed in dCCDs by means of a special evaluation concept. Results: With regard to acceptance, students were of the opinion that they had learned effectively by participating in dCCDs (M=4.31; SD=1.37). The majority of students also stated that they would recommend the course to others (M=4.23; SD=1.62). The technical implementation of the teaching format was judged positively overall, but findings for usability were heterogeneous. Students rated their clinical reasoning skills at the end of the dCCDs (M=4.43; SD=0.66) as being significantly higher than at the beginning (M=4.33; SD=0.69), with low effect size, t(181)=-2.352, p=.020, d=0.15. Conclusion: Our evaluation data shows that the dCCD format is well-accepted by students as a substitute for face-to-face teaching. In the next step, we plan to examine the extent to which participation in dCCDs leads to an increase in objectively measured clinical reasoning skills, analogous to a face-to-face CCD with on-site attendance.","Zottmann, Jan M.; Horrer, Anna; Chouchane, Amir; Huber, Johanna; Heuser, Sonja; Iwaki, Lica; Kowalski, Christian; Gartmeier, Martin; Berberat, Pascal O.; Fischer, Martin R.; Weidenbusch, Marc",GMS J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364378/; https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001392,88

It is critical to understand whether nursing home quality is related to COVID-19 cases and deaths. Using publicly available data obtained from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset, Nursing Home Compare and Long-Term Care Focus, this study compares key nursing home characteristics, infection prevention and control deficiencies, and five-star ratings among Florida nursing homes with and without resident COVID-19 cases and deaths. The study further examines the association between facility and resident characteristics, quality indicators, and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Findings from our study indicate that through late October 2020, over 90% of Florida nursing homes have at least one resident case and 65% have at least one resident death. The likelihood of having COVID-19 cases is more related to ownership status, facility size and average occupancy rate, rather than quality indicators. Associations between infection prevention and control deficiencies, overall quality ratings, and presence of COVID-19 resident deaths varied across different phases of the pandemic (e.g., overall five-star rating was found related to the odds of having resident deaths after, but not during, the surging stage).

We sought to determine the pandemic's impact on CTS trainees' educational experiences. METHODS: A survey was developed and distributed to members of the Thoracic Surgery Residents Association and other international CTS trainees. Trainees were asked to evaluate their cumulative experiences and share their overall perceptions of how CTS training had been impacted during the earliest months of the COVID‐19 pandemic (i.e., since March 01, 2020). Surveys were distributed and responses were recorded June 25–August 05, 2020. In total, 748 surveys were distributed and 166 responses were received (overall response rate 22.2%). Of these, 126 of 166 responses (75.9%) met inclusion criteria for final analysis. RESULTS: Final responses analyzed included 45 of 126 (35.7%) United States (US) and 81 of 126 (64.3%) international trainees, including 101 of 126 (80.2%) senior and 25 of 126 (19.8%) junior trainees. Most respondents (76/126, 43.2%) lost over 1 week in the hospital due to the pandemic. Juniors (12/25, 48.0%) were more likely than seniors (20/101, 19.8%) to be reassigned to COVID‐19‐specific units (p < .01). Half of trainees (63/126) reported their case volumes were reduced by over 50%.

Patients from India and China (n = 15 000) are also randomized using a factorial design to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (Reviparin) or placebo injection twice daily for 7 days to assess the impact on the composite outcomes of death, reinfarction or stroke (first co-primary outcome) or the composite + refractory ischemia (second co-primary outcome). RESULTS: Twenty thousand two hundred and one (20,201) GIK/control patients and 15,570 Reviparin/placebo patients have been included, with results expected in November 2004. CONCLUSIONS: The CREATE-ECLA trial will provide definitive answers to the role of 2 practical, promising and low-cost therapies, LMWH and GIK, in AMI patients. If effective, these therapies could be used in small medical centers in low- and middle- income countries. The experiences in this trial indicate that large trials of important questions can be successfully conducted in resource-poor settings, by academic groups without industry involvement.","Yusuf, Salim; Mehta, Shamir R.; Díaz, Rafael; Paolasso, Ernesto; Pais, Prem; Xavier, Denis; Xie, Changchun; Ahmed, Rashid J.; Khazmi, Khawar; Zhu, Jun; Liu, Lisheng",Am Heart J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002870304005939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15632895/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870304005939,88
617371,Advances and Perspectives in Dental Pulp Stem Cell Based Neuroregeneration Therapies,2021-03-29,"OBJECTIVES: During SARS-CoV-2 infection, dramatic endothelial cell damage with pulmonary microvascular thrombosis has been hypothesized to occur. Our aim was to assess whether pulmonary vascular thrombosis is due to recurrent thromboembolism from peripheral deep vein thrombosis or rather to local inflammatory endothelial damage with a superimposed thrombotic late complication. DESIGN: Observational study SETTING: Medical and intensive care unit wards of a teaching hospital PARTICIPANTS: We report a subset of patients included in a prospective institutional study (CovidBiob study) with clinical suspicion of pulmonary vascular thromboembolism. INTERVENTIONS: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography and evaluation of laboratory markers and coagulation profile. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-eight out of 55 (50.9%) patients enrolled showed pulmonary vascular thrombosis, with a median time interval from symptoms onset of 17.5 days. Simultaneous multiple pulmonary vascular thromboses were identified in 22 cases, with bilateral involvement in 16, mostly affecting segmental/subsegmental pulmonary arteries branches (67.8% and 96.4%). Patients with pulmonary vascular thrombosis had significantly higher ground glass opacities areas (31.7% [22.9-41] vs. 17.8% [10.8-22.1] p<0.001) compared to those without pulmonary vascular thrombosis. D-Dimer level at hospital admission was predictive of pulmonary vascular thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify a specific radiological pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia with a unique spatial distribution of pulmonary vascular thrombosis overlapping areas of ground glass opacities. These findings support the hypothesis of a pathogenetic relationship between COVID-19 lung inflammation and pulmonary vascular thrombosis and challenge the previous definition of pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19 pneumonia.","De Cobelli, Francesco; Palumbo, Diego; Ciceri, Fabio; Landoni, Giovanni; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; D'Angelo, Armando; Steidler, Stephanie; Galli, Laura; Poli, Andrea; Fominskiy, Evgeny; Calabrò, Maria Grazia; Colombo, Sergio; Monti, Giacomo; Nicoletti, Roberto; Esposito, Antonio; Conte, Caterina; Dagna, Lorenzo; Ambrosio, Alberto; Scarpellini, Paolo; Ripa, Marco; Spessot, Marzia; Carlucci, Michele; Montorfano, Matteo; Agricola, Eustachio; Baccellieri, Domenico; Bosi, Emanuele; Tresoldi, Moreno; Castagna, Antonella; Martino, Gianvito; Zangrillo, Alberto",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2021.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33518461/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053077021000136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053077021000136?v=s5,88

618142,Novel NGS pipeline for virus discovery from a wide spectrum of hosts and sample types,2020-12-02,"Environmental factors contribute to the risk for adverse health outcomes against a background of genetic predisposition. Among these factors, chemical exposures may substantially contribute to disease risk and adverse outcomes. In fact, epidemiological cohort studies have established associations between exposure against individual chemicals and adverse health effects. Yet, in daily life individuals are exposed to complex mixtures in varying compositions. To capture the totality of environmental exposures the concept of the exposome has been developed. Here, we undertake an overview of major exposome projects, which pioneered the field of exposomics and explored the links between chemical exposure and health outcomes using cohort studies. We seek to reflect their achievements with regard to (i) capturing a comprehensive picture of the environmental chemical exposome, (ii) aggregating internal exposures using chemical and bioanalytical means of detection, and (iii) identifying associations that provide novel options for risk assessment and intervention. Various complementary approaches can be distinguished in addressing relevant exposure routes and it emerges that individual exposure histories may not easily be grouped. The number of chemicals for which human exposure can be detected is substantial and highlights the reality of mixture exposures. Yet, to a large extent it depends on targeted chemical analysis with the specific challenges to capture all relevant exposure routes and assess the chemical concentrations occurring in humans. The currently used approaches imply prior knowledge or hypotheses about relevant exposures. Typically, the number of chemicals considered in exposome projects is counted in dozens—in contrast to the several thousands of chemicals for which occurrence have been reported in human serum and urine. Furthermore, health outcomes are often still compared to single chemicals only. Moreover, explicit consideration of mixture effects and the interrelations between different outcomes to support causal relationships and identify risk drivers in complex mixtures remain underdeveloped and call for specifically designed exposome-cohort studies.","Huhn, Sebastian; Escher, Beate I.; Krauss, Martin; Scholz, Stefan; Hackermüller, Jörg; Altenburger, Rolf",Environ Sci Eur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614387/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00444-0,88

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the impact of home working on perceived job productivity and satisfaction, work-related stress, and musculoskeletal (MSK) issues. We included 51 mobile workers, collecting data about demographic characteristics, working experience, job productivity, and stress. Job satisfaction was assessed through the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), while MSK pain was investigated by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). Moreover, a home workplace analysis had to be carried out according to current Italian regulations. Participants declared that they were less productive (39.2%) but less stressed (39.2%) and equally satisfied (51%) compared to the time of office working. Regarding MSK disorders, low back pain (LBP) was referred by 41.2% of home workers and neck pain by 23.5% of them. Neck pain worsened in 50% of home workers, while LBP did not exacerbate in 47.6% of cases. Home workers with MSK pain reported a lower job satisfaction. Depending on our data, the home environment seems to be not adequate in the mobile worker population, with an increased risk for mental health and MSK problems, particularly affecting the spine. Addressing these issues can significantly reduce risks for health, thus, improving job productivity and satisfaction and reducing cost.","Moretti, Antimo; Menna, Fabrizio; Aulicino, Milena; Paoletta, Marco; Liguori, Sara; Iolascon, Giovanni",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32872321/,88

METHODS: Countries reported weekly or monthly all-cause mortality from January 2015 until the end of June or August 2020. Weekly or monthly COVID-19 deaths were reported for 2020. Excess mortality for 2020 was calculated by comparing weekly or monthly 2020 mortality (observed deaths) against a baseline mortality obtained from 2015–2019 data for the same week or month using two methods: (i) difference in observed mortality rates between 2020 and the 2015–2019 average and (ii) difference between observed and expected 2020 deaths. RESULTS: Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK (England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland) and the USA demonstrated excess all-cause mortality, whereas Australia, Denmark and Georgia experienced a decrease in all-cause mortality. Israel, Ukraine and Ireland demonstrated sex-specific changes in all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: All-cause mortality up to August 2020 was higher than in previous years in some, but not all, participating countries. Geographical location and seasonality of each country, as well as the prompt application of high-stringency control measures, may explain the observed variability in mortality changes.","Achilleos, Souzana; Quattrocchi, Annalisa; Gabel, John; Heraclides, Alexandros; Kolokotroni, Ourania; Constantinou, Constantina; Pagola Ugarte, Maider; Nicolaou, Nicoletta; Rodriguez-Llanes, Jose Manuel; Bennett, Catherine Marie; Bogatyreva, Ekaterina; Schernhammer, Eva; Zimmermann, Claudia; Costa, Antonio Jose Leal; Lobato, Jackeline Christiane Pinto; Fernandes, Ngibo Mubeta; Semedo-Aguiar, Ana Paula; Jaramillo Ramirez, Gloria Isabel; Martin Garzon, Oscar Dario; Mortensen, Laust Hvas; Critchley, Julia A; Goldsmith, Lucy P; Denissov, Gleb; Rüütel, Kristi; Le Meur, Nolwenn; Kandelaki, Levan; Tsiklauri, Shorena; O’Donnell, Joan; Oza, Ajay; Kaufman, Zalman; Zucker, Inbar; Ambrosio, Giuseppe; Stracci, Fabrizio; Hagen, Terje P; Erzen, Ivan; Klepac, Petra; Arcos González, Pedro; Fernández Camporro, Ángel; Burström, Bo; Pidmurniak, Nataliia; Verstiuk, Olesia; Huang, Qian; Mehta, Neil Kishor; Polemitis, Antonis; Charalambous, Andreas; Demetriou, Christiana A",Int J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282450/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab123,88

Several countries have declared a stringent lockdown in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lockdown on infection and death rates over a period of time in countries with declared lock-down. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lockdown. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lockdown in a second-phase cluster analysis. RESULTS: There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lockdown in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths (Spain, Germany, Italy, UK, and France-cluster 1) fared poorly compared to those who declared lockdown early on (Belgium, Austria, New Zealand, India, Hungary, Poland and Malaysia-cluster 2). Sweden and South Korea, countries without lock-down, fared as good as the countries in cluster 2. CONCLUSION: Lockdown has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression (infection rate and death) exponentially. The success story of non-lock-down countries (Sweden and South Korea) need to be explored in detail, to identify the variables responsible for the positive results.","Ghosal, Samit; Bhattacharyya, Rahul; Majumder, Milan",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426062/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301454; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301454?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.026,88

619625,"Inhibition of RNA Helicases of ssRNA(+) Virus Belonging to Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae and Picornaviridae Families",2010-11-14,"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as sanitary measures and travel restrictions, aimed at controlling the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may affect the transmission dynamics of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). We aimed to quantify the contribution of the sales of hand hygiene products and the number of international and domestic airline passenger arrivals on HRSV epidemic in Japan. METHODS: The monthly number of HRSV cases per sentinel site (HRSV activity) in 2020 was compared with the average of the corresponding period in the previous 6 years (from January 2014 to December 2020) using a monthly paired t-test. A generalized linear gamma regression model was used to regress the time-series of the monthly HRSV activity against NPI indicators, including sale of hand hygiene products and the number of domestic and international airline passengers, while controlling for meteorological conditions (monthly average temperature and relative humidity) and seasonal variations between years (2014–2020). RESULTS: The average number of monthly HRSV case notifications in 2020 decreased by approximately 85% (p < 0.001) compared to those in the preceding 6 years (2014–2019). For every average ¥1 billion (approximately £680,000/$9,000,000) spent on hand hygiene products during the current month and 1 month before there was a 0.29% (p = 0.003) decrease in HRSV infections. An increase of average 1000 domestic and international airline passenger arrivals during the previous 1–2 months was associated with a 3.8 × 10(− 4)% (p < 0.001) and 1.2 × 10(− 3)% (p < 0.001) increase in the monthly number of HRSV infections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is an association between the decrease in the monthly number of HRSV cases and improved hygiene and sanitary measures and travel restrictions for COVID-19 in Japan, indicating that these public health interventions can contribute to the suppression of HRSV activity. These findings may help in public health policy and decision making.

However, no known study has examined the prevalence, determinants, or correlates of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in this population. METHODS Data were analyzed from a prospective cohort of FHCWs at an urban tertiary care hospital in New York City (NYC). Assessments were conducted during the spring 2020 pandemic peak (Wave 1) and seven months later (Wave 2). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify Wave 1 sociodemographic, occupational, and psychosocial factors associated with PTG at Wave 2, and the association between aspects of PTG with burnout and pandemic-related PTSD symptoms at Wave 2. RESULTS A total 76.8% of FHCWs endorsed moderate or greater PTG; the most prevalent domains were increased appreciation of life (67.0%), improved relationships (48.7%), and greater personal strength (44.1%). Non-White race/ethnicity, greater levels of positive emotions, pandemic-related PTSD symptoms, dispositional gratitude, and feelings of inspiration were independently associated with PTG. At Wave 2, endorsement of spiritual growth during the pandemic was associated with 52% and 44% lower odds of screening positive for pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and burnout, respectively; greater improvement in relationships was associated with 36% lower odds of screening positive for burnout. LIMITATIONS Single institution study and use of self-report instruments. CONCLUSIONS Nearly 4-of-5 FHCWs report pandemic-related PTG, driven largely by salutogenic factors assessed during the pandemic surge. Interventions to bolster these factors may help promote PTG and mitigate risk for burnout and pandemic-related PTSD symptoms in this population.","Feingold, Jordyn H; Hurtado, Alicia; Feder, Adriana; Peccoralo, Lauren; Southwick, Steven M; Ripp, Jonathan; Pietrzak, Robert H",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34587547/,88

Although the predominant intervention has been violence prevention (VP) education for healthcare workers, evaluating its effectiveness is challenging due to underreporting of violence and the inherent complexity of both violence and the health care environment. This review utilized a theory-driven, realist approach to synthesize and analyze a wide range of academic and grey literature to identify explanations of how and why VP education makes a difference in preventing violence and associated physical and psychological injury to workers. The review confirmed the importance of positioning VP education as part of a VP strategy, and consideration of the contexts that influence successful application of VP knowledge and skills. Synthesis and analysis of patterns of evidence across 64 documents resulted in 11 realist explanations of VP education effectiveness. Examples include education specific to clinical settings, unit-level modeling and mentoring support, and support of peers and supervisors during violent incidents. This review informs practical program and policy decisions to enhance VP education effectiveness in healthcare settings.","Provost, Sharon; MacPhee, Maura; Daniels, Michael A.; Naimi, Michelle; McLeod, Chris",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802868/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9030339,88

METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 671 eligible hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 from 1 January to 23 February 2020, with a median age of 63 years. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and compared between patients who died and survivors. Risk factors of death and myocardial injury were analysed using multivariable regression models. A total of 62 patients (9.2%) died, who more often had myocardial injury (75.8% vs. 9.7%; P < 0.001) than survivors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of initial cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87–0.96; sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 0.86; P < 0.001]. The single cut-off point and high level of cTnI predicted risk of in-hospital death, hazard ratio (HR) was 4.56 (95% CI, 1.28–16.28; P = 0.019) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07–1.46; P = 0.004), respectively. In multivariable logistic regression, senior age, comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and high level of C-reactive protein were predictors of myocardial injury. CONCLUSION: The risk of in-hospital death among patients with severe COVID-19 can be predicted by markers of myocardial injury, and was significantly associated with senior age, inflammatory response, and cardiovascular comorbidities.","Shi, Shaobo; Qin, Mu; Cai, Yuli; Liu, Tao; Shen, Bo; Yang, Fan; Cao, Sheng; Liu, Xu; Xiang, Yaozu; Zhao, Qinyan; Huang, He; Yang, Bo; Huang, Congxin",Eur Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391877/; https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa408,88

The use of face masks is proven to be effective in protecting health-care workers as they perform their duties. Still, there is limited evidence about whether the widespread use of face mask would be very useful in protecting the general population. This study aimed to conduct a review to determine if face masks would be beneficial in the general population as a means of reducing the spread of COVID-19. The widespread implementation of wearing face masks by the general population is challenging due to a variety of factors.

Previous studies have dated the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) between SARS-CoV-2 and its close relatives from bats and pangolins. However, the evolutionary rate thus derived is expected to differ from the rate estimated from sequence divergence of SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Here, I present dating results for the first time from a large phylogenetic tree with 86,582 high-quality full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The tree contains 83,688 genomes with full specification of collection time. Such a large tree spanning a period of about 1.5 years offers an excellent opportunity for dating the MRCA of the sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The MRCA is dated 16 August 2019, with the evolutionary rate estimated to be 0.05526 mutations/genome/day. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the root-to-tip distance (D) and the collection time (T) is 0.86295. The NCBI tree also includes 10 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from cats, collected over roughly the same time span as human COVID-19 infection. The MRCA from these cat-derived SARS-CoV-2 is dated 30 July 2019, with r = 0.98464. While the dating method is well known, I have included detailed illustrations so that anyone can repeat the analysis and obtain the same dating results. With 16 August 2019 as the date of the MRCA of sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes, archived samples from respiratory or digestive tracts collected around or before 16 August 2019, or those that are not descendants of the existing SARS-CoV-2 lineages, should be particularly valuable for tracing the origin of SARS-CoV-2.","Xia, Xuhua",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578371/,88

RNAi-based antiviral therapies are being studied for the treatment of retroviruses such as HIV-1. These studies include the silencing of regulatory, infectivity and structural genes. The HTLV-1 structural genes are responsible for the synthesis of proteins involved in the entry, assembly and release of particles during viral infection. To examine the possibility of silencing HTLV-1 genes gag and env by RNA interference technology, these genes were cloned into reporter plasmids. These vectors expressed the target mRNAs fused to EGFP reporter genes. Three small interference RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to gag and three corresponding to env were designed to analyze the effect of silencing by RNAi technology. The plasmids and siRNAs were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells. The results demonstrated that the expression of the HTLV-1 gag and env genes decreased significantly in vitro. Thus, siRNAs can be used to inhibit HTLV-1 structural genes in transformed cells, which could provide a tool for clarifying the roles of HTLV-1 structural genes, as well as a therapy for this infection.","Haddad, Rodrigo; Kashima, Simone; Rodrigues, Evandra Strazza; Azevedo, Rochele; Palma, Patrícia Vianna Bonini; de Magalhães, Danielle Aparecida Rosa; Zago, Marco Antonio; Covas, Dimas Tadeu",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093411000413; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093411000413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21277903/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.01.012,88

The COVID Border Accountability Project (COBAP) provides a hand-coded dataset of >1000 policies systematized to reflect a complete timeline of country-level restrictions on movement across international borders during 2020. Trained research assistants used pre-set definitions to source, categorize and verify for each new border policy: start and end dates, whether the closure is “complete” or “partial”, which exceptions are made, which countries are banned, and which air/land/sea borders were closed. COBAP verified the database through internal and external audits from public health experts. For purposes of further verification and future data mining efforts of pandemic research, the full text of each policy was archived. The structure of the COBAP dataset is designed for use by social and biomedical scientists.

622372,Cellular peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1 facilitates replication of feline coronavirus,2015-12-07,"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia patients are a population at particular risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19 infection. They have multiple comorbidities that have been identified as risk factors for severe COVID-19: diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and end-stage renal disease. AIM: The aim of this research was to evaluate the inflammatory response and in-hospital mortality in schizophrenia patients compared to a control group without mental illness. METHODS: A total of 101 consecutive individuals with schizophrenia tested positive for COVID-19 was compared with 101 individuals without schizophrenia admitted in the same hospital. The number of severe cases and the number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated between April 2020 and April 2021. RESULTS: There were no deaths in the group of patients with schizophrenia. Although the group had a higher number of cases with pulmonary and metabolic comorbidities, in the group with SCZ there were fewer severe cases compared to the control group. The values of some markers of inflammation (CRP and fibrinogen) were significantly lower in SCZ patients. The duration from infection to diagnosis and the start of symptomatic treatment was shorter for the group with SCZ (4.2±3.2 vs 5.3±4.6, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The main findings of the study were that vulnerable schizophrenia individuals on antipsychotic treatment showed a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 severe infection and a likely better COVID-19 prognosis in a protective environment. Rapid access to specialists in case of need are factors that have determined the favorable evolution in a group considered high risk. It could be speculated that antipsychotics could play an important role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 severe manifestation and may exert protective effects against detrimental courses of COVID-19.","Moga, Silvia; Teodorescu, Andreea; Ifteni, Petru; Gavris, Claudia; Petric, Paula-Simina",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629871/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s325062,88

OBJECTIVE: To describe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a series of patients scheduled for digestive endoscopy at the Hospital Santa Caterina. Salt. (Girona). METHODS: Descriptive study of a series of cases of patients scheduled for endoscopy during the month of May 2020, when endoscopic activity was resumed after the peak of the pandemic, following SCD, SEED, AEG and ESGE recommendations. We examined nasopharyngeal samples 48-72 hours before the appointment, by RT-PCR, in all patients. RNA extraction was performed using the kits: Qiagen®-adapted, BiosSprint®96-DNA-Blood-Kit (384). For amplification-detection of SARS-CoV-2, methods recommended by the WHO and the CDC were followed. RESULTS: 110 asymptomatic patients without close contact with a positive case in the previous 14 days were scheduled; 105 (96.4%) were negative and five (4.5%) were positive. Two patients developed respiratory symptoms after diagnosis (presymptomatic) and three remained asymptomatic. Allfive5 patients were autochthonous cases with no history of travel or residence in another city or country associated with high prevalence of infection. Four cases were women aged 60-81 years. The N gene was detected in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in patients scheduled for digestive endoscopy. Given the risk of transmission to professionals, we consider it advisable to perform SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 48-72 hours before the examination in situations of high incidence in the population.","Pamplona, Javier; Solano, Rubén; Ramírez, Manel; Durandez, Rosa; Mohamed, Fatimetu; Pardo, Laura; Sàbat, Miriam",Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2021.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33862154/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210570521001151?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210570521001151,88

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of PubMed/MEDLINE to identify cases of COVID-19 in pregnancy or the postpartum period and associated outcomes. We then evaluated the proportion of COVID-19 clinical trials (from Clinicaltrials.gov) excluding pregnant or breastfeeding persons (both through June 29(th), 2020). RESULTS: We identified 11,308 published cases of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Of those reporting disease severity, 21% (416/1999) were severe/critical. Maternal and neonatal survival were reassuring (98% [10437/10597] and 99% [1155/1163], respectively). Neonatal disease was rare with only 41 possible cases of infection reported in the literature. Of 2351 ongoing COVID-19 therapeutic clinical trials, 1282 were enrolling persons of reproductive age and 65% (829/1282) excluded pregnant persons. Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for 69% (75/109) of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, 80% (28/35) of lopinavir/ritonavir, and 48% (44/91) of convalescent plasma studies. We identified 48 actively recruiting or completed drug trials reporting inclusion of this population. CONCLUSIONS: There are limited published reports of COVID-19 in pregnancy despite more than 14 million cases worldwide. To date, clinical outcomes appear reassuring, but data related to important long-term outcomes are missing or not yet reported. The large number of clinical trials excluding pregnant persons, despite interventions with safety data in pregnancy, is concerning. In addition to observational cohort studies, pregnancy specific adaptive clinical trials could be designed to identify safe and effective treatments.","Pastick, Katelyn A; Nicol, Melanie R; Smyth, Elizabeth; Zash, Rebecca; Boulware, David R; Rajasingham, Radha; McDonald, Emily G",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929403/,88
623715,Inhibition of Hepatitis B virus gene expression by single and dual small interfering RNA treatment,2005-04-26,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety impact up to 1 in 5 pregnant and postpartum women worldwide. Yet, as few as 20% of these women are treated with frontline interventions such as evidence-based psychological treatments. Major barriers to uptake are the limited number of specialized mental health treatment providers in most settings, and problems with accessing in-person care, such as childcare or transportation. Task sharing of treatment to non-specialist providers with delivery on telemedicine platforms could address such barriers. However, the equivalence of these strategies to specialist and in-person models remains unproven. METHODS: This study protocol outlines the Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) randomized trial. SUMMIT is a pragmatic, non-inferiority test of the comparable effectiveness of two types of providers (specialist vs. non-specialist) and delivery modes (telemedicine vs. in-person) of a brief, behavioral activation (BA) treatment for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Specialists (psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers with ≥ 5 years of therapy experience) and non-specialists (nurses and midwives with no formal training in mental health care) were trained in the BA protocol, with the latter supervised by a BA expert during treatment delivery. Consenting pregnant and postpartum women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of ≥ 10 (N = 1368) will be randomized to one of four arms (telemedicine specialist, telemedicine non-specialist, in-person specialist, in-person non-specialist), stratified by pregnancy status (antenatal/postnatal) and study site. The primary outcome is participant-reported depressive symptoms (EPDS) at 3 months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes are maternal symptoms of anxiety and trauma symptoms, perceived social support, activation levels and quality of life at 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-randomization, and depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month post-randomization. Primary analyses are per-protocol and intent-to-treat. The study has successfully continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with needed adaptations, including temporary suspension of the in-person arms and ongoing randomization to telemedicine arms. DISCUSSION: The SUMMIT trial is expected to generate evidence on the non-inferiority of BA delivered by a non-specialist provider compared to specialist and telemedicine compared to in-person. If confirmed, results could pave the way to a dramatic increase in access to treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 04153864.

624265,Crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune responses to infectious bronchitis virus after vaccination and challenge of chickens varying in serum mannose-binding lectin concentrations,2011-11-28,"Recently, various countries from across the globe have been facing the second wave of COVID-19 infections. In order to understand the dynamics of the spread of the disease, much effort has been made in terms of mathematical modeling. In this scenario, compartmental models are widely used to simulate epidemics under various conditions. In general, there are uncertainties associated with the reported data, which must be considered when estimating the parameters of the model. In this work, we propose an effective methodology for estimating parameters of compartmental models in multiple wave scenarios by means of a dynamic data segmentation approach. This robust technique allows the description of the dynamics of the disease without arbitrary choices for the end of the first wave and the start of the second. Furthermore, we adopt a time-dependent function to describe the probability of transmission by contact for each wave. We also assess the uncertainties of the parameters and their influence on the simulations using a stochastic strategy. In order to obtain realistic results in terms of the basic reproduction number, a constraint is incorporated into the problem. We adopt data from Germany and Italy, two of the first countries to experience the second wave of infections. Using the proposed methodology, the end of the first wave (and also the start of the second wave) occurred on 166 and 187 days from the beginning of the epidemic, for Germany and Italy, respectively. The estimated effective reproduction number for the first wave is close to that obtained by other approaches, for both countries. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to find good estimates for all parameters. In relation to uncertainties, we show that slight variations in the design variables can give rise to significant changes in the value of the effective reproduction number. The results provide information on the characteristics of the epidemic for each country, as well as elements for decision-making in the economic and governmental spheres.","Lobato, Fran Sérgio; Libotte, Gustavo Barbosa; Platt, Gustavo Mendes",Nonlinear Dyn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248281/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06680-0,88

624575,Reverse genetics approaches: a novel strategy for African horse sickness virus vaccine design,2020-07-10,"The COVID-19 outbreak has seen people in many countries asked to radically modify their way of life in compliance with sweeping safety measures. During the current crisis, technology is turning out to be key, in that it allows practitioners to deliver psychological services to people who would otherwise be unreachable. However, professionals cannot solely rely on their traditional modes of practice, in that different methods are required to bring to light the needs of those affected by the emergency. People are being overwhelmed by a cascade of unusual and unexpected events that are putting a strain on their everyday routines and usual meaning-making systems; ongoing challenges to their employment and financial status will likely divert personal resources away from psychological well-being. We therefore argue that psychologists should also consider the needs of the general population. Among those who may require help–aside from the main targets of psychological intervention, such as healthcare personnel and COVID-19 patients and their relatives–specific attention should be paid to those who are not at the center of the crisis. We suggest that this large segment of potential users may benefit from a non-medical approach focused on the promotion of meaning-making processes. Indeed, the disruptive nature of the current situation hinders sense-making and threatens to undermine psychological balance and well-being, at an individual as well as at a societal level. The present article proposes a methodological perspective based on the reconstruction of meaning-making processes (sense of coherence, predictability, metaphors, narratives). Specifically, psychological interventions should promote personal and collective resources with a view to: “normalizing” current distressful experiences (i.e., acknowledging that such reactions are normal in light of the present situation); widening the observational field, taking relational contexts into account, and promoting an understanding of distressful experiences as coping strategies; fostering meaning-making/reconstruction processes through the use of appropriate metaphors and narratives; promoting a sense of coherence. We present two clinical vignettes to illustrate how these principles might be applied in practice. In conclusion, the exceptional psychological challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic require practitioners to adopt a broad and flexible perspective on clinical intervention.","Castiglioni, Marco; Gaj, Nicolo’",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33192849/,88
624765,Electron microscopic observations of visna virus-infected cell cultures,1970-04-30,"Evidence has emerged that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can be transmitted airborne in aerosol particles as well as in larger droplets or by surface deposits. This minireview outlines the underlying aerosol science, making links to aerosol research in other disciplines. SARS-CoV-2 is emitted in aerosol form during normal breathing by both asymptomatic and symptomatic people, remaining viable with a half-life of up to about an hour during which air movement can carry it considerable distances, although it simultaneously disperses. The proportion of the droplet size distribution within the aerosol range depends on the sites of origin within the respiratory tract and on whether the distribution is presented on a number or volume basis. Evaporation and fragmentation reduce the size of the droplets, whereas coalescence increases the mean droplet size. Aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2 can also coalesce with pollution particulates, and infection rates correlate with pollution. The operation of ventilation systems in public buildings and transportation can create infection hazards via aerosols, but provides opportunities for reducing the risk of transmission in ways as simple as switching from recirculated to outside air. There are also opportunities to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol form with sunlight or UV lamps. The efficiency of masks for blocking aerosol transmission depends strongly on how well they fit. Research areas that urgently need further experimentation include the basis for variation in droplet size distribution and viral load, including droplets emitted by “superspreader” individuals; the evolution of droplet sizes after emission, their interaction with pollutant aerosols and their dispersal by turbulence, which gives a different basis for social distancing.","Jarvis, Michael C.",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330334/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.590041,88

Here, we present our cohort of Turkish LRBA-deficient patients from a single center, demonstrating a diversity of clinical manifestations. METHOD: Seven affected individuals from five families were assessed retrospectively in this study. RESULTS: Of the seven patients with LRBA deficiency, four had homozygous, and two had compound heterozygous mutations. One patient remained disease free until the last follow-up (age 17 years). The most common clinical manifestations of the six symptomatic patients were organomegaly (6/6), autoimmunity (6/6), and chronic diarrhea (5/6). Recurrent infectious episodes were observed in three patients. None of the patients had hypogammaglobulinemia at presentation. B cell subpopulation analysis revealed low numbers of switched-memory B cell numbers in two of the four tested patients. During the disease course, three of the patients died, two of them underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched sibling donors, and one is under abatacept therapy. CONCLUSION: LRBA defects should always be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis for patients with autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs, chronic diarrhea, and organomegalies.

626620,Ontogeny of interferon alpha secreting cells in the porcine fetal hematopoietic organs,1994-12-31,"Background: The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iran were reported on February 19, 2020. The coronavirus expanded rapidly in all Iranian provinces and three waves of COVID-19 cases have been observed since the pandemic took effect and the fourth wave of Covid-19 cases will likely be observed soon. This study aimed to model the spread of COVID-19 in Iran and to estimate the epidemic parameters and to predict the short-term future trend of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We proposed a modified SEIR epidemic spreading model and we used data from February 20, 2020, to April 9, 2021, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments to fit the proposed model on the reported data. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model and the numerical simulation results were obtained by Runge-Kutta method. The estimated parameters were employed to calculate the effective reproduction number and to predict the short-term future trends of COVID-19 cases. Results: The results indicated that the effective reproduction number has increased during Nowruz (Persian New Year) and it was estimated to be 1.28. Considering only two exposed cases as the initial cases in the model, the cumulative number of exposed cases was estimated to be 15,252,372 individuals since the beginning of the outbreak. The prediction of the short-term future trends of COVID-19 cases with different scenarios showed that another peak of the pandemic cases occurs in the next weeks. By immediate lockdown implementation the number of active infected cases was estimated to be 397,585. Conclusion: Different scenarios of short-term prediction of the future trends of COVID-19 cases indicated that immediate strict social distancing policies need to be implemented to prevent a tremendous burden of the fourth major wave of COVID-19 infections on the health care system of Iran.","Sahafizadeh, E.; Khajeian, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.10.21255244v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.10.21255244,88

DESIGN: Parallel-group randomised controlled trial with 1:1 block randomisation. SETTING: Three major hospitals from Jiangsu and Hubei provinces, China. PARTICIPANTS: 120 formerly hospitalised COVID-19 survivors with remaining dyspnoea complaints were randomised with 61 allocated to control and 59 to TERECO. INTERVENTION: Unsupervised home-based 6-week exercise programme comprising breathing control and thoracic expansion, aerobic exercise and LMS exercise, delivered via smartphone, and remotely monitored with heart rate telemetry. OUTCOMES: Primary outcome was 6 min walking distance (6MWD) in metres. Secondary outcomes were squat time in seconds; pulmonary function assessed by spirometry; HRQOL measured with Short Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12) and mMRC-dyspnoea. Outcomes were assessed at 6 weeks (post-treatment) and 28 weeks (follow-up). RESULTS: Adjusted between-group difference in change in 6MWD was 65.45 m (95% CI 43.8 to 87.1; p<0.001) at post-treatment and 68.62 m (95% CI 46.39 to 90.85; p<0.001) at follow-up. Treatment effects for LMS were 20.12 s (95% CI 12.34 to 27.9; p<0.001) post-treatment and 22.23 s (95% CI 14.24 to 30.21; p<0.001) at follow-up. No group differences were found for lung function except post-treatment maximum voluntary ventilation. Increase in SF-12 physical component was greater in the TERECO group with treatment effects estimated as 3.79 (95% CI 1.24 to 6.35; p=0.004) at post-treatment and 2.69 (95% CI 0.06 to 5.32; p=0.045) at follow-up.

The diagnostic protocol is based on quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chests CT scan, with uncertain accuracy. This meta-analysis study determines the diagnostic value of an initial chest CT scan in patients with COVID-19 infection in comparison with RT-PCR. Three main databases; PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and EMBASE were systematically searched for all published literature from January 1st, 2019, to the 21st May 2020 with the keywords ""COVID19 virus"", ""2019 novel coronavirus"", ""Wuhan coronavirus"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""X-Ray Computed Tomography"", ""Polymerase Chain Reaction"", ""Reverse Transcriptase PCR"", and ""PCR Reverse Transcriptase"". All relevant case-series, cross-sectional, and cohort studies were selected. Data extraction and analysis were performed using STATA v.14.0SE (College Station, TX, USA) and RevMan 5. Among 1022 articles, 60 studies were eligible for totalizing 5744 patients.

We focus on the human day-to-day activity introduced by commuting to a central place for the social activity. We assume that the community is classified into two subpopulations: commuter and non-commuter, of which the commuter has two phases of the day-to-day activity: private and social. Further we take account of the combination of contact patterns in two phases, making use of mass-action and ratio-dependent types for the infection force. We investigate the dependence of the basic reproduction number on the commuter ratio and the daily expected duration at the social phase as essential factors characterizing the community structure, and show that the dependence is significantly affected by the combination of contact patterns, and that the difference in the commuter ratio could make the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease significantly different.","Seno, Hiromi",J Math Biol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-020-01491-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32270285/,88

The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) was included to compare objective and subjective measures. METHODS: 114 female adult participants with a current (53.5%) or past (46.5%) full or partial AN syndrome diagnosis completed an online survey which included functional milestone questions, the EDFLIX, WSAS, EDE-Q, and DASS-21. RESULTS: Everyday flexibility scores were significantly associated with WSAS scores, but not functional milestones for the same domain. Lower flexibility was related to higher WSAS work impairment but was not associated with poor occupational outcomes. Lower flexibility was related to higher WSAS social impairment but was not associated with less frequent social contact with friends. Milestones across work, social and relationship areas were not significantly correlated, suggesting individuals have areas of strength and weakness across functional domains. In contrast, WSAS ratings indicated broad functional impairment. CONCLUSION: Results from the milestones suggest self-reported cognitive-behavioral flexibility is not a strong determinant of everyday function. Results from the subjective WSAS function measure and the more objective functional milestones were not consistent. To obtain a more balanced assessment of everyday functioning in AN, both subjective and objective measures should be considered. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III Case–control analytic study.

Many lead molecules are not developed further and their potential is not tapped to the fullest due to lack of resources or time constraints. In order for a drug to be approved by FDA for clinical use, it must have excellent therapeutic potential in the desired area of target with minimal toxicities as supported by both pre-clinical and clinical studies. The targeted clinical evaluations fail to explore other potential therapeutic applications of the candidate drug. Drug repurposing or repositioning is a fast and relatively cheap alternative to the lengthy and expensive de novo drug discovery and development.

628703,A role for the Clostridium perfringens β2 toxin in bovine enterotoxaemia?,2002-05-01,"Background: Compartmental models may help deciding on public health interventions. They were used during the first French COVID-19 lockdown to estimate the reproduction numbers and predict the number of hospital beds required. This study aimed to assess the ability of similar compartmental models to reflect equivalent epidemic dynamics. Methods: The study considered three compartmental models independently designed to describe the COVID-19 outbreak in France. These models were scrutinized and their compartments and parameters expressed in a common framework. The parameters were set alike in the three models according to values taken from the literature. The models were calibrated using a common maximum likelihood function and the same hospitalization data taken from two official public databases. The calibration procedure was repeated over three different periods to compare model abilities to (1) fit over the whole lockdown; (2) predict the course of the epidemic during the lockdown; and, (3) provide a set of profiles to forecast the hospitalization prevalence after the lockdown. The study considered national and regional coverages. Results: The three models were all flexible enough to match hospitalization data during the lockdown, but the numbers of cases in the other compartments differed. The three models failed to predict reliably the number of hospitalizations after the fitting periods at national and regional levels. At the national scale, a refined calibration led to epidemic course profiles that reflected hospitalizations dynamics and corresponded to reproduction numbers coherent with official and literature estimates. This result could not be consistently obtained at the regional scale. Conclusion: Not all predictions were consistent between models. Even over the period used for calibration by fitting to hospitalization cases, important differences remained regarding the prevalence in the other compartments. Prevalence data are needed to further constrain the calibration and perform selection between still divergent models. This underlines strongly the need for repeated prevalence studies on representative samples, stratified by age and regions, which would undergo virological or serological tests.","Gauchon, R.; Ponthus, N.; Pothier, C.; Rigotti, C.; Volpert, V.; Derrode, S.; Bertoglio, J.-P.; Bienvenue, A.; Goffard, P.-O.; Eyraud-Loisel, A.; Pageaud, S.; Iwaz, J.; Loisel, S.; Roy, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249565v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.11.21249565,88

Shedding of virus in nasal or fecal samples, and virus-infected nasal epithelial cells were detected using immunofluorescent staining (IF), ELISA or immune electron microscopy (IEM). Isotype-specific antibody titers in sera, nasal and fecal samples were determined by ELISA. Calves inoculated with coronavirus shed virus in feces and virus was detected in nasal epithelial cells. Nasal shedding persisted longer in IN-inoculated calves than in O-inoculated calves and longer than fecal shedding in both IN and O-inoculated calves. Diarrhea occurred in all calves, but there were no signs of respiratory disease. Calves inoculated with rotavirus had similar patterns of diarrhea and fecal shedding, but generally of shorter duration than in coronavirus-inoculated calves. No nasal shedding of rotavirus was detected. Peak IgM antibody responess, in most calves, were detected in fecal and nasal speciments at 7–10 days post-exposure (DPE), preceeding peak IgA responses which occurred at 10–14 DPE. The nasal antibody responses occurred in all virus-inoculated calves even in the absence of nasal shedding of virus in rotavirus-inoculated calves. Calves inoculated with coronavirus had higher titers of IgM and IgA antibodies in fecal and nasal samples than rotavirus-inoculated calves. In most inoculated calves, maximal titers of IgM or IgA antibodies correlated with the cessation of fecal or nasal virus shedding. A similar sequence of appearance of IgM and IgA antibodies occurred in serum, but IgA antibodies persisted for a shorter period than in fecal or nasal samples. Serum IgG1 antibody responses generally preceeded IgG2 responses and were predominant in most calves after 14–21 DPE.","Saif, L.

In the present study, we investigated the role of HCV core protein in viral RNA replication. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the core protein binds to the amino-terminal region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which encompasses the finger and palm domains. Direct interaction between HCV RdRp and core protein led to inhibition of RdRp RNA synthesis activity of in vitro. Furthermore, over-expression of core protein, but not its derivatives lacking the RdRp-interacting domain, suppressed HCV replication in a hepatoma cell line harboring an HCV subgenomic replicon RNA. Collectively, our results suggest that the core protein, through binding to RdRp and inhibiting its RNA synthesis activity, is a viral regulator of HCV RNA replication.","Kang, Su-Min; Choi, Jin-Kyu; Kim, Seong-Jun; Kim, Jung-Hee; Ahn, Dae-Gyun; Oh, Jong-Won",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X09011048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19501052/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X09011048; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.05.129,88

In an effort to extend platelet (PLT) shelf life and minimize waste, our institution transitioned room temperature to cold‐stored PLTs for administration to bleeding patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe the administrative and technical processes involved in transitioning room temperature PLTs to cold storage in April 2020. Additionally, we describe the clinical utilization of cold‐stored PLTs in the first month of this practice change, with a focus on changes in PLT counts after transfusion, hemostasis, and safety outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 61 cold‐stored PLT units were transfused to 40 bleeding patients, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 1 (1‐2) units per patient. The median age was 68 (59‐73) years; 58% male. Median pretransfusion and posttransfusion PLTs counts were 88 (67‐109) and 115 (93‐145). A total of 95% of transfusions were administered in the operating room: 57% cardiac surgery, 20% vascular surgery, 8% general surgery, and 5% solid organ transplantation. Hemostasis was deemed to be adequate in all cases after transfusion. There were no transfusion reactions. One patient (3%) experienced a fever and infection within 5 days of transfusion, which was unrelated to transfusion. Median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 8.5 (6‐17) days. Two patients (5%) died in the hospital of complications not related to transfusion. CONCLUSION: Cold‐stored PLT utilization was associated with adequate hemostasis and no overt signal for patient harm.

Surgical patients are vulnerable to the infection during their hospital admission. Some surgical procedures are classified as aerosol generating (AGP). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of four specialties associates with known AGP's during the 4 months of the first wave of UK COVID‐19 epidermic to identify post‐surgical cross‐infection with SARSCoV‐2 within 14 days of a procedure. METHODS: Retrospective observational study in a tertiary healthcare center of four specialties associates with known AGP's during the 4 months of the first wave of UK COVID‐19 epidermic to identify post‐surgical cross‐infection with SARSCoV‐2 within 14 days of a procedure. RESULTS: There were 3,410 procedures reported during this period. The overall cross‐infection rate from tested patients was 1.3% (4 patients), that is, 0.11% of all operations over 4 months. Ear, nose, and throat carried slightly higher rate of infection (0.4%) than gastroenterology (0.08%). The mortality rate was 0.3% (one gastroenterology patient from 304 positive cases) compared to 0% if surgery performed after recovery from SARSCoV‐2 and 37.5% when surgery was conducted during the incubation period of the disease. Routine preoperative rapid screening tests and self‐isolation are crucial to avoid the risk of cross‐infection. Patients with underlying malignancy or receiving chemotherapy were more prone to pulmonary complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of SARS‐COV‐2 cross‐infection after surgical procedure is very low. Preoperative screening and self‐isolation together with personal protective measures should be in place to minimize the cross‐infection.

Our study aimed to evaluate the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures in daily life, and to identify communication channels used to acquire relevant information on COVID-19 in European countries. DesignA cross-sectional online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated on social media starting March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we compiled and categorized community containment measures enacted in each country by stringency (stage I-IV). Response collection continued for one week to explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified. ParticipantsIn total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). An additional 1,365 respondents completed the survey in the following week. ResultsParticipants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands were less likely to consider a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents did not only apply enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%), but also self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents largely reported being sufficiently informed about the COVID-19 outbreak and about behaviors to avoid infection (range across countries: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television (range: 53.0%-82.0%), newspapers (range: 31.0%-63.0%), official health websites (range: 39.0%-54.1%), and social media (range: 40.0%-55.8%).

Recently, there are few reports about contact dermatitis caused by frequent, daily use of hand sanitizers during this COVID-19 pandemic. A 3-year-old toddler brought with the concern of waxing-waning bilateral palmar erythema for the past 2 weeks. The parents revealed that the child liked the bright color of a recently bought hand sanitizer bottle so much he used to wash his hands every 20–30 min throughout the day. The atypical presentation of contact dermatitis might be because the child was using the sanitizer more frequently during the daytime. The dermatitis resolved with stopping excessive use of the hand sanitizer by the toddler. Clinicians should be aware of contact dermatitis during these pandemic times. Instead of investigating them extensively, careful history taking and merely advising them to judicially utilize the sanitizer can lead to complete reversal of symptoms.","Panda, Prateek Kumar; Sharawat, Indar Kumar",J Trop Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1093/tropej/fmab011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33620073/,88

We aimed to investigate the possible correlation between polymorphisms in the IL‐6 gene at rs1800796/rs1800795, in IL‐6R at rs2228145, in IL‐10 at rs1800896 and rs1800871, in IL‐17 at rs2275913 and rs763780 loci, and COVID‐19 prevalence and mortality rates among populations of 23 countries. METHODS: We searched the literature for polymorphisms in China, Japan, India, Spain, Mexico, Sweden, Turkey, Brazil, Russia, Poland, Italy, South Africa, Netherlands, Greece, Germany, UK, Iran, Finland, Czechia, Tunisia, Norway, Egypt, Croatia. We recorded the prevalence and mortality rates (per million) caused by the Coronavirus infection recorded on 7th September 2020 and 6th December 2020. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between the frequency of AG genotype of rs1800896 and prevalence recorded on 6th December 2020 (r: 0.53, r (2): 0.28, p < .05). There was a significant negative correlation between the mortality rates recorded on 7th September, and the AG genotype of rs2275913 (r: −0.51, r (2): 0.26, p < .05). There was a significant positive correlation between the prevalence recorded on 6th December, and TT genotype at rs763780 (r: 0.65, r(2):0.42, p < .05) while a negative correlation between prevalence and TC genotype at rs763780 (r: −0.66, r (2): 0.43, p < .05). Also, a significant negative correlation was found between mortality rates recorded on 6th December 2020 and CC genotype at rs763780 (r: −0.56, r (2): 0.31, p < .05). CONCLUSION: The variations in prevalence of COVID‐19 and its mortality rates among countries may be explained by the polymorphisms at rs1800896 in IL‐10, rs2275913 in IL‐17A, and rs763780 loci in the IL‐17F gene.","Karcioglu Batur, Lutfiye; Hekim, Nezih",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081354/,88
630855,High level expression of surface glycoprotein of rabies virus in tobacco leaves and its immunoprotective activity in mice,2005-09-22,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the adoption of telerehabilitation in various healthcare settings. However, there was neither a pre-existing national guideline in the Philippines nor an internationally agreed standard on telerehabilitation. The literature lacks nationwide studies documenting how physiatrists perceived and experienced telerehabilitation during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To determine the perceptions and experiences of physiatrists in the Philippines regarding telerehabilitation. DESIGN: Online survey originally developed by the authors with inputs from local experts in telehealth or telerehabilitation. SETTING: Nationwide, involving board-certified physiatrists practicing in the Philippines. PARTICIPANTS: Fellows of the Philippine Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine (PARM) (N = 259) with Internet access. MAIN OUTCOMES: Self-reported telerehabilitation knowledge, skills, and experience; key concerns; preferred clients, service offerings, and methods (technology, duration, charging). RESULTS: The respondents (n = 161; 62.2% response-rate) had a mean age of 48.1±9.6 years, were mostly females (57.8%), and mostly practiced in private hospitals and urban settings. The majority reported inadequate telerehabilitation knowledge (61.5%), skills (58.4%), and experience (72.1%). The most common sources of telerehabilitation knowledge were colleagues (52.8%), PARM (51.6%), and telemedicine-related websites (41.6%). Most of the respondents preferred to conduct telerehabilitation with former patients over new ones, and prescribe telerehabilitation programs for physical, occupational, psychological, and speech-language therapy, but not for swallowing therapy. Videoconferencing was the most common telerehabilitation method. More than half of the respondents charged lesser fees for telerehabilitation compared to in-person consultations. While the majority recognized the need for telerehabilitation, their key concerns included the lack of thorough patient examination, and medicolegal liability issues. CONCLUSION: Despite their limited baseline knowledge, skills and experience regarding telerehabilitation, many physiatrists in the Philippines learned to adopt this service delivery method during the pandemic. Their perceptions and experiences could be used in formulating practice-based guidelines and strategies to improve the conduct of telerehabilitation in the country.

We devised a statistical model to compute the probability of the end of an Ebola virus disease epidemic, accounting for sexual transmission and under-ascertainment of cases. Analyzing the empirical data in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the performance of the proposed model was compared with the existing criteria comprising a fixed waiting time of 42 days since the last case testing negative or burial. We showed that the waiting time can vary depending on the sexual behaviors of survivors and their adherence to refraining from unprotected sex is likely one of the key factors in determining the absence of additional cases after declaration. If the proportional weight of sexual transmission among all secondary transmission events was substantial, ascertaining the end could even require waiting 1 year from the purported last case. While our proposed method offers an objectively interpretable probability of the end of an epidemic, it highlights that the computation requires a good knowledge of sexual contact.","Lee, Hyojung; Nishiura, Hiroshi",J Theor Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.03.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519319301298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30928349/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519319301298,88

There is only one approved antiviral agent but global stocks are deemed insufficient. Despite in vitro antiviral activity, clinical trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were disappointing, and they may even impair outcomes. Chloroquine causes zebroid deposits reminiscent of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) and endothelial cells are key targets of COVID-19. We have explored the effect of chloroquine on cultured endothelial cells and its modulation by recombinant α-galactosidase A (agalsidase). Following dose-response studies, 0.5 μg/mL chloroquine was added to cultured human endothelial cells. Neutral red and Lysotracker were used to assess lysosomes. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) - MTT assay and cell stress by assessing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). In endothelial cells, chloroquine induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity at in vitro test concentrations for COVID-19 therapy. At a sublethal concentration, chloroquine significantly induced the accumulation of acid organelles (P < 0.05), increased ROS levels, and decreased NO production (P < 0.05). These adverse effects of chloroquine on endothelial cell biology were decreased by agalsidase-β (P < 0.05). Chloroquine-induced endothelial cell cytotoxicity and stress is attenuated by agalsidase-β treatment. This suggests that endothelial cell injury may contribute to the failure of chloroquine as therapy for COVID-19 and may be at least in part related to causing dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A.","Gregório, Paulo C.; da Cunha, Regiane S.; Biagini, Gilson; Bosquetti, Bruna; Budag, Júlia; Ortiz, Alberto; Sánchez-Niño, Maria Dolores; Barreto, Fellype C.; Stinghen, Andréa E.",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X21000193?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484708/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041008X21000193; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2021.115412,88

However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW). Unlike predecessors, method optimization of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads. This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris,…). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering the molecular weight cut-off did not improve our limit of detection and quantification (approximately 10(0) copies/μL for all genes). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E -gene fragments. This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (10(0) copies/μL), indicating that variability in bioanalytical methods for wastewater-based epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 might be substantial. dPCR results in IWW were in line with the results found with qPCR. On average, the N2-gene fragment showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 °C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene fragment proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene fragment and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10-fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene fragment in IWW.","Tim, Boogaerts; Lotte, Jacobs; Naomi, De Roeck; den Bogaert Siel, Van; Bert, Aertgeerts; Lies, Lahousse; van Nuijs Alexander, L.N.; Peter, Delputte",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323818/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148043,88

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a subset of non-coding RNAs with a length of more than 200 nucleotides, have been recently recognized as pivotal factors in the pathogenesis of viral infections. However, little is known about the function of lncRNAs in host cultured cells in response to IBV infection. RESULTS: We used next-generation high throughput sequencing to reveal the expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs in IBV-infected HD11 cells. Compared with the uninfected cells, we identified 153 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs (106 up-regulated mRNAs, 47 down-regulated mRNAs) and 181 DE lncRNAs (59 up-regulated lncRNAs, 122 down-regulated lncRNAs) in IBV-infected HD11 cells. Moreover, gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses indicated that DE mRNAs and lncRNAs were mainly involved in cellular innate immunity, amino acid metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism. In addition, 2640 novel chicken lncRNAs were identified, and a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNAs) network centered on gga-miR-30d and miR-146a-5p was established. CONCLUSIONS: We identified expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs during IBV infection that provided new insights into the pathogenesis of IBV.

Initial studies from New York City suggested more severe disease among people living with HIV (PLWH), but this was during a time when hospitals were over-capacity and health systems stretched. This report presents the incidence and outcomes among PLWH with COVID-19 in San Francisco over the first 6 months of the pandemic. METHODS: Community transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in San Francisco on March 5, 2020. This report examines the match of the San Francisco Department of Public Health COVID-19 testing database and the San Francisco Department of Public Health HIV Surveillance case registry from March 24, 2020, to September 3, 2020. RESULTS: Among 4252 COVID-19 tests performed among PLWH, 4.5% (N = 193) were positive for COVID-19, compared with a 3.5% (N = 9626) positivity rate among the 272,555 people without HIV tested for COVID-19 (P < 0.001). The mean age of those infected with HIV/COVID-19 was 48 years (20–76), 38.9% White, 38.3% Latinx, 11.9% Black, and 91.2% were men. Only 54.6% of coinfected PLWH were housed, with the remainder marginally housed. The rate of severe illness with COVID-19 was not increased among PLWH. DISCUSSION: In San Francisco, susceptibility to COVID-19 was increased among PLWH over the first 6 months of the pandemic, although clinical outcomes were similar to those without HIV. Homelessness and higher rates of congregate living situations among PLWH likely accounted for this disparity. Special efforts to house patients with marginal housing during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","Sachdev, Darpun; Mara, Elise; Hsu, Ling; Scheer, Susan; Rutherford, George; Enanoria, Wayne; Gandhi, Monica",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33044323/,88

To provide an interpretable summary of the impact on mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic we estimate weekly and annual life expectancies at birth in Spain and its regions. Methods: We used daily death count data from the Spanish Daily Mortality Surveillance System, MoMo, and death counts from 2018, and population on 1 July, 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the shifted annual calendar period up to 10 May 2020) life expectancies at birth as well as their differences over a short period of time. Results: Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11-20, 2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23rd to April 5th), with national declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 2020* also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.8 years for both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.7 years among men in Madrid. Conclusions: Weekly and annual life expectancy are easy to interpret measures for understanding the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly life expectancy is a valuable indicator of the immediate intensity of health impacts from the pandemic. This sensitive indicator is also useful for understanding disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences are expressed in intuitive year units.","Trias-Llimos, S.; Riffe, T.; Bilal, U.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.03.20120972v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120972,88

This study examines two central questions regarding the adoption of urban agriculture practices at the household level during the COVID‐19 pandemic: whether the outbreak of the novel coronavirus elicited participation in urban agriculture (e.g., community growing and home growing) and what are the characteristics of individuals who participate. To answer these questions, we conducted two online surveys in Phoenix, AZ, and Detroit, MI. The first round occurred during 2017 and the second during the lock‐down in 2020. Using bivariate probit models, we find that (1) considerably fewer individuals participate in urban agriculture at community gardens compared to at‐home gardening; (2) participation overall is lower in 2020 compared to 2017; and (3) respondents in Detroit practice urban agriculture more than respondents in Phoenix. Across both cities, our results suggest that the continuity of individuals' participation in growing food at community gardens and home is fragile. Not all characteristics that determined who participated in community gardens before COVID‐19 are determining the likelihood to participate during the pandemic. In addition, growing food at home before COVID‐19 was practiced by larger households and employed respondents, yet, during the pandemic, we find that home‐growing was more likely when children were in the household and households were smaller and younger (Detroit), and younger and more educated (Phoenix). These findings suggest that many urban households' food‐growing practices may not yet be mainstream and that other barriers may exist that inhibit households' participation.","Chenarides, Lauren; Grebitus, Carola; Lusk, Jayson L.; Printezis, Iryna",Agribusiness (N Y N Y),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362336/; https://doi.org/10.1002/agr.21675,88

Genetic analyses of ACE2 have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) specific to different human populations. Molecular dynamics simulations have indicated that several of these SNPs could affect interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, thereby providing a partial explanation for the regional differences observed in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and severity. However, the significance of population-specific ACE2 SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is unknown, as no in vitro validation studies have been performed. Here, we analyzed the impact of eight SNPs found in specific populations on receptor binding and cell entry in vitro. Except for a SNP causing a nonsense mutation that reduced ACE2 expression, none of the selected SNPs markedly altered the interaction between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2-S), which is responsible for receptor recognition and cell entry, or the efficiency of viral cell entry mediated by SARS-2-S. Our findings indicate that ACE2 polymorphisms have limited impact on the ACE2-dependent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 and underscore the importance of future studies on the involvement of population-specific SNPs of other host genes in susceptibility toward SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hashizume, Mei; Gonzalez, Gabriel; Ono, Chikako; Takashima, Ayako; Iwasaki, Masaharu",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13010067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418950/,88

We review the bearing of the 2019 NCoV infection on neurological practice. Neurological manifestations are less common than respiratory manifestations, yet conspicuous, affecting nearly over a third of hospitalized individuals. These may be classified in to early – headache, dizziness, hyposmia and hypogeusia and late – encephalopathy. Rarely but surely, a very small proportion of infected individuals might present with stroke. Certain neurological conditions, including cerebrovascular disease in both China and Italy and dementia in Italy predispose to infection and more severe manifestations, requiring intensive care unit admission. There is no convincing evidence that the manifestations, course and outcome of various neurological disorders is impacted by 2019 nCoV infection. Concerns of an increased risk of febrile seizures offset by a reduced frequency of infection in the paediatric age group.

INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised by using a minimisation algorithm to self-monitoring of blood pressure with a digital intervention (305 participants) or usual care (routine hypertension care, with appointments and drug changes made at the discretion of the general practitioner; 317 participants). The digital intervention provided feedback of blood pressure results to patients and professionals with optional lifestyle advice and motivational support. Target blood pressure for hypertension, diabetes, and people aged 80 or older followed UK national guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference in systolic blood pressure (mean of second and third readings) after one year, adjusted for baseline blood pressure, blood pressure target, age, and practice, with multiple imputation for missing values. RESULTS: After one year, data were available from 552 participants (88.6%) with imputation for the remaining 70 participants (11.4%). Mean blood pressure dropped from 151.7/86.4 to 138.4/80.2 mm Hg in the intervention group and from 151.6/85.3 to 141.8/79.8 mm Hg in the usual care group, giving a mean difference in systolic blood pressure of −3.4 mm Hg (95% confidence interval −6.1 to −0.8 mm Hg) and a mean difference in diastolic blood pressure of −0.5 mm Hg (−1.9 to 0.9 mm Hg). Results were comparable in the complete case analysis and adverse effects were similar between groups. Within trial costs showed an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £11 ($15, €12; 95% confidence interval £6 to £29) per mm Hg reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The HOME BP digital intervention for the management of hypertension by using self-monitored blood pressure led to better control of systolic blood pressure after one year than usual care, with low incremental costs. Implementation in primary care will require integration into clinical workflows and consideration of people who are digitally excluded.

The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on an interaction between the receptor-binding domain of its trimeric spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A better understanding of the spike/ACE2 interaction is still required to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we investigated the degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between both spike trimers. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits a positive cooperativity for monomeric soluble ACE2 binding when compared to the SARS-CoV-1 spike, which might have more structural restraints. Our findings can be of importance in the development of therapeutics that block the spike/ACE2 interaction.","Anand, Sai Priya; Chen, Yaozong; Prévost, Jérémie; Gasser, Romain; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Abrams, Cameron F.; Pazgier, Marzena; Finzi, Andrés",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003587/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12101104,88

However, the spectra of respiratory disease and resources available for investigation vary internationally. The applicability of POCDLUS to internal medicine (IM) practice in Saudi Arabia and the current use by Saudi physicians are unknown. AIMS: The aim of the present study was to determine the applicability of POCDLUS to IM practice in Saudi Arabia and quantify the residents' current skills, accreditation, and use of POCDLUS. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to the IM residents at our institution to assess their knowledge, use of POCDLUS, and their perceptions of its applicability in IM. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Standard descriptive statistical techniques were used. Categorical data, presented as frequency, were compared using the Chi-squared test. The Likert scale responses, presented as mean ± standard deviation, were compared with a Student's t-test. RESULTS: In total, 100 residents participated (response rate 92.6%) and reported that POCDLUS was applicable to their practice. Identifying pleural effusions was most applicable. A small proportion (n = 7) had received training, nine used POCDLUS regularly, none were accredited and the overall self-reported level of knowledge was poor. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst POCDLUS is applicable to IM practice in Saudi Arabia, the significant skills gap preclude the provision of a POCDLUS service. As COVID-19 can cause an interstitial syndrome, our pandemic preparation response should include POCDLUS training. The current study is supported by a similar Canadian study and the international standardisation of POCDLUS training may be feasible. The findings of the current study may facilitate the development of POCDLUS training programs for internists throughout Saudi Arabia.","Rajendram, Rajkumar; Souleymane, Mamdouh; Mahmood, Naveed; Kharal, Mubashar; AlQahtani, Mohammad",Ann Thorac Med,https://doi.org/10.4103/atm.atm_358_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34484442/,88

However, little is known about the influencing factors and psychological mechanism of cyber aggressive behavior in adolescents. This study examined whether dark personality traits would be associated with cyber aggression in adolescents, whether belief in virtuous humanity would mediate the relationship between dark personality traits and cyber aggression, and whether self-control would play a moderating role in the links. A total of 675 Chinese college students completed a series of anonymous questionnaires regarding dark personality traits, belief in virtuous humanity, self-control, and cyber aggression. Results showed the following: (1) dark personality was positively related to cyber aggression in adolescents; (2) belief in virtuous humanity mediated the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism and psychopathy) and cyber aggression; (3) self-control play a moderating role in the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism and psychopathy) and cyber aggression, and the relationship between belief in virtuous humanity and cyber aggression.

At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19. Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.

The proposed mathematical model examines and includes different behaviours of transition from one process to another in current situation and study their propagation mode. We propose a mathematical model, where two different type of psychological stresses occur due to COVID-19 situation and its impact on people’s life such as their mental well being and happiness. We present some sufficient conditions for the vanishing or spreading of the psychological stress through qualitative and quantitative analysis. The basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) of the model is computed and the local and the global stabilities of different equilibria are studied. Moreover, to better understand the level of psychological stress and decreasing mental well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak in India, we also conducted an online survey. Our findings establish several factors associated with level of psychological impact and mental health status. Based on the empirical analysis, we found that psychological stress has a significant negative influence on mental well being. Further, this study confirms that coping strategies with stress have significantly contributed towards the betterment in the mental well-being of the people. Numerical simulations are also given to illustrate the theoretical results. The results of the present study can be generalized to the society, Government, and others that they can adopt different strategies to avoid stressful situations during COVID-19 outbreak. The findings suggest that policy-makers, Government officials should focus on coping strategies to combat with pandemic disease.","Jain, Subit K.; Tyagi, Swati; Dhiman, Neeraj; Alzabut, Jehad",Results Phys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518795/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721007488; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104661; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379721007488,88

The outbreak of COVID-19 imposed physical and emotional obstacles for traditional face-to-face rehabilitation. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of telerehabilitation remained unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation. Methods A cohort of 86 patients who received minimally invasive esophagectomy between September 2020 and January 2021 was randomly allocated into two groups. The telerehabilitation group received additional online consulting and training, including (I) precautions for nutritional support; (II) swallowing function training; (III) respiratory function training; (IV) guidance and feedback on matters such as patient's current vital signs, wound status, medication, and sleep status. The primary outcome was the change of quality of life (QOL) of each patient at 3 months after surgery. Results No serious adverse events were observed in either group. The telerehabilitation group showed significant improvements in pain using the OLQ-C30 scale (P<0.001), and in choking using the QLQ-OES18 scale (P<0.001). The comparison of the QLQ-C30 and QES-18 score changes at three months after discharge revealed that nearly all aspects in the telerehabilitation group displayed more score changes with significant changes in the appetite loss and pain part (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). The score changes in QLQ-OES18 revealed significant improvement in swallowing saliva (P<0.05), as well slight improvements in choking, dry mouth, taste, and cough without significance. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that telerehabilitation was at least an important supplement to traditional face-to-face consulting and training for patients after esophageal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 period.

The public health emergency required urgent efforts to develop and test the efficacy and safety of vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency use approval has been granted to COVID-19 vaccines before the completion of conventional phases of clinical trials. However, there is no comprehensive review of safety data reported from the vaccine trials, which is critical information to inform the policies in order to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and mitigate the risk aversion perceived due to the COVID-vaccine side effects. This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the evidence on the safety data from the published COVID-19 vaccine trials. This study followed PRISMA guidelines. We searched three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) for published studies between Dec 2019 and 2020. Eligible study designs were randomized trials and pre-and post-intervention evaluations. Descriptive findings of included studies were reported stratified by target population, setting, outcomes, and overall results. From PubMed, Embase, WHO database, and Google Scholar screened titles and abstracts, 11 studies were identified in this review. Most of the reactions reported were mild to moderate whereas a few with severe intensity. All reactions resolved within 3–4 days. The commonly reported local adverse events were pain at the site of injection, swelling, and redness. The systemic reactions included fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Some trials also reported laboratory derangements like decreased hemoglobin, increased bilirubin, altered SGOT and SGPT. None of these alterations were clinically manifested and were self-limiting. Few clinical trials reported serious adverse events, but they were unrelated to vaccination. This systematic review indicates that COVID-19 vaccines can be safe with no serious adverse events. However, long-term post-marketing surveillance data, particularly in high-risk vulnerable populations (elderly and those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children) is warranted to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kaur, Rimple Jeet; Dutta, Siddhartha; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Charan, Jaykaran; Dhingra, Sameer; Mitra, Prasenjit; Singh, Kavita; Yadav, Dharmveer; Sharma, Praveen; Misra, Sanjeev",Indian J Clin Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814753/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12291-021-00968-z,88

Many students volunteered to provide clinical support. Volunteering to work in a clinical capacity was a unique medical education opportunity; however, it is unknown whether this was a positive learning experience or which volunteering roles were of most benefit to students. METHODS: The COVIDReady2 study is a national cross-sectional study of all medical students at medical schools in the United Kingdom. The primary outcome is to explore the experiences of medical students who volunteered during the pandemic in comparison to those who did not. We will compare responses to determine the educational benefit and issues they faced. In addition to quantitative analysis, thematic analysis will be used to identify themes in qualitative responses. DISCUSSION: There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that service roles have potential to enhance medical education; yet, there is a shortage of studies able to offer practical advice for how these roles may be incorporated in future medical education. We anticipate that this study will help to identify volunteer structures that have been beneficial for students, so that similar infrastructures can be used in the future, and help inform medical education in a non-pandemic setting.

The reprocessing procedure for reusable flexible bronchoscopes (RFBs) involves multiple episodes of handling of equipment that has been used during an aerosol-generating procedure and thus is a potential source of transmission. Single-use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFBs) eliminate this source. Additionally, RFBs pose a risk of nosocomial infection transmission between patients with the identification of human proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and pathogenic organisms on fully reprocessed bronchoscopes despite full adherence to the guidelines. Bronchoscopy units have been hugely impacted by the pandemic with restructuring of pre- and post-operative areas, altered patient protocols and the reassessment of air exchange and cleaning procedures. SUFBs can be incorporated into these protocols as a means of improving occupational safety.

Residual LRT samples obtained from critically ill COVID-19 patients with predetermined microbiological culture results were tested using the Unyvero HPN Application. Performance evaluation of the HPN Application was carried out using the standard-of-care (SoC) microbiological culture findings as the reference method. Eighty-three LRT samples were used in the evaluation. The HPN Application had a full concordance with SoC findings in 59/83 (71%) samples. The new method detected additional bacterial species in 21 (25%) and failed at detecting a bacterial species present in lower respiratory culture in 3 (3.6%) samples.

To contain the spread of the virus while awaiting a vaccine, countries applied different approaches from simply giving advice on personal hygiene and applying progressive measures to total lockdown. This paper aims to investigate the impacts of the pandemic on travel behavior in Istanbul,Turkey, through a longitudinal panel study conducted in three phases during the early stages of the epidemic and pandemic. The paper reflects the travel behavior evolution during the development of the outbreak resulting from residents’ self- regulation and governmental measures, distinguishing travel for commute, Social/Recreational/Leisure (SRL), and shopping activities, as well as use of different travel modes based on various socio-economic characteristics. Due to the application of the social distancing of at least 1.5 m, closure of numerous non-essential venues, encouraging teleworking and distance education, job losses and cancellation of all social gatherings in Istanbul between the second and third phase of our data collection, the transition in travel activity pattern and transport mobility appears to be quite extreme, particularly for commuting and SRL trips.","Shakibaei, Shahin; De Jong, Gerard C.; Alpkökin, Pelin; Rashidi, Taha H.",Sustain Cities Soc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251093/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670720308362; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720308362?v=s5,88

We hypothesized that timely government implementation of stringent measures to reduce viral transmission would benefit mental health, as evidenced by reduced rates of depressive symptoms (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9≥10, PHQ-2≥3). METHODS: The systematic review herein (PROSPERO CRD42020200647) evaluated to what extent differences in government-imposed stringency and timeliness of response to COVID-19 moderate the prevalence of depressive symptoms across 33 countries (k=114, N=640,037). We included data from six lower-middle-income countries, nine upper-middle-income countries, and 18 higher-income countries. Government-imposed stringency and timeliness in response were operationalized using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response (“Stringency”) Index. RESULTS: The overall proportion of study participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms was 21.39% (95% CI 19.37–23.47). The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms was significantly lower in countries wherein governments implemented stringent policies promptly. The moderating effect of government response remained significant after including the national frequency of COVID cases at the time of study commencement, Healthcare Access and Quality index, and the inclusion of COVID patients in the study. LIMITATIONS: Factors that may have confounded our results include, for example, differences in lockdown duration, lack of study participant and outcome assessor blinding, and retrospective assessment of depressive symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Governments that enacted stringent measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 benefited not only the physical, but also the mental health of their population.","Lee, Yena; Lui, Leanna M.W.; Chen-Li, David; Liao, Yuhua; Mansur, Rodrigo B.; Brietzke, Elisa; Rosenblat, Joshua D.; Ho, Roger; Rodrigues, Nelson B.; Lipsitz, Orly; Nasri, Flora; Cao, Bing; Subramaniapillai, Mehala; Gill, Hartej; Lu, Ciyong; McIntyre, Roger S.",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34052584/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032721003827; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721003827,88

643743,Roles of microRNAs in Gastrointestinal Cancer Stem Cell Resistance and Therapeutic Development,2021-02-05,"Background The first COVID-19 case in Kenya was confirmed on March 13th, 2020. Here, we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate, and magnitude, of a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases observed in China, whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between China and Kenya. Methods We developed a modelling framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya, KenyaCoV. KenyaCoV was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission both within, and between, different Kenyan regions and age groups. KenyaCoV was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions, the recent 2019 Kenyan census, and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to Kenya. Key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the age-specific rate of developing COVID-19 symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, were adapted for the Kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the Chinese outbreak. Results We find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within Kenya, identifying the role of subclinical, and therefore largely undetected, infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic. Depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for Kenya range from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44 - 2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17). In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: >80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.","Brand, Samuel P C; Aziza, Rabia; Kombe, Ivy K; Agoti, Charles N; Hilton, Joe; Rock, Kat S; Parisi, Andrea; Nokes, D James; Keeling, Matt; Barasa, Edwine",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059865,88
643943,Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with a branched 2-(2-phosphonoethoxy)ethyl chain: Efficient synthesis and antiviral activity,2011-08-01,"Alanyl aminopeptidase (APN) is a surface-bound metallopeptidase that processes the N-terminals of biologically active peptides such as enkephalins, angiotensins, neurokinins, and cytokines. It exerts profound activity on vital processes such as immune response, cellular growth, and blood pressure control. Inhibition of either APN gene expression or its enzymatic activity severely affects leukocyte growth and function. We show here that oxidoreductase-mediated modulations of the cell surface thiol status affect the enzymatic activity of APN. Additional evidence for the pivotal role of extracellular cysteines in the APN molecule was obtained when substitution of any of these six cysteines caused complete loss of surface expression and enzymatic activity. In contrast, the transmembrane Cys24 appears to have no similar function. Enzymatically inactive cysteine mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as shown by high-resolution imaging and Endoglycosidase H digestion. In the absence of any crystal-structure data, the demonstration that individual extracellular cysteines contribute to APN expression and function appears to be of particular importance. The data are the first to show thiol-dependent modulation of the activity of a typical surface-bound peptidase at the cell surface, probably reflecting a general regulating mechanism. This may relate to various disease processes such as inflammation or malignant transformation.","Firla, Beate; Arndt, Marco; Frank, Karin; Thiel, Ute; Ansorge, Siegfried; Täger, Michael; Lendeckel, Uwe",Free Radic Biol Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584901008279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11909693/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584901008279,88
643944,Genomic characterization of equine coronavirus,2007-12-05,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection is associated with high mortality rates but limited clinical data have been reported. We describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from all adult (>18 years old) patients admitted to our 20-bed mixed ICU with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection between October 1, 2012 and May 31, 2014. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples. RESULTS: During the observation period, 31 patients were admitted with MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59 ± 20 years, 22 [71 %] males). Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients; 22 (77.4 %) patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Invasive mechanical ventilation was applied in 27 (87.1 %) and vasopressor therapy in 25 (80.6 %) patients during the intensive care unit stay. Twenty-three (74.2 %) patients died in the ICU. Nonsurvivors were older, had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission, and were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy. After adjustment for the severity of illness and the degree of organ dysfunction, the need for vasopressors was an independent risk factor for death in the ICU (odds ratio = 18.33, 95 % confidence interval: 1.11–302.1, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV infection requiring admission to the ICU is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The need for vasopressor therapy is the main risk factor for death in these patients.

In addition to putting people’s lives at risk and causing mortality, various problems have occurred due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarantine, social distancing, and the obligation to use protective tools have led to sometimes long term closing of various jobs and services, including rehabilitation services. For instance, the disease has interrupted the provision of Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) services to children due to the need for face-to-face communication between Speech and Language Pathologists (SLPs) and children during the evaluation and treatment processes. Therefore, here, we described the quality of providing SLP services during the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative effects of the disease on the provision of SLP services. In addition, we made an attempt to explain concerns and problems raised by the families, the importance of providing SLP services during the critical period of speech and language development, telepractice services, the roles of speech-language-hearing related scientific associations, and the roles of SLPs during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Tohidast, Seyed Abolfazl; Mansuri, Banafshe; Bagheri, Rasool; Azimi, Hadi",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32705994/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110262; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587620304055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587620304055?v=s5,88

Their infectious entry requires viral spike (S) proteins, which attach to cell receptors, undergo proteolytic cleavage, and then refold in a process that catalyzes virus-cell membrane fusion. Fusion-inhibiting peptides bind to S proteins, interfere with refolding, and prevent infection. Here we conjugated fusion-inhibiting peptides to various lipids, expecting this to secure peptides onto cell membranes and thereby increase antiviral potencies. Cholesterol or palmitate adducts increased antiviral potencies up to 1000-fold. Antiviral effects were evident after S proteolytic cleavage, implying that lipid conjugates affixed the peptides at sites of protease-triggered fusion activation. Unlike lipid-free peptides, the lipopeptides suppressed CoV S protein-directed virus entry taking place within endosomes. Cell imaging revealed intracellular peptide aggregates, consistent with their endocytosis into compartments where CoV entry takes place. These findings suggest that lipidations localize antiviral peptides to protease-rich sites of CoV fusion, thereby protecting cells from diverse CoVs.","Park, Jung-Eun; Gallagher, Tom",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217302520; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.07.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802158/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217302520,88

To the best of our knowledge, no study quantified the changes on moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behaviors (SB) and its correlates in Brazilians. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the changes (pre versus during pandemic) in time spent in MVPA and SB in self-isolating Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) to explore correlates. METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective, self-report online web survey, evaluating the time spent in MVPA and SB pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic in self-isolating people in Brazil. Sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical measures, and time in self-isolation were also obtained. Changes in MVPA and SB and their correlates were explored using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Models were adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 877 participants (72.7% women, 53.7% young adults [18–34 years]) were included. Overall, participants reported a 59.7% reduction (95% CI 35.6–82.2) in time spent on MVPA during the pandemic, equivalent to 64.28 (95% CI 36.06–83.33) minutes per day. Time spent in SB increased 42.0% (95% CI 31.7–52.5), corresponding to an increase of 152.3 (95% CI 111.9–192.7) minutes per day. Greater reductions in MVPA and increases in SB were seen in younger adults, those not married, those employed, and those with a self-reported previous diagnosis of a mental disorder.

However, there are only limited data regarding the precise prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Here, to estimate the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 infection in East Java, Indonesia, we investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We enrolled 1,819 individuals from June to December 2020 and observed that the subjects’ overall prevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was 11.4% (207/1,819). The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differed significantly between the job/occupation groups (P = 0.0001). A greater prevalence of IgG was detected in laboratory technicians (who take samples from suspected cases and deal with polymerase chain reaction [PCR] procedures, 22.2%) compared to medical personnel who see and take direct care of patients with COVID-19 (e.g., physicians and nurses, 6.0%), other staff in medical facilities (2.9%), general population (12.1%) and non-COVID-19 patients (14.6%). The highest prevalence among age groups was in the 40–49-year-olds (14.8%), and the lowest prevalence was in the 20–29-year-olds (7.4%). However, the younger population still showed a higher prevalence than generally reported, suggesting greater exposure to the virus but less susceptibility to the disease. A geographical difference was also observed: a higher prevalence in Surabaya (13.1%) than in Jombang (9.9%).

646842,Development of Nanobodies Targeting Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus: The Prospect in Disease Diagnosis and Therapy,2021-07-26,"POLICY POINTS: Preventive measures such as the national lockdown in Italy have been effective in slowing the spread of COVID‐19. However, they also had psychological and economic impacts on people’s lives, which should not be neglected as they may reduce citizens’ trust and compliance with future health mandates. Engaging citizens in their own health management and in the collaboration with health care professionals and authorities via the adoption of a collaborative approach to health policy development is fundamental to fostering such measures’ effectiveness. Psychosocial analysis of citizens’ concerns and emotional reactions to preventive policies is important in order to plan personalized health communication campaigns. CONTEXT: Because of the COVID‐19 pandemic, between February 23 and March 8, 2020, some areas of Italy were declared “red zones,” with citizens asked to stay home and avoid unnecessary interpersonal contacts. Such measures were then extended, between March 10 and May 4, 2020, to the whole country. However, compliance with such behaviors had an important impact on citizens’ personal, psychological, and economic well‐being. This could result in reduced trust in authorities and lowered compliance. Keeping citizens engaged in their own health and in preventive behaviors is thus a key strategy for the success of such measures. This paper presents the results from a study conducted in Italy to monitor levels of people’s health engagement, sentiment, trust in authorities, and perception of risk at two different time points. METHODS: Two independent samples (n = 968 and n = 1,004), weighted to be representative of the adult Italian population, were recruited in two waves corresponding to crucial moments of the Italian COVID‐19 epidemic: between February 28 and March 4 (beginning of “phase 1,” after the first regional lockdowns), and between May 12 and May 18 (beginning of “phase 2,” after the national lockdown was partially dismissed). Respondents were asked to complete an online survey with a series of both validated measures and ad hoc items. A series of t‐tests, general linear models, and contingency tables were carried out to assess if and how our measures changed over time in different social groups. FINDINGS: Although sense of self and social responsibility increased between the two waves, and trust toward authorities remained substantially the same, trust in science, consumer sentiment, and health engagement decreased. Our results showed that while both the level of general concern for the emergency and the perceived risk of infection increased between the two waves, in the second wave our participants reported being more concerned for the economic consequences of the pandemic than the health risk. CONCLUSIONS: The potentially disruptive psychological impact of lockdown may hamper citizens’ compliance with, and hence the effectiveness of, behavioral preventive measures. This suggests that preventive measures should be accompanied by collaborative educational plans aimed at promoting people’s health engagement by making citizens feel they are partners in the health preventive endeavor and involved in the development of health policies.","GRAFFIGNA, GUENDALINA; PALAMENGHI, LORENZO; SAVARESE, MARIAROSARIA; CASTELLINI, GRETA; BARELLO, SERENA",Milbank Q,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822424/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12506,88

Digital interventions in SB require mixed method evaluations to understand potential for impact in real-world settings. In this study, the RE-AIM QuEST evaluation framework will be used to understand the potential of a digital health promotion application which targets reducing and breaking up SB across multiple workplace settings. Methods: Four companies and 80 employees were recruited to use a digital application. Questionnaires were used to measure SB, and additional health and work-related outcomes at baseline, one month, three month and six month follow-up. Qualitative data was collected through focus groups with employees and interviews with stakeholders. Questionnaire data was analysed using Wilcoxon Sign Rank tests and qualitative data was thematically analysed. Results: The digital application significantly increased standing time at one month for the total group and transitions per hour in one of the companies. Facilitators and barriers were identified across RE-AIM. Conclusions: Addressing the barriers which have been identified, while maintaining the positive attributes will be critical to producing an effective digital application which also has the potential for impact in the real world.","MacDonald, Bradley; Gibson, Ann-Marie; Janssen, Xanne; Kirk, Alison",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599730/,88

649621,Differentially expressed non-coding RNAs induced by transmissible gastroenteritis virus potentially regulate inflammation and NF-κB pathway in porcine intestinal epithelial cell line,2018-10-12,"BACKGROUND: In spring 2009, a novel strain of influenza A originating in Veracruz, Mexico, quickly spread to the United States and throughout the world. This influenza A virus was the product of gene reassortment of 4 different genetic elements: human influenza, swine influenza, avian influenza, and Eurasian swine influenza. In the United States, New York was the epicenter of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic. Hospital emergency departments (EDs) were inundated with patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) requesting screening for H1N1. Our ED screening, as well as many others, used a rapid screening test for influenza A (QuickVue A/B) because H1N1 was a variant of influenza A. The definitive laboratory test i.e., RT-PCR for H1N1 was developed by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and subsequently distributed to health departments. Because of the extraordinary volume of test requests, health authorities restricted reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hence most EDs, including our own, were dependent on rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) for swine influenza. A positive rapid influenza A test was usually predictive of RT-PCR H1N1 positivity, but the rapid influenza A screening test (QuickVue A/B) was associated with 30% false negatives. The inability to rely on RIDTs for H1N1 diagnosis resulted in underdiagnosing H1N1. Confronted with adults admitted with ILIs, negative RIDTs, and restricted RT-PCR testing, there was a critical need to develop clinical criteria to diagnose probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia. METHODS: During the pandemic, the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital developed clinical criteria for adult admitted patients with ILIs and negative RIDTs. Similar to the one developed for the clinical diagnosis of legionnaire's disease. The Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia is based on key clinical and laboratory features. RESULTS: During the “herald” wave of the swine influenza H1N1 pandemic, the diagnostic weighted point score system accurately identified probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia and accurately differentiated swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia from ILIs and other viral and bacterial community-acquired pneumonias. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with ILIs and negative RIDTs, the diagnostic weighted diagnostic point score system, may be used to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis of swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia.","Cunha, Burke A.; Syed, Uzma; Stroll, Stephanie; Mickail, Nardeen; Laguerre, Marianne",Heart Lung,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2009.09.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956309002350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19944879/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956309002350,88

The face specific mask was compared to a universal design of facemask and different filter container’s designs were merged with the mask body. Subjective assessment of the face specific mask demonstrated tight closure at the nose, mouth and chin area, and permits the normal wearing of glasses. A screw-drive locking system is advised for easy assembly of the filter components. Automation of the process enables high volume production but still allows sufficient designer interaction to answer specific requirements. The suggested protocol can be used to provide more comfortable, effective and sustainable solution compared to a single use, standardized mask. Subsequent research on printing materials, sterilization technique and compliance with international regulations will facilitate the introduction of the face specific mask in clinical practice as well as for general use.","Shaheen, Eman; Willaert, Robin; Miclotte, Isabel; Coropciuc, Ruxandra; Bila, Michel; Politis, Constantinus",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270772/,88

COVID-19, which is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2), affects multiple organ systems through a myriad of mechanisms. Afflicted patients present with a vast constellation of symptoms, from asymptomatic disease to life-threatening complications. The most common manifestations pertain to mild pulmonary symptoms, which can progress to respiratory distress syndrome and venous thromboembolism. However, in patients with renal failure, life-threatening cardiac abnormalities can ensue. Various mechanisms such as viral entry through Angiotensin receptor (ACE) affecting multiple organs and thus releasing pro-inflammatory markers have been postulated. Nevertheless, the predictors of various presentations in the affected population remain elusive. An ameliorated understanding of the pathology and pathogenesis of the viral infection has led to the development of variable treatment options, with many more that are presently under trial.

652364,Immune evasion of porcine enteric coronaviruses and viral modulation of antiviral innate signaling,2016-12-02,"BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding offers short- and long- term health benefits to mothers and children and constitutes a priority for public health. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to be transmitted via breastmilk. Moreover, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are presumably contained in breastmilk of mothers with history of COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Direct breastfeeding is the preferred infant feeding option during the pandemic, but conflicting practices have been adopted, which could widen existing disparities in breastfeeding. This study aims to describe how was information about breastfeeding communicated in Mexican media during the pandemic and assess Mexican adults’ beliefs regarding breastfeeding among mothers infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective content analysis of media coverage on breastfeeding in Mexico between March 1 and September 24, 2020, excluding advertisements, was done. For the content analysis, both a sentiment analysis and an analysis based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for breastfeeding promotion were performed. Also, we incorporated a descriptive analysis from the July 2020 wave of the ENCOVID-19 survey, which included questions on beliefs about breastfeeding. This information was stratified by gender, age, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: 1014 publications on breastfeeding were identified in internet, newspapers, TV, and magazines. Most information was published during World Breastfeeding Week, celebrated in August. Based on the sentiment analysis, 57.2% of all information was classified as positive, and based on the SWOT analysis, most information was classified either as strengths or opportunities for breastfeeding promotion. However, the ENCOVID-19 data showed that 67.3% of people living in households with children under 3 years of age believe that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed, and 19.8% stated that they simply didn’t know. These beliefs showed differences both by gender and by socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: While the Mexican government endorsed the recommendations on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, communication of those messages was sporadic, inconstant and unequal across types of media. Moreover, there were also negative messages for breastfeeding circulating on the media. There continues to be a widespread notion that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed and, due to differences on beliefs by socioeconomic status, health inequities could be exacerbated.","Vilar-Compte, Mireya; Gaitán-Rossi, Pablo; Rhodes, Elizabeth C.; Cruz-Villaba, Valeria; Pérez-Escamilla, R.",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031652/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-528093/v1,88

The presence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and the surrounding tumor microenvironment protects glioblastoma from recognition by the immune system. Conventional therapy concepts have failed to completely remove glioblastoma cells, which is one major drawback in clinical management of the disease. The use of small molecule inhibitors, immunomodulators, immunotherapy, including peptide and mRNA vaccines, and virotherapy came into focus for the treatment of glioblastoma. Although novel strategies underline the benefit for anti-tumor effectiveness, serious challenges need to be overcome to successfully manage tumorigenesis, indicating the significance of developing new strategies. Therefore, we provide insights into the application of different medications in combination to boost the host immune system to interfere with immune evasion of glioblastoma cells which are promising prerequisites for therapeutic approaches to treat glioblastoma patients.","Burster, Timo; Traut, Rebecca; Yermekkyzy, Zhanerke; Mayer, Katja; Westhoff, Mike-Andrew; Bischof, Joachim; Knippschild, Uwe",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485282/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.695325,88

Objective To evaluate the characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and identify their associations with outcomes. Background There are limited data on the outcomes in COVID-19 patients in Pennsylvania. Design Retrospective study Setting Intensive care units in an academic health system in Western Pennsylvania. Participants Patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs as direct admission or transfers from regular floors between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. Main outcome(s) and measure(s) The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included complications during ICU stay, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, and the need for oxygen at discharge. Categorical variables are described as frequencies and continuous variables as median with interquartile range (IQR). Regression modeling was used to identify the predictors of inpatient mortality in these patients. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis was performed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Results The cohort included 58 consecutive patients, with a median age of 62 years (IQR 54-73), 63.8% of which were male. On presentation, constitutional symptoms were the most common (91.4%), followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms (87.9%). Tachypnea (65.5%) and hypoxia (67.2%) were the most common abnormal vital signs at presentation. Common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (74.1%), obesity (53.5%), and diabetes (39.7%). The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score on admission to ICU was 11 (IQR 8.5-17.5). The major complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 50.0%, shock 41.4%, and acute kidney injury 41.4%. The proportion of patients who underwent mechanical ventilation, required vasopressors, or were on renal replacement therapy were 58.6%, 41.4%, and 10.3%, respectively. Overall mortality was 32.8%. Age, Charlson-comorbidity index, tachypnea, lymphopenia at presentation, high APACHE score, shock, ARDS, mechanical ventilation, and steroid use were significantly associated with mortality. Of the patients who survived their ICU stay, 63.2% were discharged home and 44.7% had a new oxygen requirement at discharge. Conclusion and relevance Our study reports high mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care in Western Pennsylvania. Identifying factors associated with poor prognosis could help risk-stratify these patients.

OBJECTIVE - To establish a CCP donation program based on the availability of recovered COVID-19 patients and the practical limitations to recruit clinically valid donors in a multicultural setting. DESIGN - From March to June 2020, we developed a program for collection of COVID-19 CCP as part of the treatment options for patients affected with COVID-19. From an initial population of 3,746 candidates, only those with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results in at least two separate tests were considered. This filter reduced the eligible donor pool to 488 patients. After other exclusions were applied, such as language barrier, age, accessibility to donation, comorbidities, etc., the final count was 267 potentially eligible donors, which represented only 54.7 % (267/488) of preselected candidates. RESULTS - Eighty donors were called. Approximately a third of the calls provided additional challenges as outlined by the following four reasons: limited functional understanding of English; schedule availability due to rotating work timetables; transportation restrictions since public transport services were severely restricted during lockdown; and lost to follow up. Finally, a total of 38 valid donors participated, from which 45 apheresis procedures were performed. CONCLUSIONS - As a summary of our experience, we can conclude that despite the limitations we were able to establish an effective program.

This in turn has strongly impacted the energy demand of the transport sector and associated CO(2) emissions. We analyse near real-time passenger mobility and related emission trends in Europe between 21 January and 21 September 2020. We compiled a dataset of country-, sector- and lockdown- specific values, representing daily activity changes in private, public, and active passenger transport. In the aggregate, surface passenger transport emissions fell by 11.2% corresponding to 40.3 MtCO(2) in Europe. This decline was predominantly due to the reduction of private passenger transport in five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK). During the first lockdown in April 2020, CO(2) emissions from surface passenger transport declined by 50% in Europe, resulting in a 7.1% reduction in total CO(2) emissions. After April 2020, private passenger travel recovered rapidly, while public passenger flows remained low. Solely prompted by the private sector, a rebound in total emissions and surface passenger transport emissions of 1.5% and 10.7%, respectively, was estimated at the end of the study period. The resulting situation of increased private and decreased public passenger transport is in contradiction to major climate goals, and without reversing these trends, emission reductions, as stated in the European Green Deal are unlikely to be achieved. Our study provides an analysis based on a detailed and timely set of data of surface passenger transport and points to options to grasp the momentum for innovative changes in passenger mobility.","Schulte-Fischedick, Marta; Shan, Yuli; Hubacek, Klaus",Appl Energy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261921007972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305265/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117396; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921007972,88

In March 2020, our institution cancelled all in-person conferences as per guidelines from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the conferences were shifted to virtual platforms. Our recent peer learning approach allowed us to practice appropriate social distancing while following the institutional and national guidelines with minimal disruption. Other institutions that are facing similar challenges can adopt or modify our framework of a successful and efficient virtual peer learning process.","Virarkar, Mayur; Morani, Ajaykumar C; Bhosale, Priya; Wagner-Bartak, Nicolaus A; Carter, Brett W; Lano, Elizabeth",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430170/,88
654551,Proof by synthesis of Tobacco mosaic virus,2014-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Some endocrinologists were involved in the management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. This study aims to analyze burnout levels among the Association of Medical Endocrinologists (AME) members before and during the pandemic. METHODS: We recruited two AME members samples at two different times: before COVID-19 (n = 811) and during the first wave of the ongoing pandemic (n = 579). Both the samples filled the Maslach Burnout Inventory. We performed MANOVAs to evaluate demographic and COVID-19 related differences in burnout levels and Pearson's Chi-square test to compare burnout severity before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Women reported higher Emotional Exhaustion and reduced Professional Accomplishment than men. The oldest physicians had lower levels of Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization and higher Professional Accomplishment than younger workers. Independent contractors displayed lower levels of burnout compared to established contractors. Finally, the pandemic, per se, did not lead to changes in burnout levels. DISCUSSION: Women and young physicians are at higher risk of burnout. It is also possible that front-line professionals are at higher risk during a health care crisis. Moreover, it is likely that the length of exposure to the pandemic has not been sufficient to impact burnout levels. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to pandemic-related activities seemed to have a low impact on burnout severity, except for physicians directly involved in managing COVID-19 cases. It is strongly recommended the availability of psychological support in public hospitals.","Loscalzo, Yura; Marucci, Simonetta; Garofalo, Piernicola; Attanasio, Roberto; Lisco, Giuseppe; De Geronimo, Vincenzo; Guastamacchia, Edoardo; Giannini, Marco; Triggiani, Vincenzo",Endocr. metab. immune disord. drug targets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303333/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530321666210720123336,88

Patients admitted for ADHF have high in-hospital morbidity and mortality, as well as frequent rehospitalizations and subsequent cardiovascular death. This devastating clinical course is partly due to suboptimal medical management of ADHF with persistent congestion upon hospital discharge and inadequate predischarge initiation of life-saving guideline-directed therapies. While new drugs for the treatment of chronic HF continue to be approved, there has been no new therapy approved for ADHF in decades.

Whilst vaccination should provide a long-term solution, this is pitted against the constant threat of mutations in the virus rendering the current vaccines less effective. Consequently, small molecule antiviral agents would be extremely useful to complement the vaccination program. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which encodes at least nine enzymatic activities that all have drug targeting potential. The papain-like protease (PLpro) contained in the nsp3 protein generates viral non-structural proteins from a polyprotein precursor, and cleaves ubiquitin and ISG protein conjugates. Here we describe the expression and purification of PLpro. We developed a protease assay that was used to screen a custom compound library from which we identified dihydrotanshinone I and Ro 08-2750 as compounds that inhibit PLpro in protease and isopeptidase assays and also inhibit viral replication in cell culture-based assays.","Lim, Chew Theng; Tan, Kang Wei; Wu, Mary; Ulferts, Rachel; Armstrong, Lee A.; Ozono, Eiko; Drury, Lucy S.; Milligan, Jennifer C.; Zeisner, Theresa U.; Zeng, Jingkun; Weissmann, Florian; Canal, Berta; Bineva-Todd, Ganka; Howell, Michael; O'Reilly, Nicola; Beale, Rupert; Kulathu, Yogesh; Labib, Karim; Diffley, John F.X.",Biochem J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198325/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20210244,88

The high contagiousness of the virus, the strong impact on the health system of the various countries and the absence to date of treatments able to improve the prognosis of the disease make the introduction of a vaccine indispensable, even though there are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines. The aim of the study is to carry out a review of the medical literature concerning vaccine candidates for the main coronaviruses responsible for human epidemics, including recent advances in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19. This extensive review carried out on the vaccine candidates of the main epidemic coronaviruses of the past has shown that the studies in animal models suggest a high efficacy of potential vaccines in providing protection against viral challenges. Similar human studies have not yet been carried out, as the main trials are aimed at assessing mainly vaccine safety and immunogenicity. Whereas the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) epidemic ended almost two decades ago and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) epidemic is now better controlled, as it is less contagious due to the high lethality of the virus, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a problem that is certainly more compelling, which pushes us to accelerate the studies not only for the production of vaccines but also for innovative pharmacological treatments. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines might come too late to affect the first wave of this pandemic, but they might be useful if additional subsequent waves occur or in a post-pandemic perspective in which the virus continues to circulate as a seasonal virus.","Conte, Cristiano; Sogni, Francesco; Affanni, Paola; Veronesi, Licia; Argentiero, Alberto; Esposito, Susanna",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8020309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32560340/,88
656979,The synthetic futures of vesicular stomatitis virus,2012-07-11,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to large-scale shutdowns in society. This resulted in global supply bottlenecks for medical protective equipment. The so-called Maker Movement recognized this emerging problem early on and, with the help of additive manufacturing (AM), began developing and manufacturing half masks or face shields as personal protective equipment (PPE). This knowledge has been made available in many places in form of open source product data, so that products could be adapted and improved, saving development time. METHODS: This production and innovation potential has been taken up and professionalized by the authors of this article. By means of a proof-of-principle we provide an overview of the possibility and successful unique introduction of a so-called professional “hybrid production” in a micro factory using 3D-printing at the place of greatest demand in a hospital by medical personnel to produce their own PPE. Furthermore the learning process and future benefits of on site 3D-printing are described. RESULTS: Our proof-of-principle successfully showed that the allocation of 3D-printing capabilities in the hospital infrastructure is possible. With assistance of the engineers, responsible for product design and development, the medical staff was able to produce PPE by means of AM. However, due to legal uncertainties and high material and production costs the usability is severely limited. CONCLUSIONS: The practical research showed that a complete implementation of the concept and the short-term establishment of a 3D-printing factory for the autonomous supply of a hospital with PPE was not feasible without further efforts. Nevertheless, it has enabled the medical staff to use AM technologies for future research approaches.","Hartig, Sascha; Duda, Sven; Hildebrandt, Lennart",3D Print Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41205-020-00090-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284417/,88

Data sources: Cochrane, PubMed, Natural Standard, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine databases were searched to identify and acquire primary research reports, literature reviews, and secondary analyses related to the clinical objective. Published clinical trials, literature reviews, meta‐analyses, and systematic reviews were evaluated for evidence‐based practice implications. Conclusions: Vitamin C is frequently used for the treatment and prophylaxis of the common cold; however, no published recommendations were found in a review of the nurse practitioner literature that specifically address the efficacy of vitamin C for the common cold. Our literature review revealed that vitamin C is not effective at preventing the common cold in the general adult population; however, it is effective at preventing colds when consumed regularly by athletes training in subarctic conditions. We also found that regular vitamin C consumption may reduce the duration of cold symptoms in both adults and children, but it does not decrease the severity of cold symptoms. Implications for practice: NPs should counsel their patients that regular vitamin C consumption may decrease the duration of cold symptoms, but does not affect symptom severity or act as a prophylaxis.","Heimer, Kathryn A.; Hart, Ann Marie; Martin, Linda Gore; Rubio‐Wallace, Sherrie",J Am Acad Nurse Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19432914/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-7599.2009.00409.x,88

Whether mixing of viral components during co-infection alters pathogenic outcomes or viral replication is not known. In this study, we investigated how different coronavirus nucleocapsid (CoV N) proteins interact and affect PEDV replication. We found that PDCoV N and TGEV N can competitively interact with PEDV N. However, the presence of PDCoV or TGEV N led to very different outcomes on PEDV replication. While PDCoV N significantly suppresses PEDV replication, overexpression of TGEV N, like that of PEDV N, increases production of PEDV RNA and virions. Despite partial interchangeability in nucleocapsid oligomerization and viral RNA synthesis, endogenous PEDV N cannot be replaced in the production of infectious PEDV particles.

This study relies on simple subcellular fractionation used to obtain soluble- and membrane-enriched fractions followed by 2-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) separation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The cells were collected using a brushing technique applied on NE of clinically evaluated volunteers. Subsequently, the soluble- and the membrane-protein enriched fractions were prepared and analyzed in parallel using 2D-LC-MS/MS. In a set of 1482 identified proteins, 947 (63.9%) proteins were found to be associated to membrane fraction. Grand average hydropathy value index (GRAVY) analysis, the transmembrane protein mapping and annotations of primary location deposited in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) confirmed an enrichment of hydrophobic proteins on this dataset. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of soluble fraction revealed an enrichment of molecular and cellular functions associated with cell death, protein folding and drug metabolism while in membrane fraction showed an enrichment of functions associated with molecular transport, protein trafficking and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction. The IPA showed similar enrichment of functions associated with cellular growth and proliferation in both soluble and membrane subproteomes. This finding was in agreement with protein content analysis using exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI). A comparison of our data with previously published studies focusing on respiratory tract epithelium revealed similarities related to identification of proteins associated with physical barrier function and immunological defence. In summary, we extended the NE molecular profile by identifying and characterizing proteins associated to pivotal functions of a respiratory epithelium, including the control of fluid volume and ionic composition at the airways' surface, physical barrier maintenance, detoxification and immunological defence. The extent of similarities supports the applicability of a less invasive analysis of NE to assess prognosis and treatment response of lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Simões, Tânia; Charro, Nuno; Blonder, Josip; Faria, Daniel; Couto, Francisco M.; Chan, King C.; Waybright, Timothy; Isaaq, Haleem J.; Veenstra, Timothy D.; Penque, Deborah",J Proteomics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187439191100203X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21621024/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.05.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187439191100203X,88

Data on the epidemiology profiles of ARIs are scarce in the western and rural areas of China. The purpose of the current study is to provide data on the presence of potential pathogens of ARIs in hospitalized children in Chengdu, west China. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were obtained from hospitalized patients (under 6 years old) with ARIs in a local hospital in Chengdu. Eight respiratory viruses were identified by PCR and 6 respiratory bacteria by biochemical reactions and Analytical Profile Index (API). Pathogens profiles, clinical characteristics and seasonality were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of patients were identified with at least one respiratory pathogen. Human rhinovirus (HRV) (23%), Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22.7%) was the most commonly identified viruses, with Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.5%) the most commonly identified bacterium in the study. The presences of more than one pathogen were found, and multiple viral, bacterial, viral/bacterial combinations were identified in 14.9, 3.3 and 13.9% of patients respectively. Respiratory viruses were identified throughout the year with a seasonal peak in December–February. Pathogens profiles and clinical associations were different between infants (< 1 year of age) and older children (> 1 year of age). Infants with ARIs were more likely to have one or more viruses than older children. Infants identified with multiple pathogens had significantly higher proportions of tachypnea than infants that were not. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that viral agents were frequently found in hospitalized children with ARI in Chengdu during the study period. This study gives us better information on the pathogen profiles, clinical associations, co-infection combinations and seasonal features of ARIs in hospitalized children, which is important for diagnoses and treatment of ARIs, as well as implementation of vaccines in this area. Moreover, future efforts in reducing the impact of ARIs will depend on programs in which available vaccines, especially vaccines on RSV, HRV and S. pneumoniae could be employed in this region and new vaccines could be developed against common pathogens.","Chen, Jiayi; Hu, Pengwei; Zhou, Tao; Zheng, Tianli; Zhou, Lingxu; Jiang, Chunping; Pei, Xiaofang",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29976175/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-018-1203-y,88

In this paper, we shed light on the effectiveness of such a strategy in two European countries (Spain and Italy) by analysing data from June to December 2020, collected via a large-scale online citizen survey with 95,251 answers in Spain and 43,393 answers in Italy. Through our analysis, we identify several weaknesses in each of the three pillars of the TTI strategy: testing, tracing and isolating. Moreover, we analyse the respondents' self-reported behaviour before and after the mitigation strategies were deployed during the second wave of infections. We find that the changes in the participants' behaviour were more pronounced in Italy than in Spain, whereas in both countries, respondents reported being very compliant with individual protection measures, such as wearing facial masks or frequently disinfecting their hands. Finally, we analyse the participants' perceptions about their government's measures and the safety of everyday activities and places regarding the risk of getting an infection. We find that the perceived risk is often gender- and age-dependent and not aligned with the risk level identified by the literature. This finding emphasises the importance of deploying public-health communication campaigns to debunk misconceptions about SARS-CoV-2.

In addition to fever, cough, headache, and shortness of breath, an intense increase in immune response-based inflammation has been the hallmark of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection. This narrative review summarizes and critiques pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its plausible effects on drug metabolism and disposition. The release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins, tumor necrosis factor α), also known as ‘cytokine storm’, leads to altered molecular pathophysiology and eventually organ damage in the lung, heart, and liver. The laboratory values for various liver function tests (e.g., alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin) have indicated potential hepatocellular injury in COVID-19 patients. Since the liver is the powerhouse of protein synthesis and the primary site of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug metabolism, even a minor change in the liver function status has the potential to affect the hepatic clearance of xenobiotics. It has now been well established that extreme increases in cytokine levels are common in COVID-19 patients, and previous studies with patients infected with non-SARS-CoV-2 virus have shown that CYP enzymes can be suppressed by an infection-related cytokine increase and inflammation. Alongside the investigational COVID-19 drugs, the patients may also be on therapeutics for comorbidities; especially epidemiological studies have indicated that individuals with hypertension, hyperglycemia, and obesity are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the average population. This complicates the drug-disease interaction profile of the patients as both the investigational drugs (e.g., remdesivir, dexamethasone) and the agents for comorbidities can be affected by compromised CYP-mediated hepatic metabolism. Overall, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay attention to the COVID-19 and CYP-driven drug metabolism interactions with the goal to adjust the dose or discontinue the affected drugs as appropriate.","Deb, Subrata; Arrighi, Scott",Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538960/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13318-020-00668-8,88

While available data suggest that school-aged children are not significant spreaders of SARS-CoV-2, the possibility of transmission in schools remains an ongoing concern, especially among an aging teaching workforce. Even in low-prevalence settings, communities must balance the potential risk of transmission with the need for students' ongoing education. Through the roll out of high-throughput school-based SARS-CoV-2 testing, enhanced follow-up for individuals exposed to COVID-19 and wellbeing surveys, this study investigates the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the current psychosocial wellbeing impacts of the pandemic in school communities. Methods: The DETECT Schools Study is a prospective observational cohort surveillance study in 79 schools across Western Australia (WA), Australia. To investigate the incidence, transmission and impact of SARS-CoV-2 in schools, the study comprises three “modules”: Module 1) Spot-testing in schools to screen for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2; Module 2) Enhanced surveillance of close contacts following the identification of any COVID-19 case to determine the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in a school setting; and Module 3) Survey monitoring of school staff, students and their parents to assess psycho-social wellbeing following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in WA.

An important issue is whether this pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies and sanitary measures overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease.","Roques, L.; Bonnefon, O.; Baudrot, V.; Soubeyrand, S.; Berestycki, H.",R Soc Open Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33489282/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201382,88

Some asymptomatic patients with early-stage lung cancer who have COVID-19 receive surgical treatment but develop severe pneumonia and other complications or even experience postoperative death, and they may have a worse prognosis compared with healthy individuals infected with COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the incidence and prognosis of COVID-19 in lung cancer patients and provide evidence-based medical support for clinical treatment. METHODS: We will search 6 medical databases to identify eligible studies published from the establishment of the database to the present. The quality of the included literature will be evaluated using the bias risk assessment tool in Cochrane 5.1.0, and a meta-analysis will be performed using Stata 14.0. Heterogeneity will be statistically assessed using χ(2) tests. RESULTS: The study will integrate existing research findings to investigate the prevalence and severity rate of patients with lung cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the prognosis and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with or without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence to support whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer and provide guidance for clinical prevention and treatment based on the evidence obtained in light of the unpredictable threat posed by COVID-19.

660889,Arenaviridae exoribonuclease presents genomic RNA edition capacity,2019-02-08,"BACKGROUND: Sweden has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 deaths per inhabitant globally. However, absolute death counts can be misleading. Estimating age- and sex-specific mortality rates is necessary in order to account for the underlying population structure. Furthermore, given the difficulty of assigning causes of death, excess all-cause mortality should be estimated to assess the overall burden of the pandemic. METHODS: By estimating weekly age- and sex-specific death rates during 2020 and during the preceding five years, our aim is to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden, and in the most affected region Stockholm. RESULTS: Eight weeks after Sweden’s first confirmed case, the death rates at all ages above 60 were higher than for previous years. Persons above age 80 were disproportionally more affected, and men suffered greater excess mortality than women in ages up to 75 years. At older ages, the excess mortality was similar for men and women, with up to 1.5 times higher death rates for Sweden and up to 3 times higher for Stockholm. Life expectancy at age 50 declined by less than 1 year for Sweden and 1.5 years for Stockholm compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The excess mortality has been high in older ages during the pandemic, but it remains to be answered if this is because of age itself being a prognostic factor or a proxy for comorbidity. Only monitoring deaths at a national level may hide the effect of the pandemic on the regional level.","Modig, Karin; Ahlbom, Anders; Ebeling, Marcus",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169145/; https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa218,88
661908,Detection and characterization of a novel bat-borne coronavirus in Singapore using multiple molecular approaches,2019-10-01,"Studies of individuals under conditions of confinement or severe social and physical restrictions have consistently shown deleterious mental health effects but also high levels of adaptability when dealing with such conditions. Considering the role of physical activity and sport in psychological adaptation, this paper describes a longitudinal study to explore to what extent the imposed restrictions due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 may have affected athletes’ mental health outcomes and how far the process of adaptation to confinement conditions is differentially affected depending on whether the sports activity was practiced individually or in a group, and outdoors, indoors, or both. Two hundred and seventy-four athletes were assessed over 7 weeks using the GHQ-28 and an ad hoc survey exploring the practice of physical activity. A mixed-model fixed effects ANCOVA was used to analyze the effects of time, place, and company in which the sport was practiced, with an index of the amount of physical activity expended as a covariate. Results show a significant effect of time in three out of four of the GHQ-28 subscales, in all cases showing a consistent adaptation to conditions over time. Results also show that playing sport indoors, outdoors, or both, and practicing alone vs. with others differentially affect the somatic symptoms exhibited during confinement: Athletes who practiced sport with others showed higher levels of somatic symptoms at the beginning of the set of data but a quicker rate of adaptation. Differences arising from practicing sport alone or with others were more pronounced in the case of indoor sports, which could be related to the fact that physical activity that can be practiced during confinement is more similar to that practiced indoors alone. Implications relating to what sport psychologists and other health professionals may offer to athletes in stressful situations are discussed.","Rubio, Víctor J.; Sánchez-Iglesias, Iván; Bueno, Marta; Martin, Gema",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.613495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584448/,88

We sought to review the guidance around conducting remote consultations and found that while there is a large amount of information about the implementation of remote consultations at an organisation level, there is a paucity of high-quality papers considering the guidelines for online consultations alongside practical advice for their implementation at the individual level. We reviewed guidelines from reputable medical sources and generated practical advice to assist practitioners in performing safe and effective video consultation. Additionally, we noted reports in the literature of a lack of transparency and resulting confusion regarding the choice of telemedicine platforms. We therefore sought to summarise key characteristics of a number of major telemedicine platforms. We recognised a lack of clarity regarding the legal status of performing remote consultations, and reviewed advice from medicolegal sources. Finally, we address the sources of these individual uncertainties, and give recommendations on how these might be addressed systematically, so the practitioners are well trained and competent in the use of online consultations, which will inevitably play an increasingly large role in both primary and secondary care settings in the future.","Kalu, Peter; Howgego, Gregory; Sharma, Ishta",J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748681520303776?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1748681520303776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051176/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjps.2020.08.045,88

662873,Tuning intrinsic disorder predictors for virus proteins,2021-01-25,"Hepatic veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS), a potentially life-threatening complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), results from prolonged sinusoidal endothelial cell activation and profound endothelial cell damage, with sequelae. Defibrotide, the only drug approved in the United States and Europe for treating VOD/SOS post-HCT, has European Commission orphan drug designation for preventing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), associated with endothelial dysfunction. This endothelial cell protector and stabilizing agent restores thrombo-fibrinolytic balance and preserves endothelial homeostasis through antithrombotic, fibrinolytic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-adhesive activity. Defibrotide also preserves endothelial cell structure by inhibiting heparanase activity. Evidence suggests that downregulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) is key to defibrotide’s endothelial protective effects; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/AKT) potentially links defibrotide interaction with the endothelial cell membrane and downstream effects. Despite defibrotide’s being most extensively studied in VOD/SOS, emerging preclinical and clinical data support defibrotide for treating or preventing other conditions driven by endothelial cell activation, dysfunction, and/or damage, such as GvHD, transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy-associated neurotoxicity, underpinned by cytokine release syndrome and endotheliitis. Further preclinical and clinical studies will explore defibrotide’s potential utility in a broader range of disorders resulting from endothelial cell activation and dysfunction.","Richardson, Paul G.; Palomo, Marta; Kernan, Nancy A.; Hildebrandt, Gerhard C.; Chao, Nelson; Carreras, Enric",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584241/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41409-021-01383-x,88
663105,Genetic diversity in the yellow head nidovirus complex,2008-10-25,"Inferring the transmission potential of an infectious disease during the low-incidence period following an epidemic wave is crucial for preparedness. In this period, necessarily scarce data hamper existing inference methods, blurring early-warning signals essential for discriminating between the likelihoods of resurgence versus elimination. Advanced insight into whether a region of interest will face elevating caseloads (requiring swift community-wide interventions) or achieve local elimination (allowing interventions to be relaxed or refocussed on controlling the importation of infections), can be the difference between decisive and ineffective policy. We propose a novel early-warning framework that formally maximises information extracted from low-incidence data to robustly infer the chances of sustained local transmission or elimination in real time, at any desired scale of investigation. Applying this framework, we decipher previously hidden disease-transmission signals from the prolonged low-incidence COVID-19 data of New Zealand, Hong Kong and Victoria state, Australia. We uncover how timely interventions averted dangerous, resurgent waves of COVID-19 and support official declarations of elimination. Across these locations, we obtain strong evidence for the effectiveness of rapid and adaptive COVID-19 responses.","Parag, Kris V; Cowling, Benjamin J; Donnelly, Christl A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.23.20236968v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.20236968,88
663260,"Isolation and identification of bat viruses closely related to human, porcine and mink orthoreoviruses",2015-12-01,"BACKGROUND: Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are common causes of febrile illnesses in many settings in Senegal. These infections are usually managed presumptively due to lack of appropriate diagnostic tools. This situation, can lead to poor management of febrile illness or antibiotic misuse. In addition, there are limited data on the spectrum of pathogens commonly responsible for these ARI. This study was conducted to explore the pathogens community among patients with acute respiratory infection in a rural area in Senegal. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from August to December 2015. Children and adult patients attending Keur Socé health post for signs suggestive of acute respiratory infection were enrolled after providing inform consent. Eligible participants were recruited using a consecutive sampling method. Paired nose and throat swabs were collected for pathogen detection. Samples were processed using a multiplex PCR designed to identify 21 pathogens including both virus and bacteria. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty patients participated in the study. Samples positivity rate was evaluated at 95.2% (238/250). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen (74%) and was present in all months and all age-groups, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (28,8%) and rhinovirus (28,4%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected only among children under 5 years old in August and September while coronavirus was present in all age groups, during the months of October and December. CONCLUSION: This pilot study revealed a diversity of pathogens over the time and across all age groups, highlighting the need for further exploration. A pathogen community approach including both virus and bacteria at a larger scale becomes crucial for a better understanding of transmission dynamics at population level in order to help shape ARI control strategies.","Tine, Roger C.; Ndiaye, Léon A.; Niang, Mbayame N.; Kiori, Davy E.; Dia, Ndongo; Gaye, Oumar; Broutin, Hélène",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3362-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200897/,88

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a pandemic that is still ongoing worldwide. Previous pandemic influenza A virus (pH1N1) might be re-emerging through a drug-resistant mutation. We report a colorimetric viral detection method based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 endonuclease dead (dCas9) system. In this method, RNA in the viral lysate was directly recognized by the CRISPR/dCas9 system with biotin-protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-presenting oligonucleotide (PAMmer). Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase then bound to biotin-PAMmer, inducing a color change through the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. Using the developed method, we successfully identified SARS-CoV-2, pH1N1, and pH1N1/H275Y viruses by the naked eye. Moreover, the detection of viruses in human nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was demonstrated. Finally, clinical samples from COVID-19 patients led to a successful diagnosis. We anticipate that the current method can be employed for simple and accurate diagnosis of viruses.","Moon, Jeong; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Yong, Dongeun; Lee, In-Chul; Kim, Hongki; Kang, Hyunju; Lim, Eun-Kyung; Lee, Kyu-Sun; Jung, Juyeon; Park, Hyun Gyu; Kang, Taejoon",ACS Sens,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c01929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270431/,88

Due to the similarities between the symptoms of influenza and COVID-19, receiving the flu vaccine in suspicious cases can be helpful because it will make it easier to request a medical test and diagnosis. In this study, the value of influenza vaccination in the cancer population was investigated. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, all cancer patients who were referred to our clinic and had eligibility to receive the flu vaccine were included in our study for following up clinical signs every week for one month. All patients who were vaccinated from October 1 to November 15, 2020 were investigated. The most side effects that were followed were fever, runny nose, bone pain, and life-threatening or persistent adverse effects. RESULTS: From a total of 288 patients (median age: 52 years (range 18-79), 112 (38.9%) males and 176 (61.1%) female) with different types of cancers, only two patients had an adverse effect of vaccination (including bone pain, runny nose, and fatigue), and one had COVID-19 ten days after vaccination. The rest of the patients did not show any side effects due to flu vaccination after one month of follow-up.

This study was designed to contribute to the existing knowledge on how risk communication (RC) and risk perception (RP) affect protective and preventive behaviors (PPB) during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: The required data were extracted from a national online survey of Iranian adults aged 15 and older during March 15–19, 2020 (n=3213). Data analysis was performed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The study findings reveal that RC has direct and indirect positive effects on PB. Furthermore, this study also provides new evidence indicating that RP mediates the relationship between RC and PB and there is a two-way relationship between RC and RP. These interactions may have impact on risk communication strategies which should be adopted during this pandemic.

This study aimed to investigate the opinion of the Iranian people on authorities’ management during a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was conducted on 70 Iranian citizens in Shiraz to explore their opinion about the government response to the COVID-19 outbreak in February and March 2020. Based on saturation criteria, the data was collected by 1 open-end question: “What is your attitude toward the readiness of the officials and government in this epidemic?” Thematic analysis was conducted to explore themes. At the first step of the outbreak, people had critical opinions on their authorities’ management. Four themes were studied, including trust and responsiveness, policymaking during a health crisis, economic management, and epidemic management. Although the citizens’ expectation is dynamic, our study showed that there are still high demands from citizens toward the authorities, even in a new crisis that was not perceived before.

The use of molecular epidemiology to document RSV transmission in the outpatient setting has not been well described. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of two nosocomial outbreaks of RSV at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). Subjects included patients seen at the SCCA with RSV detected in two outbreaks in 2007-2008 and 2012, and all employees with respiratory viruses detected in the 2007-2008 outbreak. A subset of samples was sequenced using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the RSV attachment glycoprotein coding region. RESULTS: Fifty-one cases of RSV were identified in 2007-2008. Clustering of identical viral strains was detected in 10 (67%) of 15 patients with RSV sequenced from 2007-2008. As part of a multimodal infection control strategy implemented as a response to the outbreak, symptomatic employees had nasal washes collected. Of 254 employee samples, 91 (34%) tested positive for a respiratory virus, including 14 with RSV. In another RSV outbreak in 2012, 24 cases of RSV were identified; nine (90%) of 10 patients had the same viral strain, and 1 (10%) had another viral strain. CONCLUSIONS: We document spread of clonal strains within an outpatient cancer care setting. Infection control interventions should be implemented in outpatient, as well as inpatient, settings to reduce person-to-person transmission and limit progression of RSV outbreaks.","Chu, Helen Y.; Englund, Janet A.; Podczervinski, Sara; Kuypers, Jane; Campbell, Angela P.; Boeckh, Michael; Pergam, Steven A.; Casper, Crey",Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2014.02.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879114001475; http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083879114001475/pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879114001475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607551/,88

However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.

A major underlying cause of COVID-19 mortality is a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm in severe/critically ill patients. Although many clinical trials are testing the efficacy of targeting inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in COVID-19 patients, the critical inflammatory mediator initiating COVID-19 patient death is undefined. Here we suggest that the immunopathological pathway leading to COVID-19 mortality can be divided into three stages with distinct clinical features that can be used to guide therapeutic strategies. Our interpretation of the recently published clinical trials from COVID-19 patients suggests that the clinical efficacy in preventing COVID-19 mortality using IL-1 blockade is subjected to notable caveats, while that for IL-6 blockade is suboptimal.

Without effective medications or vaccines available, authorities turned toward mitigation measures such as use of face masks, school’s closings, shelter-in-place, telework and social distancing. People found refuge on the internet and social media apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM). The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure. A sample of convenience of messages, memes, tweets or cartoons in several languages was selected from the most popular social media outlets, i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. More than 300 FNM were identified. Descriptive statistics were used for highlighting potential relationships between variables. Content analysis determined that FNM could be divided into Health- and non-health-related types. There are several sub-types considering, but not limited to, religious beliefs, politics, economy, nutrition, behaviors, prevention of the infection, the origin of the disease and conspiracy theories. The parallel FNM pandemic affected the response from an already debilitated public health system through the confusion created in the community and the erosion in the credibility of genuine media. Public health practitioners had to face people’s unpredictable behaviors, panic, tensions with the communities and, in some cases, a hostile climate toward frontline workers. Public health practitioners must adjust ongoing and future health promotion and education interventions including plans to neutralize fake news messages.","Atehortua, Nelson A; Patino, Stella",Health Promot Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450022/; https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa140,88

OBJECTIVE: To assess demographics, comorbid conditions, and clinical factors associated with critical illness and mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a public hospital in New York City (NYC) during the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to NYC Health + Hospitals / Bellevue Hospital from March 9(th) to April 8(th), 2020. RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Primary analyses were conducted among those requiring supplemental oxygen (n = 270); half of these patients (135) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A majority were male (67.4%) and the median age was 58 years. Approximately one-third (32.6%) of hypoxic patients managed outside the ICU required non-rebreather or non-invasive ventilation. Requirement of renal replacement therapy occurred in 42.3% of ICU patients without baseline end-stage renal disease. Overall, 30-day mortality among hypoxic patients was 28.9% (53.3% in the ICU, 4.4% outside the ICU). In adjusted analyses, risk factors associated with mortality included dementia (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 2.11 95%CI 1.50–2.96), age 65 or older (aRR 1.97, 95%CI 1.31–2.95), obesity (aRR 1.37, 95%CI 1.07–1.74), and male sex (aRR 1.32, 95%CI 1.04–1.70). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 demonstrated severe morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Modifications in care delivery outside the ICU allowed the hospital to effectively care for a surge of critically ill and severely hypoxic patients.","Filardo, Thomas D.; Khan, Maria R.; Krawczyk, Noa; Galitzer, Hayley; Karmen-Tuohy, Savannah; Coffee, Megan; Schaye, Verity E.; Eckhardt, Benjamin J.; Cohen, Gabriel M.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33227019/,88

This clearly also applies to psychiatric services. The restrictions and safeguards associated with the pandemic particularly concern adherence to social distancing and medical treatment safety procedures. The implementation of these procedures is generally complicated by conditions of forensic psychiatry where, in line with demands made by courts, the treatment and isolation of mentally unwell offenders must be carefully managed. In most countries, forensic psychiatric treatment is an inpatient service where patients are kept in restricted and cramped spaces, making social distancing difficult to implement as patients participate in compulsory group therapeutic activities. As a result, it is necessary to introduce unique recommendations relating to patient safety and treatment adapted to the realities of forensic psychiatry. All this requires the implementation of additional restrictions, over and above those arising from the essential aspects of forensic psychiatry. In this paper, we present and discuss the Polish guidelines for forensic psychiatric care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, developed as a result of discussions on essential measures introduced to reduce the spread of the virus and the unique needs of the forensic patient population.","Heitzman, Janusz; Gosek, Paweł",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519542/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.576703,88

Although this question is probably a legitimate one, one should however discuss this thoroughly before deciding whether medical students are to be included in this kind of medical care on a larger scale. Various arguments should be weighted, and potential tasks should be chosen carefully. This period could however be also an opportunity for medical students to learn things they would probably never learn about. Nevertheless, medical students have a deficit concerning knowledge about epidemics, and they are also not really well skilled in many hygiene measures. Furthermore, some of the known medical students’ behaviour could be a risk factor for further spread of the virus as well. Then, young adults are at risk of getting infected themselves. Last but not least, medical students in general are under a great deal of pressure from their studies which could lead to the development of anxiety and other mental disorders. One could only speculate on the effects of this epidemic on their further mental well-being. Therefore, medical students participating in direct care of patients with COVID-19 should first be trained well, and then properly supervised at all times. Only then it might be a really useful and exceptional experience, for healthcare, medical schools as well as for society.","Bank, Ivan; Wijnen-Meijer, Marjo",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008374/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02261-8,88

However, these studies obtained data during the early phase of the pandemic and did not adjust for potential confounders, including PCR-test numbers per population (PCR-tests). Currently—more than four months after declaration of the pandemic—the BCG-hypothesis needs reexamining. An ecological study was conducted by obtaining data of 61 factors in 173 countries, including BCG vaccine coverage (%), using morbidity and mortality as outcomes, obtained from open resources. ‘Urban population (%)’ and ‘insufficient physical activity (%)’ in each country was positively associated with morbidity, but not mortality, after adjustment for PCR-tests. On the other hand, recent BCG vaccine coverage (%) was negatively associated with mortality, but not morbidity, even with adjustment for percentage of the population ≥ 60 years of age, morbidity, PCR-tests and other factors. The results of this study generated a hypothesis that a national BCG vaccination program seems to be associated with reduced mortality of COVID-19, although this needs to be further examined and proved by randomized clinical trials.","Urashima, Mitsuyoshi; Otani, Katharina; Hasegawa, Yasutaka; Akutsu, Taisuke",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32756371/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155589,88

We describe the results of a SARS-CoV-2 universal screening program at the L&D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, NY, a 545-bed public hospital serving a diverse, largely immigrant and low-income patient population and an epicenter of the global pandemic. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. All pregnant women admitted to the L&D Unit of Elmhurst Hospital from March 29, 2020 to April 22, 2020 were included for analysis. The primary outcomes of the study were: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity among universally screened pregnant women, stratified by demographic characteristics, maternal comorbidities, and delivery outcomes; and (2) Symptomatic or asymptomatic presentation at the time of testing among SARS-CoV-2 positive women. A total of 126 obstetric patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 between March 29 and April 22. Of these, 37% were positive. Of the women who tested positive, 72% were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity (unadjusted difference 24.4 percentage points, CI 7.9, 41.0) and report their primary language as Spanish (unadjusted difference 32.9 percentage points, CI 15.8, 49.9) than patients who tested negative. Conclusions In this retrospective cross-sectional study of data from a universal SARS-Cov-2 screening program implemented in the L&D unit of a safety-net hospital in Queens, New York, we found over one-third of pregnant women testing positive, the majority of those asymptomatic. The rationale for universal screening at the L&D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital was to ensure safety of patients and staff during an acute surge in SARS-Cov-2 infections through appropriate identification and isolation of pregnant women with positive test results. Women were roomed by their SARS-CoV-2 status given increasing space limitations. In addition, postpartum counseling was tailored to infection status. We quickly established discharge counseling and follow-up protocols tailored to their specific social needs. The experience at Elmhurst Hospital is instructive for other L&D units serving vulnerable populations and for pandemic preparedness.","Maru, S.; Patil, U.; Carroll-Bennett, R.; Baum, A.; Bohn-Hemmerdinger, T.; Ditchik, A.; Scanlon, M.; Krishnan, P.; Bogaert, K.; Woodbury, C.; Maru, D.; Noble, L.; Wasserman, R.; Brown, B.; Vreeman, R.; Masci, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.12.20171694; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.12.20171694v1?rss=1,88

Methods Fifty T1D patients undergoing continuous/flash glucose monitoring were recruited. The study’s primary outcome was the change of time in range (TIR) from before to lockdown period. Three time-point comparisons of TIR, mean glucose levels (MG), estimated (e)HbA1c, time above (TAR) and below range (TBR), moderate/severe hypoglycemic events between pre-lockdown, lockdown and post-lockdown period were also performed. Information on lockdown-associated perceived stress, changes of work status and physical activity were recorded. Results TIR significantly decreased (75(63-84)% vs. 69(50-76)%, p<0.001) whereas MG (154±15 mg/dl vs. 165±25 mg/dl, p=0.027) and eHbA1c (7.3(6.6-7.8)% vs. 7.5(6.7-8.2)%, p=0.031) increased from pre- to lockdown period; overall glucose control significantly improved when restriction ended. Lockdown-associated work loss/suspension independently predicted impaired TIR after adjustment for potential confounders (Standardized β:-0.29; 95%CΙ:-18.7–-2.25; p=0.01). Greater TAR, TBR and hypoglycemic events were also reported during the lockdown. Conclusion In T1D Italian individuals, blood glucose control significantly worsened during the COVID-19 lockdown; work instability and related issues represented the main determinant of impaired glucose variability in this population.","Barchetta, Ilaria; Agata Cimini, Flavia; Bertoccini, Laura; Ceccarelli, Valentina; Spaccarotella, Michele; Giorgio Baroni, Marco; Gisella Cavallo, Maria",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33075424/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108513; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168822720307701; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822720307701?v=s5,88

DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. SETTING: Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms. RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG “Most of the time” or “Strictly.” Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for; however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Callow, Daniel D.; Arnold-Nedimala, Naomi A.; Jordan, Leslie S.; Pena, Gabriel S.; Won, Junyeon; Woodard, John L.; Smith, J.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A multi-institutional networking session was hosted on Zoom and included medical students, faculty, and residents from across the country. The breakout room feature was used to divide participants into smaller groups. Participants were randomly shuffled into new groups every 10 to 15 minutes. Students completed pre- and post-session surveys. RESULTS: Among the 134 students who registered, 69 students participated in the session, and 53 students completed a post-session survey. Most students reported the session was valuable or very valuable (79%), and it was easy or very easy to network through the virtual format (66%). After the session, 18 (33.9%) students reported their interest in radiation oncology increased, and 34 (64.2%) reported their interest remained the same. Most students believed COVID-19 (55%) and virtual interviews and platforms (55%) negatively or somewhat negatively affected their ability to select a residency program. Most students (62%) were concerned they will be inaccurately evaluated as an interviewee on a virtual platform. Although 30% agreed or strongly agreed the cost-savings and convenience of virtual interviews outweigh potential downsides, 66% of students were planning to visit cities of interest in person before rank list submission. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students reported significant concerns with their ability to be accurately evaluated and to choose among residency programs on a virtual platform. Students found the networking session to be a valuable resource for most students, and programs could continue similar efforts during the residency application cycle to better represent their program while maintaining certain financial and geographic advantages of a virtual environment.","Pollom, Erqi L.; Sandhu, Navjot; Deig, Christopher R.; Obeid, Jean-Pierre; Miller, Jacob A.; Kahn, Jenna M.",Adv Radiat Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2021.100643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748546/,88

We perform a detailed structure-guided mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1, revealing insight into how it coordinates these activities against host but not viral mRNA. We find that residues in the N-terminal and central regions of nsp1 not involved in docking into the 40S mRNA entry channel nonetheless stabilize its association with the ribosome and mRNA, both enhancing its restriction of host gene expression and enabling mRNA containing the SARS-CoV-2 leader sequence to escape translational repression. These data support a model in which viral mRNA binding functionally alters the association of nsp1 with the ribosome, which has implications for drug targeting and understanding how engineered or emerging mutations in SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 could attenuate the virus.","Mendez, Aaron S.; Ly, Michael; González-Sánchez, Angélica M.; Hartenian, Ella; Ingolia, Nicholas T.; Cate, Jamie H.; Glaunsinger, Britt A.",Cell Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112472101305X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34624207/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109841; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221112472101305X,88

674126,Viral and Cellular Proteins Involved in Coronavirus Replication,2005,"Craft food and beverage makers regularly emphasize transparency about the ethical, sustainable sourcing of their ingredients and the human labour underpinning their production, all of which helps elevate the status of their products and occupational communities. Yet, as with other niche ethical consumption markets, craft industries continue to rely on employment conditions for agricultural workers that reproduce inequalities of race, class, and citizenship in the dominant food system. This paper interrogates the contradiction between the exaltation of craft cidermakers’ labour and the devaluation of farmworker labour by assessing how craft beverage actors make sense of inequalities facing manually skilled agricultural workers. Through a focus on the emerging craft cider industry, this paper draws on in-depth interviews and ethnographic data with a range of urban and rural cider actors in the Pacific Northwest (British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington State). I find that actors in the craft cider industry engage with inequalities affecting farmworkers through three main patterns: (1) Justifications of the status quo; (2) Supply chain fog; and (3) Misgiving/critique. By using an analytical framework that integrates critical agrarianism and the politics of sight, this study provides insights into both barriers and opportunities to redistribute social recognition and material rewards across food supply chains.","Weiler, Anelyse M.",Agric Human Values,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092914/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10226-w,88

We report a nucleic acid test that integrates distinct mechanisms of DNA and RNA amplification optimized for high sensitivity and rapid kinetics, linked to Cas13 detection for specificity. We paired this workflow, termed Diagnostics with Coronavirus Enzymatic Reporting (DISCoVER), with extraction-free sample lysis using shelf-stable reagents that are widely available at low cost. DISCoVER has been validated on saliva samples to incentivize frequent testing for more widespread community surveillance and robustly detected attomolar levels of SARS-CoV-2 within 30 minutes, while avoiding false positives in virus-negative saliva. Furthermore, DISCoVER is compatible with multiplexed CRISPR probes to enable simultaneous detection of a human gene control or alternative pathogens.","Agrawal, Shreeya; Fanton, Alison; Chandrasekaran, Sita S.; Prywes, Noam; Lukarska, Maria; Biering, Scott B.; Smock, Dylan C.

Stress and negative affect can lead to emotional eating, which in turn can have negative outcomes on health. In this population-based study, 24,968 Norwegian inhabitants participated in an electronic questionnaire including structured questions on dietary habits, emotional eating, psychological distress symptoms, and COVID-19-related worries. The study took place during April 2020 after around six weeks of interventions to tackle the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, emotional eating was reported in 54% of the population and was markedly more frequent in female participants. Worries related to consequences of the pandemic were associated with increased emotional eating, and the association was stronger for worries related to personal economy—odds ratios (OR) 1.7 (95% confidence interval (CI95%) 1.5–1.9)—compared to worries related to health—OR 1.3 (CI95% 1.2–1.5). Psychological distress had a strong association with emotional eating—OR 4.2 (CI95% 3.9–4.4). Correspondingly, the intake of high-sugar foods and beverages was higher for those with substantial COVID-19-related worries and those with psychological distress compared to the overall population.","Bemanian, Mitra; Mæland, Silje; Blomhoff, Rune; Rabben, Åsgeir Kjetland; Arnesen, Erik Kristoffer; Skogen, Jens Christoffer; Fadnes, Lars Thore",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375442/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010130,88

Considering COVID-19's alarming levels of spread and severity, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The first case of COVID-19 in Nepal was reported on January 23, 2020. The Government of Nepal implemented different public health measures to contain COVID-19, including border closures and a countrywide lockdown. We collected the daily data provided by the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) of the Government of Nepal and illustrated the early epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Nepal. By May 31, 2020, 1,572 cases and eight deaths were reported in Nepal associated with COVID-19. The estimate of prevalence for COVID-19 among tested populations was 2.25% (95% CI: 2.15–2.37%) and case-fatality rate was 0.5%. The majority of the cases were young males (n = 1,454, 92%), with overall average age being 30.5 years (ranging from 2 months to 81 years) and were mostly asymptomatic. There were only five cases from three districts until the end of March, but cases surged from April and spread to 57 out of 77 districts of Nepal by the end of May 2020 despite the continuous lockdown. Most of these cases are from the southern plains of Nepal, bordering India. As the effect of COVID-19 is expected to persist longer, the Government of Nepal should make appropriate strategies for loosening lockdowns in a phase-wise manner while maintaining social distancing and personal hygiene and increasing its testing, tracking, and medical capacity.","Dhakal, Santosh; Karki, Surendra",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32850929/,88

Here, we evaluate the influence of HCQ treatment on the effect of anti-PD1 tumor immunotherapy. Anti-PD1 therapy-sensitive tumor lines MC38, CT26, and RIL-175 were used to investigate the impact of HCQ on anti-PD1 therapy efficacy. In vitro assays demonstrated that HCQ directly inhibited tumor cell growth in all the tested tumor cell lines. HCQ treatment impaired both antigen-specific and nonspecific T-cell production of TNFα and IFNγ in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in all the three tumor models, HCQ treatment significantly impaired the response to anti-PD1 treatment, accompanying diminished in vivo T-cell activation and reduced tumor-infiltrating, antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. This study shows that HCQ treatment can result in immunotherapy failure due to its immunosuppressive effects that offset both increased MHC-I expression by tumor cell and direct cytotoxicity.","Wabitsch, Simon; McVey, John C.; Ma, Chi; Ruf, Benjamin; Kamenyeva, Olena; McCallen, Justin D.; Diggs, Laurence P.; Heinrich, Bernd; Greten, Tim F.",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490900/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101990,88

These patients are the sickest of all patients in any critical care unit and will invariably have a prolonged course and rehabilitation. Spontaneous breathing and early mobilization can reduce the intensive care unit (ICU)–acquired weakness, improve functional recovery, and reduce superadded infections and length of stay in the hospital, thus decreasing the cost of treatment. In low socioeconomic countries, there is an associated challenge of the availability of specially trained personnel necessary to manage patients on ECMO. Managing and ambulating an awake patient on ECMO is very labour-intensive and poses various challenges. Every ECMO program should aim to develop goals, methods, and protocols to this end. These can be derived from best practices worldwide by suitably adapting to available personnel and equipment. In this review, we aim to highlight the advantages and associated challenges of awake ECMO and describe protocols to aid safe ambulation and physiotherapy for ECMO patients.

680226,Novel viral translation strategies,2014-07-08,"The study of metabolic deregulation in myeloid malignancies has led to the investigation of metabolic-targeted therapies considering that cells undergoing leukemic transformation have excessive energy demands for growth and proliferation. However, the most difficult challenge in agents targeting metabolism is to determine a window of therapeutic opportunities between normal and neoplastic cells, considering that all or most of the metabolic pathways important for cancer ontogeny may also regulate physiological cell functions. Targeted therapies have used the properties of leukemic cells to produce altered metabolic products when mutated. This is the case of IDH1/2 mutations generating the abnormal conversion of α-ketoglutarate (KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite inhibiting KG-dependent enzymes, such as the TET family of genes (pivotal in characterizing leukemia cells either by mutations, e.g., TET2, or by altered expression, e.g., TET1/2/3). Additional observations derive from the high sensitivity of leukemic cells to oxidative phosphorylation and its amelioration using BCL-2 inhibitors (Venetoclax) or by disrupting the mitochondrial respiration. More recently, nicotinamide metabolism has been described to mediate resistance to Venetoclax in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

People who have social contacts with COVID-19 patients might be at higher risk of physical or mental health problems. This study investigated whether people who had social contacts with COVID-19 patients would have poorer physical or mental outcomes, and different attitudes and behaviors. Chinese adults were recruited to fill in an online survey using snowball sampling during 21(st)-26(nd) February 2020. Physical symptoms, psychological outcomes, quality of life, COVID-19 related attitudes, and behaviors were measured. The differences in the outcomes between participants who had COVID-19 social contacts and those who had not were analyzed. The survey included 1,447 non-infected eligible participants. Among those, 173 (12.0%) reported at least one confirmed/suspected case in their social contacts. In the multiple regression adjusted for demographic data, the presence of confirmed/suspected infection cases in one’s social contacts was significantly associated with poorer physical and mental outcomes, lower health-related quality of life, and different COVID-19 related attitudes and behaviors (p<0.05). In conclusion, people who had social contacts with COVID-19 patients were at risk of adverse health outcomes. Future studies are needed to understand the long-term impacts.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, observational study conducted in a pediatric intensive and high-dependency care unit (PICU, HDU) in an urban hospital in Paris. All patients, aged from 1 month to 18 years, admitted for confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 were included. RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 27 children. Comorbidities (n = 19, 70 %) were mainly neurological (n = 7), respiratory, (n = 4), or sickle cell disease (n = 4). SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were positive in 24 children (nasopharyngeal swabs). The three remaining children had a chest CT scan consistent with COVID-19. Respiratory involvement was observed in 24 patients (89%). Supportive treatments were invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 9), catecholamine (n = 4), erythropheresis (n = 4), renal replacement therapy (n = 1), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 1). Five children died, of whom three were without past medical history. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the large spectrum of clinical presentation and time course of disease progression as well as the non-negligible occurrence of pediatric life-threatening and fatal cases of COVID-19 mostly in patients with comorbidities.

Many other organisms rely instead on RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by a specialized Dicer protein that cleaves viral double-stranded RNA. Whether RNAi also contributes to mammalian antiviral immunity remains controversial. We identified an isoform of Dicer, named antiviral Dicer (aviD), that protects tissue stem cells from RNA viruses-including Zika virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-by dicing viral double-stranded RNA to orchestrate antiviral RNAi. Our work sheds light on the molecular regulation of antiviral RNAi in mammalian innate immunity, in which different cell-intrinsic antiviral pathways can be tailored to the differentiation status of cells.","Poirier, Enzo Z; Buck, Michael D; Chakravarty, Probir; Carvalho, Joana; Frederico, Bruno; Cardoso, Ana; Healy, Lyn; Ulferts, Rachel; Beale, Rupert; Reis E Sousa, Caetano",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg2264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34244417/,88
682831,Antiviral activity of itraconazole against type I feline coronavirus infection,2019-01-18,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 may cause severe pneumonitis and trigger a massive inflammatory response that requires ventilatory support. The intensive care unit (ICU)-mortality has been reported to be as high as 62%. Dexamethasone is the only of all anti-inflammatory drugs that have been tested to date that has shown a positive effect on mortality. We aim to explore if treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is safe and effective for patients with severe COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that HBO can prevent ICU admission, morbidity and mortality by attenuating the inflammatory response. The primary objective is to evaluate if HBO reduces the number of ICU admissions compared with best practice treatment for COVID-19, main secondary objectives are to evaluate if HBO reduces the load on ICU resources, morbidity and mortality and to evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised, controlled, phase II, open label, multicentre trial. 200 subjects with severe COVID-19 and at least two risk factors for mortality will be included. Baseline clinical data and blood samples will be collected before randomisation and repeated daily for 7 days, at days 14 and 30. Subjects will be randomised with a computer-based system to HBO, maximum five times during the first 7 days plus best practice treatment or only best practice treatment. The primary endpoint, ICU admission, is defined by criteria for selection for ICU. We will evaluate if HBO mitigates the inflammatory reaction in COVID-19 using molecular analyses. All parameters are recorded in an electronic case report form. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will review the safety parameters. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial is approved by The National Institutional Review Board in Sweden (2020-01705) and the Swedish Medical Product Agency (5.1-2020-36673).

Studies on the COVID-19 pandemic mainly focus on individual psychological consequences, such as anxiety, depression or stress. The presented study added a family context to psychological analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescence. We examined the mediational effects of closeness to parents and perceived pandemic-related threats to relationships between personality (emotional stability and agreeableness) and stress in adolescents. Methods: in total, 413 students from secondary schools in southern Poland completed questionnaires measuring stress, personality, closeness to parents and experiencing threats with COVID-19. Results: the results demonstrated that closeness with parents in conjunction with experiencing family-related threats and threats related to lifestyle changes were mediators between adolescent personality traits and the intensity of the stress experienced.

Conclusion: Challenges to HCW education in north west Syria can be broadly divided into 1. Organisational (local healthcare leadership and governance, coordination and collaboration between stakeholders, competition between stakeholders and insufficient funding.) 2. Programmatic (lack of accreditation or recognition of qualifications, insufficient physical space for teaching, exodus of faculty affecting teaching and training, prioritisation of physicians over non-physicians, informally trained healthcare workers.) 3.

The efficacy of thiopurine in IBD was first reported in the late 1960s. Thiopurines are used to alleviate the symptoms of IBD, especially UC. These drugs have a steroid-sparing potential and are widely used for the purpose of maintaining long-term remission in steroid-dependent cases. Therefore, thiopurines tend to be used long-term, but adverse events that accompany long-term use, such as lymphoproliferative disorders, must be monitored with care. In contrast, thiopurine plays a critical role in controlling the immunogenicity of biologics. Furthermore, although thiopurine is an old drug, new findings, including the prediction of serious adverse events such as severe alopecia and acute advanced leukopenia, by nudix hydrolase 15 gene polymorphism analysis, as well as the possibility of appropriate drug monitoring by detailed analysis of 6-thioguanine nucleotides have been clarified. However, the consequences of thiopurine withdrawal have not been determined and further studies, including randomized controlled trials, are necessary to answer the clinical question regarding the scenarios in which thiopurine withdrawal is possible.","Tominaga, Keiichi; Sugaya, Takeshi; Tanaka, Takanao; Kanazawa, Mimari; Iijima, Makoto; Irisawa, Atsushi",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584261/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.582291,88
683774,“Antigen Camouflage and Decoy” Strategy to Overcome Interference From Maternally Derived Antibody With Newcastle Disease Virus-Vectored Vaccines: More Than a Simple Combination,2021-08-27,"PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to investigate the association between suicide and Lyme and associated diseases (LAD). No journal article has previously performed a comprehensive assessment of this subject. INTRODUCTION: Multiple case reports and other references demonstrate a causal association between suicidal risk and LAD. Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers and veterans, both with greater LAD exposure. Multiple studies demonstrate many infections and the associated proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory-mediated metabolic changes, and quinolinic acid and glutamate changes alter neural circuits which increase suicidality. A similar pathophysiology occurs in LAD. METHOD: A retrospective chart review and epidemiological calculations were performed. RESULTS: LAD contributed to suicidality, and sometimes homicidality, in individuals who were not suicidal before infection. A higher level of risk to self and others is associated with multiple symptoms developing after acquiring LAD, in particular, explosive anger, intrusive images, sudden mood swings, paranoia, dissociative episodes, hallucinations, disinhibition, panic disorder, rapid cycling bipolar, depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, substance abuse, hypervigilance, generalized anxiety disorder, genital–urinary symptoms, chronic pain, anhedonia, depression, low frustration tolerance, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Negative attitudes about LAD from family, friends, doctors, and the health care system may also contribute to suicide risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over 1,200 LAD suicides in the US per year. CONCLUSION: Suicidality seen in LAD contributes to causing a significant number of previously unexplained suicides and is associated with immune-mediated and metabolic changes resulting in psychiatric and other symptoms which are possibly intensified by negative attitudes about LAD from others. Some LAD suicides are associated with being overwhelmed by multiple debilitating symptoms, and others are impulsive, bizarre, and unpredictable. Greater understanding and a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed. It is suggested that medical examiners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other epidemiological organizations proactively evaluate the association between LAD and suicide.","Bransfield, Robert C",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670127/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s136137,88
684255,Interaction of coronavirus nucleocapsid protein with the 5′‐ and 3′‐ends of the coronavirus genome is involved in genome circularization and negative‐strand RNA synthesis,2019-05-08,"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the number of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the United States has exponentially increased. Identifying and monitoring individuals with COVID-19 and individuals who have been exposed to the disease is critical to prevent transmission. Traditional contact tracing mechanisms are not structured on the scale needed to address this pandemic. As businesses reopen, institutions and agencies not traditionally engaged in disease prevention are being tasked with ensuring public safety. Systems to support organizations facing these new challenges are critically needed. Most currently available symptom trackers use a direct-to-consumer approach and use personal identifiers, which raises privacy concerns. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a monitoring and reporting system for COVID-19 to support institutions conducting monitoring activities without compromising privacy. METHODS: Our multidisciplinary team designed a symptom tracking system after consultation with experts. The system was designed in the Georgetown University AvesTerra knowledge management environment, which supports data integration and synthesis to identify actionable events and maintain privacy. We conducted a beta test for functionality among consenting Georgetown University medical students. RESULTS: The symptom tracker system was designed based on guiding principles developed during peer consultations. Institutions are provided access to the system through an efficient onboarding process that uses clickwrap technology to document agreement to limited terms of use to rapidly enable free access. Institutions provide their constituents with a unique identifier to enter data through a web-based user interface to collect vetted symptoms as well as clinical and epidemiologic data. The website also provides individuals with educational information through links to the COVID-19 prevention recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Safety features include instructions for people with new or worsening symptoms to seek care. No personal identifiers are collected in the system. The reporter mechanism safeguards data access so that institutions can only access their own data, and it provides institutions with on-demand access to the data entered by their constituents, organized in summary reports that highlight actionable data. Development of the system began on March 15, 2020, and it was launched on March 20, 2020. In the beta test, 48 Georgetown University School of Medicine students or their social contacts entered data into the system from March 31 to April 5, 2020. One of the 48 users (2%) reported active COVID-19 infection and had no symptoms by the end of the monitoring period. No other participants reported symptoms. Only data with the unique entity identifier for our beta test were generated in our summary reports. CONCLUSIONS: This system harnesses insights into privacy and data sharing to avoid regulatory and legal hurdles to rapid adaption by entities tasked with maintaining public safety. Our pilot study demonstrated feasibility and ease of use. Refinements based on feedback from early adapters included release of a Spanish language version. These systems provide technological advances to complement the traditional contact tracing and digital tracing applications being implemented to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission during reopening.","Kassaye, Seble G; Spence, Amanda Blair; Lau, Edwin; Bridgeland, David M; Cederholm, John; Dimolitsas, Spiros; Smart, JC",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/19399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32788148/,88

Critically, successful adaptation helps to reduce such symptoms to baseline, preventing long-term psychiatric disorders. It is thus important to understand whether and which psychiatric symptoms show transient elevations, and which persist long-term and become chronically heightened. At particular risk for the latter trajectory are symptom dimensions directly affected by the pandemic, such as obsessive–compulsive (OC) symptoms. In this longitudinal large-scale study (N = 406), we assessed how OC, anxiety and depression symptoms changed throughout the first pandemic wave in a sample of the general UK public. We further examined how these symptoms affected pandemic-related information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines. We show that scores in all psychiatric domains were initially elevated, but showed distinct longitudinal change patterns. Depression scores decreased, and anxiety plateaued during the first pandemic wave, while OC symptoms further increased, even after the ease of Covid-19 restrictions. These OC symptoms were directly linked to Covid-related information seeking, which gave rise to higher adherence to government guidelines. This increase of OC symptoms in this non-clinical sample shows that the domain is disproportionately affected by the pandemic. We discuss the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public mental health, which calls for continued close observation of symptom development.","Loosen, Alisa M.; Skvortsova, Vasilisa; Hauser, Tobias U.",Transl Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01410-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34021112/,88

The COVID-19 pandemic is a massive health crisis which has brought enormous physical and psychological pressure. Mental health care for health care workers (HCWs), should receive serious consideration. The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes of HCWs and to examine known predictors of outcomes during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: 1,556 HCWs who participated in the COVID-19 IMPACT project, an international online survey examining the behavioral and psychological impacts of COVID-19 among 9,565 people from 78 countries/regions and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression symptoms and sleep changes. Predictors examined included sociodemographic factors, and perceived social support. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that, half of the HCWs had moderate levels of perceived stress and depression symptoms. Predictors associated with higher HCWs’ stress and depression symptoms included female gender, not having children, living with parents, lower educational background and having lower social support. Half of the HCWs (n = 800, 51.4%) continued to sleep about the same and one in four slept more or slept less. Positive predictors of sleep changes were being older, widower, not working, living with parents, and having children. Surprisingly, HCWs had less perceived stress and depression and higher levels of perceived social support than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The need for establishing ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust psychological intervention and support of HCWs, seems to be significant as the pandemic continues.

This paper describes the third wave of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during July‐August 2020. METHODS: Adults (N = 2025) who participated in the baseline and/or first follow‐up surveys were reinvited to participate in this survey, which assessed: (1) COVID‐19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental disorders; as well as the role of (3) psychological factors and (4) social and political attitudes, in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure that the cross‐sectional sample is nationally representative in terms of gender, age, and household income, and representative of the baseline sample characteristics for household composition, ethnicity, urbanicity and born/raised in UK. RESULTS: 1166 adults (57.6% of baseline participants) provided full interviews at Wave 3. The raking procedure successfully re‐balanced the cross‐sectional sample to within 1% of population estimates across selected socio‐demographic characteristics. CONCLUSION: This paper demonstrates the strength of the C19PRC Study data to facilitate and stimulate interdisciplinary research addressing important public health questions relating to the COVID‐19 pandemic.","McBride, Orla; Butter, Sarah; Murphy, Jamie; Shevlin, Mark; Hartman, Todd K.; Hyland, Philip; McKay, Ryan; Bennett, Kate M.; Gibson‐Miller, Jilly; Levita, Liat; Mason, Liam; Martinez, Anton P.; Stocks, Thomas VA; Vallières, Frédérique; Karatzias, Thanos; Valiente, Carmen; Vazquez, Carmelo; Bentall, Richard P.",Int J Methods Psychiatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34021946/; https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1880,88

Nurses are providing care to patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization. To ensure adequate response capacity and to maintain the health of nurses at risk of infection, it is important to analyse the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours per shift among frontline nurses. Objective To analyse the actual work hours and preferred work hours per shift of nurses reports among frontline nurses fighting the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the influencing factors on the nurses reported preferred work hours. Design Cross-sectional survey Setting(s) This study was conducted in 10 designated hospitals providing treatments to patients with COVID-19 in China. Participants Nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19 in designated hospitals in China. Methods A self-designed questionnaire with open-ended questions was used to assess frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 cases in 10 designated hospitals. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyse the actual work hours, the nurses reported preferred work hours and factors influencing nurses reported preferred work hours among the frontline nurses. Results A total of 109 nurses responded to the survey. The actual work hours per shift among frontline nurses were exceeded the nurses reported preferred work hours [Median (interquartile range): 5.00(2.00) h vs 4.00 (2.00)h; Minmum-Maxmum: 4-12 h vs 4-8 h], and 60.55% (66/109) of the nurses regarded 4 h as the preferred number of work hours per shift. Five key themes associated with the influencing factors emerged, including circumstances, personal preventable equipment, the physical and emotional needs of nurse, the safety needs of nurse and work intensity. Conclusions These findings suggest that there is a gap between the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours among frontline nurses in different units and different posts. The main influencing factors were circumstances, personal preventable equipment, the physical and emotional needs of nurse, the safety needs of nurse and work intensity.","Zhang, Xia; Jiang, Zhixia; Yuan, Xiaoli; Wang, Ying; Huang, Di; Hu, Rujun; Zhou, Jiamei; Chen, Fang",Int J Nurs Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425239/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002074892030119X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103635; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002074892030119X?v=s5,88

This study aimed to investigate the reasons underlying people’s willingness to get vaccinated in a sample of Italian adults, considering the effects of different individual characteristics and psychological variables upon positive vs. negative/hesitant vaccination intentions, as well as subjects’ self-reported motivations for such intentions. An anonymous cross-sectional survey was distributed online in February 2021. The results showed that trust in science, number of vaccinations received in 2019, and belief that COVID-19 is more severe than the common flu, were associated with positive vaccination intentions. “Chance externality” health locus of control showed both direct and indirect effects upon positive vaccination intentions. Anxiety symptoms and participants’ perceived psychological status also showed indirect positive effects. Subjects’ self-reported motivations varied interestingly across positive vs. negative/hesitant intentions. Implications of these findings for identifying effective pro-vaccination messages are discussed in the final section of the paper.","Giuliani, Mattia; Ichino, Anna; Bonomi, Alice; Martoni, Riccardo; Cammino, Stefania; Gorini, Alessandra",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451935/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080810,88

The significant growth of the fair trade (FT) movement in the last decades draws attention to ethical consumption. FT’s aim at improving the livelihoods of producers in developing countries and promotion of social change is considered a model that shows the benefits of trade to development. Although conveying a large number of publications, not all questions about the movement are explored. The literature is prolific on coffee, cacao, flowers, wine, and gold. In contrast, the engagement with staple foods – a prominent globally traded food category – seems minor. The primary objective of this review was to map the existing literature about FT and staple foods; then, to investigate the role of staple foods in the FT movement. The search strategy was designed to retrieve publications on the intersection of FT and staple foods. To date, there is no review about FT and staple foods nexus. Our systematic review addressed this gap considering FT as an alternative capable of addressing unsustainable food consumption and production impacts. Our research protocol included keywords searching across four databases, screening, and comparative analysis. From 283 documents retrieved, 49 were deemed relevant to reflect the role of staple foods in the FT movement. This systematic review discusses challenges and opportunities for the FT model to further engage with staples and recommends improvement of its environmental credentials.

The recent intense focus on this application of chloroquine stimulated an investigation into the effects of chloroquine at low doses on highly biologically-diverse models and whether it may induce hormetic-biphasic dose response effects. The assessment revealed that hormetic effects have been commonly induced by chloroquine, affecting numerous cell types, including tumor cell lines (e.g. human breast and colon) and non-tumor cell lines, enhancing viral replication, sperm motility, various behavioral endpoints as well as decreasing risks of convulsions, and enhancing a spectrum of neuroprotective responses within a preconditioning experimental framework. These diverse and complex findings indicate that hormetic dose responses commonly occur with chloroquine treatment with a range of biological models and endpoints. These findings have implications concerning study design features including the number and spacing of doses, and suggest a range of possible clinical concerns and opportunities depending on the endpoint considered.","Calabrese, Edward J.; Hanekamp, Jaap C.; Hanekamp, Yannic N.; Kapoor, Rachna; Dhawan, Gaurav; Agathokleous, Evgenios",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720359659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017762/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142436; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720359659?v=s5,88

688033,Detection of Signature Sequences in Overlapping Genes and Prediction of a Novel Overlapping Gene in Hepatitis G Virus,2000,"Little is known about associations between depression and serum heavy metal levels, dietary vitamin intakes. Thus, we sought to determine the nature of these associations and to predict risks of depression using marginal effects. A data set of 16,371 individuals aged ≥10 years that participated in Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) conducted from 2009 to 2017 (excluding 2014 and 2015) was used to obtain information on sociodemographics, family histories, lifestyles, serum heavy metal levels, food intakes, and depression. Serum cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) levels were analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and mercury (Hg) levels using a mercury analyzer. Daily vitamin intakes were calculated by 24-h dietary recall. The results obtained showed that females are at higher risk of depression than males. A doubling of serum Cd was associated with a 21% increase in depression (AOR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07–1.37, p = 0.002), whereas twofold increases in daily vitamin B1, B3 and vitamin A intakes reduced the risk of depression by 17% (0.83, 95% CI: 0.73–0.95, p = 0.005), 20% (0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.91, p = 0.001), and 8% (0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99, p = 0.020), respectively. Interactions between heavy metals, vitamin intakes, and sex did not influence the risk of depression. The result shows that increased daily dietary vitamin intake might protect the public against depression. Further studies are needed to reduce the risks posed by heavy metals and to determine more comprehensively the effects of daily dietary vitamin intake on depression.","Nguyen, Hai Duc; Oh, Hojin; Hoang, Ngoc Hong Minh; Jo, Won Hee; Kim, Min-Sun",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414543/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15986-w,88

In this study, we analyzed trends in febrile seizures and viral infection in Korean children, using big data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). METHODS: We analyzed children younger than 6 years who visited the hospital and were diagnosed with febrile seizures from 2009 to 2016, using medical records in the HIRA database. A total of 666,136 medical records of children with a main or subdiagnosis of febrile seizure from 2008 to 2016 were included. Of these records, patients younger than 1 month and records before 2009 were excluded. Finally, 558,130 records were extracted. RESULTS: The medical records included 315,774 male children and 242,356 (43.4%) female children, with a mean age of 2.31 ± 1.31 years. The annual incidence of febrile seizure was 25.4 per 1000 person-years (27.9 for boys and 22.7 for girls). The ratio of male to female children was 1.30: 1, and records of 1-year-old children comprised the highest proportion (n = 210,400, 33.70%). The total monthly number of patients was highest in May (n = 64,969, 11.6%), and peaks were formed from April to July. The fewest patients were seen in October (n = 34,424, 6.17%).

The G-form is both more infectious in vitro and associated with increased viral loads in infected people. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying these distinctive characteristics, we employed multiple replicas of microsecond all-atom simulations to probe the molecular-level impact of this substitution on Spike closed and open states. The open state enables Spike interactions with its human cellular receptor, ACE2. Here we show that changes in the inter-protomer energetics due to the D614G substitution favor a higher population of infection-capable (open) states. The inter-protomer interactions between S1 and S2 subunits in the open state of the D-form are asymmetric. This asymmetry is resolved in the G-form due to the release of tensile hydrogen bonds resulting in an increased population of open conformations. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive due to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies.","Mansbach, Rachael A; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Nguyen, Kien; Montefiori, David; Korber, Bette; Gnanakaran, S",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.26.219741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32743581/,88

It serves as a natural experiment to explore changes in presentations for surgical diseases including acute appendicitis. The objective was to determine if the pandemic was associated with changes in incidence of acute appendicitis compared to a historical control and to determine if there were associated changes in disease severity. METHODS: The study is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of adults (N = 956) presenting with appendicitis in nonpandemic versus pandemic time periods (December 1, 2019–March 10, 2020 versus March 11, 2020–May 16, 2020). Corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 composed the historical control. Primary outcome was mean biweekly counts of all appendicitis presentations, then stratified by complicated (n = 209) and uncomplicated (n = 747) disease. Trends in presentations were compared using difference-in-differences methodology. Changes in odds of presenting with complicated disease were assessed via clustered multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: There was a 29% decrease in mean biweekly appendicitis presentations from 5.4 to 3.8 (rate ratio = 0.71 [0.51, 0.98]) after the pandemic declaration, with a significant difference in differences compared with historical control (P = .003). Stratified by severity, the decrease was significant for uncomplicated appendicitis (rate ratio = 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.47–0.91]) when compared with historical control (P = .03) but not for complicated appendicitis (rate ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.52–1.52]); (P = .49). The odds of presenting with complicated disease did not change (adjusted odds ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 0.83–2.25]). CONCLUSION: The pandemic was associated with decreased incidence of uncomplicated appendicitis without an accompanying increase in complicated disease. Changes in individual health care–use behaviors may underlie these differences, suggesting that some cases of uncomplicated appendicitis may resolve without progression to complicated disease.","Neufeld, Miriam Y.; Bauerle, Wayne; Eriksson, Evert; Azar, Faris K.; Evans, Heather L.; Johnson, Meredith; Lawless, Ryan A.; Lottenberg, Lawrence; Sanchez, Sabrina E.; Simianu, Vlad V.; Thomas, Christopher S.; Drake, F.
