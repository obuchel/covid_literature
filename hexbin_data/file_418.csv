151,151,151,Preliminary Findings of a Randomized Trial of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions to Prevent Influenza Transmission in Households,14.881084,4.109846,2008-05-07,"BACKGROUND: There are sparse data on whether non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the spread of influenza. We implemented a study of the feasibility and efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene to reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households (composed of at least 3 members) where an index subject presented with influenza-like-illness of <48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) surgical face masks or 3) hand hygiene. Households were visited within 36 hours, and 3, 6 and 9 days later. Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture. The primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza (by self-reported symptoms). We randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6%. Clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5% to 18% depending on case definitions. The laboratory-based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms. Adherence to interventions was variable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The secondary attack ratios were lower than anticipated, and lower than reported in other countries, perhaps due to differing patterns of susceptibility, lack of significant antigenic drift in circulating influenza virus strains recently, and/or issues related to the symptomatic recruitment design. Lessons learnt from this pilot have informed changes for the main study in 2008.

Late Presenters, Very Late Presenters and AIDS presenters still represent, also in Europe, including Italy, a huge challenge in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old male with a history of fever and back pain. HIV test resulted positive with a high HIV Viral Load and a very low T-CD4 number of cells (5 cells/mm(3)). Imaging investigations revealed multiple vertebral and pulmonary lesions together with abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy. Blood cultures were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans and for Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lymphnode biopsy resulted positive in PCR for Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacteria (Mycobacterium chelonae). A gastric biopsy also revealed a GIST. The patient also had CMV DNA positive. Although we performed antiretroviral therapy and specific-therapies for each disease, he was transferred to intensive care unit where he died due to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. CONCLUSION: The reported case is unusual due to the relevant number of opportunistic diseases (both infectious and tumoral) emerging not long after the HIV infection had been diagnosed. Late presenters HIV patients and AIDS presenters still represent a challenge, which is often too complex for clinicians to deal with. In spite of proper management, the risk of suboptimal results cannot be excluded.

An effective and affordable HBV control model is urgently needed. A national project of Community-based Collaborative Innovation HBV (CCI-HBV) demonstration areas has optimized the existing community healthcare resources and obtained initial results in HBV control. METHODS: Based on the existing community healthcare network, CCI-HBV project combined the community health management and health contract signing service for long-staying residents in hepatitis B screening. Moreover, HBV field research strategy was popularized in CCI-HBV areas. After screening, patients with seropositive results were enrolled in corresponding cohorts and received treatment at an early stage. And the uninfected people received medical supports including health education through new media, behavior intervention and HBV vaccinations. In this process, a cloud-based National Information Platform (NIP) was established to collect and store residents’ epidemiological data. In addition, a special quality control team was set up for CCI project. RESULTS: After two rounds of screening, HBsAg positive rate dropped from 5.05% (with 5,173,003 people screened) to 4.57% (with 3,819,675 people screened), while the rate of new HBV infections was 0.28 per 100 person-years in the fixed cohorts of 2,584,322 people. The quality control team completed PPS sampling simultaneously and established the serum sample database with 2,800,000 serum samples for unified testing. CONCLUSIONS: CCI-HBV project has established a large-scale field research to conduct whole-population screening and intervention. We analyzed the HBsAg prevalence and new infection rate of HBV in the fixed population for the epidemic trend and intervention effect. The purpose of CCI-HBV project is to establish and evaluate a practical model of grid management and field strategy, to realize the new goal to control hepatitis B in China. To provide policymakers with a feasible model, our results are directly applicable.

Diseases like influenza, enteric fever and rickettsial fevers account for majority of such outbreaks. Optimal diagnostic tests to inform treatment decisions are not available at the point-of-care. A proper epidemiological and clinical characterization of such outbreaks is important for appropriate treatment and control efforts. METHODS: An investigation was initiated as a response to increased presentation of patients at Patan Hospital from Chalnakhel locality in Dakchinkali municipality, Kathmandu with AUFI from June 10 to July 1, 2016. Focused group discussion with local inhabitants and the epidemiological curve of febrile patients at local primary health care centre confirmed the outbreak. The household-survey was conducted in the area with questionnaire administered on patients to characterize their illnesses and their medical records were reviewed. A different set of questionnaire was administered on the patients and controls to investigate the association with common risk factors. Water samples were collected and analyzed microbiologically. RESULTS: Eighty one patients from 137 households suffered from febrile illness within 6 weeks window before the investigation. All the 67 sampled patients with acute fever had a generalized illness without a discernible focus of infection. Only 38% of the patients had received a clinical diagnosis while the rest were treated empirically without a diagnosis. Three patients had blood culture confirmed enteric fever. Forty-two (63%) patients had been administered antibiotics, most commonly, ofloxacin, cefixime or azithromycin with a mean fever clearance time of 4 days. There was no definite association between several risk factors and fever. Fecal contamination was noted in tap water samples. CONCLUSION: Based on the pattern of illness, this outbreak was most likely a mixture of self-limiting viral infections and enteric fever. This study shows that even in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis, a detailed characterization of the illness at presentation and the recovery course can suggest the diagnosis and help in formulating appropriate recommendation for treatment and control.","Pokharel, Sunil; Karki, Manan; Acharya, Bhim; Marasini, Baburam; Arjyal, Amit",BMC Infect Dis,418,3

To study a potential impact of the O-acetyl group on the overall conformation of the carbohydrate chain, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of oligosaccharide chain fragments of increasing length starting from the non-reducing end have been carried out for the first time in this study. They revealed a considerable loss in chain flexibility after addition of the internal N-acetylneuraminic acid onto the chain. Besides MD calculations with different dielectric constants, the conformational behaviour of the complete oligosaccharide chain of the 9-O-acetylated G(D1a) ganglioside was simulated in the solvents water and dimethyl sulfoxide. These solvents were also used in NMR measurements. The results of this study indicate that 9-O-acetylation at the terminal sialic acid does not influence the overall conformation of the ganglioside. An extended interaction analysis of energetically minimized conformations of G(D1a) ((e)Neu5,9Ac(2)) and G(D1a), obtained during molecular dynamics simulations, allowed assessment of the influence of the different parts of the saccharide chains on spatial flexibility. Noteworthy energetic interactions, most interestingly between the 9-O-acetyl group and the pyranose ring of N-acetylgalactosamine, were ascertained by the calculations. However, the strength of this interaction does not force the ganglioside into a conformation, where the 9-O-acetyl group is no longer accessible. Binding of G(D1a) ((e)Neu5,9Ac(2)) to proteins, which are specific for 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, should thus at least partially be mediated by the presence of this group. To experimentally prove this assumption, a NMR study of 9-O-acetylated G(D1a) in the presence of an affinitypurified polyclonal IgG fraction from human serum with preferential binding to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid was performed. The almost complete disappearance of the intensity of the 9-O-acetyl methyl signal of the G(D1a) (clearly indicates that the assumed interaction of the 9-O-acetyl group with the human protein takes place.","Siebert, Hans-Christian; von der Lieth, Claus-Wilhelm; Dong, Xin; Reuter, Gerd; Schauer, Roland; Gabius, Hans-Joachim; Vliegenthart, Johannes F.G.",Glycobiology,418,17

Our aim was to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative assessment of rectal/throat ESBL-E carriage can predict ESBL-E-associated VAP in medical ICU patients. METHODS: From May 2014 to May 2017, all ESBL-E carriers had a semi-quantitative assessment of ESBL-E density in swabs cultures. For those who developed GNB-VAP (diagnosed using bronchoalveolar lavage or plugged telescopic catheter with significant quantitative culture), the last positive swab collected at least 48 h before GNB-VAP onset was selected. Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively collected database. RESULTS: Among 365 ESBL-E carriers, 82 developed 107 episodes of GNB-VAP (ESBL-E VAP, n = 50; and non-ESBL-E GNB-VAP, n = 57) after 13 days of mechanical ventilation in median. Antimicrobials use before VAP onset was similar between groups. The last swabs were collected 5 days in median before VAP onset. ESBL-E. coli carriers developed ESBL-E VAP less frequently (n = 13, 34%) than others (n = 32, 67.3%, p < .01). Throat swab positivity (39 (78%) vs. 12 (23%), p < .01) was more frequent for ESBL-E VAP. ESBL-E VAP was associated with significantly higher ESBL-E density in rectal swabs. In multivariate models, non-E. coli ESBL-E carriage and rectal ESBL-E carriage density, or throat carriage, remained associated with ESBL-E VAP. CONCLUSION: In carriers of ESBL-E other than E. coli, ESBL-E throat carriage or a high-density ESBL-E rectal carriage are risk factors of ESBL-E VAP in case of GNB-VAP.

However, the successful pregnancy and foaling rates obtained after ICSI are only 10% of the oocytes matured in vitro. Conditions used for oocyte in vitro maturation are not optimized for equine oocytes. Hence, in the present work, we aimed to elucidate the major metabolites present in equine preovulatory follicular fluid obtained from postmortem mares using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR). Twenty-two metabolites were identified; among these, nine of them are not included in the composition of in vitro maturation media. Hence, our data suggest that the currently used media for equine oocyte maturation can be further improved. ABSTRACT: Production of equine embryos in vitro is currently a commercial technique and a reliable way of obtaining offspring. In order to produce those embryos, immature oocytes are retrieved from postmortem ovaries or live mares by ovum pick-up (OPU), matured in vitro (IVM), fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and cultured until day 8–10 of development. However, at best, roughly 10% of the oocytes matured in vitro and followed by ICSI end up in successful pregnancy and foaling, and this could be due to suboptimal IVM conditions. Hence, in the present work, we aimed to elucidate the major metabolites present in equine preovulatory follicular fluid (FF) obtained from postmortem mares using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR). The results were contrasted against the composition of the most commonly used media for equine oocyte IVM: tissue culture medium 199 (TCM-199) and Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium/nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F-12). Twenty-two metabolites were identified in equine FF; among these, nine of them are not included in the composition of DMEM/F-12 or TCM-199 media, including (mean ± SEM): acetylcarnitine (0.37 ± 0.2 mM), carnitine (0.09 ± 0.01 mM), citrate (0.4 ± 0.04 mM), creatine (0.36 ± 0.14 mM), creatine phosphate (0.36 ± 0.05 mM), fumarate (0.05 ± 0.007 mM), glucose-1-phosphate (6.9 ± 0.4 mM), histamine (0.25 ± 0.01 mM), or lactate (27.3 ± 2.2 mM). Besides, the mean concentration of core metabolites such as glucose varied (4.3 mM in FF vs. 5.55 mM in TCM-199 vs. 17.5 mM in DMEM/F-12). Hence, our data suggest that the currently used media for equine oocyte IVM can be further improved.","Fernández-Hernández, Pablo; Sánchez-Calabuig, María Jesús; García-Marín, Luis Jesús; Bragado, María J.; Gutiérrez-Adán, Alfonso; Millet, Óscar; Bruzzone, Chiara; González-Fernández, Lauro; Macías-García, Beatriz",Animals (Basel),418,3

Herein, we described a unique fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based microarray platform for real-time quantification of nucleic acid targets that combines advantages of both and reduces their limitations. A set of 3′ amino-modified TaqMan probes were designed and immobilized on a glass slide composing a regular microarray pattern, and used as probes in the consecutive PCR carried out on the surface. During the extension step of the PCR, 5′ nuclease activity of DNA polymerase will cleave quencher dyes of the immobilized probe in the presence of nucleic acids targets. The increase of fluorescence intensities generated by the change in physical distance between reporter fluorophore and quencher moiety of the probes were collected by a confocal scanner. Using this new approach we successfully monitored five different pathogenic genomic DNAs and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of fluorescence intensity changes on the TaqMan probe array. The results indicate that the TaqMan probe array on a planar glass slide monitors DNA targets with excellent specificity as well as high sensitivity. This set-up offers the great advantage of real-time quantitative detection of DNA targets in a parallel array format.","Liu, Heping; Wang, Hong; Shi, Zhiyang; Wang, Hua; Yang, Chaoyong; Silke, Spering; Tan, Weihong; Lu, Zuhong",Nucleic Acids Res,418,3

However, drugs used for single dose treatments must possess important characteristics, namely, long half-life, effective concentration in tissues over a long period, and low toxicity. In tropical medicine, such drugs are an important advance in the treatment of malaria (mefloquine and halofantrine), schistosomiasis (praziquantel and metrifonate), filariasis (ivermectin), and genitourinary tract and intestinal infections. Intestinal infections are one of the most frequent problems in tropical medicine. While a large number of cases of diarrhoea are of viral (rotavirus) or bacterial (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) origin, necessitating only oral rehydration, some are of parasitological origin (Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, Strongyloides, Trichuris, Schistosoma) and can be cured by a single dose treatment (tinidazole, secnidazole, ivermectin, albendazole, praziquantel). Secnidazole is the nitroimidazole with the longest half-life and is, therefore, used in single dose treatments for Giardia, acute intestinal amoebiasis and E. histolytica cyst carriers. Single dose treatments of most intestinal parasites will be a major advance in the management of tropical infectious diarrhoea. In the next decade, opportunistic intestinal infections (Cryptosporidium, Isospora, Enterocytozoon) in AIDS patients that are refractory to treatment could be the major problem.","Dupouy-Camet, Jean",Drug Investig,418,3

This allows us to benefit from both the performance of existing process discovery methods, and the accuracy of the employed fundamental synthesis techniques. We prove that the proposed approach preserves fitness with respect to the event log, while improving the precision when indirect dependencies exist. The approach has been implemented and tested on both synthetic and real-life datasets.

The saturated type of incidence rates and treatment rate of infectives are deliberated herein. The mathematical analysis shows that the model has two equilibria: disease-free and endemic. We derive the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the model and study the stability behavior of the model at both disease-free and endemic equilibria. Through analysis, it is demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] , unstable when [Formula: see text] , and linearly neutrally stable when [Formula: see text] for the time delay [Formula: see text] . Further, an undelayed epidemic model is studied when [Formula: see text] , which reveals that the model exhibits forward and backward bifurcations under specific conditions, which also has important implications in the study of disease transmission dynamics.

Harm reduction strategies and positive behaviors of medical providers in mitigating the effects of COVID-19 among HIV-infected children and HIV-exposed infants,14.979143,11.817908,2020-12-31,"Water is essential for irrigation, drinking and industrial purposes from global to the regional scale. The groundwater considered a significant water resource specifically in regions where the surface water is not sufficient. Therefore, the research problem is focused on district-wise sustainable groundwater management due to urbanization. The number of impervious surface areas like roofing on built-up areas, concrete and asphalt road surface were increased due to the level of urban development. Thus, these surface areas can inhibit infiltration and surface retention by the impact of urbanization because vegetation/forest areas are decreased. The present research examines the district-wise spatiotemporal groundwater storage (GWS) changes under terrestrial water storage using the global land data assimilation system-2 (GLDAS-2) catchment land surface model (CLSM) from 2000 to 2014 in West Bengal, India. The objective of the research is mainly focused on the delineation of groundwater stress zones (GWSZs) based on ten biophysical and hydrological factors according to the deficiency of groundwater storage using the analytic hierarchy process by the GIS platform. Additionally, the spatiotemporal soil moisture (surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, and profile soil moisture) changes for the identification of water stress areas using CLSM were studied. Finally, generated results were validated by the observed groundwater level and groundwater recharge data. The sensitivity analysis has been performed for GWSZs mapping due to the deficit of groundwater storage. Three correlation coefficient methods (Kendall, Pearson and Spearman) are applied for the interrelationship between the most significant parameters for the generation of GWSZ from sensitivity analysis. The results show that the northeastern (max: 1097.35 mm) and the southern (max: 993.22 mm) parts have high groundwater storage due to higher amount of soil moisture and forest cover compared to other parts of the state. The results also show that the maximum and minimum total annual groundwater recharge shown in Paschim Medinipore [(361,148.51 hectare-meter (ham)] and Howrah (31,510.46 ham) from 2012 to 2013. The generated outcome can create the best sustainable groundwater management practices based upon the human attitude toward risk.

There are three main forms of phobia: social phobia (social anxiety disorder), specific phobia, or agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a form of anxiety disorder where one fears and avoids situations or places that might cause them to panic. The main purpose of this study is to investigate phobia among residents in broad training programs in Abha city and compare phobia between residents in broad training programs and general practitioners in Abha city. METHODS: It is a cross-sectional study. The study was conducted in Abha city of Saudi Arabia from December 2019 to March 2020. It included a representative sample of medical doctors under broad training programs and general practitioners (none trained) in all the health-care centers. A link for the survey questionnaires was created and shared with the respondents. The questionnaire included sociodemographics of the participants, the Kutcher Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Psychometric Properties and Clinical Utility of the Specific Phobia Questionnaire in an Anxiety Disorders Sample for specific phobia. RESULTS: The study included 300 physicians. Majority of them (81%) were in the age group between 25 and 30 years. Males represent 54% of them. There was no statistically significant difference between resident physicians and general practitioners regarding the avoidance of different social situations. CONCLUSION: Overall, the residents in board training programs in Abha city expressed lower levels of discomfort, anxiety, distress, avoidance, fear, and life interference of some social and specific situations compared to general practitioners.","ALQarni, Hassan Zaher M; Al Saleh, Majed Mohammed; Alsaleem, Safar A; Al- Garni, Abdulaziz Mohammed; Al-Hayaza, Shahad Hassan; AL-Zailaie, Ameerah Khalid; Alsulayyim, Rahaf Saeed; Al-Hasher, Sara Khalid; Al-Shehri, Khalid Mohammed",J Family Med Prim Care,418,3

Reduction of healthcare-associated viral infections during COVID-19 pandemic,14.884576,11.872125,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The CDC recommends testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients who present with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and to cohort hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Up to 35% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic; however, no recommendations exist for universal testing in hospitalized patients. We assessed the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst hospitalized patients at a tertiary care center during a time when there was a regional surge of cases. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was performed on inpatients at Georgetown University Hospital on 4/27/20, excluding those who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, tested within 72 hours or admitted to pediatric, psychiatric, labor & delivery or ICUs. Patients within the hospital were not cohorted based on COVID-19 status. Patient demographics and comorbidities were obtained from the EMR and analyzed for significance based on SARS-CoV-2 status. RESULTS: Hospital census on the testing date was 297; 204/297(68.7%) met inclusion criteria; 78/297(26.3%) were known COVID-19 patients. Within the study group 78/204 (38.2%) had known COVID-19, 21/204 (10.3%) were PUIs (4 of whom tested positive), 31/204 (15.1%) tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours and 74/204 (36.3%) met criteria for testing. The median age was 62 years (IQR, 53 to 70), 59%(n=122) were male, 56%(n= 115) were Black, and 90%(n=185) had at least one co-morbidity. 0/74 of those tested on 4/27/20 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and none were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 28 days. In adjusted analyses, patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 were more likely to be Black(OR=10.53 95% CI 3.02, 36.68, p=0.0002); male(OR=3.27 95% CI 1.26, 8.47, p=0.0143); reside in group/nursing homes(OR= 11.78 95%CI 3.03, 45.76, p=0.0004); have a history of prior stroke(OR= 6.25 95%CI 1.49, 26.12, p=0.012); but less likely to smoke(OR=0.10 95%CI 0.02, 0.48, p=0.0039), or have active malignancy (OR= 0.11 95%CI 0.01, 0.73, p=0.0223).

Initial Impact of COVID-19 on Ambulatory Antibiotic Prescribing for Respiratory Viral Infections,14.73624,11.845604,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the causative pathogens of several human diseases, including seasonal respiratory infections (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and the novel CoV recently identified as the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2. AT-527 is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials and has demonstrated potent activity and a well-tolerated safety profile in HCV-infected subjects. Here we report the in vitro activity of AT-511, the free base form of AT-527, against SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs. METHODS: BHK-21, Huh-7, RD and differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (dNHBE) cell cultures were exposed to virus and serial dilutions of test compounds. Independent assessments of antiviral activity were obtained by determining effective concentrations of test compounds required to 1) prevent half-maximal (EC(50)) virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) using MTT or neutral red staining and 2) produce virus yield reductions (VYR) by 90% (EC(90)) using standard endpoint dilution CCID(50) assays in Vero 76 cells. Half maximal cytotoxicity of test compounds was determined by dye (MTT or neutral red) staining in the absence of added virus or by microscopic inspection (dNHBE cells only). RESULTS: Table 1 presents the in vitro activities of AT-511 against several coronaviruses. Also included in these assays are the antiviral activities of potential COVID-19 oral treatments, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and N(4)-hydroxycytidine. Table 1. In Vitro Activity of AT-511 Against Various Human Coronaviruses [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate the potent in vitro activity of AT-511 against several CoVs, with individual EC(90) values ranging from 0.34 to 1.2 µM against HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and less activity against MERS-CoV (average EC(90) = 36 µM). The potent in vitro antiviral activity of AT-511 against SARS-CoV-2 (EC(90) = 0.55 µM), associated with the AT-527 safety profile in treated HCV patients, support the ongoing clinical evaluation of the safety and efficacy of AT-527 in COVID-19 patients.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients with SARS-CoV-2–associated acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study,14.819607,11.83423,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Accurate, rapid, inexpensive biomarkers are needed to differentiate COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia, allowing effective treatment and antibiotic stewardship. We hypothesized that the ratio of ferritin to procalcitonin (F/P) reflects greater viral activity and host response with COVID-19 pneumonia, while bacterial pneumonia would be associated with less cytolysis (lower ferritin) and more inflammation (higher procalcitonin), thus a lower F/P ratio. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients admitted to a single University hospital in the US through May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared F/P ratio of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia, excluding patients with COVID-19 and bacterial co-infections. In a logistic regression, we controlled for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), diabetes (DM), and hypertension (HTN). We used a receiver operating characteristic analysis to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of F/P values for the diagnosis of COVID-19 versus bacterial pneumonia. RESULTS: Of 218 patients with COVID-19 and 17 with bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19 patients were younger (56 vs 66 years, p=0.04), male (66% vs 24%, p=0.009), had higher BMI (31 vs 27 kg/m(2), p=0.03), and similar rates of HTN (59% vs 45%, p=0.3) and DM (32% vs 18%, p=0.2). The median F/P ratio was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (3195 vs 860, p=0.0003, Figure 1). An F/P ratio cut-off of ≥ 1250 generated a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 59% to correctly classify a COVID-19 case (Figure 2). When adjusted for age, gender, BMI, DM, and HTN, a ratio ≥ of 1250 was associated with significantly greater odds of COVID-19 versus bacterial pneumonia (OR: 4.9, CI: 1.5, 16.1, p=0.009). Figure 1.

Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis of Ferritin to Procalcitonin Ratio Cut-off Values Predicting COVID-19 Diagnosis. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We observed an elevated F/P ratio in patients with COVID-19 compared to those with bacterial pneumonia. A F/P ratio ≥ 1250 provides a clinically relevant increase in pre-test probability of COVID-19. Prospective studies evaluating the discriminatory characteristics of F/P ratio in larger cohorts is warranted.

A prospective case–control study was performed using a convenience sample recruited from a single university glaucoma clinic and a group of healthy controls. SVOP and standard automated perimetry (SAP) was performed with testing order randomised. The reference standard was a diagnosis of glaucoma based a comprehensive ophthalmic examination and abnormality on standard automated perimetry (SAP). The index test was SVOP. 31 patients with glaucoma and 24 healthy subjects were included. Mean SAP mean deviation (MD) in those with glaucoma was − 8.7 ± 7.4 dB, with mean SAP and SVOP sensitivities of 23.3 ± 0.9 dB and 22.1 ± 4.3 dB respectively. Participants with glaucoma were significantly older. On average, SAP sensitivity was 1.2 ± 1.4 dB higher than SVOP (95% limits of agreement = − 1.6 to 4.0 dB). SVOP sensitivity had good ability to differentiate healthy and glaucomatous eyes with a 95% CI for area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 to 0.96, similar to the performance of SAP sensitivity (95% CI 0.86 to 0.97, P = 0.60). For 80% specificity, SVOP had a 95% CI sensitivity of 75.7% to 94.8% compared to 77.8% to 96.0% for SAP. SVOP took considerably longer to perform (514 ± 54 s compared to 267 ± 76 s for SAP). Eye tracking perimetry may be useful for detection of glaucoma but further studies are needed to evaluate SVOP within its intended sphere of use, using an appropriate design and independent reference standard.","Tatham, Andrew J.; Murray, Ian C.; McTrusty, Alice D.; Cameron, Lorraine A.; Perperidis, Antonios; Brash, Harry M.; Fleck, Brian W.; Minns, Robert A.",Sci Rep,418,0

Despite these impressive findings, however, a key barrier to the full realization of ML’s potential in medical prognoses is technology acceptance. Recent efforts to produce explainable AI (XAI) have made progress in improving the interpretability of some ML models, but these efforts suffer from limitations intrinsic to their design: they work best at identifying why a system fails, but do poorly at explaining when and why a model’s prediction is correct. We posit that the acceptability of ML predictions in expert domains is limited by two key factors: the machine’s horizon of prediction that extends beyond human capability, and the inability for machine predictions to incorporate human intuition into their models. We propose the use of a novel ML architecture, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to enhance human understanding and encourage acceptability. Our approach prioritizes human cognitive intuition at the center of the algorithm design, and offers a distribution of predictions rather than single outputs. We explain how this approach may significantly improve human-machine collaboration in prediction tasks in expert domains such as medical prognoses. We propose a model and demonstrate, by expanding a concrete example from the literature, how our model advances the vision of future hybrid human-AI systems.","Fompeyrine, D. A.; Vorm, E.

In addition to cardiovascular system involvement, it can also have other multiple organs involved. This study is aimed at investigating the correlation between anti-cardiolipin antibody (ACA)/D dimer/C reactive protein (CRP) and coronary artery lesions (CAL)/multiple-organ lesions in children with KD. Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed in 284 KD/IKD patients from May 2015 to April 2016. Among them, 175 were males (61.6%), with average age of 2 years and 5 months old. Patients were divided into ACA+ group and ACA- group, elevated D dimer group (DDE) and normal D dimer group (DDN), and coronary artery injury (CAL) group and non-coronary artery injury (NCAL) group. Results: ACA was most likely tested positive in younger KD children (p < 0.05). ACA+ and hypoproteinemia were correlated with CAL, thrombocytosis, and granulocytopenia (p < 0.05–0.01). Levels of cTnI and CK in the CAL group were significantly higher than those in the NCAL group (p < 0.05). CAL was more frequently detected in younger patients and patients with prolonged fever, later IVIG treatment, and elevated CRP over 100 mg/l, but there was no statistically significant difference (all p > 0.05). In the KD with DDE group, the incidence of granulopenia, thrombocytosis, myocardial damage, cholestasis, hypoproteinemia, and aseptic urethritis was significantly higher than that in the KD with DDN group (p < 0.05–0.01). However, elevated D dimer was not associated with CAL. CRP elevation was highly correlated with D dimer, but not with CAL. Conclusion: Higher incidence of CAL and myocardial damage occurred in KD patients with positive ACA and hypoproteinemia. In the current study, ACA was only tested for positive and negative, which is a limitation to this study. To further elucidate the association, ACA titers would establish its significance in drawing a conclusion for the significance of ACA in CAL and myocardial damages. In addition, higher incidence of CAL occurred in younger patients. The higher D dimer was associated with increased multiple-organ damage (MOD). CRP was closely correlated with D dimer, but not correlated with ACA and CAL.","Xu, Yun-ming; Chu, Yan-qiu; Wang, Hong",Front Pediatr,418,7

However, interaction between a transferred lymph node and the recipient lymphatic system in relieving lymphedema has not been identified. The aims of this study were to investigate anatomic changes in the lymphatic system in the forelimb of a canine after lymph node dissection and irradiation and to clarify the interaction between the transferred lymph node and recipient lymphatics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two adult female mongrel canines were used for this exploratory study. The unilateral axillary and lower neck node dissections were performed, and 15-Gy irradiation was applied on postoperative day 3. After 1 y, a VLNT flap was harvested from the lower abdominal region and inset in the axilla with vascular anastomoses. The girth of each forelimb was determined with a tape measure at different time points. Indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography and lymphangiography were performed before and after each surgery to evaluate morphologic changes in the lymphatics. RESULTS Both canines revealed identical changes in the lymphatic system, but only one canine developed lymphedema. After lymph node dissection, a collateral lymphatic pathway formed a connection to the contralateral cervical node. After VLNT, an additional collateral pathway formed a connection to the internal mammary node via the transferred node in the axilla. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that the lymphatic system has a homing mechanism, which allows the severed lymphatic vessels to detect and connect to adjacent lymph nodes. VLNT may create new collateral pathways to relieve lymphedema.","Suami, Hiroo; Scaglioni, Mario F; Dixon, Katherine A; Tailor, Ramesh C",The Journal of surgical research,418,16

Most published reports regarding this procedure have focused on the right-sided approach. Since left-sided approach chest surgery is the first choice in cases of right pleural adhesion, large left thymus tumors, and tumors in close contact with the great vessels of the left pericardium, we performed thoracoscopic thymectomy using the left-sided approach in 52 cases and summarize herein its technical feasibility, indications, and operative steps. METHODS Between February 2004 and October 2014, 52 patients (24 men, 28 women, median age: 50 years, ranging from 18 to 85 years), underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy using the left-sided approach. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia with single-lung ventilation. Patients were placed in the right lateral decubitus position and three ports were made. The entire hemithorax was carefully examined, then mediastinal pleura was incised, and the thymus was bluntly dissected from the inferior polar extending to the superior polar. The thymic venous was clipped. RESULTS All procedures were carried out safely, including simple thymectomy (n = 43) and extended thymectomy (n = 9). There were no operative deaths or serious complications, and there were seven cases of conversion to open thoracotomy. The mean operative duration was 105.3 minutes (ranging from 80 to 140 minutes). The mean blood loss was 78.5 ml (ranging from 20 to 200 ml), and there was no blood transfusion required. All patients were well throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS The left-sided approach for video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy was a safe approach and could be an alternative procedure to the right-sided approach for the same procedure.","Li, Yun; Wang, Jun",World journal of surgical oncology,418,31

However, T2D is a phenotypically and pathophysiologically heterogenous disorder, and the need for a tailored approach in its management is becoming increasingly evident. There is emerging evidence that irregular immune responses contribute to the development of hyperglycemia in T2D and, inversely, that insulin resistance is a component of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. Nevertheless, it has not yet been fully elucidated to what extent the presence of conventional autoimmune markers, such as autoantibodies, in subjects with T2D might affect the natural history of the disease and particularly each response to various treatments. The challenge for future research in the field is the discovery of novel genetic, molecular, or phenotypical indicators that would enable the characterization of specific subpopulations of people with T2D who would benefit most from the addition of immunomodulatory therapies to standard glucose-lowering treatment. This narrative review aims to discuss the plausible mechanisms through which the immune system might be implicated in the development of metabolic disturbances in T2D and obesity and explore a potential role of immunotherapy in the future management of the disorder and its complications.","Koufakis, Theocharis; Dimitriadis, George; Metallidis, Symeon; Zebekakis, Pantelis; Kotsa, Kalliopi",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,418,1

ZBP1 sensing of the Z-RNA produced during influenza virus infection induces cell death in the form of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis). PANoptosis is a coordinated cell death pathway that is driven through a multiprotein complex called the PANoptosome and enables crosstalk and co-regulation among these processes. During influenza virus infection, a key step in PANoptosis and PANoptosome assembly is the formation of the ZBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome. When Z-RNA is sensed, ZBP1 recruits RIPK3 and caspase-8 to activate the ZBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome. Several other host factors have been found to be important for ZBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, including molecules involved in the type I interferon signaling pathway and caspase-6. Additionally, influenza viral proteins, such as M2, NS1, and PB1-F2, have also been shown to regulate the ZBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome.

Methods to overcome replicative senescence include genomic modifications which have their own disadvantages. We have evaluated a three-dimensional (3D) thermo-reversible gelation polymer (TGP) matrix environment for its capabilities to reverse cellular senescence. The expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-βgal) by human chondrocytes from osteoarthritis-affected cartilage tissue, grown in a conventional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer culture versus in 3D-TGP were compared. In 2D, the cells de-differentiated into fibroblasts, expressed higher SA-βgal and started degenerating at 25 days. SA-βgal levels decreased when the chondrocytes were transferred from the 2D to the 3D-TGP culture, with cells exhibiting a tissue-like growth until 42-45 days. Other senescence associated markers such as p16INK4a and p21 were also expressed only in 2D cultured cells but not in 3D-TGP tissue engineered cartilage. This is a first-of-its-kind report of a chemically synthesized and reproducible in vitro environment yielding an advantageous reversal of aging of human chondrocytes without any genomic modifications. The method is worth consideration as an optimal method for growing cells for regenerative medicine applications.","Katoh, Shojiro; Fujimaru, Atsuki; Iwasaki, Masaru; Yoshioka, Hiroshi; Senthilkumar, Rajappa; Preethy, Senthilkumar; Abraham, Samuel J K",Scientific reports,418,19

They also suffer from recurrent infections that overlap with those seen in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a disease caused by defects of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and a lack of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We studied an international cohort of 17 PKCδ-deficient patients and found that their EBV-B cells and monocyte-derived phagocytes produced only small amounts of ROS and did not phosphorylate p40phox normally after PMA or opsonized Staphylococcus aureus stimulation. Moreover, the patients' circulating phagocytes displayed abnormally low levels of ROS production and markedly reduced neutrophil extracellular trap formation, altogether suggesting a role for PKCδ in activation of the NADPH oxidase complex. Our findings thus show that patients with PKCδ deficiency have impaired NADPH oxidase activity in various myeloid subsets, which may contribute to their CGD-like infectious phenotype.","Neehus, Anna-Lena; Moriya, Kunihiko; Nieto-Patlán, Alejandro; Le Voyer, Tom; Lévy, Romain; Özen, Ahmet; Karakoc-Aydiner, Elif; Baris, Safa; Yildiran, Alisan; Altundag, Engin; Roynard, Manon; Haake, Kathrin; Migaud, Mélanie; Dorgham, Karim; Gorochov, Guy; Abel, Laurent; Lachmann, Nico; Dogu, Figen; Haskologlu, Sule; İnce, Erdal; El-Benna, Jamel; Uzel, Gulbu; Kiykim, Ayca; Boztug, Kaan; Roderick, Marion R; Shahrooei, Mohammad; Brogan, Paul A; Abolhassani, Hassan; Hancioglu, Gonca; Parvaneh, Nima; Belot, Alexandre; Ikinciogullari, Aydan; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Puel, Anne; Bustamante, Jacinta",The Journal of experimental medicine,418,12

In previous work, we introduced a model based on eigen decomposition of the Laplacian which predicts the functional network from the structural network in healthy brains. In this work, we apply the eigen decomposition model to two types of epilepsy; temporal lobe epilepsy associated with mesial temporal sclerosis, and MRI-normal temporal lobe epilepsy. Our findings show that the eigen relationship between function and structure holds for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy as well as normal individuals. These results suggest that the brain under TLE conditions reconfigures and rewires the fine-scale connectivity (a process which the model parameters are putatively sensitive to), in order to achieve the necessary structure-function relationship.","Abdelnour, Farras; Dayan, Michael; Devinsky, Orrin; Thesen, Thomas; Raj, Ashish",NeuroImage,418,16

As the COVID-19 pandemic has tested global health systems to their limits, pharmacy professionals have shown themselves to be an integral part of them. Community pharmacists have supported government initiatives to control the pandemic and have ensured patients continued to receive their medicines. Hospital pharmacists have been moving beyond their specialties to help provide critical care to patients while dealing with ICU drug shortages. Pharmaceutical scientists have been involved in finding effective vaccines and identifying effective treatments. In short, the pharmacy profession has been demonstrating expertise, strength, courage and dedication to care at the highest level. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), which represents the pharmacy profession globally, has a mission to advance pharmacy worldwide by sharing best pharmacy practice and innovation with the world. In this article, it describes how pharmacy has stepped up during the COVID‑19 crisis by giving examples from several countries. It highlights, for example, how virtual practice became more prominent as face-to-face meetings became impossible, how pharmacists' scope of practice has been extended, and how pharmacy educators have embraced digital technologies to teach and assess students remotely. In particular, the article highlights pharmacists' involvement in the COVID-19 vaccination programmes in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. As a result of all this, FIP sees an exciting future for the profession. Health ministers and heads of state have been praising pharmacists for their service, and FIP wants governments to translate this recognition into support for expanded roles and scientific research. It continues to gather data and intelligence to support an expansion of pharmacy practice, education and pharmaceutical workforce that builds on the profession's scientific base. All these advances are supported by scientific studies about our specialty. Finally, FIP expresses its worries about equity of access to medicines during the pandemic, as younger, healthier people in rich countries are vaccinated before people at greater risk in poor countries. It insists it will continue to advocate on this topic as a core component of its global vision. In this article, we share with readers a snapshot of how our profession around the world has adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our thoughts on the how it is affecting the evolution of pharmacy practice.","Jordan, Dominique; Guiu-Segura, Josep M; Sousa-Pinto, Gonçalo; Wang, Lin-Nam",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,418,20

Previously, pancreatico-splenectomy has been performed for dissecting splenic hilar lymph nodes, followed by pancreas-preserving splenectomy and spleen-preserving lymphadenectomy. However, the necessity of routine splenectomy or splenic hilar lymph node dissection has been under debate due to the increased morbidity caused by splenectomy and the poor prognostic feature of splenic hilar lymph node metastasis. In contrast, the relatively high incidence of splenic hilar lymph node metastasis, survival advantage, and therapeutic value of splenic hilar lymph node dissection in some patient subgroups, as well as the effective use of novel technologies, still supports the necessity and applicability of splenic hilar lymph node dissection.

Each technique has advantages that affect patient selection. In this report, we report our experience with 31 patients who underwent single-incision laparoscopic stoma creation using only a pre-selected stoma site as the point of port access. METHODS A 2.5-cm skin incision was made at a previously marked stoma site, and two 5-mm trocars were placed into the abdomen through the stoma site. An optional third trocar was inserted at the stoma site only if the bowel needed to be mobilized or if adhesions needed to be divided. After full intra-abdominal exploration, a selected intestinal loop was brought up to the stoma site, and the ostomy was then matured using standard techniques. RESULTS Between April 2009 and March 2012, 31 patients (19 men) with a mean age of 68 years (range, 46-87 years) underwent single-incision laparoscopic stoma creation. Fecal diversion included ileostomy (n = 18) and colostomy (n = 13). There were no intraoperative complications. Two patients (6.5%) required additional port placement in the midline suprapubic area. Conversion to open laparotomy was required in two patients (6.5%) because of the presence of extensive adhesions. Postoperative complications were observed in two patients and included peristomal ileus and dehydration due to high ileostomy output. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic stoma creation is an effective technique that allows full intra-abdominal visualization and bowel mobilization, while reducing the need for additional skin incisions beyond that of the stoma site.","Hasegawa, Junichi; Hirota, Masaki; Kim, Ho Min; Mikata, Shoki; Shimizu, Junzo; Soma, Yoshihito; Nezu, Riichiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,418,1

Aerobic fitness (VO2max) and salivary aldosterone were measured to see if they modulated ion reabsorption rates. METHODS During a passive heating protocol (lower leg 42 °C water submersion) the maximum ion reabsorption rates from the chest, forearm and thigh were measured, alongside other thermophysiological responses. The maximum ion reabsorption rate was defined as the inflection point in the slope of the relation between galvanic skin conductance and sweat rate. RESULTS The maximum ion reabsorption rate at the forearm, chest and thigh (0.29 ± 0.16, 0.33 ± 0.15, 0.18 ± 0.16 mg/cm2/min, respectively) were weakly correlated with age (r ≤ - 0.232, P ≥ 0.05) and salivary aldosterone concentrations (r ≤ - 0.180, P ≥ 0.179). A moderate positive correlation was observed between maximum ion reabsorption rate at the thigh and VO2max (r = 0.384, P = 0.015). Salivary aldosterone concentration moderately declined with age (r = - 0.342, P = 0.021). Whole body sweat rate and pilocarpine-induced sudomotor responses to iontophoresis increased with VO2max (r ≥ 0.323, P ≤ 0.027) but only moderate (r = - 0.326, P = 0.032) or no relations (r ≤ - 0.113, P ≥ 0.256) were observed with age. CONCLUSION The eccrine sweat glands' maximum ion reabsorption rate is not affected by age, spanning 50-84 years. Aldosterone concentration in an aged cohort does not appear to modulate the ion reabsorption rate. We provide further support for maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness to attenuate any decline in sudomotor function.","Gerrett, N; Amano, T; Inoue, Y; Kondo, Narihiko",European journal of applied physiology,418,1

Affordable novel drugs with less severe side effects are urgently required. We investigated the effect of withanone (WN) from Withania somnifera on the serotonin system of wild-type and knockout Caenorhabditis elegans strains using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods. METHODS WN or fluoxetine (as positive control drug) was administered to wild-type (N2) and knockout C. elegans strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109, and MT9772) to determine their effect on oxidative stress (Trolox, H2DCFDA, and juglone assays) on osmotic stress and heat stress and lifespan. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was applied to investigate the effect of WN or fluoxetine on the expression of serotonin receptors (ser-1, ser-4, ser-7) and serotonin transporter (mod-5). The binding affinity of WN to serotonin receptors and transporter was analyzed in silico using AutoDock 4.2.6. RESULTS WN scavenged ROS in wild-type and knockout C. elegans and prolonged their lifespan. WN upregulated the expression of serotonin receptor and transporter genes. In silico analyses revealed high binding affinities of WN to Ser-1, Ser-4, Ser-7, and Mod-5. LIMITATIONS Further studies are needed to prove whether the results from C. elegans are transferrable to mammals and human beings. CONCLUSION WN ameliorated depressive-associated stress symptoms by activating the serotonin system. WN may serve as potential candidate in developing new drugs to treat depression.","Naß, Janine; Efferth, Thomas",Pharmacopsychiatry,418,19

Moreover, the potential for using short interfering RNA (siRNA) as a therapy in its own right is also progressing at a significant pace. However, the widespread use of such approaches is contingent on having appropriate systems to achieve clinically appropriate, safe, and efficient delivery of siRNA. There are many physicochemical and biological barriers to such delivery, and a growing emphasis on the design and characterisation of non-viral technologies that will overcome these barriers and expedite targeted delivery. This review discusses the considerations and challenges associated with use of siRNA-based therapeutics, including stability and off-target effects. Speculation is made on the properties of an ideal delivery system and the non-viral delivery approaches used to date, both in vitro and in vivo, are classified and discussed. Moreover, the ability of cyclodextrin-based delivery vectors to fulfil many of the criteria of an ideal delivery construct is also elaborated.","Guo, Jianfeng; Fisher, Karen A; Darcy, Raphael; Cryan, John F; O'Driscoll, Caitriona",Molecular bioSystems,418,25

Control programs usually include vaccination with a modified live viral (MLV) vaccine. On occasion BoHV-1 strains are isolated from diseased animals or fetuses postvaccination. Currently there are no markers for differentiating MLV strains from field strains of BoHV-1. In this study several BoHV-1 strains were sequenced using whole-genome sequencing technologies and the data analyzed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Strains sequenced included the reference BoHV-1 Cooper strain (GenBank Accession JX898220), eight commercial MLV vaccine strains, and 14 field strains from cases presented for diagnosis. Based on SNP analyses, the viruses could be classified into groups having similar SNP patterns. The eight MLV strains could be differentiated from one another although some were closely related to each other. A number of field strains isolated from animals with a history of prior vaccination had SNP patterns similar to specific MLV viruses, while other field isolates were very distinct from all vaccine strains. The results indicate that some BoHV-1 isolates from clinically ill cattle/fetuses can be associated with a prior MLV vaccination history, but more information is needed on the rate of BoHV-1 genome sequence change before irrefutable associations can be drawn.","Fulton, R W; d'Offay, J M; Eberle, R",Vaccine,418,20

We report our rate of hemorrhagic complications after endovascular treatment and analyze the clinical significance and potential mechanisms, with emphasis on cases of delayed hemorrhage after uneventful embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS During a 10-year period, 846 embolization procedures were performed in 408 patients with brain AVMs. Any cases of hemorrhagic complications were identified and divided into those related or unrelated to a periprocedural arterial tear (during catheter navigation or catheter retrieval). We analyzed the following variables: sex, age, hemorrhagic presentation, Spetzler-Martin grade, size of the AVM, number of embolized pedicles, microcatheter used, type and volume of liquid embolic agent injected, and the presence of a premature venous occlusion. Univariate and multivariate multiple regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for hemorrhagic complications. RESULTS A hemorrhagic complication occurred in 92 (11%) procedures. Forty-four (48%) complications were related to a periprocedural arterial perforation, and 48 (52%) were not. Hemorrhagic complications unrelated to an arterial perforation were located more commonly in the cerebral parenchyma, caused more neurologic deficits, and were associated with worse prognosis than those in the arterial perforation group. Only premature venous occlusion was identified as an independent predictor of hemorrhagic complication in the nonperforation group. Premature venous occlusion was significantly related to the ratio of Onyx volume to nidus diameter. CONCLUSIONS Higher injected volume of embolic agent and deposition on the venous outflow before complete occlusion of the AVM may account for severe hemorrhagic complications.","Baharvahdat, H; Blanc, R; Termechi, R; Pistocchi, S; Bartolini, B; Redjem, H; Piotin, M",AJNR.

METHODS A meta-analysis was performed from available studies investigating serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms in glaucoma patients and controls. RESULTS Twelve studies in total, including 130,676 and 476 subjects, were analysed for the association between serum vitamin D levels and VDR polymorphisms with glaucoma, respectively. Collectively, it was found that glaucoma patients have lower levels of vitamin D compared to controls (SMD=-1.16, 95% CI=-1.56--0.76, P<0.00001). In parallel, the pooled results showed a significant association between glaucoma and allelic (b vs. B, OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.37-2.46, P=0.00001) and recessive (bb vs. Bb+BB, OR=3.16, 95% CI=1.30-7.66, P=0.001) models of VDR BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphism, but not with VDR TaqI (rs731236) or FokI (rs2228570) polymorphisms. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis suggests that patients with glaucoma may have vitamin D deficiency. In addition, the vitamin D signalling cascade may be a contributing factor in developing glaucoma, which is supported by the evidence that b allele carriers of VDR BsmI exhibited an increase in the risk of glaucoma. Thus, dietary supplementation of vitamin D may become an important approach as an additional treatment for glaucoma.","Ulhaq, Z S",Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,418,20

This required parents to act in new roles without much support. Although studies have asked parents about stress before and during the pandemic, none have examined how stress may have fluctuated throughout the day and the characteristics related to those daily changes. OBJECTIVE Our study assesses how time-varying (e.g., presence of a focal child) and day-varying (e.g., weekend vs. weekday) factors were related to parents' level of stress. METHODS We use Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine stress three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) for 14 days. We include two different dates hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels: (1) when Ohio announced schools would go virtual for the rest of the academic year and (2) when most retail businesses were allowed to re-open. Our sample of 332 individuals, recruited via Facebook, Craigslist, and word of mouth, completed 13,360 of these brief surveys during April-May 2020. Data were analyzed using generalized ordered logit models. RESULTS Parents report lower levels of stress when completing the 9 p.m. survey, but higher levels when they were at work, during weekdays (compared to weekends) or when they were with the focal child. COVID-19 milestone dates were not related to stress levels. CONCLUSIONS Parents need some form of respite (e.g. child care, child-only activities) to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their child(ren)'s schooling. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations.","Freisthler, Bridget; Gruenewald, Paul J; Tebben, Erin; Shockley McCarthy, Karla; Price Wolf, Jennifer",Social science & medicine,418,12

Although equally effective at detecting impairment as other cognitive screens (e.g. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)), sorting tests are not commonly used in this context. This study examines the QuickSort, which is a new brief sorting test that is designed to screen older adults for cognitive impairment. DESIGN Observational cohort study. SETTING General community and inpatients, Australia. PARTICIPANTS Older (≥60 years) community-dwelling adults (n = 187) and inpatients referred for neuropsychological assessment (n = 78). A normative subsample (n = 115), screened for cognitive and psychological disorders, was formed from the community sample. MEASUREMENTS Participants were administered the QuickSort, MMSE, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. The QuickSort requires people to sort nine stimuli by color, shape, and number, and to explain the basis for their correct sorts. Sorting (range = 0-12), Explanation (range = 0-6), and Total (range = 0-18) scores were calculated for the QuickSort. RESULTS The Cognitively Healthy subsample completed the QuickSort within 2 minutes, 50% had errorless performance, and 95% had Total scores of 10 or greater. The likelihood of community-dwelling older adults and inpatients (n = 260) being impaired on either the MMSE or FAB, or both, increased by a factor of 3.75 for QuickSort Total scores of less than 10 and reduced by a factor of 0.23 for scores of 10 or greater. CONCLUSION The QuickSort provides a quick, reliable, and valid alternative to lengthier cognitive screens (e.g., MMSE and FAB) when screening older adults for cognitive impairment. The QuickSort performance of an older adult can be compared with a cognitively healthy normative sample and used to estimate the likelihood they will be impaired on either the MMSE or FAB, or both. Clinicians can also use evidence-based modeling to customize the QuickSort for their setting.","Foran, Amie M; Mathias, Jane L; Bowden, Stephen C",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,418,31

Coupled with a recent report by Jim O'Neill [https://amr-review.org] that if left unaddressed antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria could kill 10 million people per year by 2050, which would surpass current cancer mortality, this further highlights the need for unequivocal identification of microorganisms. Whilst traditional microbiological testing has offered insights into the characterisation and identification of a wide range of bacteria, these approaches have proven to be laborious and time-consuming and are not really fit for purpose, considering the modern day speed and volume of international travel and the opportunities it creates for the spread of pathogens globally. To overcome these disadvantages, modern analytical methods, such as mass spectrometry (MS) and vibrational spectroscopy, that analyse the whole organism, have emerged as essential alternative approaches. Currently within clinical microbiology laboratories, matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI)-MS is the method of choice for bacterial identification. This is largely down to its robust analysis as it largely measures the ribosomes which are always present irrespective of how the bacteria are cultured. However, MALDI-MS requires large amounts of biomass and infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy are attractive alternatives as these physicochemical bioanalytical techniques have the advantages of being rapid, reliable and cost-effective for analysing various types of bacterial samples, even at the single cell level. In this review, we discuss the fundamental applications, advantages and disadvantages of modern analytical techniques used for bacterial characterisation, classification and identification.","AlMasoud, Najla; Muhamadali, Howbeer; Chisanga, Malama; AlRabiah, Haitham; Lima, Cassio A; Goodacre, Royston",The Analyst,418,31

We assessed the patient experience with telemedicine in routine radiation oncology practice to determine satisfaction, quality of care, and opportunities for optimization. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients seen within a multistate comprehensive cancer center for prepandemic office visits and intrapandemic telemedicine visits in December 2019 through June 2020 who completed patient experience questionnaires were evaluated. Patient satisfaction between office and telemedicine consultations were compared, patient visit-type preferences were assessed, and factors associated with an office visit preference were determined. RESULTS In total, 1,077 patients were assessed (office visit, n=726; telemedicine, n=351). The telemedicine-consult survey response rate was 40%. No significant differences were seen in satisfaction scores between office and telemedicine consultations, including the appointment experience versus expectation, quality of physician's explanation, and level of physician concern and friendliness. Among telemedicine survey respondents, 45% and 34% preferred telemedicine and office visits, respectively, and 21% had no preference for their visit type. Most respondents found their confidence in their physician (90%), understanding of the treatment plan (88%), and confidence in their treatment (87%) to be better or no different than with an office visit. Patients with better performance status and who were married/partnered were more likely to prefer in-person office visit consultations (odds ratio [OR], 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00-1.08]; P=.047, and 2.41 [95% CI, 1.14-5.47]; P=.009, respectively). Patients with telephone-only encounters were more likely to report better treatment plan understanding with an office visit (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.00-4.77; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS This study is the first to assess telemedicine in routine radiation oncology practice, and found high patient satisfaction and confidence in their care. Optimization of telemedicine in oncology should be a priority, specifically access to audiovisual capabilities that can improve patient-oncologist communication.","Shaverdian, Narek; Gillespie, Erin F; Cha, Elaine; Kim, Soo Young; Benvengo, Stephanie; Chino, Fumiko; Kang, Jung Julie; Li, Yuelin; Atkinson, Thomas M; Lee, Nancy; Washington, Charles M; Cahlon, Oren; Gomez, Daniel R",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,418,16

We previously reported the frequent occurrence of amyloid deposits in the ligament flavum in the presence of lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS), which is a common spinal disorder in older individuals. Our earlier clinicopathological studies revealed that amyloid deposits derived from transthyretin (TTR) were involved in the pathogenesis of LSCS. ATTR amyloid was the most common form in the ligamentum flavum, but amyloid deposits that were not identified still existed in more than 50% of patients with LSCS. In this study, we found apolipoprotein AI (AApoAI) amyloid deposits in the ligamentum flavum of patients with LSCS. The deposits occurred in 12% of patients with LSCS. Biochemical studies revealed that the amyloid deposits consisted mainly of full-length ApoAI. As a notable finding, the lumbar ligamentum flavum of patients who had LSCS with double-positive amyloid deposits-positive for both ATTR and AApoAI-was significantly thicker than that of patients who had LSCS with single-positive-that is, positive for either ATTR or AApoAI-amyloid deposits. We thus suggest that lumbar AApoAI amyloid formation may enhance the pathological changes of lumbar ATTR amyloidosis in patients with LSCS.","Tasaki, Masayoshi; Okada, Masamitsu; Yanagisawa, Akihiro; Nomura, Toshiya; Matsushita, Hiroaki; Ueda, Akihiko; Inoue, Yasuteru; Masuda, Teruaki; Misumi, Yohei; Yamashita, Taro; Nakamura, Takayuki; Miyamoto, Takeshi; Obayashi, Konen; Ando, Yukio; Ueda, Mitsuharu",Amyloid : the international journal of experimental and clinical investigation : the official journal of the International Society of Amyloidosis,418,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expressions of PGM5-AS1 and SMAD4 in human colorectal cancer tissues and cells. CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate the SW403 cells proliferation and transwell assay was performed to evaluate the SW403 cells migration. The correlation between miR-100-5p and PGM5-AS1 was detected by statistical analysis. Bioinformatics prediction and Luciferase assay were performed to explore the interaction and binding site of PGM5-AS1 and miR-100-5p, miR-100-5p and SMAD4, respectively. RESULTS We found that both PGM5-AS1 and SMAD4 were downregulated in human colorectal cancer tissues and cells. qRT-PCR and CCK-8 assay showed that PGM5-AS1 expression is associated with the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. Transwell assay showed that PGM5-AS1 regulated the migration ability of colorectal cancer cells. The bioinformatics prediction and Luciferase assay demonstrated that by sponging miR-100-5p, PGM5-AS1 can serve as a molecular sponge to further regulate the expression of SMAD4. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we found that lncRNA-PGM5-AS1 was low expressed in human colorectal cancer cells, which could promote tumor proliferation, migration and invasion by serving as a molecular sponge and by modulating the inhibitory effect of miR-100-5p on tumor suppressor gene SMAD4.","Zhou, B; Yi, F; Chen, Y; Li, C-H; Cheng, Y-S; Yang, K",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,418,1

Patterned silicon chips with microwells provide high crystal-loading density with an extremely high hit rate. The microfocus, undulator-fed beamline at CHESS, which has compound refractive optics and a fast-framing detector, was built and optimized for this experiment. The high-throughput oscillation method described here collects 1-5° of data per crystal at room temperature with fast (10° s-1) oscillation rates and translation times, giving a crystal-data collection rate of 2.5 Hz. Partial datasets collected by the oscillation method at a storage-ring source provide more complete data per crystal than still images, dramatically lowering the total number of crystals needed for a complete dataset suitable for structure solution and refinement - up to two orders of magnitude fewer being required. Thus, this method is particularly well suited to instances where crystal quantities are low. It is demonstrated, through comparison of first and last oscillation images of two systems, that dose and the effects of radiation damage can be minimized through fast rotation and low angular sweeps for each crystal.","Wierman, Jennifer L; Paré-Labrosse, Olivier; Sarracini, Antoine; Besaw, Jessica E; Cook, Michael J; Oghbaey, Saeed; Daoud, Hazem; Mehrabi, Pedram; Kriksunov, Irina; Kuo, Anling; Schuller, David J; Smith, Scott; Ernst, Oliver P; Szebenyi, Doletha M E; Gruner, Sol M; Miller, R J Dwayne; Finke, Aaron D",IUCrJ,418,16

Specifically, the study was designed to investigate the influence of MIC on the activity of prolonged-infusion TZP using pharmacokinetics (PKs) consistent with a non-critically ill patient population. There was no benefit with prolonged- compared with standard-infusion TZP against isolates with susceptible MICs of 8 or 16 mg/L. However, prolonged-infusion TZP produced more than two times the final bacterial kill against less susceptible isolates with an intermediate MIC of 32 mg/L. The PDs of TZP were well described by a sigmoid Emax model (r(2) = 0.84) where %ƒT>MIC thresholds of 27 and 75% were associated with bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, respectively. However, the well-established PD relationship with %ƒT>MIC was not observed with prolonged-infusion TZP. In conclusion, this study characterizes the targeted benefits of prolong-infusion TZP based on pathogen MIC, and supports the assertion that the benefits are selective and most likely observed in patients with less susceptible pathogens or altered PKs.","Zelenitsky, S; Nash, J; Weber, Z; Iacovides, H; Ariano, R",Journal of chemotherapy,418,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Placental tissue samples were collected from women with PE (n = 28) and without PE (n = 28). The normotensive controls without PE were matched for gestational age at delivery with the patients with PE. The expression levels of AGGF1 in the placental tissues were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. RESULTS The immunoexpression of AGGF1 was localised in the syncytiotrophoblast tissue. Notable, the mRNA and protein expression levels of AGGF1 were decreased in preeclamptic placentas as compared with the normotensive control group (P < 0.05).

The onset time was unclear. CT showed an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery without early ischemic changes. MRI revealed a negative fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) pattern, in which several small acute infarcts were seen in diffusion-weighted images with no corresponding hyperintensity lesions on FLAIR. Accordingly, intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (0.6 mg/kg, the dose approved in Japan) was administered at 1,660 minutes after the last known well and 116 minutes after the symptom recognition. An immediate internal carotid angiogram showed severe stenosis at the distal end of the horizontal portion of the left middle cerebral artery. In the follow-up angiogram at 164 minutes after the symptom recognition, the stenotic lesion almost resolved with the restoration of quick and nearly complete antegrade flow. Her symptoms also resolved promptly. Although the use of MRI is recommended to be minimized in the emergency stroke management during the COVID-19 pandemic, MRI is occasionally mandatory for patient selection, such as cases with unclear onset to perform intravenous thrombolysis.

The authors' preferred technique is a robotic low anterior resection that requires a hybrid approach with laparoscopic hand-assisted mobilization of the left colon and robotic assistance for rectal dissection. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of this approach as it relates to intra-operative and short-term outcomes. METHOD Between August 2005 and July 2011, consecutive patients undergoing rectal dissection for cancer via the hybrid robotic technique were included in our study. Demographics, margin positivity, intra-operative and short-term outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS The preferred approach was performed in 77 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. Of these, 68 underwent low anterior resection and nine had a coloanal pull-through procedure (mean age 60.1 years; mean body mass index 28.0 kg/m(2) ; mean operative time 327 min; conversion rate 3.9%). Three patients (3.9%) had positive resection margins (one circumferential, two distal). Five patients had an anastomotic leak (6.4%). No robot-specific complications were observed. CONCLUSION The hybrid approach involving hand-assisted left colon mobilization and robotic rectal dissection is a safe and feasible technique for minimally invasive low anterior resection.

Acupuncture is considered a good alternative therapy for PDM. However, the central mechanism of the analgesic effect of acupuncture is largely unknown. In this study, eligible patients were randomized into the real and sham acupuncture groups using a computer-generated, permuted block randomization method. The study cohort comprised 34 patients: 19 in the real acupuncture group and 15 in the sham acupuncture group. The clinical characteristics of the patients during their menstrual period were collected, and imaging scans were performed during the first 3 days of the patients' menstrual period. We analyzed task and resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to investigate the potential central mechanism of the immediate effect of acupuncture intervention on the intensity of PDM pain. The task fMRI study found that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and right supplemental motor area were activated during real acupuncture. Using the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) method, we found a post- versus pre-treatment change in the FC of the rACC and left precentral gyrus in the comparison of real acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. In addition, the FC of the rACC-left precentral gyrus at baseline was negatively correlated with short-term analgesia, while the change in the FC of the rACC-left precentral gyrus was positively correlated with short-term analgesia after acupuncture treatment. These findings support the importance of rACC-left precentral gyrus resting-state FC in the modulation of the intensity of PDM pain through acupuncture, which may shed light on the central mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of PDM.","Wang, Yanan; Xu, Jing; Zhang, Qing; Zhang, Qi; Yang, Ya; Wei, Wei; Guo, Xiaoli; Liang, Fanrong; Yu, Siyi; Yang, Jie",Frontiers in neuroscience,418,1

Our aim, therefore, was to establish the optimal autonomic testing protocol that best predicts cardiovascular capacity during competition by comprehensively examining autonomic function in elite wheelchair rugby athletes with cervical SCI and thereby enhance the standardized classification. Twenty-six individuals with cervical SCI (C4-C8; AIS A, B, C) participated in this study during the 2015 Parapan American Games in Toronto, Canada. Clinic autonomic testing included: sympathetic skin responses, baseline hemodynamics, orthostatic challenge test, and cold-pressor tests. Further, we completed standard motor/sensory assessments and obtained each participants' International Wheelchair Rugby Federation classification. These clinic metrics were correlated to in-competition heart rate monitoring obtained during competition. The current study provides novel evidence that the change in systolic blood pressure during an orthostatic challenge test predicts approximately 50% of the in-competition peak heart rate (P<.001). Conversely, International Wheelchair Rugby Federation classification was poorly associated with in-competition peak heart rate (R2 =.204; P<.05). Autonomic testing provides deep insight regarding preserved autonomic control after SCI that is associated with performance in elite wheelchair rugby athletes. As such, incorporating assessments of cardiovascular capacity in classification will help to ensure a level playing field and may obviate the need for practices such as boosting to gain an advantage due to poor cardiovascular control.","Squair, J W; Phillips, A A; Currie, K D; Gee, C; Krassioukov, A V",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,418,1

Traditional pathways to risk assess for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) would involve face-to-face assessment to formulate an appropriate management plan following an initial presentation usually in secondary care or in-hospital settings. Appropriate antithrombotic measures can prevent complication of DVT such as pulmonary embolism with prompt early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS This observational, pilot study evaluates the possibility of combining telemedicine technology and a virtual examination pathway for remote triage and assessment of patients with suspected DVT. RESULTS Piloting and development of a virtual risk assessment pathway for DVT involves various challenges and multidisciplinary co-ordination. CONCLUSION Advances in telecommunication technology can enable clinicians, specialist nurses and hospital departments to develop a virtual examination pathway for remote triage and assessment of patients with suspected DVT. This pathway is not a replacement for conventional 'face-to-face' evaluation, but we believe the template can be explored and refined to act as a blueprint for future applications even when the pandemic has stabilised.","Iyengar, Karthikeyan P; Jain, Vijay Kumar; Soni, Manjusha; Hakim, Zuned",Postgraduate medical journal,418,1

We present our initial experience with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery of partial adrenalectomy (LESS-PA) to treat aldosterone-producing adenomas. CASE PRESENTATION A 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with aldosterone-producing macroadenomas in the left adrenal and aldosterone-producing microadenomas in the right adrenal. A two-step operation was planned. The first step involved transumbilical LESS-PA for the left adrenal tumors. A multichannel port was inserted through the center of the umbilicus and the left adrenal gland was approached using bent instruments according to standard traditional laparoscopic procedures. The tumors were resected using an ultrasonic scalpel, and the resected site was coagulated using a vessel sealing instrument and then sealed with fibrin glue. Operative time was 123 minutes and blood loss was minimal. The patient was discharged from hospital within 72 hours. Her right adrenal microadenomas will be treated in the next several months. CONCLUSIONS Although our experience is limited, LESS-PA appears to be safe and feasible for treating aldosterone-producing adenomas. More cases and comparisons with the multiport technique are needed before drawing any definite conclusions concerning the technique.","Yuge, Kazuyuki; Miyajima, Akira; Hasegawa, Masanori; Miyazaki, Yasumasa; Maeda, Takahiro; Takeda, Toshikazu; Takeda, Ayano; Miyashita, Kazutoshi; Kurihara, Isao; Shibata, Hirotaka; Kikuchi, Eiji; Oya, Mototsugu",BMC urology,418,1

We used this denominator to identify opportunities for improved donor conversion at one OPO, Indiana Donor Network (INOP). We sought to determine whether such analyses are immediately actionable for quality improvement (QI) initiatives directed at increased donor conversion. CALC-based assessment of INOP's performance revealed an opportunity to improve conversion of older donors. Following the QI initiative, INOP donor yield rose by 44%, while organs transplanted rose by 29%. These changes tolerated temporary disruption around the COVID-19 pandemic. Improved donor yield was primarily seen in older groups identified by CALC-based methods. Process changes in resource allocation and monitoring were associated with a 57% increase in the number of potential donors approached in the QI period and a subsequent rise in the number of potential donor referrals, suggesting positive feedback at area hospitals. Post-intervention, INOP's projected donation performance rose from 51st to 18th among all OPOs. OPOs can use CALC death data to accurately assess donor conversion by categories including age and race/ethnicity. These data can be used in real time to inform OPO-level processes to maximize donor recovery.","Doby, Brianna L; Hanner, Kellie; Johnson, Steven; Purnell, Tanjala S; Shah, Malay B; Lynch, Raymond J",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,418,19

A previous scoping review and expert consultation survey identified 15 potential low-value intra-hospital practices in the adult orthopaedic trauma population. Limiting the frequency of such practices could reduce adverse events, improve clinical outcomes and free up resources. The aim of this study is to synthesise the evidence on intra-hospital practices for orthopaedic injuries, previously identified as potentially of low value. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Epistemonikos to identify systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies that evaluate selected practices according to a priori PICOS statements (Population-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome-Study design) . We will evaluate the methodological quality for systematic reviews using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews version 2 (AMSTAR-2). Risk of bias in original studies will be evaluated with the Cochrane revised tool for RCTs (RoB2) and with the risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. If for a given practice, more than two original studies on our primary outcome are identified, we will conduct meta-analysis using a random effects model and assess heterogeneity using the I2 index. We will assess credibility of evidence (I-IV) based on statistical significance, sample size, heterogeneity and bias as per published criteria. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required as original data will not be collected. Knowledge users from three level I trauma centres are involved in the design and conduct of the study in accordance with an integrated knowledge translation approach. Findings related to the rapid review will be available in May 2020. They will be presented to key stakeholders to inform discussions and raise awareness on low-value injury care. In addition, results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal, at national and international scientific meetings and to healthcare associations.","Bérubé, Mélanie; Moore, Lynne; Leduc, Stéphane; Farhat, Imen; Lesieur, Martin; Lamontagne, Jean; Pelet, Stéphane; Berry, Gregory; Tardif, Pier-Alexandre; Côté, Caroline; Paquet, Jérôme",BMJ open,418,16

Forty subjects with solitary thyroid nodule planned for thyroid lobectomy were enrolled consecutively in both centers. Intervention was randomized by block randomization into two groups (VSSL, CTL). Primary outcomes were operative time and intraoperative blood loss. Secondary outcomes were postoperative blood loss and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. There was clinically significant less operative time (VSSL/CTL = 62.4 ± 15.9/83.3 ± 16.1 min, p < 0.001) and less intraoperative blood loss (VSSL/CTL = 40.5 ± 19.1/63.3 ± 22.4 mL, p = 0.001) in VSSL group compared with CTL group. There was no significant difference of postoperative blood loss (VSSL/CTL = 58.8 ± 30.6/76.0 ± 36.9 mL, p = 0.116) between both the groups. There was one case of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury found in both groups. VSSL with the new LigaSure™ Small Jaw Instrument was better than conventional technique in terms of shortening operative time. It was also better in reducing intraoperative hemorrhage, but this effect did not exceed clinically significant levels. Postoperative blood loss and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury were not significantly different between both the groups.","Hirunwiwatkul, Prakobkiat; Tungkavivachagul, Sutumma",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,418,29

This is partly because evidence for which genes are implicated in testis size variation tends to come from investigations involving just one or a few species. Contemporary comparative phylogenetic methods provide an opportunity to test candidate genes for their role in phenotypic change at a macro-evolutionary scale-across species and over millions of years. Previous attempts to detect genotype-phenotype associations across species have been limited in that they can only detect where genes have driven directional selection (e.g. brain size increase). RESULTS Here, we introduce an approach that uses rates of evolutionary change to overcome this limitation to test whether any of twelve candidate genes have driven testis size evolution across tetrapod vertebrates-regardless of directionality. We do this by seeking a relationship between the rates of genetic and phenotypic evolution. Our results reveal five genes (Alkbh5, Dmrtb1, Pld6, Nlrp3, Sp4) that each have played unique and complex roles in tetrapod testis size diversity. In all five genes, we find strong significant associations between the rate of protein-coding substitutions and the rate of testis size evolution. Such an association has never, to our knowledge, been tested before for any gene or phenotype. CONCLUSIONS We describe a new approach to tackle one of the most fundamental questions in biology: how do individual genes give rise to biological diversity? The ability to detect genotype-phenotype associations that have acted across species has the potential to build a picture of how natural selection has sculpted phenotypic change over millions of years.","Baker, Joanna; Meade, Andrew; Venditti, Chris",BMC biology,418,12

Great improvement in endovascular techniques was provided by the introduction of Onyx with different kinds of approach. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and the safety of Onyx embolization of brain AVMs with the double arterial catheterization technique (DACT). METHODS This was a retrospective study. From January 2006 until June 2011, 61 AVMs eligible for the DACT were treated. Forty-one of the 61 AVMs were treated with single arterial catheterization technique and 20 of 61 with DACT; patient age and Spetzler-Martin AVM grade were similar in the 2 groups. RESULTS In the DACT group, we obtained complete occlusion of the nidus in all small AVMs, whereas in the single arterial catheterization technique group, we obtained complete occlusion in only 1 of the 36% of the cases. Among the medium-size AVMs, there were no significant differences in the 2 groups, but we performed fewer procedures per patient when we used the DACT (1.4 vs 2.2). In the DACT group, we observed fewer hemorrhagic complications (3.4% vs 12.5% per procedure) and lower morbidity (5% vs 7% per patient) and mortality (0% vs 2.4%) rates. CONCLUSION The DACT in multifeeder AVMs may lead to a higher occlusion rate of the nidus for small AVMs and reduce the number of procedures, ensuring a higher standard of safety because of the possibility of managing the progression of Onyx into venous drainage.","Renieri, Leonardo; Consoli, Arturo; Scarpini, Giulia; Grazzini, Giulia; Nappini, Sergio; Mangiafico, Salvatore",Neurosurgery,418,33

Our aim was to investigate, using a bench-top model, the effect of different ventilator settings and positions of the exhalation port and nebulizer on the amount of albuterol delivered to a lung simulator. METHODS A lung model simulating spontaneous breathing was connected to a single-limb NIV ventilator, set in bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) with inspiratory/expiratory pressures of 10/5, 15/10, 15/5, and 20/10 cmH2O, or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5 and 10 cmH2O. Three delivery circuits were tested: a vented mask with the nebulizer directly connected to the mask, and an unvented mask with a leak port placed before and after the nebulizer. Albuterol was collected on a filter placed after the mask and then the delivered amount was measured with infrared spectrophotometry. RESULTS Albuterol delivery during NIV varied between 6.7 ± 0.4% to 37.0 ± 4.3% of the nominal dose. The amount delivered in CPAP and BIPAP modes was similar (22.1 ± 10.1 vs. 24.0 ± 10.0%, p = 0.070). CPAP level did not affect delivery (p = 0.056); in BIPAP with 15/5 cmH2O pressure the delivery was higher compared to 10/5 cmH2O (p = 0.033) and 20/10 cmH2O (p = 0.014). Leak port position had a major effect on delivery in both CPAP and BIPAP, the best performances were obtained with the unvented mask, and the nebulizer placed between the leak port and the mask (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this model, albuterol delivery was marginally affected by ventilatory settings in NIV, while position of the leak port had a major effect. Nebulizers should be placed between an unvented mask and the leak port in order to maximize aerosol delivery.","Sutherasan, Yuda; Ball, Lorenzo; Raimondo, Pasquale; Caratto, Valentina; Sanguineti, Elisa; Costantino, Federico; Ferretti, Maurizio; Kacmarek, Robert M; Pelosi, Paolo",BMC pulmonary medicine,418,30

This has led to the growing interest in surgical correction of the acquired deformity with either ""super construct"" internal fixation implants or fine-wire static circular external fixation. The use of static circular external fixation without implants has been demonstrated to achieve high rates of deformity correction with low complication rates. The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of pin site infection in this high-risk patient population. METHODS Over an 11-year period, 283 consecutive diabetic patients underwent single-stage correction of Charcot foot deformity with static fine-wire circular external fixation and no internal fixation devices. Pin care was minimal. RESULTS Fifty-nine (20.8%) patients developed clinical signs of pin tract infection in at least 1 pin site. Forty-nine occurred in patients undergoing surgical correction of deformity in the foot. Eight occurred in patients undergoing surgical correction at the ankle level and 2 in patients undergoing complex reconstruction for combined foot and ankle deformity. Higher rates of pin site infections were observed in patients with osteomyelitis present at the time of surgery (25.6%) as compared with patients without evidence of infection (17.8%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .1184). There was no correlation between body mass index and pin site infection (P = .288). There was a statistically significant trend (P < .05) for higher rates of pin site infection in patients with elevated hemoglobin A1C levels. Erythema and drainage resolved in all patients with local pin care and empiric oral antibiotic therapy. None of the wires were removed prematurely, and all infections resolved following removal of the circular external fixator at the scheduled time for removal. CONCLUSIONS Pin site infection was common following surgical correction of the acquired deformity associated with Charcot foot. These acquired pin site infections were a nuisance but did not appear to add permanent morbidity or require additional surgery to resolve.

Filoviruses use a class I fusion protein, GP(1,2), to bind to an unknown, but shared, cell surface receptor to initiate virus-cell fusion. In addition to GP(1,2), ebolaviruses and cuevaviruses, but not marburgviruses, express two secreted glycoproteins, soluble GP (sGP) and small soluble GP (ssGP). All three glycoproteins have identical N termini that include the receptor-binding region (RBR) but differ in their C termini. We evaluated the effect of the secreted ebolavirus glycoproteins on marburgvirus and ebolavirus cell entry, using Fc-tagged recombinant proteins. Neither sGP-Fc nor ssGP-Fc bound to filovirus-permissive cells or inhibited GP(1,2)-mediated cell entry of pseudotyped retroviruses. Surprisingly, several Fc-tagged Δ-peptides, which are small C-terminal cleavage products of sGP secreted by ebolavirus-infected cells, inhibited entry of retroviruses pseudotyped with Marburg virus GP(1,2), as well as Marburg virus and Ebola virus infection in a dose-dependent manner and at low molarity despite absence of sequence similarity to filovirus RBRs. Fc-tagged Δ-peptides from three ebolaviruses (Ebola virus, Sudan virus, and Taï Forest virus) inhibited GP(1,2)-mediated entry and infection of viruses comparably to or better than the Fc-tagged RBRs, whereas the Δ-peptide-Fc of an ebolavirus nonpathogenic for humans (Reston virus) and that of an ebolavirus with lower lethality for humans (Bundibugyo virus) had little effect. These data indicate that Δ-peptides are functional components of ebolavirus proteomes. They join cathepsins and integrins as novel modulators of filovirus cell entry, might play important roles in pathogenesis, and could be exploited for the synthesis of powerful new antivirals.","Radoshitzky, Sheli R; Warfield, Kelly L; Chi, Xiaoli; Dong, Lian; Kota, Krishna; Bradfute, Steven B; Gearhart, Jacqueline D; Retterer, Cary; Kranzusch, Philip J; Misasi, John N; Hogenbirk, Marc A; Wahl-Jensen, Victoria; Volchkov, Viktor E; Cunningham, James M; Jahrling, Peter B; Aman, M Javad; Bavari, Sina; Farzan, Michael; Kuhn, Jens H",Journal of virology,418,11

METHODS Twenty-eight patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for rectal adenocarcinoma with submucosal invasion or a rectal neuroendocrine tumor at our hospital between January 2005 and December 2012. A group of 14 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery with previous ER was compared to a group of 14 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery without previous ER. RESULTS Though most fibrosis involved the submucosa after polypectomy and endoscopic mucosal resection, fibrosis after endoscopic submucosal dissection involved the muscularis propria in two patients, and the subserosa in one patient. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between the groups. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery after ER for rectal tumors is safe and feasible.

Among 147 staff members, 21.8%, 24.5%, and 12.9% reported depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. The results of structural equation modeling showed that self-efficacy and coping strategies had direct effects on psychological well-being. In the paths from self-perceived caregiving to psychological well-being, self-efficacy and positive coping strategies played mediating roles independently and together, and social support played a mediating role together with coping strategies. Care home staff's psychological well-being was undermined during the COVID-19 lockdown. Interventions aimed at improving staff's self-efficacy, adoption of positive coping strategies, and avoidance of negative coping strategies or considerations of social support along with coping strategies are suggested to decrease exhibited symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.

Domain organization in Hsp70 dictates ATPase activity, ATP dependent allosteric regulation, client/substrate binding and release, and interactions with co-chaperones. The protein quality control activities of Hsp70 are classified as foldase, holdase, and disaggregase activities. Co-chaperones directly assisting protein refolding included J domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors. However, co-chaperones can also be grouped and explored based on which domain of Hsp70 they interact. Here we discuss how the network of cytosolic co-chaperones for Hsp70 contributes to the functions of Hsp70 while closely looking at their structural features. Comparison of domain organization and the structures of co-chaperones enables greater understanding of the interactions, mechanisms of action, and roles played in protein quality control.","Karunanayake, Chamithi; Page, Richard C",Experimental biology and medicine,418,5

Although no patients in this trial had renal insufficiency, in cautious response to this announcement, the trial protocol was changed from an intravenous administration of 0.2 mmol/Kg of a conventional Gd-based MR contrast agent to 0.1 mmol/Kg of gadobenate dimeglumine. The study described herein compares the signal quality of pulmonary MRA performed with double dose conventional agent to single dose gadobenate dimeglumine. This study is a retrospective analysis of data from a prospective, multicenter study in men and women ≥18 years with documented presence or absence of PE. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at all participating centers, and all patients provided written indication of informed consent. We performed both objective and subjective analysis of pulmonary artery image quality. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the main pulmonary artery were assessed in single and double dose protocols and compared. SNR and CNR of the main PA were correlated with subjective quality assessment of main/lobar, segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Although there were individual outliers, both SNR (P = 0.01) and CNR (P = 0.008) were higher in all quartiles for examinations using gadobenate dimeglumine than with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Subjective quality of vascular signal intensity at each vessel order was significantly better for gadobenate dimeglumine (P < 0.0001), and correlated well with SNR and CNR at each order (<0.001). Because of agent high relaxivity, a single dose of gadobenate dimeglumine provides better pulmonary MRA signal quality than double dose of a conventional Gd-based MR contrast agent.","Woodard, Pamela K; Chenevert, Thomas L; Sostman, H Dirk; Jablonski, Kathleen A; Stein, Paul D; Goodman, Lawrence R; Londy, Frank J; Narra, Vamsidhar; Hales, Charles A; Hull, Russell D; Tapson, Victor F; Weg, John G",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,418,28

METHODS SENTIS is a previously published prospective randomized controlled trial. We analyzed the demographic information, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scores (NIHSS) on day 4, discharge disposition and 90-day modified Rankin Score (mRS). Univariate models were constructed to determine the impact of discharge disposition on 90-day outcomes as well as the association of the day 4 NIHSS with outcomes. RESULTS A total of 292 patients with a mean age of 65 ± 14 years were analyzed. Discharge disposition was distributed as follows: 153 (52.1%) to an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), 111 (38.0%) to home and 28 (9.6%) to a skilled nursing facility (SNF). Only 2 out of 28 patients (7.1%) discharged to a SNF achieved a 90-day mRS ≤ 2 compared with 60/153 (39.2%) in the IRF group (OR 8.39 (95% CI 1.92 to 36.64), p = 0.0047). This association persisted after adjusting for age and admission NIHSS. Only 3 of 50 patients (6%) with a NIHSS of ≥ 14 at day 4 achieved a mRS 0-2 at day 90. CONCLUSIONS This analysis shows that discharge to an IRF is associated with better neurological outcomes than discharge to a SNF. Additionally, patients with a NIHSS of ≥ 14 at day 4 are unlikely to achieve independent function.","Belagaje, Samir R; Zander, Kay; Thackeray, Lisa; Gupta, Rishi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,418,1

One proposed benefit is a decrease in narcotic usage and peri-operative pain when compared to traditional multiple incision VATS. The purpose of this study was to determine the post-operative narcotic usage between patients undergoing anatomic lobectomy via traditional VATS as compared to patients undergoing uniportal VATS. METHODS All consecutive patients undergoing anatomic lobectomy for presumed malignancy by a single surgeon at an academic medical institution were recorded between July 2013 and September 2015. Patients were excluded if they were narcotic dependent prior to the operation, if they had an epidural catheter placed, or if they were under 18 years of age. All narcotics were converted to oral morphine equivalents (OMEq) using standard formulas. RESULTS Data were collected on 84 patients. There was no difference between groups with regard to age, gender, tumor size, length of stay, or duration of post-operative thoracostomy. The groups had a similar rate of complications including post-operative atrial fibrillation and need for prolonged thoracostomy. Patients undergoing uniportal VATS had significantly lower narcotic usage in the recovery room, and on post-operative days 1 and 2. In addition, the total narcotic usage during their inpatient stay was significantly lower for patients undergoing uniportal VATS. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal VATS is a safe and effective strategy for the surgical management of benign and malignant lung disease. In patients undergoing anatomic lobectomy, there was an association with significantly less post-operative narcotic usage in patients undergoing uniportal VATS when compared to traditional VATS. This emerging technology may benefit patients by allowing less narcotic usage during their post-operative hospitalization.","Louis, Scott Gregory; Gibson, William James; King, Chase Lynn; Veeramachaneni, Nirmal Kumar",Journal of visualized surgery,418,1

However, the ability of the V protein to suppress host innate immunity is not well understood. In this study, we explored the function of V protein and its relationship with virulence by generating V protein-inserted recombinant (r) NDVs. Using rNDVs as a model, we examined the efficiency of infection, IFN responses, and apoptosis of host cells during infection. We found that viral propagation occurred smoothly when V protein from lentogenic NDV is inserted instead of the V protein from the velogenic strain. The infection of lentogenic V protein-inserted rNDV induced less expression of IFNs and downstream antiviral proteins via efficient degradation of p-STAT1 and MDA5. Moreover, velogenic V protein triggered a higher apoptosis rate during infection thereby restricting the replication of NDV. Conversely, lentogenic V protein inhibits IFN responses efficiently and induces less apoptosis compared to the velogenic strain. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the role of V protein in NDV pathogenicity.","Nan, Fu Long; Zhang, He; Nan, Wen Long; Xie, Chang Zhan; Ha, Zhuo; Chen, Xing; Xu, Xiao Hong; Qian, Jing; Qiu, Xu Sheng; Ge, Jin Ying; Bu, Zhi Gao; Zhang, Ying; Lu, Hui Jun; Jin, Ning Yi",Veterinary microbiology,418,1

During the outbreak of an infectious disease, the population’s psychological reactions play a crucial role in affecting both the spread of the disease and the occurrence of emotional distress. It is recognized that there are number of techniques and tools which are used to detect the depression. To assess whether the individual is depressed or not, machine learning techniques are used. The course of action is based on texts, images, videos and emoticons etc. Among different techniques, it is analyzed that none of the technique is using the probability method to detect the depression. In probability method, one can create a database, which is a collection of words related to emotions like happiness, sadness and anger etc., The probability would be set for all such words in the database and then it will be calculated by various techniques which shows the level of depression of a person. This paper summarized the findings on the identification of depressive mood disorders, using emotion analysis methods and techniques.

Virus-cell membrane fusion is mediated by the virus envelope complex, and its fusogenicity is the result of an active virus-cell interaction process that induces conformation changes within the envelope. For some viruses, such as influenza, exposure to an acidic milieu within the cell during the early steps of infection triggers the necessary structural changes. However, for other pathogens which are not exposed to such environmental stress, activation of fusogenicity can result from precise thiol/disulfide rearrangements mediated by either an endogenous redox autocatalytic isomerase or a cell-associated oxidoreductase. Study of the activation of HIV envelope fusogenicity has revealed new knowledge about how redox changes within a viral envelope trigger fusion. We discuss these findings and their implication for anti-HIV therapy. In addition, to compare and contrast the situation outlined for HIV with an enveloped virus that can fuse with the cell plasma membrane independent of the redox status of its envelope protein, we review parallel data obtained on SARS coronavirus entry.","Fenouillet, Emmanuel; Barbouche, Rym; Jones, Ian M",Antioxidants & redox signaling,418,16

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and current concerns about the risk of an avian influenza (H5N1) pandemic, have made a review of this area timely. We searched the major literature databases between 1960 and 2005, and then screened titles and abstracts, and finally selected 40 original studies based on a set of criteria. We established a review panel comprising medical and engineering experts in the fields of microbiology, medicine, epidemiology, indoor air quality, building ventilation, etc. Most panel members had experience with research into the 2003 SARS epidemic. The panel systematically assessed 40 original studies through both individual assessment and a 2-day face-to-face consensus meeting. Ten of 40 studies reviewed were considered to be conclusive with regard to the association between building ventilation and the transmission of airborne infection. There is strong and sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, air movements in buildings and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and SARS. There is insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools, offices, homes and isolation rooms in relation to spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. PRACTICAL IMPLICATION: The strong and sufficient evidence of the association between ventilation, the control of airflow direction in buildings, and the transmission and spread of infectious diseases supports the use of negatively pressurized isolation rooms for patients with these diseases in hospitals, in addition to the use of other engineering control methods. However, the lack of sufficient data on the specification and quantification of the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools and offices in relation to the spread of airborne infectious diseases, suggest the existence of a knowledge gap. Our study reveals a strong need for a multidisciplinary study in investigating disease outbreaks, and the impact of indoor air environments on the spread of airborne infectious diseases.","Li, Y; Leung, G M; Tang, J W; Yang, X; Chao, C Y H; Lin, J Z; Lu, J W; Nielsen, P V; Niu, J; Qian, H; Sleigh, A C; Su, H-J J; Sundell, J; Wong, T W; Yuen, P L",Indoor air,418,15

Previous studies have demonstrated that NOTES procedures are associated with less postoperative pain and faster recovery times. This study analyzes intraoperative and postoperative opioid use for TVC compared with traditional four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCs). METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive TVC and LC female patients between August 2009 and August 2012 in an academic institution. We compared demographics, intraoperative and postoperative opioid use and times in the operating room (OR) and in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). RESULTS A total of 68 TVC and 67 LC patients were included in this study. The TVC and LC groups were similar in terms of age (both 41 years) and body mass index (29 and 31 kg/m2, respectively). The intraoperative preparation, surgical, and emergence times were significantly longer for the TVC than for the LC (p ≤ 0.01). Compared with the LC group, the intraoperative opioid requirement was significantly greater (TVC 27 mg vs. LC 25 mg; p = 0.003), but after adjusting for anesthesia time, the difference in OR opioid consumption became non-significant (p = 0.08). The PACU opioid requirement (TVC 2.5 vs. LC 5 mg; p = 0.04) was significantly lower for the TVC group, and a greater proportion of patients did not need any pain medications (TVC 38 % vs. LC 21 %; p = 0.04), compared with the LC group. The average PACU pain scores were not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.45). CONCLUSION TVC patients did not experience more pain than LC patients. Although the average pain scores of TVC patients did not differ from those of the LC patients, TVC patients did require less pain medication in the PACU.","Wood, Stephanie G; Dabu-Bondoc, Susan; Dai, Feng; Mikhael, Hosni; Vadivelu, Nalini; Roberts, Kurt E",Surgical endoscopy,418,9

The virus was identified in all 91 palm civets and 15 raccoon dogs of animal market origin sampled prior to culling, but not in 1,107 palm civets later sampled at 25 farms, spread over 12 provinces, which were claimed to be the source of traded animals. Twenty-seven novel signature variation residues (SNVs) were identified on the spike gene and were analyzed for their phylogenetic relationships, based on 17 sequences obtained from animals in our study and from other published studies. Analysis indicated that the virus in palm civets at the live-animal market had evolved to infect humans. The evolutionary starting point was a prototype group consisting of three viral sequences of animal origin. Initially, seven SNV sites caused six amino acid changes, at positions 147, 228, 240, 479, 821, and 1080 of the spike protein, to generate low-pathogenicity viruses. One of these was linked to the first SARS patient in the 2003-2004 period.

The resulting high-pathogenicity groups were responsible for infections during the so-called early-phase epidemic of 2003. Finally, the remaining six SNVs caused four amino acid changes, at positions 227, 244, 344, and 778, which resulted in the group of viruses responsible for the global epidemic.","Kan, Biao; Wang, Ming; Jing, Huaiqi; Xu, Huifang; Jiang, Xiugao; Yan, Meiying; Liang, Weili; Zheng, Han; Wan, Kanglin; Liu, Qiyong; Cui, Buyun; Xu, Yanmei; Zhang, Enmin; Wang, Hongxia; Ye, Jingrong; Li, Guichang; Li, Machao; Cui, Zhigang; Qi, Xiaobao; Chen, Kai; Du, Lin; Gao, Kai; Zhao, Yu-Teng; Zou, Xiao-Zhong; Feng, Yue-Ju; Gao, Yu-Fan; Hai, Rong; Yu, Dongzhen; Guan, Yi; Xu, Jianguo",Journal of virology,418,16

For the evaluation of the NVI ELISA, field sera collected from cattle in England and Sweden were tested in parallel with an ELISA in use at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), Weybridge. The tests showed 96% agreement. The sensitivity and specificity of the NVI ELISA relative to the CVL ELISA were 94% and 100%, respectively. There was evidence that the difference in sensitivity between the 2 tests was due to the detection of both IgG and IgM class antibodies by the CVL ELISA, whereas the NVI ELISA was designed specifically to detect IgG1. Milk and serum samples from individual cows were tested by the NVI ELISA for presence of antibodies to BRSV. There was a good correlation between the ability to detect antibodies in serum and the ability to detect them in milk, although the antibody titer was generally lower in milk than in serum. Bulk milk samples were collected from farms with severe clinical symptoms of respiratory distress and from farms with no history of respiratory disease. There was a clear distinction between antibody levels in diseased and healthy herds. The NVI ELISA is a rapid and reliable test for detecting antibodies to BRSV in milk, bulk milk, and serum samples.","Elvander, M; Edwards, S; Näslund, K; Linde, N","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",418,16

DATA SOURCES A MEDLINE search was performed using the following terms: severe acute respiratory syndrome and SARS virus. Additional information and references were obtained from the Web sites for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and Health Canada. STUDY SELECTION Recent case series were used to develop a review of the epidemiology, clinical features, outcomes, and management of patients with SARS from an intensive care unit (ICU) perspective. This was supplemented by epidemiology information obtained from other Web-based sources. Recent published studies describing the etiology of SARS were also included. DATA SYNTHESIS SARS has rapidly spread from Southeast Asia to numerous countries, including Canada and the United States. A new coronavirus has been isolated and detected from many affected patients. The mortality rate worldwide is approximately 10.5%. From five cohorts, the ICU admission rate ranged from 20% to 38%. Fifty-nine percent to 100% of the ICU patients required mechanical ventilatory support. The mortality rate of SARS patients admitted to the ICU ranged from 5% to 67%. The most common clinical symptoms and signs are fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgias, malaise, and inspiratory crackles. Common laboratory abnormalities included mild leukopenia, lymphopenia, and increased aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The chest radiograph pattern ranged from focal infiltrates to diffuse airspace disease. Management consisted of isolation, strict respiratory and contact precautions, ventilatory support as needed, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. Predictors of mortality included advanced age, the presence of comorbidities, and a high lactic dehydrogenase or high neutrophil count at admission. CONCLUSIONS SARS is a highly contagious, infectious process that can advance to significant hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring ICU monitoring and support. Early recognition is critical for effective management and containment of this disease.","Manocha, Sanjay; Walley, Keith R; Russell, James A",Critical care medicine,418,26

Association of SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Load Trends with Clinical Status in COVID-19:A Retrospective Analysis from an Academic Hospital Center in New York City,14.641407,11.810412,2020,"In early February 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) began receiving reports of patients with a syndrome characterized by an atypical pneumonia with rapid progression to respiratory failure without an identified cause despite extensive diagnostic workups. Most of these reports pointed out that the outbreak started in Southern China, specifically in the Guandong Province. The initial outbreak in South East Asia has already spread to other Regions in Asia, Europe, North and South America, and South Africa. Many of these cases can be linked through chains of transmission to an index case from the Guandong Province who visited Hong Kong. Although the exact mode of transmission has not been clearly established, the etiology of this syndrome has already been identified. A novel Coronavirus has been identified by electron microscopy and molecular assays in multiple laboratories from respiratory specimens throughout the world. The syndrome has been defined as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) by WHO, and is characterized by an incubation period between 1 and 10 days (average 5 days) and by a febrile phase that usually lasts approximately 3 days. During the respiratory phase that begins around day 3, patients start developing a dry cough, shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilatory support is required in about 10 to 40% of cases and the case-fatality rate ranges between 3 and 16%. The laboratory findings in SARS cases include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a rise in transaminases and lactic dehydrogenase levels. Treatment of SARS includes supportive measures and the empiric use of ribavirin. Respiratory isolation, use of respiratory masks, and compulsory hand hygiene constitute the principal preventive measures. The confirmation of a case can be performed at reference laboratories by serologic and molecular assays. From the onset of this epidemic Mexico established a surveillance system as well as clinical guidelines and recommendations for the identification, prevention of secondary spread, and medical management of suspicious and probable cases by health care personnel.","Franco-Paredes, Carlos; Kuri-Morales, Pablo; Alvarez-Lucas, Carlos; Palacios-Zavala, Ethel; Nava-Frías, Margarita; Betancourt-Cravioto, Miguel; Santos-Preciado, José Ignacio; Tapia-Conyer, Roberto",Salud publica de Mexico,418,16

Effective preventive therapies are therefore a clinical priority. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the angiotensin-receptor blocker candesartan compared with placebo affects microalbuminuria incidence or rate of change in albuminuria in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. DESIGN 3 randomized trials of the DIRECT (Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trials) Program. SETTING 309 secondary care centers. PATIENTS 3326 and 1905 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Most were normotensive, and all had normoalbuminuria (median urinary albumin excretion rate, 5.0 microg/min). INTERVENTION Candesartan, 16 mg/d increasing to 32 mg/d, versus placebo. Assignment was done centrally using an interactive voice-response system. Patients, caregivers, and researchers were blinded to treatment assignment. During a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 793 patients discontinued therapy and 63 were lost to follow-up. MEASUREMENTS Urinary albumin excretion rate, assessed annually by 2 overnight collections; if it was 20 microg/min or greater, then 2 further collections were done. The primary end point was new microalbuminuria (3 or 4 collections of urinary albumin excretion rate >or=20 microg/min). The secondary end point was rate of change in albuminuria. RESULTS Individual and pooled results of the 3 trials showed that candesartan had little effect on risk for microalbuminuria (pooled hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.16]; P = 0.60). Pooled results showed that the annual rate of change in albuminuria was 5.53% lower (CI, 0.73% to 10.14%; P = 0.024) with candesartan than with placebo. LIMITATIONS Investigators recruited mainly normotensive patients or patients with well-controlled hypertension who were at low overall vascular risk, which resulted in a low rate of microalbuminuria. Studies were powered for retinal and not renal end points. CONCLUSION Candesartan, 32 mg/d, for 4.7 years did not prevent microalbuminuria in mainly normotensive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.","Bilous, Rudy; Chaturvedi, Nish; Sjølie, Anne Katrin; Fuller, John; Klein, Ronald; Orchard, Trevor; Porta, Massimo; Parving, Hans-Henrik",Annals of internal medicine,418,25

We used computer-based immunoinformatic analysis and the newly resolved 3-dimensional (3D) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimeric protein, together with analyses of the immunogenic profiles of SARS-CoV, to anticipate potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for vaccine design, particularly for peptide-driven vaccine design and serological diagnosis. Nine conserved linear B-cell epitopes and multiple discontinuous B-cell epitopes composed of 69 residues on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S protein were predicted to be highly antigenic. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a different antigenic profile than that of the SARS-CoV S protein due to the variations in their primary and 3D structures. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 may exploit an immune evasion mechanism through two point mutations in the critical and conserved linear neutralization epitope (overlap with fusion peptide) around a sparsely glycosylated area. These mutations lead to a significant decrease in the antigenicity of this epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In addition, 62 T-cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted in our study. The structure-based immunoinformatic analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in this study may improve vaccine design, diagnosis, and immunotherapy against the pandemic of COVID-19.","Wang, Dongliang; Mai, Jinhui; Zhou, Wenfeng; Yu, Wanting; Zhan, Yang; Wang, Naidong; Epstein, Neal D.; Yang, Yi",Vaccines,418,21

Intersectional gerontology considers the compounding effects of multiple forms of social inequity. This study explores how racial-nativity status, family income, education level and the intersecting profile of these three social standings stratify differential patterns of chronic conditions among Canadians aged 45 years and older. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the baseline Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (n = 29,748), multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds of having one and/or two (&#8804; 2) or multiple (&#8805;3) medical conditions (i.e., diabetes, asthma, cancer, previous heart attack, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obesity) based on socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: There were significant racial-nativity disparities and social-class gradients in multimorbidity. The odds of having &#8805;3 medical conditions were greater for Black immigrants (OR=1.79, 95% CI=1.13, 2.82), South Asian immigrants (OR=1.49, 95% CI=1.02, 2.19) and close to double for Aboriginal Canadians (OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.37, 2.80) relative to Canadian-born Whites. Black, South Asian and Aboriginal populations from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds had the highest odds of having &#8805;3 medical conditions (OR=3.50, 95% CI=1.41, 8.70). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Despite a universal health system, marginalized older Canadians who are racialized foreign-born, less educated, and/or low-income have a higher prevalence of multimorbidity that are associated with COVID-19 severe illness and mortality. Upstream health policy and social care tackling intersecting structural inequities should be undertaken to prevent increasing multimorbidity among underserved aging populations.","Lin, Shen Lamson",GerontologistGerontologist,418,1

METHODS: We used data on (1) PrEP use, (2) anal sex acts, and (3) condom use, per partner type [steady partners (SPs), known casual partners (KCPs), and unknown casual partners (UCPs)], collected daily through a mobile application used between December 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. We compared the period before versus after March 15, 2020, regarding average proportion of days per week at which each end point was reported and average proportion of anal sex acts covered by PrEP and/or condoms. RESULTS: We included data from 136 men who have sex with men. After March 15, 2020, the proportion of days with anal sex increased with SPs [odds ratio (OR) = 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.44) and decreased with KCPs (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.82) and UCPs (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.61). Shifts in partner types were most profound immediately after March 15, 2020, whereas returning to prerestriction levels mid-May 2020. The proportion of days with PrEP use decreased from 74% before to 58% after March 15, 2020 (P < 0.001). After March 15, 2020, PrEP use during sex decreased with UCPs (ß = -0.36; 95% CI = -0.72 to 0.00) but not with SPs and KCPs. Condom use during sex decreased with KCPs (ß = -0.36; 95% CI = -0.67 to 0.04) and UCPs (ß = -0.24; 95% CI = -0.46 to 0.03) but not with SPs. CONCLUSIONS: MSM decreased sex with casual partners and increased sex with SP, but changes were transient. Decreases in sex acts with casual partners paralleled decreases in PrEP use. However, condom use during sex with casual partners decreased, indicating the importance of continued sexual health services, including sexually transmitted infections screening and PrEP care, during COVID-19 restrictions.","Jongen, Vita W; Zimmermann, Hanne M L; Boyd, Anders; Hoornenborg, Elske; van den Elshout, Mark A M; Davidovich, Udi; van Duijnhoven, Yvonne T H P; de Vries, Henry J C; Prins, Maria; Schim van der Loeff, Maarten F; Coyer, Liza",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,418,6

Foram selecionados três representantes por família que foram inoculados pela via intraperitoneal em hamsters distribuídos em doze grupos (cada grupo recebeu uma estirpe diferente). Foi mantido um grupo controle que recebeu solução salina estéril pela mesma via. Após 16 dias da inoculação, os animais foram eutanasiados; os baços foram colhidos, pesados, macerados, suspendidos em solução salina estéril e diluídos. Cada uma das diluições foi semeada em duplicata em placas com meio de Petragnani, que foram incubadas a 37°C. Após 30 dias de incubação, foram realizadas as contagens de UFC e os resultados foram expressos em UFC de M. avium por grama de baço. As famílias genéticas apresentaram capacidade de virulência semelhante (p=0,49). As estirpes dentro das famílias PIG B e PIG D não apresentaram diferença na virulência (p=0,15 e p=0,87, respectivamente). Dentro da família PIG A, o isolado A52 foi mais virulento do que A1 e A162; a estirpe C122 se apresentou menos virulenta do que as estirpes C44 e C68 dentro da família PIG C.

Current periodontal treatment is limited by its dependency on patients learning and maintaining good dental habits, and repeated visits to oral health physicians. Vitamin C's role in collagen synthesis and immune function makes it important in wound healing and possibly periodontal healing. Therefore, if some patients are deficient, this may worsen patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients were invited to participate following assessment and treatment at the Westmead Centre of Oral Health Periodontic Clinic, regardless of current disease stage or treatment. Adults were eligible if they gave informed consent and had current periodontal disease. Study involvement consisted of periodontal assessment and care followed by an interview and measurement of serum vitamin C and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: A total of 6 out of 20 patients had vitamin C levels less than the institutional normal range, of whom 2 had levels <11.4 µmol/L and one <28 µmol/L. Low vitamin C was associated with higher periodontal disease stage (p = 0.03). Elevated CRP was found in 2/3 of people with low vitamin C and CRP was negatively correlated with vitamin C (p < 0.01). Vitamin C did not correlate with patient-reported fruit or vegetable consumption, but high processed meat intake was associated with lower vitamin C. CONCLUSION: Although a small study, this rate of vitamin C deficiency in the periodontal clinic is clinically important and correlations with disease severity and CRP suggests biological importance. This warrants further studies to assess vitamin C and whether supplementation improves periodontal outcomes, particularly in deficient subjects.","Munday, Molly-Rose; Rodricks, Rohan; Fitzpatrick, Michael; Flood, Victoria M; Gunton, Jenny E",Nutrients,418,6

Here, the approach is applied to compare the mortality trajectories of second-line and front-line European countries facing the COVID-19 epidemic wave. Using data up to mid-April, we show that the second-line countries generally followed relatively mild mortality curves rather than fast and severe ones. Thus, the continuation, after mid-April, of the COVID-19 wave across Europe was likely to be mitigated and not as strong as it was in most of the front-line countries first impacted by the wave (this prediction is corroborated by posterior data).","Soubeyrand, Samuel; Ribaud, Mélina; Baudrot, Virgile; Allard, Denis; Pommeret, Denys; Roques, Lionel",PLoS One,418,21

Central venous catheters have also been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Paradoxical embolism as an aetiological mechanism of ischaemic stroke should be considered in a highly prothrombotic context, where it may be more frequent. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old woman with a central venous catheter, with a large vessel ischaemic stroke, treated with mechanical thrombectomy for an atypical paradoxical embolism while in intensive care for bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. In the aetiological study, analysis highlighted an elevation of the D-dimer and right-left shunt with massive passage of contrast directly from the central peripheral access pathway in the left upper extremity to the left atrium in the transoesophageal echocardiogram. Thoracic tomographic angiography showed an anomalous venous structure with its origin in the subclavian vein and drainage to the segmental vein of the left upper lobe with direct emptying into the left atrium. Treatment consisted in anticoagulation until removal of the central venous catheter and simple anti-aggregating medication on discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Paradoxical embolism due to intra- or extra-cardiac shunt should be considered in patients with COVID-19, given the high associated risk of venous thromboembolism. Further studies are needed to be able to define optimal prophylactic and therapeutic management.","Ballvé-Martín, A; Boned, S; Rubiera, M",Rev Neurol,418,1

Critically ill COVID-19 patients have relatively well-preserved lung mechanics despite severe gas exchange abnormalities, a feature not consistent with classical ARDS but more consistent with pulmonary vascular disease. Many patients with severe COVID-19 also demonstrate markedly abnormal coagulation, with elevated d-dimers and higher rates of venous thromboembolism. We present four cases of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia with severe respiratory failure and shock, with evidence of markedly elevated dead-space ventilation who received tPA.

The causative agent of COVID-19 is SARS CoV-2, similar to its relative viruses SARS Cov-1 and MERS. Up till now, no vaccine has been developed against this disease and the only way one can stay safe is via prevention and developing one's immune system. Plants have been used since ancient times in herbal medicines and many chemicals and extracts in them are found to boost the immune system. Therefore, a consciously maintained diet consisting of plant-based immunity boosters is the need of the hour. Plants are known to provide many chemicals, natural therapeutics and vitamins which naturally enhance our immune system. Recently, vaccination research is also being carried out in transgenic plants. In this review, we have focused on highlighting some of the main players within the Kingdom Plantae which, when taken up in regular diet, can significantly boost our immune system capacity and thus provide the best possible measure to combat this pandemic.","Khan, Mudassir; Saddique, Muhammad Abu Bakar; Tahir, Huzaifa; Amjad, Muhammad Dawood; Ahmad, Abdullah; Masood, Usama; Khan, Dilawar",Infectious disorders.

This disease is caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and so far, little is known about this virus. In this study, by using plaque purification, we purified two SARS-CoV-2 virus strains from the same specimen, one named F8 containing a 12-bp deletion in the E gene and the other named 8X containing the wild-type E gene. There was no significant difference in the viral titer and infectivity of these two strains. The S protein content of the F8 viral culture was 0.39â µg/ml, much higher than that of 8X. An inactivated vaccine made from the F8 strain could trigger high levels of the IgG titer and neutralizing antibody titer, which could last for at least 6 weeks and were significantly higher than those from the 8X strain at 1 and 3 weeks post vaccination, respectively. In conclusion, we reported that both the E gene mutant and wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains were isolated from the same clinical sample by plaque purification. A 12-bp deletion in the E gene was important for SARS-CoV-2 replication and immunogenicity.","Sun, Yi-Sheng; Xu, Fang; An, Qi; Chen, Chen; Yang, Zhang-Nv; Lu, Hang-Jing; Chen, Jian-Cai; Yao, Ping-Ping; Jiang, Jian-Min; Zhu, Han-Ping",Emerg Microbes Infect,418,16

Both infection and death caused by SARS-CoV-2 are still rapidly increasing worldwide. In this study, we demonstrate that viral coding proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have distinct features and are most, medium and least conserved with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the rest four mild coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1), respectively. Moreover, expression of host responsive genes (HRG), HRG-enriched biological processes, and HRG-enriched KEGG pathways upon infection of SARS-CoV-2 show slightly overlapping with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but distinctive to the four mild coronaviruses. Interestingly, enrichment of overactivation of neutrophil by HRGs is only and commonly found in infections of severe SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV but not in the other four mild coronaviruses, and the related gene networks show different patterns. Clinical data supports that overactivation of neutrophil for severe patients can be one major factor for the similar clinical symptoms observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to infections of the other two severe coronavirus (SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV). Taken together, our study provides a mechanistic insight into SARS-CoV-2 epidemic via revealing the conserved and distinct features of SARS-CoV-2, raising the critical role of dysregulation of neutrophil for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Using daily data from 175 countries, we show that, even after controlling for other concurrent lockdown policies, cancelling public events, imposing restrictions on private gatherings and closing schools and workplaces had significant effects on reducing COVID-19 infections. Restrictions on internal movement and public transport had no effects because the aforementioned policies, imposed earlier on average, had already de facto reduced human mobility. International travel restrictions, although imposed early, had a short-lived effect failing to prevent the epidemic from turning into a pandemic because they were less stringent. We interpret the impact of each intervention on containing the pandemic using a conceptual framework which relies on their effects on human mobility behaviors in a manner consistent with time-use and epidemiological factors.","Askitas, Nikolaos; Tatsiramos, Konstantinos; Verheyden, Bertrand",Sci Rep,418,16

Especially during operations in the area of the upper respiratory tract, there is a significantly increased risk of infection with COVID-19 for everyone present in the operating room. The aim of the study is to analyze the validity of SARS-CoV-2 swabs taken preoperatively under suboptimal conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective comparison of the PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 swaps taken preoperatively and intraoperatively from 62 children in the period from April to November 2020. Median age was 4.49 years. The PCR diagnosis was carried out one or two days preoperatively (in the case of emergency interventions on the same day) and again intraoperatively using a pooled nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: All 62 preoperatively taken swabs were negative. Deviating from the preoperative test result, one intraoperatively obtained swab was positive. CONCLUSIONS: Due to limited compliance, a correct preoperative swab technique (preanalytics) cannot always be assumed for children. Sufficient protective measures for everyone present in the operating room are therefore imperative. Intraoperative test should be considered if the the preoperative test was performed under difficult conditions.","Zaubitzer, Lena; Ludwig, Sonja; Jungbauer, Frederic; Walter, Beatrice; Lange, Bettina; Rotter, Nicole; Schell, Angela",Laryngorhinootologie,418,20

Noninvasive ventilation was administered based on clinical judgment. Patients requiring oropharyngeal intubation were excluded from the study. For parameters to be measured at the hospital entrance, age, clinical history, National Early Warning Score 2 (a multiparametric score system), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F ratio), C-reactive protein, and blood cell count were selected. RESULTS: In 64 patients, age (direct relationship), P/F, and platelet number (inverse relationship) independently accounted for 43% of the acute phase duration of the disease (P < .001).

The lockdown of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by entrepreneurial ecosystem actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first-hand account of the adversity startups face during a crisis and how by utilizing bricolage responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises. Managerial summary: The lockdown measures as a response to the spread of the new coronavirus threaten the existence of many innovative startups. Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long-term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth.","Kuckertz, Andreas; Brändle, Leif; Gaudig, Anja; Hinderer, Sebastian; Morales Reyes, Carlos Arturo; Prochotta, Alicia; Steinbrink, Kathrin M.; Berger, Elisabeth S.C.",J.

This paper investigates the reaction of financial markets globally in terms of their decline and volatility as Coronavirus epicentre moved from China to Europe and then to the US. Findings suggest that the earlier epicentre China has stabilised while the global markets have gone into a freefall especially in the later phase of the spread.

In this viewpoint review, we aimed to assess the vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of COVID-19 among neurological disorders. With this in mind, we tested the hypothesis that age rather than neuropathology itself could be decisive in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, whereas neuropathology rather than age may be critical in neuroimmunological diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis. Highlighting the role of potential susceptibility or protection factors from this disastrous infection, we also stratify the risk for future neurodegeneration.","Ferini-Strambi, Luigi; Salsone, Maria",J. neurol,418,14

Some neurological complication can occur even after mild forms of respiratory disease. This study’s aims were to assess cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with nonspecific neurological symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 25 patients, aged 33–62 years, who had nonspecific neurological symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as 25 healthy participants in the control group, were assessed for cerebrovascular reactivity according to transcranial color Doppler (TCCD) which we combined with a breath-holding test (BHT). In subjects after SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were statistically significantly lower flow velocities through the middle cerebral artery at rest period, lower maximum velocities at the end of the breath-holding period and lower breath holding index (BHI) in relation to the control group. Changes in cerebral artery flow rate velocities indicate poor cerebral vasoreactivity in the group after SARS-CoV-2 infection in regard to the control group and suggest vascular endothelial damage by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Marcic, Marino Marcic Ljiljana Marcic Barbara Capkun Vesna Vukojevic Katarina",Journal of Personalized Medicine,418,17

METHODS: Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) technique was applied to analyze the major spatial distribution modes and the temporal changes of AIDS incidences in Mainland China during 2002-2017. RESULTS: The annual average AIDS incidences increased from 0.06 per 100 000 in 2002 to 4.15 per 100 000 in 2017, with an annual average increase of 0.31 per 100 000. The southwest regions were high-incidence areas, as well as Xinjiang province in the northwest. There were two typical spatial modes. EOF 1 represented an isodirectional spatial pattern that the incidences were relatively high in general, and the fluctuation ranges were relatively high in the southwest and northeast. EOF 2 represented a reverse spatial pattern that the incidences were relatively high (or low) in Guangxi, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Shanghai, and Henan, yet were relatively low (or high) in the remaining regions. CONCLUSION: The AIDS incidences in Mainland China were relatively low during 2002-2010, yet were kept in a relatively high level since 2012.

The analysis reveals that the baseline concentration of NO 2during 2015–19 was higher for Casablanca city than Rabat city. Further, the NO 2level during lockdown period has reduced significantly in Casablanca city in comparison with the NO 2levels during 2015-19 and this reduction was higher than that of Rabat city. The primary source for the contribution of troposphere NO 2in Casablanca city was vehicular transport, and a complete lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in NO 2concentration.

COVID-19 can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, potentially determining multi-organ dysfunction. Data on the relationship between COVID-19 and thyroid have been emerging, and rapidly increasing since March 2020. The thyroid gland and the virus infection with its associated inflammatory-immune responses are known to be engaged in complex interplay. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 combined with the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as the key molecular complex to infect the host cells. Interestingly, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels are high in the thyroid gland and more than in the lungs. Our literature search provided greater evidence that the thyroid gland and the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis could be relevant targets of damage by SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, COVID-19-related thyroid disorders include thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, as well as nonthyroidal illness syndrome. Moreover, we noticed that treatment plans for thyroid cancer are considerably changing in the direction of more teleconsultations and less diagnostic and therapeutical procedures.

Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is the ideal approach to achieving herd immunity. However, reaching herd immunity through vaccination has several challenges such as certain groups? objection to vaccines due to religious objections, fears regarding possible risks or skepticism about the benefits. This objection and skepticism is of great concern to the current COVID-19 vaccination campaign. If the proportion of vaccinated people in a community falls below the herd immunity threshold, exposure to contagious SARS-CoV-2 could result in a new surge of of COVID-19. This concern is further magnified by the recent CDC findings that people with no symptoms transmit more than half (59%) of all COVID-19 cases. This number includes 35% of new cases from people who infect others prior to showing symptoms and 24% of new cases from people who never develop symptoms. The spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 vaccination poses a great threat to the vaccination campaign of young adults. In an effort to further understand this current social media misinformation narrative, we surveyed college students between the ages of 18-23 and their willingness to take the vaccine. Our survey included ?fact checking? pieces of social media misinformation and investigated whether adults in this age group have been influenced by widely circulated misinformation. Our survey also included questions to investigate the potential that a significant portion of people in this age group might completely oppose vaccinations. Our findings further support the need for efficacious therapeutics for natural viral infection as an alternative to vaccination. Providing the population with an assortment of therapeutic options will reduce death caused by natural viral infection as the U.S. and world population attempts to reach herd immunity.","Federico, Francesca Esmaeli-Azad Babak",The FASEB Journal,418,16

However, over the past weeks, an increase in the number of children presenting to hospitals in the greater Paris region with a phenotype resembling Kawasaki disease (KD) has led to an alert by the French national health authorities. METHODS: Multicentre compilation of patients with KD in Paris region since April 2020, associated with the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ('Kawa-COVID-19'). A historical cohort of 'classical' KD served as a comparator. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included (sex ratio=1, median age 10 years IQR (4·7 to 12.5)). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 12 cases (69%), while a further three cases had documented recent contact with a quantitative PCR-positive individual (19%). Cardiac involvement included myocarditis in 44% (n=7). Factors prognostic for the development of severe disease (ie, requiring intensive care, n=7) were age over 5 years and ferritinaemia >1400 µg/L. Only five patients (31%) were successfully treated with a single intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) infusion, while 10 patients (62%) required a second line of treatment. The Kawa-COVID-19 cohort differed from a comparator group of 'classical' KD by older age at onset 10 vs 2 years (p<0.0001), lower platelet count (188 vs 383 G/L (p<0.0001)), a higher rate of myocarditis 7/16 vs 3/220 (p=0.0001) and resistance to first IVIg treatment 10/16 vs 45/220 (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Kawa-COVID-19 likely represents a new systemic inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Further prospective international studies are necessary to confirm these findings and better understand the pathophysiology of Kawa-COVID-19.

This unmitigated strategy predisposed the residents to risks of heightened transmission of the pandemic. Drawing on social geometry approach in the analysis of human relations, we reveal some insights offered by our experiences in theorizing about public health intervention (PHI) and in doing so develop an alternative analytical framework ('social pendulum') to support the development of a PHI strategy that is compatible with the swing-like lifestyle of residents in the informal settlements.

To monitor the pandemic trend, existing studies rely on the aggregation of traditional statistical models and epidemic spread theory. In other words, historical statistics of COVID-19, as well as the population mobility data, become the essential knowledge for monitoring the pandemic trend. However, these solutions can barely provide precise prediction and satisfactory explanations on the long-term disease surveillance while the ubiquitous social media resources can be the key enabler for solving this problem. For example, serious discussions may occur on social media before and after some breaking events take place. These events, such as marathon and parade, may impact the spread of the virus. To take advantage of the social media data, we propose a novel framework, Social Media enhAnced pandemic suRveillance Technique (SMART), which is composed of two modules: (i) information extraction module to construct heterogeneous knowledge graphs based on the extracted events and relationships among them; (ii) time series prediction module to provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of the confirmed cases and fatality at the state-level in the United States and to discover risk factors for COVID-19 interventions.

This study aims to assess student reception and investigate objective outcomes to determine if online learning is a suitable alternative. METHODS: Medical students enrolled in the third-year surgical clerkship during COVID-19 were asked to participate in a survey. 19 of 27 (70%) students participated. Content, faculty-led lectures, and resident-led problem-based learning (PBL) sessions were assessed using a ten-point Likert scale. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) examination, weekly quiz, and oral examination scores were compared to previous years. Student t-tests compared the groups. RESULTS: The median age was 25 years. Comparing in-person to electronic sessions, there was no difference in effectiveness of faculty sessions preparing students for NBME (6.2 vs. 6.7, P = .46) or oral examinations (6.4 vs. 6.8, P = .58); there was also no difference in resident-led PBL sessions preparing students for NBME (7.2 vs. 7.2, P = .92) or oral examinations (7.4 vs. 7.6, P = .74). Comparing this group to students from the previous academic year, there was no difference in weekly quiz (85.3 vs. 87.8, P = .13), oral examination (89.8 vs. 93.9, P = .07), or NBME examination (75.3 vs. 77.4, P = .33) scores. DISCUSSION: Surgical medical didactic education can effectively be conducted remotely through faculty-led lectures and resident-led PBL sessions. Students did not have a preference between in-person and electronic content in preparation for examinations. As scores did not change, electronic education may be adequate for preparing students for examinations in times of crisis such as COVID-19.","Kronenfeld, Joshua P; Ryon, Emily L; Kronenfeld, Daniel S; Hui, Vanessa W; Rodgers, Steven E; Thorson, Chad M; Sands, Laurence R",Am Surg,418,24

We aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics and the entire evolution of COVID-19 in Wuhan, and to evaluate the effect of non-pharmaceutical intervention by the government. METHODS: The information of COVID-19 cases until Mar 18, 2020 in Wuhan were collected from the national infectious disease surveillance system in Hubei province. RESULTS: A total of 49,973 confirmed cases were reported until Mar 18, 2020 in Wuhan. Among whom, 2496 cases died and the overall mortality was 5.0%. Most confirmed cases (25,619, 51.3%) occurred during Jan 23 to Feb 4, with a spike on Feb 1 (new cases, 3374). The number of daily new cases started to decrease steadily on Feb 19 (new cases, 301) and decreased greatly on Mar 1 (new cases, 57). However, the mortality and the proportion of severe and critical cases has been decreasing over time, with the lowest of 2.0 and 10.1% during Feb 16 to Mar 18, 2020, respectively. The percentage of severe and critical cases among all cases was 19.6%, and the percentage of critical and dead cases aged over 60 was 70.1 and 82.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The number of new cases has dropped significantly after the government taking the isolation of four types of personnel and the community containment for 14 days. Our results indicate that the mortality and proportion of severe and critical cases gradually decreased over time, and critical and dead cases are more incline to be older individuals.","Wang, Dongming; Cai, Jing; Shi, Tingming; Xiao, Yang; Feng, Xiaobing; Yang, Meng; Li, Wenzhen; Liu, Wei; Yu, Linling; Ye, Zi; Xu, Tao; Ma, Jixuan; Li, Mingyan; Chen, Weihong",Respir Res,418,1

To limit multicollinearity a principal component analysis was conducted, the results of which showed that three components together could explain 65% of the total variance that were therefore subjected to further study. Comparison of a generalized linear model (GLM) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) indicated an improvement in model performance using GWR (goodness of fit=93%) compared to GLM (goodness of fit=86%). The local coefficient of determination (R2) showed a significant influence of specific demographic and socioeconomic factors on COVID-19, including percentages of Omani and non-Omani population at various age levels; spatial interaction; population density; number of hospital beds; total number of households; purchasing power; and purchasing power per km2. No direct correlation between COVID- 19 rates and health facilities distribution or tobacco usage. This study suggests that Poisson regression using GWR and GLM can address unobserved spatial non-stationary relationships.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of billing data. SETTING: A large-volume practice with both community and tertiary care providers. METHODS: As part of a quality initiative, billing data were queried to identify children <18 years of age who underwent tympanostomy tube placement between January 2019 and December 2020. Patient age, practice location, and case numbers were gathered. RESULTS: The study included data from 2652 patients. Prior to state-mandated clinic and operating room restrictions, there were no significant differences in the number of tympanostomy tubes placed (P = .64), including month-to-month comparisons, the distribution of patients being cared for at community vs tertiary care sites (P = .63), or patient age at the time of surgery (P = .97) between 2019 and 2020. After resumption of outpatient clinical and elective surgical activities, the number of tympanostomy tubes placed decreased significantly between 2019 and 2020 (831 vs 303 cases, P = .003), with a persistent month-to-month difference. In addition, patients undergoing tube placement were older (4.5 vs 3.2 years, P < .001). The distribution of cases performed in the community setting decreased during this time period as well (P < .001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of pediatric tympanostomy tube placement has significantly decreased. The age of patients undergoing surgery has increased, and more children are being cared for in a tertiary setting. These findings may reflect changes in the prevalence of acute and chronic otitis media as the result of the pandemic.","Diercks, Gillian R; Cohen, Michael S",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,418,14

AIM: To describe characteristics and outcomes of approximately the first 200 documented COVID-19 cases during the first outbreak in the Gold Coast. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients managed by Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service (GCHHS). Demographics, clinical characteristics and outcomes data were collected. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-seven patients were included (mean age 45 years); 52.3% were female and 9.1% were healthcare workers. Most were overseas travellers (53.8%), contacts of a local confirmed case (25.4%) or cruise ship passengers (17.3%). The commonest comorbidities were hypertension (14.2%) and asthma (11.2%). The commonest symptoms were cough (74.1%), fever (58.9%), sore throat (48.7%), headache (48.7%) and rhinorrhoea (46.2%). Sixty-three patients were hospitalised and the rest admitted to a 'virtual ward'. Of 63 hospitalised patients, 5 (7.9%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 3 (4.8%) required intubation. No patients died. Due to low numbers of accurate exposure dates, the incubation period could not be reliably calculated for a significant proportion of the cohort. Average duration of symptoms was 14 days, time from first symptom to hospitalisation was 5.3 days and time from first symptom to ICU admission was 11.6 days. The majority (88%) experienced mild disease and achieved complete symptom resolution (97%). Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction was the main diagnostic method (99%).

Demographic, comorbidity and laboratory determinants of death and of ICU admission were explored in all Danish hospitalised patients. METHODS: National health registries were used to identify all hospitalized patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We obtained demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and laboratory results on admission and explored prognostic factors for death using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and competing risk survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 2431 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 between February 27 and July 8 (median age 69 years [IQR 53-80], 54.1% males), 359 (14.8%) needed admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 455 (18.7%) died within 30 days of follow-up. The seven-day cumulative incidence of ICU admission was lower for females (7.9%) than for males (16.7%), (p < 0.001). Age, high CCI, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, lymphopenia, neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia within ±24-h of admission were independently associated with death within the first week in the multivariate analysis. Conditional upon surviving the first week, male sex, age, high CCI, elevated CRP, LDH, creatinine, urea and neutrophil count were independently associated with death within 30 days. Males presented with more pronounced laboratory abnormalities on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, male sex, comorbidity, higher levels of systemic inflammation and cell-turnover were independent factors for mortality. Age was the strongest predictor for death, moderate to high level of comorbidity were associated with a nearly two-fold increase in mortality. Mortality was significantly higher in males after surviving the first week.","Holler, Jon Gitz; Eriksson, Robert; Jensen, Tomas Østergaard; van Wijhe, Maarten; Fischer, Thea Kølsen; Søgaard, Ole Schmeltz; Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Mohey, Rajesh; Fabricius, Thilde; Jøhnk, Frederik; Wiese, Lothar; Johnsen, Stine; Søborg, Christian; Nielsen, Henrik; Kirk, Ole; Madsen, Birgitte Lindegaard; Harboe, Zitta Barrella",BMC Infect Dis,418,29

Antibiotic Utilization During the COVID-19 Surge in Detroit,14.797759,11.911909,2020,"BACKGROUND: Psychological safety is a dynamic team-level phenomenon which exists when team members believe that it is safe to take interpersonal risks. In healthcare teams, the presence of psychological safety is critical to delivering safe care. Scholars have highlighted a need for alternative measures which compliment survey-based measures of psychological safety in healthcare teams. METHODS: The exploratory phase of this study raised concerns about whether current survey measures could provide a sufficient understanding of psychological safety within healthcare teams to inform strategies to improve it. Thus, previously validated psychological safety surveys and a meeting observation measure were adapted for use in healthcare teams. First, two group feedback sessions were held with 22 healthcare professionals, as well as a systematic literature review. Then, the members of eleven healthcare teams in Ireland and The Netherlands (n = 135) took part in the pilot test of the adapted composite measure. RESULTS: The final composite measure has two parts: a team meeting observation measure and an adapted survey. The observation measure has 31 observable behaviours fitting seven categories: voice, defensive voice, silence behaviours, supportive, unsupportive, learning or improvement-oriented and familiarity type behaviours. The survey part consists of 19 items in three sub-dimensions related to; the team leader, other team members and the team as a whole. Three additional items capture the perceived representativeness of the observed team meeting compared to other similar meetings. Final adaptations were made in order to integrate the observation and survey measure. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting composite measure combines the strengths of observational and survey measures and is tailored for use in healthcare teams. It is uniquely co-developed with healthcare professionals and grounded in the psychological safety and healthcare literature. This composite measure can enable longitudinal research on psychological safety and inform future research to develop and test interventions to improve psychological safety.","O039,; Donovan, Róisín; Van Dun, Desirée; McAuliffe, Eilish",BMC Med Res Methodol,418,1

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many preexisting risk factors for adolescent substance use, such as early life stress, social isolation, school connection, and boredom. Other effects include the potential for arrest in adolescent development, which can occur when there is disruption in expected developmental milestones. New cohorts of adolescents who may not otherwise initiate substances may now be at risk. The pandemic is also straining family systems, with potential for increased conflict and relapse that can occur in a bidirectional fashion. In parallel, the way in which we treat substance use disorders in youth has also shifted, with a dominance in digitally based platforms for delivery of most outpatient treatment. Challenges to utilizing virtual technology include fewer means of monitoring substance use remotely; privacy concerns; and ease of nonadherence with treatment by signing off the computer. Practitioners can utilize considerable opportunities for virtual care to reach adolescents at risk of developing a substance use disorder and/or those who may already have relapsed.

Initial Impact of COVID-19 on Ambulatory Antibiotic Prescribing for Respiratory Viral Infections,14.988262,11.768446,2020,"IMPORTANCE: Anatomically, viral density is greater in the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx. It is to be expected that instrumentation in or through those areas will entail a higher risk of transmission. That's why head and neck and otolaryngologist surgeons are among the most vulnerable health professionals. OBSERVATIONS: Surgeons should essentially perform procedures they require. Surgeries should be performed with personal protective equipment suitable for the high risk of aerosolization: goggles, N95 face mask, facial mask, blood-repelling gown and gloves. It is advisable to have the cooperative COVID-19 test in all patients. Telemedicine is a useful resource if resources allow it. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Otolaryngologists and related specialists are among the groups at higher risk when performing surgeries and upper airway examinations. There are no emergencies in a pandemic. The care of health professionals is crucial to combating this health situation.","Boccalatte, L A; Larrañaga, J J; Perez Raffo, G M; Teijido, C A; García Fornari, G; Staneloni, M I; Figari, M F",Am J Otolaryngol,418,23

The present study aimed to evaluate the involvement of the human endogenous retrovirus -W envelope (HERV-W ENV) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection considering recent findings that HERVs are activated in response to infectious agents and lead to various immunopathological effects. We analysed HERV-W ENV expression in blood cells of COVID-19 patients in correlation with clinical characteristics and have discussed its potential role in the outcome of the disease. METHODS: We analysed HERV-W ENV expression in blood samples of COVID-19 patients and healthy donors by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, and evaluated its correlation with clinical signs, inflammatory markers, cytokine expression, and disease progression. FINDINGS: HERV-W ENV was highly expressed in the leukocytes of COVID-19 patients but not in those of healthy donors. Its expression correlated with the markers of T-cell differentiation and exhaustion and blood cytokine levels. The percentage of HERV-W ENV-positive lymphocytes correlated with inflammatory markers and pneumonia severity in COVID-19 patients. Notably, HERV-W ENV expression reflects the respiratory outcome of patients during hospitalization. INTERPRETATION: Given the known immuno- and neuro-pathogenicity of HERV-W ENV protein, it could promote certain pathogenic features of COVID-19 and therefore serve as a biomarker to predict clinical progression of disease and open to further studies for therapeutic intervention.

We sought to review the risk, severity and mortality in COVID-19 and its relation to the glycemic control, and role of anti-diabetic agents in patients with diabetes. METHODS: A Boolean search was made in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar database until May 10, 2020 and full articles with supplementary appendix were retrieved using the specific key words related to the topic. RESULTS: There is a high prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. Patients with diabetes had a significantly more severe variety of COVID-19 and increased mortality, compared to the groups without diabetes. Moreover, poor glycemic control is associated with a significantly higher severe COVID-19 and increased mortality, compared to the well-controlled glycemic groups. No data currently available for or against any anti-diabetic agents in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, in particular poorly-controlled group is associated with a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality. This calls for an optimal glycemic control and an increased emphasis on future preventative therapies including the vaccination programs for these groups in addition to the traditional risk prevention such as social distancing and self-isolation.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Khunti, Kamlesh",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,418,16

The contents of five heavy metals (Cu, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) and six biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase, sodium-potassium ATPase, metallothionein, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde) in the muscles of crucians (Carassius auratus) were measured to calculate the IBR value. The results indicate that the contents of heavy metal in the fish under active monitoring and passive monitoring were rather low and did not exceed the National Food Safety Standards of China. The IBR value of day 14 of active monitoring correlated with the heavy metal Cd content in the fish, suggesting a potential risk of Cd pollution in the aquatic environment of Dianchi Lake. The IBR values obtained for different regions of the lake on day 14 can be arranged in the following order: West S3 (9.24) > East S1 (3.97) > South S2 (2.39) > North S4 (0.36).

DESIGN: A retrospective, observational, correlational study of existing deidentified Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant data using the Omaha System and its equivalent, Simplified Omaha System Terms. METHODS: We used three samples to explore for patterns of resilience: pre-COVID-19 community-generated data (N = 383), pre-COVID-19 clinical documentation data (N = 50,509), and during-COVID-19 community-generated data (N = 102). Community participants used the My Strengths + My Health (MSMH) app to generate the two community datasets. The clinical data were obtained from the Omaha System Data Collaborative. We operationalized resilience as Omaha System Status scores of 4 (minimal signs or symptoms) or 5 (no signs or symptoms) as a discrete strengths measure for each of 42 Omaha System problem concepts. We used visualization techniques and standard descriptive and inferential statistics for analysis. FINDINGS: It was feasible to examine resilience, operationalized as strengths by problem concept, within existing Omaha System or Simplified Omaha System Terms (MSMH) data. We identified several patterns indicating strengths and resilience that were consistent with literature related to community connectedness for community participants, and sleep for individuals in the clinical data. CONCLUSIONS: When used consistently, the Omaha System within MSMH enabled robust data collection for a comprehensive, holistic assessment, resulting in better whole-person data including strengths, and enabled us to discover a potentially useful approach for defining resilience in new ways using standardized nursing data. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The notion that how we assess individuals and communities (i.e., the completeness of our assessments in relation to whole-person health) determines what we can know about resilience is seemingly in opposition to the critical need to decrease documentation burden, despite the potential to shift from a problem deficit-based assessment to one of strengths and resilience. However, a patient-facing comprehensive assessment that includes resilience and the social determinants of health can provide a transformative, whole-person platform for strengths-based care and population management.","Monsen, Karen A; Austin, Robin R; Goparaju, Bhavana; Clarence Jones, Robert; Mathiason, Michelle A; Pirsch, Anna; Eder, Milton",J Nurs Scholarsh,418,9

Therefore, it is valuable to seek a laboratory differential diagnostic protocol of COVID-19 and other pneumonia types on admission, and to compare the dynamic changes in laboratory indicators during follow-up. Methods: A total of 143 COVID-19, 143 bacterial pneumonia and 145 conventional viral pneumonia patients were included. The model group consisted of 140 COVID-19, 80 bacterial pneumonia and 60 conventional viral pneumonia patients, who were age and sex matched. We established a differential diagnostic model based on the laboratory results of the model group on admission via a nomogram, which was validated in an external validation group. We also compared the 400-day dynamic changes of the laboratory indicators among groups. Results: LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression showed that eosinophils (Eos), total protein (TP), prealbumin (PA), potassium(K), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) could differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia types. The C-index of the nomogram model was 0.922. Applying the nomogram to the external validation group showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.902. The 400-day change trends of the laboratory indexes varied among subgroups divided by sex, age, oxygenation index (OI), and pathogen. Conclusion: The laboratory model was highly accurate at providing a new method to identify COVID-19 in pneumonia patients. The 400-day dynamic changes in laboratory indicators revealed that the recovery time of COVID-19 patients was not longer than that of other pneumonia types.","Wang, Jing; Zheng, Yufen; Chen, Yijun; Hu, Xingzhong; Peng, Minfei; Fang, Yicheng; Shen, Bo; Lu, Guoguang",,418,20

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 67 collected cases was conducted and included approximately 67 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to the Suzhou Fifth People's Hospital from January 1, 2020 to February 8, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical and imaging characteristics as well as laboratory data of the 67 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The study found that fibrinogen (FIB) was increased in 45 (65.2%) patients, and when FIB reached a critical value of 4.805 g/L, the sensitivity and specificityãDA, helping to distinguish general and severe cases, were 100 and 14%ã92.9%, respectively, which were significantly better than those for lymphocyte count and myoglobin.

Antibodies are considered as a key immune effectors that provide protection against pathogenic threats. At the same time, the nature and duration of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been precisely determined. The aim of the study was to determine the changes in the level of antibodies to SARSCoV-2 during immunization with the «Gam-COVID-Vac» vaccine. Material and methods. Observations were carried out with participance of 30 employees of the city clinical hospital No. 1. Medical workers were vaccinated against COVID-19 with the «Gam-COVID-Vac» vaccine according to the standard scheme. The level of antibodies was assessed on the 17th day after the administration of the 1st component of the vaccine, on the 17th and 30th days after the administration of the 2nd component of the vaccine. Results. Our studies show that the blood level of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 practically did not change on the 17th and 38th days after immunization with the 1st component (the average СP values were 1.616 and 1.75, respectively). However, by the 30th day, a decrease of IgM to SARS-CoV-2 was observed (average СP value - 0.7829). It should be noted that on the 17th day after immunization a significant variation was revealed in its indicators, which leveled off by the 30th day. A completely different picture was observed with the level of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. It significantly increased after immunization with the 2nd component and did not change until the 30th day (the average CP values were 12.36 and 12.48 on the 38th and 51st days, respectively). It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that after immunization with the 1st component on the 17th day, a low level of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 (CP - &lt; 1) was recorded in 48 %, and after immunization with the 2nd component - only in 10 % vaccinated. At the same time by 51 days from vaccination the seroconversion level was 100 %. It should be noted that in some patients the IgG level changed by the 30th day after immunization, compared to the 17th day. Conclusion. Thus, our information confirms that the «Gam-COVID-Vac» vaccine is effective and, in more than 90 % of cases, leads to the formation of a sufficiently high level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Shapovalov, K.

Compared to bacterial studies, laboratory and analytical methods to study the entirety of viral communities in clinical samples are rudimentary and need further refinement. In order to address this need, we developed Virobiome-Seq, a sequence capture method and an accompanying bioinformatics analysis pipeline, that identifies viral reads in human samples. Virobiome-Seq is able to enrich for and detect multiple types of viruses in human samples, including novel subtypes that diverge at the sequence level. In addition, Virobiome-Seq is able to detect RNA transcripts from DNA viruses and may provide a sensitive method for detecting viral activity in vivo. Since Virobiome-Seq also yields the viral sequence, it makes it possible to investigate associations between viral genotype and psychiatric illness. In this proof of concept study, we detected HIV1, Torque Teno, Pegi, Herpes and Papilloma virus sequences in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells, plasma and stool samples collected from individuals with psychiatric disorders. We also detected the presence of numerous novel circular RNA viruses but were unable to determine whether these viruses originate from the sample or represent contaminants. Despite this challenge, we demonstrate that our knowledge of viral diversity is incomplete and opportunities for novel virus discovery exist. Virobiome-Seq will enable a more sophisticated analysis of the virome and has the potential of uncovering complex interactions between viral activity and psychiatric disease.","Yolken, Robert H; Kinnunen, Paula M; Vapalahti, Olli; Dickerson, Faith; Suvisaari, Jaana; Chen, Ou; Sabunciyan, Sarven",Schizophr. res,418,16

This study is particularly interested in analyzing the role of attitudes, descriptive norms, protective behaviors toward COVID-19, travel frequency before the pandemic, and spatial and individual characteristics on activity-travel behavior changes in relation to information and communication technology (ICT) use. Data were obtained from 1062 respondents using a web-based questionnaire survey. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the complex relationships among variables. This study found that descriptive norms positively affected the frequency of travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teleworking and e-learning and attitudes toward COVID-19 directly affected activity-travel behavior changes. On the contrary, teleshopping did not contribute to reducing out-of-home activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experience of ICT influenced a decline in travel frequency and ride-hailing use. Furthermore, although personal attributes insignificantly influenced activity-travel behavior change, these attributes directly affected ICT use. Meanwhile, people living outside of Java Island had a higher travel frequency during the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic than their counterparts. Based on our findings, this study recommends that the very initial step in an emergency caused by a disaster be to massively socialize or educate people about the risk of the pandemic and to continue with a policy to minimize travel by encouraging teleworking and e-learning.

There is still little information about molecular compounds that can inhibit the development of infections caused by this disease. It is crucial to achieving the discovery of competent natural inhibitor candidates, such as antiviral peptides, because they have a variety of biological activities and have evolved to target biochemical machinery from different pathogens or host cell structures. In silico studies will be carried out, including protein-peptide docking and protein-protein docking, to identify, evaluate, and explore the affinity and molecular interactions of the Magainin-1 and Magainin-2 peptide molecules derived from frog skin (Xenopus laevis) to the main protease macromolecule (Mpro) SARS-CoV-2, and its effect on the ACE-2 receptor (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 Receptor). Protein-peptide docking simulations show that both peptide molecules have a good affinity for the active site area of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro macromolecule. These results were then confirmed using protein-protein docking simulations to observe the ability of the peptide molecule in preventing attachment to the ACE-2 receptor surface area. In silico studies show that Magainin-2 has the best affinity, with a bond free energy value of −3054.53 kJ/mol. Then the protein-protein docking simulation provided Magainin-2 was able to prevent the attachment of ACE-2 receptors, with an ACE score of 1697.99 kJ/mol. Thus, through in silico research, it is hoped that the Magainin peptide molecule can be further investigated in the development of new antiviral peptides for the treatment of infectious diseases of COVID-19.","Fakih, Taufik Muhammad; Dewi, Mentari Luthfika; Syahroni, Eky",Biogenesis: Jurnal Ilmiah Biologi,418,16

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of English-language articles published December 31, 2019-June 19, 2020. Studies of any design that performed tests on &#8805;10 patients and reported or inferred correlative statistics were included. Studies were evaluated using elements of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) guidelines. RESULTS: We conducted a narrative and tabular synthesis of studies organized by their reference standard strategy or comparative agreement method, resulting in six categorizations. Critical study details were frequently unreported, including the mechanism for patient/sample selection and researcher blinding to results, which lead to concern for bias. CONCLUSIONS: Current studies estimating test performance characteristics have imperfect study design and statistical methods for the estimation of test performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 tests. The included studies employ heterogeneous methods and overall have an increased risk of bias. Employing standardized guidelines for study designs and statistical methods will improve the process for developing and validating rRT-PCR and NAAT for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Axell-House, Dierdre B; Lavingia, Richa; Rafferty, Megan; Clark, Eva; Amirian, E Susan; Chiao, Elizabeth Y",J Infect,418,16

Em relação à educação em saúde da população de Lésbicas, Gays, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais (LGBT), assunto que ainda está em processo de inserção nas escolas médicas, tal mudança trouxe novas oportunidades para a discussão do conteúdo, mas também criou e escancarou vulnerabilidades preexistentes. Relato de Experiência: Ocorreram no Brasil diversas experiências de educação em saúde LGBT durante o período da pandemia da Sars-Cov-2, com auxílio de plataformas digitais. Em uma universidade do Rio Grande do Norte, uma disciplina optativa de Atenção à Saúde da População LGBT, que já seria ministrada no formato presencial, sofreu modificações e acabou por ser ofertada no modelo remoto. A liga de semiologia de uma faculdade de São Paulo se viu obrigada a mudar a sua aula com a mesma temática em decorrência do isolamento social. Discussão: Essas experiências permitiram a análise de uma série de oportunidades e vulnerabilidades trazidas por esse momento de reformulações no ensino. A modalidade remota expôs e expandiu desigualdades sociais por conta da necessidade de equipamentos e internet para acesso aos conteúdos, marginalizando uma parcela vulnerável da população. Além disso, o ambiente digital pode ser inseguro para o pronunciamento de pessoas LGBT. Em contrapartida, essa modalidade permitiu a ampliação do público atingido pelas atividades, resultante da diminuição dos custos e da quebra de barreiras geográficas permitidas pelo ambiente digital. Surgiram inovações nas ferramentas de ensino, como uso de podcasts e vídeos, flexibilizando as formas de ensino e divulgação de informações. Conclusão: Diante das deficiências encontradas com a experiência do ensino remoto emergencial, espera-se que, no futuro, os aprendizados adquiridos levem a uma implementação curricular mais democrática de atividades inclusivas em ensino sobre saúde LGBT nas universidades.","Morais Neto, Antônio Carlos de; Tagnin, Luisa Hercowitz; Araújo, Alisson Costa de; Sousa, Maria Isabele Oliveira; Barra, Brígida Gabriele Albuquerque; Hercowitz, Andrea",Rev. bras. educ. méd,418,26

This coronavirus affects many organs, including the skin, whose manifestations are a consequence of the disease itself, as well as the preventative measures taken to avoid the infection. This paper reviews the cutaneous manifestations which currently have been encountered during this pandemic. METHODS: A search was conducted on PubMed, and all relevant articles were included. RESULTS: The results show the occurrence of many cutaneous findings, ranging from those related to the infection itself and to various dermatitides related to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) utilized by healthcare workers while attending to infected patients. DISCUSSION: Recognizing these findings is important for the accurate diagnosis of those infected with COVID-19 as well as the prompt treatment of the side effects caused by PPE that might further impair the effectiveness of healthcare workers.","Akl, Jennifer; El-Kehdy, Jessica; Salloum, Antoine; Benedetto, Anthony; Karam, Paula",J. cosmet. dermatol,418,13

At Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM), one approach to reduce the scheduled screen time has been to pre-record lectures so students can access these at their convenience Much of the pharmacology content is delivered as lecture with some content reinforcement in small group sessions Transitioning from synchronous, live lectures to pre-recorded lectures that can be accessed asynchronously presents a number of potential challenges including building rapport with students, maintaining a common experience between the pharmacology faculty and students since the lectures can be recorded weeks or months before being accessible to the students, responding to non-verbal cues during the lecture to expand or quickly move past a concept, opportunities for faculty development in response to those non-verbal cues, and continuous quality improvement of the lecture based on real-time feedback One solution has been the ?interactive lecture?: a hybrid model in which students prepare for a synchronous session by watching a short (15-20 min) pre-recording that provides relevant physiology and potentially pharmacological strategies Students join the synchronous session to reinforce and build on concepts from the pre-recording Because they are coming into the session with some degree of foundational knowledge, there are more opportunities for interaction in the form of polling questions Similar to reading the non-verbal cues in the classroom, these questions allow the instructor to respond to the students in the room and adjust the teaching focus in real-time In this way, the session is somewhat directed by the students and their understanding and questions Additionally, the instructor can revise the session in the future based on a better understanding of what concepts were clear and where students struggled The IUSM second-year medical students had the experience of one course in which pharmacology was taught asynchronously with only one synchronous small group session and another course in which pharmacology was taught synchronously for all sessions either as interactive lectures or small group sessions At the end of the second course, students received an evaluation in which they were asked to rank their preference The overall response rate was 79% (296 of 375 students responding) Of these, 32% of students chose only the pre-recording and 13% of students chose to only access slides without any recording or live session The remaining 55% of students included a synchronous session in their preference Clearly, there is a large fraction of students who prefer to learn the pharmacology content independently Based on other feedback, many of these students are utilizing non-IUSM resources such as Sketchy Pharm, First Aid, and USMLE Step 1 Qbank as their primary resource for pharmacology content However, the majority of students want some form of synchronous session and interaction in order to help learn, solidify, and apply pharmacology Of those students, nearly half preferred the interactive lecture format The interactive lecture is an efficient and effective way to deliver pharmacology content and maintain student-faculty interaction in the virtual classroom","Richardson, Jennelle",The FASEB Journal,418,1

In this context, this paper examines the mediating role of e-customer satisfaction during COVID-19 pandemic. This study is based on flow theory using two consequent factors, which have not been investigated together previously. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire consisted of flow experience dimensions and e-customer satisfaction, repurchase intention. An online survey was conducted with 478 consumers who experienced flow in online shopping. Exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to test research hypotheses. The research study data were collected between 20 March and 31 May 2020, during the spread of COVID-19. Findings: Telepresence, concentration and control dimensions of flow experience have a significant effect on e-customer satisfaction. In addition, it was determined that the change in repurchase intention was caused by concentration and telepresence dimensions of flow experience. Therefore, it was found that e-customer satisfaction has a significant effect on repurchase intention. As a result, it was determined that e-customer satisfaction has a partial mediating role in the effect of flow experience dimensions of telepresence, concentration and control, and a full mediating role in the effect of flow experience dimension of time distortion on repurchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of the study are that research was conducted on only one retail company and a limited number of participants were reached. In addition, some flow experience dimensions were excluded in the study, constituting another limitation. Originality/value: This paper contributes flow theory literature by modelling flow dimensions as an independent variable that affects e-customer satisfaction and repurchase intention. In addition, different dimensions of flow experience in online retailing have been discussed, and no study has been found that discusses flow experience dimensions (goal clarity, enjoyment, curiosity, control, telepresence, time distortion, concentration) together.

Molecular adjuvants are a specific subclass of adjuvants where ligands of known immune-modulatory receptors are directly fused to an antigen. Co-stimulation of the B cell receptor (BCR) and immune-modulatory receptors through this strategy can augment downstream signaling to improve antibody titers and/or potency, and survival in challenge models. AREAS COVERED: C3d has been the most extensively studied molecular adjuvant and shown to improve immune responses to a number of antigens. Similarly, tumor necrosis superfamily ligands, such as BAFF and APRIL, as well as CD40, CD180 and immune complex ligands can also improve humoral immunity as molecular adjuvants. EXPERT OPINION: However, no single strategy has emerged that improves immune outcomes in all contexts. Thus, systematic exploration of molecular adjuvants that target B cell receptors will be required to realize their full potential as next-generation vaccine technologies.","Sicard, Taylor; Kassardjian, Audrey; Julien, Jean-Philippe",Expert rev. vaccines (Online),418,7

This study investigated the facility-level nephrology practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associated challenges. Additionally, the treatment patterns and outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with COVID-19 were reviewed. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide questionnaire survey of 704 educational facilities that were certified by the Japanese Society of Nephrology (JSN) from October 20, 2020 to November 16, 2020. The questionnaire reviewed the facility characteristics, infection prevention measures taken during routine nephrology practice, impact of COVID-19 on nephrology practice, experiences in managing CKD patients with COVID-19, and nosocomial transmission in the nephrology unit. RESULTS: Of the 347 facilities that responded, 95.1% checked outpatients' body temperatures and COVID-19 symptoms at their visits. To reduce face-to-face contact, 80% and 70% of the facilities lengthened the intervals between outpatient visits and introduced online/telephonic consultations, respectively. As a result, more than half of the hospitals experienced a decrease in the numbers of outpatients and inpatients (64% and 50%, respectively). During the study period, 347 facilities managed 479 CKD patients with COVID-19. Oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation were performed for 47.8% and 16.5% of the patients, respectively, with a 9.2% total mortality rate. CONCLUSION: This survey demonstrated that JSN-certified educational nephrology facilities adopted multiple measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic; however, they faced several challenges. Sharing these experiences could standardize these approaches and prepare us better for the future.","Sugawara, Yuka; Iwagami, Masao; Yoshida, Yoko; Kikuchi, Kan; Ando, Ryoichi; Shinoda, Toshio; Ryuzaki, Munekazu; Nakamoto, Hidetomo; Sakai, Ken; Hanafusa, Norio; Kashihara, Naoki; Nangaku, Masaomi",Clin. exp. nephrol,418,13

Thus, the current study objective was to evaluate any change in the QTc interval in patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 receiving favipiravir treatment. METHOD: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were assessed in this single-center retrospective study. 189 patients, whose diagnosis was confirmed using real-time PCR, were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups: those using hydroxychloroquine (Group 1, nâ¯=â¯66), hydroxychloroquine plus favipiravir (Group 2, nâ¯=â¯66), and favipiravir only (Group 3, nâ¯=â¯57). The QTc interval was measured before treatment (QTc-B) and 48â¯h after (i.e., the median) starting treatment (QTc-AT). RESULTS: The median age was 53 (39-66 IQR) and 97 (51%) of patients were female. The median QTc(Bazett)-change was 7â¯ms (pâ¯=â¯0.028) and 12â¯ms (pâ¯<â¯0.001) and in Group 1 and 2, respectively.

All P-stalk proteins (uL10, P1 and P2) undergo phosphorylation within their C-termini. Here, we show that uL10 has multiple phosphorylation sites, mapped also within the N-terminal rRNA-binding-domain. Our results reveal that the introduction of a negative charge within the N-terminus of uL10 impairs its association with the ribosome. These findings demonstrate that uL10 N-terminal phosphorylation has regulatory potential governing the uL10 interaction with the ribosome and may control the activity of GAC.","Filipek, Kamil; Michalec-Wawiórka, Barbara; Boguszewska, Aleksandra; Kmiecik, Sebastian; Tchórzewski, Marek",FEBS lett,418,16

Recently, we developed a novel drug delivery model using protein transduction domains (PTD) overcoming limitation of soluble recombinant proteins, including bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7). This study aims at evaluating the therapeutic effects of PTD-BMP-7 consisted of PTD and full-length BMP-7 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related fibrosis. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) were then treated with TGF-ß1 or TGF-ß1 + PTD-BMP-7. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters were inserted into Sprague-Dawley rats, and these rats were infused intra-peritoneally with saline, peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) or PDF + PTD-BMP-7. In vitro, TGF-ß1 treatment significantly increased fibronectin, type I collagen, &#945;-SMA and Snail expression, while reducing E-cadherin expression in HPMCs (P < .001). PTD-BMP-7 treatment ameliorated TGF-ß1-induced fibronectin, type I collagen, &#945;-SMA and Snail expression, and restored E-cadherin expression in HPMCs (P < .001). In vivo, the expressions of EMT-related molecules and the thickness of the sub-mesothelial layer were significantly increased in the peritoneum of rats treated with PDF, and these changes were significantly abrogated by the intra-peritoneal administration of PTD-BMP-7. PTD-BMP-7 treatment significantly inhibited the progression of established PD fibrosis. These findings suggest that PTD-BMP-7, as a prodrug of BMP-7, can be an effective therapeutic agent for peritoneal fibrosis in PD patients.","Kim, Seonghun; Shin, Dong Ho; Nam, Bo Young; Kang, Hye-Young; Park, Jimin; Wu, Meiyan; Kim, Nam Hee; Kim, Hyun Sil; Park, Jung Tak; Han, Seung Hyeok; Kang, Shin-Wook; Yook, Jong In; Yoo, Tae-Hyun",J. cell. mol. med,418,20

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perceived change in physical activity or exercise and mental health outcomes over the short-term in response to COVID-19 mitigation strategies in a sample of adult twins. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 3,971 identical and same-sex fraternal adult twins (909 pairs, 77% identical) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry. Participants in this study completed an online survey examining the impact of COVID-19 mitigation on a number of health-related behaviors and outcomes, administered between March 26 and April 5, 2020. In the present study, the exposure was perceived change in physical activity or exercise. The outcomes were levels of perceived anxiety and stress. RESULTS: More twin pairs reported a decrease in physical activity levels (42%) than those reporting no change (31%) or increased physical activity levels (27%). A perceived decrease in physical activity or exercise was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. However, the physical activity-stress relationship was confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors. On the other hand, the physical activity-anxiety relationship held after controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors, although it was no longer significant after further controlling for age and sex, with older twins more likely to report lower levels of anxiety and females more likely to report higher levels of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic may be impacting physical activity and mental health, with those experiencing a decrease in physical activity also having higher levels of stress and anxiety. These relationships are confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors, in the case of stress, and age and sex, in the case of anxiety.","Duncan, Glen E; Avery, Ally R; Seto, Edmund; Tsang, Siny",PLoS One,418,16

The domains at the nanoscale represent a viable strategy to purposely address materials' properties for applications in several fields such as catalysis, biomedicine, and energy conversion. In this case, solution-phase seeded growth and the hot-injection method are ingeniously combined to fabricate TiO2/PbS heterostructures. The interest in such hybrid nanostructures arises from their absorption properties that make them advantageous candidates as solar cell materials for more efficient solar light harvesting and improved light conversion. Due to the strong lattice mismatch between TiO2 and PbS, the yield of the hybrid structure and the control over its properties are challenging. In this study, a systematic investigation of the heterostructure synthesis as a function of the experimental conditions (such as seeds' surface chemistry, reaction temperature, and precursor concentration), its topology, structural properties, and optical properties are carried out. The morphological and chemical characterizations confirm the formation of small dots of PbS by decorating the oleylamine surface capped TiO2 nanocrystals under temperature control. Remarkably, structural characterization points out that the formation of heterostructures is accompanied by modification of the crystallinity of the TiO2 domain, which is mainly ascribed to lattice distortion. This result is also confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which shows intense emission in the visible range. This originated from self-trapped excitons, defects, and trap emissive states.","Dibenedetto, Carlo Nazareno; Sibillano, Teresa; Brescia, Rosaria; Prato, Mirko; Triggiani, Leonardo; Giannini, Cinzia; Panniello, Annamaria; Corricelli, Michela; Comparelli, Roberto; Ingrosso, Chiara; Depalo, Nicoletta; Agostiano, Angela; Curri, Maria Lucia; Striccoli, Marinella; Fanizza, Elisabetta",Molecules (Basel),418,33

This study aimed to determine the ongoing trend and upcoming infection status of COVID-19 in county levels of Texas. METHODS: Data were extracted from the following sources: published literature, surveillance, unpublished reports, and websites of Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Natality report of Texas and WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. Four-compartment Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removal (SEIR) mathematical model was used to estimate the current trend and future prediction of basic reproduction number and infection case in Texas. Since the basic reproduction number is not sufficient to predict the outbreak, we applied the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to calculate the probability of the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The estimated mean basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Texas is predicted 2.65 by January 31, 2021. Our model indicated that the third wave might occur at the beginning of May of 2021, which will peak at the end of June 2021. This prediction may come true if the current spreading situation/level persists, i.e., no clinically effective vaccine is available,or this vaccination program fails for some reason in this area. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates an alarming ongoing and upcoming infection rate of COVID-19 at county levels of Texas, thereby emphasizing promoting more coordinated and disciplined actions by both policymakers and the population to contain its devastating impact.","Hassan, Md Nazmul; Mahmud, Md Shahriar; Nipa, Kaniz Fatema; Kamrujjaman, Md",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,418,30

Briefly, statins could act modulating virus entry, acting on the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, ACE2 and CD147, and/or lipid rafts engagement. Statins, by inducing autophagy activation, could regulate virus replication or degradation, exerting protective effects. The well-known anti-inflammatory properties of statins, by blocking several molecular mechanisms, including NF-&#954;B and NLRP3 inflammasome, could limit the ""cytokine storm"" in severe COVID-19 patients which is linked to fatal outcome.

When the observations are independent, the analysis of such studies can be based on standard methods for multi-state models. However, the independence assumption is often violated, such as in multicenter studies, which makes the use of standard methods improper. In this work we address the issue of nonparametric estimation and two-sample testing for the population-averaged transition and state occupation probabilities under general multi-state models based on right-censored, left-truncated, and clustered observations. The proposed methods do not impose assumptions regarding the within-cluster dependence, allow for informative cluster size, and are applicable to both Markov and non-Markov processes. Using empirical process theory, the estimators are shown to be uniformly consistent and to converge weakly to tight Gaussian processes. Closed-form variance estimators are derived, rigorous methodology for the calculation of simultaneous confidence bands is proposed, and the asymptotic properties of the nonparametric tests are established. Furthermore, we provide theoretical arguments for the validity of the nonparametric cluster bootstrap, which can be readily implemented in practice regardless of how complex the underlying multi-state model is. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed methods is good, and that methods that ignore the within-cluster dependence can lead to invalid inferences. Finally, the methods are applied to data from a multicenter randomized controlled trial.","Bakoyannis, Giorgos",,418,20

This work introduces a new approach of the 3D Active Contour Model (3D ACM) to estimate an inhomogeneous motion of lungs, which can be used to analyze lung disease patterns using a hierarchical predictive model. The biophysical model of lungs consists of End Expiratory (EE) and End Inspiratory (EI) models, generated by high-resolution computed tomography images (HRCT). A proposed technique uses the 3D ACM to estimate the velocity vector by using the corresponding points on the parametric surface model of the EE model to the EI model. The external energy from the EI models is the external force that pushes the 3D parametric surface to reach the boundary. The external forces, such as the balloon force and Gradient Vector Flow (GVF), were adjusted adaptively based on the Zaratio which was calculated from the ratio of the maximum value of EI to EE on the Z axis. Next, the feature representation is studied and evaluated based on the lung structure, separated into five lobes. The stepwise regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques are applied to classify the lung diseases into normal, obstructive lung, and restrictive lung diseases. In conclusion, the inhomogeneous motion pattern of lungs integrated with medical-based knowledge can be used to analyze lung diseases by differentiating normal and abnormal motion patterns and separating restrictive and obstructive lung diseases.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the access to medical care and health care information in patients with cardiovascular diseases during social, preventive, and mandatory confinement in Argentina. Results: A total of 1,487 surveys were analyzed. Mean age was 56.17 ± 14.0 years; 66.8% of survey respondents were women, 38.9% lived in the Greater Buenos Aires area and 27.1 % in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The most commonly reported main cardiovascular disease was hypertension (52.1%); 42% required medical care and 57.9% could not access to consultation due to issues related with the health system in 68.2% of cases. Only 16.4% did not request medical care for fear of becoming infected with COVID-19. Seventy-two percent required prescriptions and 13% did not obtain them. Access to vaccination was normal in 41.4% of respondents. Social mandatory isolation was respected in 92.4% of cases. Finally, 54.6% of the surveyed population felt unprotected by the health system. Conclusions: We believe that access of the population with chronic cardiovascular diseases to the health system should be warranted in order to adapt monitoring and minimize hospitalization due to decompensation in this high-risk population.","González, Stella M.

Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included patients presenting between March 23, 2020 and April 19, 2020. All patients who presented to the emergency department were included as cases. The data were collected using an electronic medical record system. Results: Overall, 1,192 patients (mean 42.57 per day) presented to the ocular emergency department and were included for analysis. The median age of the patients was 35 (Interquartile range, IQR: 20-52) years and they were mostly adults (77.85%). The majority of patients were male (62.16%) and presented from the local metropolitan region (56.21%). On triaging based on the ocular disorders at presentation, the majority of the patients were emergency related (65.02%), followed by urgent (8.14%) and routine (26.85%) in nature. The most common emergencies were microbial keratitis (23.74%), followed by corneal trauma (16.39%). There was an increasing trend seen in emergency patients (46.11%; week 1 to 71.78%; week 4) and a decreasing trend seen in routine patients (45%; week1 to 21.20%; week 4). A subset of patients (23.49%) underwent surgery where indicated and the most commonly performed procedures were vitreo-retinal procedures (32.86%) followed by trauma related (31.43%). Conclusion: The enforcement of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 resulted in a fewer patients presenting to the hospital. The majority of them presented from the local metropolitan region and the common emergencies were microbial keratitis and corneal trauma. About one fourth required a surgical intervention which was most commonly a vitreo-retinal procedure.","Das, Anthony Vipin; Narayanan, Raja",Indian J Ophthalmol,418,29

We report the recent spread of a new SARS-CoV-2 spike 501Y variant. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from human nasopharyngeal samples by Illumina next-generation sequencing were analyzed using Nextclade and an in-house Python script and compared using BLASTn to the GISAID database. Phylogeny was performed using the IQ-TREE software. RESULTS: We identified that SARS-CoV-2 genomes from four patients diagnosed in our institute harbored a new set of amino acid substitutions including L18F;L452R;N501Y;A653V;H655Y;D796Y;G1219V±Q677H. These spike N501Y genomes are the first of Nextstrain clade 19B. We obtained partial spike gene sequences of this genotype for an additional 43 patients. All patients infected with this genotype were diagnosed since mid-January 2021. We detected 42 other genomes of this genotype in GISAID, which were obtained from samples collected in December 2020 in four cases and in 2021 in 38 cases. The 89 sequences obtained in our institute or other laboratories originated from the Comoros archipelago, Western European countries (mostly metropolitan France), Turkey and Nigeria.

We aimed to develop a novel model and implement it in a freely accessible web application. DESIGN: We built an SIR-type compartmental model with two additional compartments: D (deceased patients); L (individuals who will die but who will not infect anybody due to social or medical isolation) and integration of a time-dependent transmission rate and a periodical weekly component linked to the way in which cases and deaths are reported. RESULTS: The model was implemented in a web application (as of 2 June 2020). It was shown to be able to accurately capture the changes in the dynamics of the pandemic for 20 countries whatever the type of pandemic spread or containment measures: for instance, the model explains 97% of the variance of US data (daily cases) and predicts the number of deaths at a 2-week horizon with an error of 1%. CONCLUSIONS: In early performance evaluation, our model showed a high level of accuracy between prediction and observed data.

PURPOSE: The proceedings of an international summit on the current and desired future state of use of robotic systems to compound intravenous (IV) solutions are summarized. SUMMARY: The International IV Robotics Summit was held at the Cleveland Clinic main campus in Cleveland, OH, on April 29 and 30, 2019. The purpose of the summit was 2-fold: (1) to define the current state of robotic IV compounding and (2) to develop a guide for automation companies, pharmacy departments, and drug manufacturers to improve the technology and expand the use of IV robotics in health systems in the future. The first day of the summit included 45-minute presentations by each of the speakers. Each lecturer recounted a different hospital's experience implementing and using IV robotics. On day 2 of the summit, an expert panel dedicated to mapping the future of IV robotics was convened to determine barriers to widespread adoption of IV robotics in health systems and offer potential solutions to remove these barriers. The expert panel targeted 3 specific audiences: robot manufacturers, drug manufacturers, and fellow pharmacy leaders. CONCLUSION: It is the hope of the international faculty that the information that emerged from the summit can be used by others to successfully implement IV compounding robotics in their sterile products areas to maximize patient safety. The summit also served as a call to action for pharmacy leaders, drug manufacturers, and robotic companies to develop a safer, more efficient future for patients by working together to optimize the development and operation of IV robotics.","Long, Jordan; Calabrese, Samuel; Al-Jedai, Ahmed; Boyd, Anthony; Cotugno, Michael; Dorn, Mitchell; Fanikos, John; Freudiger, Michael J; Kraemer, Irene; Lopez-Cabezas, Carmen; Smith, Abbi; de Stoppelaar, Francine M; Usher, Jerry; Yaniv, Angela W; Knoer, Scott",Am. j. health system pharm,418,24

Data available in the literature reported a potential increased risk of fatal arrhythmias under these therapies. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of these drugs on QT interval and outcome in a COVID-19 population. METHOD: A total of 112 consecutive COVID-19 patients were included in this analysis and were divided in 3 groups according to the receiving therapeutic regimens: 19 (17%) patients in Group 1 (no treatment), 40 (36%) in Group 2 (HCQ only), 53 (47%) in Group 3 (HCQ/AZT). RESULTS: A prolonged QTc interval was found in 61% of patients treated with HCQ alone or in combination with AZT, but only 4 (4%) patients showed a QTc > 500 ms. HCQ/AZT combination determined a greater increase of QTc duration compared to the other two strategies (Group 3 452 ± 26.4 vs Group 2 436.3 ± 28.4 vs Group 1 424.4 ± 24.3 ms, respectively; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HCQ/AZT combination (OR 9.02, p = 0.001) and older age (OR 1.04, p = 0.031) were independent predictors of QTc prolongation. The risk increased with age (incremental utility analysis p = 0.02). Twenty patients (18%) died, and no cardiac arrest neither arrhythmic fatalities were documented. CONCLUSIONS: The HCQ/AZT combination therapy causes a significantly increase of QT interval compared to HCQ alone. Older patients under such regimen are at higher risk of experiencing QT prolongation. The use of such drugs may be considered as safe relating to arrhythmic risk in the treatment of COVID-19 patients as no arrhythmic fatalities occurred.","Bernardini, Andrea; Ciconte, Giuseppe; Negro, Gabriele; Rondine, Roberto; Mecarocci, Valerio; Viva, Tommaso; Santini, Francesca; de Innocentiis, Carlo; Giannelli, Luigi; Witkowska, Ewa; Locati, Emanuela Teresina; Castelvecchio, Serenella; Marrocco-Trischitta, Massimiliano M; Vicedomini, Gabriele; Menicanti, Lorenzo; Pappone, Carlo",Int. j. cardiol,418,16

This article provides a concise review of the current closure and wound management methods for each of the following three layers and dressing: 1) deep fascia layer, or arthrotomy; 2) subdermal layer or subcutaneous layer; 3) skin and subcuticular layer; and 4) dressing application. By introducing a comprehensive and systematic approach to TKA wounds, this report also incorporates newer modalities such as barbed sutures and adhesive dressings, which have increasingly replaced traditional suture and staple methods. Furthermore, we examine how various layers of modern wound closure compare to conventional methods while discussing both the clinical and economic impacts of each. Newer wound management methods, such as the adhesive and occlusive dressings with varying monofilament subcuticular sutures, can eliminate the need for staple and suture removal, increase the value of care provided, limit unnecessary postoperative visits, and potentially address wound issues by communicating safely with patients via telemedicine, an ever-relevant discussion in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Tarazi, John M; Naylor, Brandon H; Salem, Hytham S; Mont, Michael A",Surg. technol. int.

In this study, the psychological support application using WebRTC was developed to assist undergraduates in dealing with mental and psychological health problems encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. The case study was conducted by distributing a survey consisting of the sharing, consulting and profiling modules of the application that have to be answered by the respondents. This application implements WebRTC as a platform for the user of the application to ‘randomly’ call another user. A user can choose whether to be the caller, the receiver, or both. The caller would be able to call the receiver when the specifications are chosen while the receiver is only able to receive a call. If both are chosen, the user would be able to initiate and receive a call. In order to connect one user to another in peer-to-peer communication, a signalling server is used. The results obtained in this case study showed that the COVID-19 outbreak has affected undergraduates’ mental health and the developed application is able to help the undergraduates in healing their mental health.

It was conducted in English and comprised two parts: socio-demographic characteristics, and KAP towards COVID-19. 712 responses to the questionnaire were collected. 90% of respondents (n = 695) were undergraduate students, while 10% (n = 81) were postgraduates. The majority (87%, n = 647) stated that they obtained COVID-19 information from multiple reliable sources. They were highly knowledgeable about the COVID-19 pandemic, but 76% (n = 539) did not recognize its routes of transmission. Medical students were significantly more knowledgeable compared with allied health students (P<0.0001, Mann Whitney U test) but there was no difference in knowledge between undergraduate and postgraduate students (P = 0.14, Mann Whitney U test). Medical students thought that more could be done to mitigate the COVID-19 situation compared with the allied health students (66.2% compared with 51.6%, p = 0.002 Fisher's Exact test). 63% (n = 431) were worried about getting COVID-19 infection, while 92% (n = 633)) were worried that a family member could be infected with the virus. 97% (n = 655) took precautions when accepting home deliveries, 94% (n = 637) had been washing their hands more frequently, and 95% (n = 643) had been wearing face masks. In conclusion, medical and health sciences students in the UAE showed high levels of knowledge and good attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, they were worried about themselves or their family members becoming infected. Medical students had more knowledge about COVID-19 pandemic which was reflected in their opinion that more can be done to mitigate its effects.","Baniyas, Noura; Sheek-Hussein, Mohamud; Al Kaabi, Nouf; Al Shamsi, Maitha; Al Neyadi, Maitha; Al Khoori, Rauda; Ajab, Suad; Abid, Muhammad; Grivna, Michal; Abu-Zidan, Fikri M",PLoS One,418,26

This study was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective investigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and we compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed by &#967; test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. RESULTS: Our study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients. The median age of the death group was older than the recovered group (69 [62, 74] vs. 40 [33, 57] years, Zâ=â9.738, Pâ<â0.001). More patients in the death group had underlying diseases (72.5% vs. 41.4%, &#967;â=â22.105, Pâ<â0.001). Patients in the death group had a significantly longer time of illness onset to hospitalization (10.0 [6.5, 12.0] vs. 7.0 [5.0, 10.0] days, Zâ=â3.216, Pâ=â0.001). On admission, the proportions of patients with symptoms of dyspnea (70.6% vs. 19.0%, &#967;â=â60.905, Pâ<â0.001) and expectoration (32.1% vs. 12.1%, &#967;â=â13.250, Pâ<â0.001) were significantly higher in the death group. The blood oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the death group (85 [77, 91]% vs. 97 [95, 98]%, Zâ=â10.625, Pâ<â0.001). The white blood cell (WBC) in death group was significantly higher on admission (7.23 [4.87, 11.17] vs. 4.52 [3.62, 5.88] ×10/L, Zâ=â7.618, Pâ<â0.001). Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] ×10/L, Zâ=â8.037, Pâ<â0.001) and lymphocyte percentage (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.50 [15.27, 31.25]%, Zâ=â10.315, Pâ<â0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte percentage continued to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Zâ=â5.242, Pâ<â0.001). Alanine transaminase (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Zâ=â2.592, Pâ=â0.010), aspartate transaminase (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Zâ=â7.308, Pâ<â0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] vs. 65.00 [54.60, 78.75] µmol/L, Zâ=â6.478, Pâ<â0.001) were significantly higher in the death group than those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs. 3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Zâ=â10.206, Pâ<â0.001) and showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Zâ=â1.219, Pâ=â0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (89.9% vs. 8.6%, &#967;â=â148.105, Pâ<â0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.9%, &#967;â=â93.222, Pâ<â0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0%, &#967;â=â23.257, Pâ<â0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0%, &#967;â=â14.618, Pâ<â0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0%, &#967;â=â7.655, Pâ=â0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death group had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC.","Deng, Yan; Liu, Wei; Liu, Kui; Fang, Yuan-Yuan; Shang, Jin; Zhou, Ling; Wang, Ke; Leng, Fan; Wei, Shuang; Chen, Lei; Liu, Hui-Guo",Chin Med J (Engl),418,13

Individual or multiple micronutrients have been shown to modulate immune function and affect the risk and severity of a number of infectious diseases. We systematically reviewed the evidence on the impact of micronutrient supplements to reduce the occurrence of ARIs and shorten the duration of ARI symptoms among adults. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the pooled effects of vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) on the occurrence of ARIs and the duration of ARI symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI (risk ratio (RR)=0.97; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00; p=0.028) and shortened the duration of symptoms (per cent difference: -6% (95% CI -9% to -2%; p=0.003)). The RR of vitamin D to prevent ARI was farther from the null when diagnosis was based on clinical diagnosis or laboratory testing, compared with self-report and when the loading dose was <60 000 IU. Vitamin C supplementation reduced the risk of ARIs (RR=0.96; 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99; p=0.01) and shortened the duration of symptoms (per cent difference: -9% (95% CI -16% to -2%; p=0.014)).

Targeting the binding affinity of molecules for either the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at its host receptor region or the S-protein:human ACE2 interface complex, we screen ligands from drug and biomolecule data sets that can potentially limit and/or disrupt the host-virus interactions. Top scoring one hundred eighty-seven ligands (with 75 approved by the Food and Drug Administration) are further validated by all atom docking studies. Important molecular descriptors (2&#967;n, topological surface area, and ring count) and promising chemical fragments (oxolane, hydroxy, and imidazole) are identified to guide future experiments. Overall, this work expands our knowledge of small-molecule treatment against COVID-19 and provides a general screening pathway (combining quick ML models with expensive high-fidelity simulations) for targeting several chemical/biochemical problems.","Batra, Rohit; Chan, Henry; Kamath, Ganesh; Ramprasad, Rampi; Cherukara, Mathew J; Sankaranarayanan, Subramanian K R S",J Phys Chem Lett,418,30

We utilized an online quantitative and qualitative survey to characterize the practices of RDs treating patients with IMDs during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify challenges and unmet needs. We received responses from 117 RDs. Results indicate that RDs are using alternate methods to engage this vulnerable population and provide MNT during the pandemic, including offering telemedicine appointments. Barriers to implementation of telemedicine include the limitations of virtual visits (inability to conduct physical exams and collect blood samples), time, patient knowledge of technology, audio problems, and patient access to internet, computers, or smartphones. RDs have addressed these barriers by extending prescriptions without a medical exam, relying on local facilities for blood draws, increasing the number of patients that use at-home filter papers for blood monitoring, and expanding the use of phone calls and emails. RDs identified patient education materials to facilitate telemedicine visits as a primary unmet need. Despite the reported barriers and limitations of telemedicine for MNT of IMDs, there was widespread satisfaction with the approach among RDs, with 96.9% reporting that they were somewhat or very satisfied with telemedicine. Although this survey focused on barriers, benefits of telemedicine for both RDs and patients were also reported.

This study is to understand COVID-19's imposed HR of fatality while controlling for covariates, such as age, sex, metastasis status and cancer type. METHODS: We conducted survival analyses of 4606 cancer patients with COVID-19 test results from 16 March to 11 October 2020 in UK Biobank and estimated the overall HR of fatality with and without COVID-19 infection. We also examined the HRs of 13 specific cancer types with at least 100 patients using a stratified analysis. RESULTS: COVID-19 resulted in an overall HR of 7.76 (95% CI 5.78 to 10.40, p<10-10) by following 4606 patients with cancer for 21 days after the tests. The HR varied among cancer type, with over a 10-fold increase in fatality rate (false discovery rate &#8804;0.02) for melanoma, haematological malignancies, uterine cancer and kidney cancer. Although COVID-19 imposed a higher risk for localised versus distant metastasis cancers, those of distant metastases yielded higher overall fatality rates due to their multiplicative effects. DISCUSSION: The results confirmed prior reports for the increased risk of fatality for patients with COVID-19 plus hematological malignancies and demonstrated similar findings of COVID-19 on melanoma, uterine, and kidney cancers. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the heightened risk that COVID-19 imposes on localised and haematological cancer patients and the necessity to vaccinate uninfected patients with cancer promptly, particularly for the cancer types most influenced by COVID-19. Results also suggest the importance of timely care for patients with localised cancer, whether they are infected by COVID-19 or not.","Li, Haiquan; Baldwin, Edwin; Zhang, Xiang; Kenost, Colleen; Luo, Wenting; Calhoun, Elizabeth A; An, Lingling; Bennett, Charles L; Lussier, Yves A",,418,22

We conducted a structured, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study that was addressed to patients after kidney, liver, pancreas, or combined transplantation. We focused on: sociodemographic data, present use of digital technologies in daily life and for health reasons, patients' eHealth literacy, and their overall attitude towards eHealth. A total of 234 patients completed the questionnaire. Most of the patients (90%) have a web-enabled computer, 78.2% have a smartphone, and 71.8% regularly search the internet for health-related information. Sixty-eight percent would like to receive discharge summaries online, and 54% would like to chat online with their physicians. Even though ICT use in daily life was age-related, no significant difference could be shown for health reasons or the type of transplanted organ. Modern ICT use is predominantly accepted for health reasons by SOT recipients. Regardless of the transplanted organ, a deeper integration of eHealth has potential for improving cross-sectoral care. To successfully implement eHealth technologies in cross-sectoral care future research should include online physician-patient communication, data security, data safety, and the aspects of quality and safety of care.","Holderried, Martin; Hoeper, Ansgar; Holderried, Friederike; Heyne, Nils; Nadalin, Silvio; Unger, Oliver; Ernst, Christian; Guthoff, Martina",Sci Rep,418,16

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study including healthcare professionals in the emergency department and other units serving patients with COVID-19, of a training and research hospital in Turkey. METHODS: 210 volunteers, including 105 healthcare professionals in the emergency department and 105 healthcare professionals working in other departments rendering services for COVID-19 patients, were included in this study. A sociodemographic data form and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF-TR) and Religious Orientation Scale were applied to the volunteers. RESULTS: The perceived stress levels and PSQI subscores were found to be significantly higher among the volunteers working in the emergency department than among those in other departments. The risk of development of anxiety among women was 16.6 times higher than among men. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals on the frontline need systematic regular psychosocial support mechanisms. Anxiety due to fear of infecting family members can be prevented through precautions such as isolation. However, it should be remembered that loneliness and feelings of missing family members consequent to isolation may increase the risk of depression.","Araç, Songül; Dönmezdil, Süleyman",Säo Paulo med. j,418,20

The causative agent was identified as a member of the Coronaviridae family, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we present an analysis on the substances identified in the human metabolome capable of binding the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The substances present in the human metabolome have both endogenous and exogenous origins. The aim of this research was to find molecules whose biochemical and toxicological profile was known that could be the starting point for the development of antiviral therapies. Our analysis revealed numerous metabolites-including xenobiotics-that bind this protease, which are essential to the lifecycle of the virus. Among these substances, silybin, a flavolignan compound and the main active component of silymarin, is particularly noteworthy. Silymarin is a standardized extract of milk thistle, Silybum marianum, and has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antineoplastic, and antiviral activities. Our results-obtained in silico and in vitro-prove that silybin and silymarin, respectively, are able to inhibit Mpro, representing a possible food-derived natural compound that is useful as a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19.","Sardanelli, Anna Maria; Isgrò, Camilla; Palese, Luigi Leonardo",Molecules (Basel),418,1

We describe 44 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (cycle threshold value <30) admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi between March 6 and April 15 2020. Whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these patients were sequenced using Illumina Miseq and analysed for common genetic variants and relationships to local and globally circulating strains. Results showed that 32 cases were Vietnamese with a median age of 37 years (range 15-74 years), and 23 were male. Most cases were acquired outside Vietnam, mainly from the UK (n = 15), other European countries (n = 14), Russia (n = 6) and countries in Asia (n = 3). No cases had travelled from China. Forty-one cases had symptoms at admission, typically dry cough (n = 36), fever (n = 20), sore throat (n = 14) and diarrhoea (n = 12). Hospitalisation was long with a median of 25 days, most commonly from 20-29 days. All SARS-CoV-2 genomes were similar (92-100% sequence homology) to the reference sequence Wuhan_1 (NC_045512), and 32 strains belonged to the B.1.1 lineage. The three most common variants were linked, and included C3037T, C14408T (nsp12: P323L) and A23403G (S: D614G) mutations. This group of mutations often accompanied variant C241T (39/44 genomes) or GGG 28881..28883 AAC (33/44 genomes). The prevalence of the former reflected probable European origin of viruses, and the transition D614G was dominant in Vietnam. New variants were identified; however, none could be associated with disease severity.","Nguyen, Tam Thi; Pham, Thach Ngoc; Van, Trang Dinh; Nguyen, Trang Thu; Nguyen, Diep Thi Ngoc; Le, Hoa Nguyen Minh; Eden, John-Sebastian; Rockett, Rebecca J; Nguyen, Thuong Thi Hong; Vu, Bich Thi Ngoc; Tran, Giang Van; Le, Tan Van; Dwyer, Dominic E; van Doorn, H Rogier",PLoS One,418,29

We aimed to assess changes in primary headache characteristics and lifestyle factors during the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany using digital documentation in the mobile application (app) M-sense. MAIN BODY: We analyzed data of smartphone users, who entered daily data in the app in the 28-day period before lockdown (baseline) and in the first 28 days of lockdown (observation period). This analysis included the change of monthly headache days (MHD) in the observation period compared to baseline. We also assessed changes in monthly migraine days (MMD), the use of acute medication, and pain intensity. In addition, we looked into the changes in sleep duration, sleep quality, energy level, mood, stress, and activity level. Outcomes were compared using paired t-tests. The analysis included data from 2325 app users. They reported 7.01 ± SD 5.64 MHD during baseline and 6.89 ± 5.47 MHD during lockdown without significant changes (p > 0.999). MMD, headache and migraine intensity neither showed any significant changes. Days with acute medication use were reduced from 4.50 ± 3.88 in the baseline to 4.27 ± 3.81 in the observation period (p < 0.001). The app users reported reduced stress levels, longer sleep duration, reduced activity levels, along with a better mood, and an improved energy level during the first lockdown month (p &#8804; 0.001). In an extension analysis of users who continued to use M-sense every day for 3 months after initiation of lockdown, we compared the baseline and the subsequent months using repeated-measures ANOVA. In these 539 users, headache frequency did not change significantly neither (6.11 ± 5.10 MHD before lockdown vs. 6.07 ± 5.17 MHD in the third lockdown month, p = 0.688 in the ANOVA). Migraine frequency, headache and migraine intensity, and acute medication use were also not different during the entire observation period. CONCLUSION: Despite slight changes in factors that contribute to the generation of headache, COVID-19-related lockdown measures did not seem to be associated with primary headache frequency and intensity over the course of 3 months.","Raffaelli, Bianca; Mecklenburg, Jasper; Scholler, Simon; Overeem, Lucas Hendrik; Oliveira Gonçalves, Ana Sofia; Reuter, Uwe; Neeb, Lars",J Headache Pain,418,29

Relatively little attention has been paid to understanding how the pandemic has affected treatment, prevention and control of malaria, which is a major cause of death and disease and predominantly affects people in less well-resourced settings. MAIN BODY: Recent successes in malaria control and elimination have reduced the global malaria burden, but these gains are fragile and progress has stalled in the past 5 years. Withdrawing successful interventions often results in rapid malaria resurgence, primarily threatening vulnerable young children and pregnant women. Malaria programmes are being affected in many ways by COVID-19. For prevention of malaria, insecticide-treated nets need regular renewal, but distribution campaigns have been delayed or cancelled. For detection and treatment of malaria, individuals may stop attending health facilities, out of fear of exposure to COVID-19, or because they cannot afford transport, and health care workers require additional resources to protect themselves from COVID-19. Supplies of diagnostics and drugs are being interrupted, which is compounded by production of substandard and falsified medicines and diagnostics. These disruptions are predicted to double the number of young African children dying of malaria in the coming year and may impact efforts to control the spread of drug resistance. Using examples from successful malaria control and elimination campaigns, we propose strategies to re-establish malaria control activities and maintain elimination efforts in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to be a long-term challenge. All sectors of society, including governments, donors, private sector and civil society organisations, have crucial roles to play to prevent malaria resurgence. Sparse resources must be allocated efficiently to ensure integrated health care systems that can sustain control activities against COVID-19 as well as malaria and other priority infectious diseases. CONCLUSION: As we deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that other major killers such as malaria are not ignored. History tells us that if we do, the consequences will be dire, particularly in vulnerable populations.","Rogerson, Stephen J; Beeson, James G; Laman, Moses; Poespoprodjo, Jeanne Rini; William, Timothy; Simpson, Julie A; Price, Ric N",BMC Med,418,26

However, psychophysical olfactory tests performed by an examiner are very difficult in these highly infectious patients. This study aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire for olfactory function that can be readily used to evaluate olfactory loss. METHODS: Fourteen smell-related questions were created based on smells familiar to Koreans. Among them, questions with a &#954; value of 0.6 or higher were finally selected through a test-retest reliability analysis. The correlations between the scores of the olfactory questionnaire and those of olfactory function tests (Butanol Threshold Test [BTT] and Cross Cultural Smell Identification Test [CCSIT]) were analyzed. To evaluate the predictive ability of the questionnaire and elicit cutoff values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. RESULTS: Out of the 14 questions in the questionnaire, 11 (&#954; > 0.6) were selected for the olfactory questionnaire. We analyzed 2,273 subjects, and there was a significant correlation between the total score of the olfactory questionnaire and the BTT (r = 0.643, P < 0.001) or CCSIT (r = 0.615, P < 0.001) scores. ROC curves for the olfactory questionnaire, BTT, and CCSIT all demonstrated high predictive power to discriminate anosmia and severe hyposmia from normosmia. Regarding mild to moderate hyposmia, however, ROC curve for the olfactory questionnaire alone showed high predictive power of discrimination from normosmia. Based on the results of ROC curves among the subclasses, we suggest the classification of the total score of the questionnaire as 0-4, 5-17, 18-27, 28-41, and 42-44, for anosmia, severe hyposmia, moderate hyposmia, mild hyposmia, and normosmia, respectively. CONCLUSION: The total scores of the questionnaires correlated with the BTT and CCSIT scores. The symptom questionnaire for olfactory dysfunction may be useful as an alternative tool for olfactory function testing, when unavailable.","Kim, Jeong Whun; Kim, Hyo Sang; Kim, Minju; Kim, Su Hwan; Cho, Sung Woo; Kim, Jin Youp",J Korean Med Sci,418,16

Furthermore, there are limited data on how these factors are associated with virological and immunological parameters over time. Methods and FindingsNasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were longitudinally collected from a cohort of 58 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Chicago, Illinois between March 27 and June 9, 2020. Samples were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 viral load, viral genotype, viral diversity, and antibody titer. Demographic and clinical information, including patient blood tests and several composite measures of disease severity, were extracted from electronic health records. All parameters were assessed for association with three patient outcome groups: discharge without intensive care unit (ICU) admission (n = 23), discharge with ICU admission (n = 29), and COVID-19 related death (n = 6). Higher age, male sex, and higher body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with ICU admission. At hospital admission, higher 4C Mortality scores and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were likewise associated with ICU admission. Longitudinal trends in Deterioration Index (DI) score, Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and serum neutrophil count were also associated with ICU admission, though only the retrospectively calculated median DI score was predictive of death. While viral load and genotype were not significantly associated with outcome in this study, viral load did correlate positively with C-reactive protein levels and negatively with D-dimer, lymphocyte count, and antibody titer. Intra-host viral genetic diversity resulted in changes in viral genotype in some participants over time, though intra-host evolution was not associated with outcome. A stepwise-generated multivariable model including BMI, lymphocyte count at admission, and neutrophil count at admission was sufficient to predict outcome with a 0.82 accuracy rate in this cohort. ConclusionsThese studies suggest that COVID-19 disease severity and poor outcomes among hospitalized patients are likely driven by dysfunctional host responses to infection and underlying co-morbid conditions rather than SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Several parameters, including 4C mortality score, LDH levels, and DI score, were ultimately predictive of participant outcome and warrant further exploration in larger cohort studies for use in clinical management and risk assessment. Finally, the prevalence of intra-host diversity and viral evolution in hospitalized patients suggests a mechanism for population-level change, further emphasizing the need for effective antivirals to suppress viral replication and to avoid the emergence of new variants.","Simons, Lacy M; Lorenzo-Redondo, Ramon; Gibson, Meg; Kinch, Sarah L; Vandervaart, Jacob P; Reiser, Nina L; Eren, Mesut; Lux, Elizabeth; McNally, Elizabeth; Tambur, Anat R; Vaughan, Douglas E; Bachta, Kelly R; Demonbreun, Alexis R.; Satchell, Karla J.F.; Achenbach, Chad J; Ozer, Egon A; Ison, Michael G; Hultquist, Judd F.",,418,25

However we argue that, while detection of cases have still not been reported after 10 days and one million app downloads - a situation comparable to Australia who launched its app a month before -, the adoption of the app generates important risks to our informational privacy, surveillance and habituation to security policies. It also may create discrimination, distrust and generate other health problems such as addiction and others as 5G technology continues to be deployed without prior impact studies. Finally the smartphone app against covid epidemics appears as an extreme case of the privacy paradox where the government plays on the immediate benefits and downplays long-term concerns while inducing a technology of self.

The effect of AKI on the clinical outcomes of these two conditions is unclear. METHODS: This retrospective, territory-wide cohort study used an electronic public healthcare database in Hong Kong to identify patients with SARS or COVID-19 by diagnosis codes, virologic results, or both. The primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death. RESULTS: We identified 1670 patients with SARS and 1040 patients with COVID-19 (median ages, 41 versus 35 years, respectively). Among patients with SARS, 26% met the primary endpoint versus 5.3% of those with COVID-19. Diabetes mellitus, abnormal liver function, and AKI were factors significantly associated with the primary endpoint among patients with either SARS or COVID-19. Among patients with SARS, 7.9%, 2.1%, and 3.7% developed stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI, respectively; among those with COVID-19, 6.6%, 0.4%, and 1.1% developed stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI, respectively. In both groups, factors significantly associated with AKI included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Among patients with AKI, those with COVID-19 had a lower rate of major adverse clinical outcomes versus patients with SARS. Renal function recovery usually occurred within 30 days after an initial AKI event. CONCLUSIONS: AKI rates were higher among patients with SARS than those with COVID-19. AKI was associated with major adverse clinical outcomes for both diseases. Patients with diabetes mellitus and abnormal liver function were also at risk of developing severe consequences after SARS and COVID-19 infection.","Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Yip, Terry Cheuk-Fung; Lui, Grace Chung-Yan; Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun; Chow, Viola Chi-Ying; Ho, Tracy Hang-Yee; Li, Timothy Chun-Man; Tse, Yee-Kit; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Ng, Chi-Fai; Hui, David Shu-Cheong; Chan, Henry Lik-Yuen; Szeto, Cheuk-Chun; Wong, Grace Lai-Hung",J.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to paediatric oncology providers worldwide from June 22 to Aug 21, 2020, through the St Jude Global Alliance and International Society for Paediatric Oncology listservs and regional networks. The survey included 60 questions to assess institution characteristics, the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, disruptions to cancer care (eg, service closures and treatment abandonment), adaptations to care, and resources (including availability of clinical staff and personal protective equipment). Surveys were included for analysis if respondents answered at least two thirds of the items, and the responses were analysed at the institutional level. FINDINGS: Responses from 311 health-care professionals at 213 institutions in 79 countries from all WHO regions were included in the analysis. 187 (88%) of 213 centres had the capacity to test for SARS-CoV-2 and a median of two (range 0-350) infections per institutution were reported in children with cancer. 15 (7%) centres reported complete closure of paediatric haematology-oncology services (median 10 days, range 1-75 days). Overall, 2% (5 of 213) of centres were no longer evaluating new cases of suspected cancer, while 43% (90 of 208) of the remaining centers described a decrease in newly diagnosed paediatric cancer cases. 73 (34%) centres reported increased treatment abandonment (ie, failure to initiate cancer therapy or a delay in care of 4 weeks or longer). Changes to cancer care delivery included: reduced surgical care (153 [72%]), blood product shortages (127 [60%]), chemotherapy modifications (121 [57%]), and interruptions to radiotherapy (43 [28%] of 155 institutions that provided radiotherapy before the pandemic). The decreased number of new cancer diagnoses did not vary based on country income status (p=0·14). However, unavailability of chemotherapy agents (p=0·022), treatment abandonment (p<0·0001), and interruptions in radiotherapy (p<0·0001) were more frequent in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.

TB is strongly associated with poverty and this risk is largely mediated by undernutrition in India. COVID-19 response related lockdown has resulted in an economic crisis which may double levels of poverty, has exacerbated food insecurity, and disrupted TB services. These developments may have serious implications for TB progression and transmission in India. The nutritional status of a population is a strong determinant of the TB incidence, and undernutrition in adults alone accounts for 32–44% of TB incidence in India. A systematic review has shown that a 14% increase in TB incidence can occur per one unit decrease in body mass index (BMI), across the BMI range of 18.5–30 kg/m2. We believe that one unit decrease in BMI (corresponding to a 2–3 kg weight loss) may result in the poor in India as a result of the lockdown and its aftermath. This may result in an increase in estimated (uncertainty interval) incident TB by 185 610 (180 230, 190 990) cases. A 59% reduction in TB case detection between end March and May 2020, may result in an estimated (uncertainty interval) additional 87 711 (59 998, 120 630) TB deaths [19.5% increase (14.5, 24.7)] in 2020. Disadvantaged social groups and those living in states with higher levels of poverty, under-nutrition,and migrant workers are at particular risk. We suggest enhanced rations including pulses through the public distribution system and direct cash transfers to the poor pending restoration of livelihoods. TB services should be resumed immediately with enhanced efforts at case detection including active case finding. To prevent deaths among TB detected within the national TB programme, systemic identification, referral and management of severe disease at notification should be considered.","Bhargava, Anurag; Shewade, Hemant Deepak",Indian J.

The coronavirus spike glycoprotein encourages the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells and is the main target of antivirals. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 to enter cells with an affinity similar to SARS-CoV, correlated with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans.Objective: In the research, identification, evaluation, and exploration of the structure of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein macromolecules and their effects on Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) using in silico studies.Methods: The spike glycoproteins of the two coronaviruses were prepared using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2020. Further identification of the three-dimensional structure and sequencing of the macromolecular spike glycoprotein structure using Chimera 1.14 and Notepad++. To ensure the affinity and molecular interactions between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins against ACE-2 protein-protein docking simulations using PatchDock was accomplished. The results of the simulations were verified using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2020.Results: Based on the results of the identification of the macromolecular structure of the spike glycoprotein, it was found that there are some similarities in characteristics between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Protein-protein docking simulations resulted that SARS-COV-2 spike glycoprotein has the strongest bond with ACE-2, with an ACE score of −1509.13 kJ/mol.Conclusion: Therefore, some information obtained from the results of this research can be used as a reference in the development of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein inhibitor candidates for the treatment of infectious diseases of COVID-19.","Fakih, Taufik Muhammad; Dewi, Mentari Luthfika",Journal Of Biomedicine And Translational Research,418,29

DESIGN: Cross-sectional questionnaire study, part of the longitudinal UK Medical Applicant Cohort Study (UKMACS). SETTING: UK medical school admissions in 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 2887 participants completed an online questionnaire from 8 April to 22 April 2020. Eligible participants had registered to take the University Clinical Admissions Test in 2019 and agreed to be invited to take part, or had completed a previous UKMACS questionnaire, had been seriously considering applying to medicine in the UK for entry in 2020, and were UK residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Views on calculated grades, views on medical school admissions and teaching in 2020 and 2021, reported experiences of education during the national lockdown. RESULTS: Respondents were concerned about the calculated grades that replaced A-level examinations: female and Black Asian and Minority Ethnic applicants felt teachers would find it difficult to grade and rank students accurately, and applicants from non-selective state schools and living in deprived areas had concerns about the standardisation process. Calculated grades were generally not considered fair enough to use in selection, but were considered fair enough to use in combination with other measures including interview and aptitude test scores. Respondents from non-selective state (public) schools reported less access to educational resources compared with private/selective school pupils, less online teaching in real time and less time studying during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has and will have significant and long-term impacts on the selection, education and performance of our medical workforce. It is important that the views and experiences of applicants from diverse backgrounds are considered in decisions affecting their future and the future of the profession.","Woolf, Katherine; Harrison, David; McManus, Chris",BMJ Open,418,17

(2) To provide a treatment algorithm for care of COVID-19 positive/suspected hip fractures patients that accounts for their increased risk of morbidity and mortality. SETTING: One academic medical center including 4 Level 1 trauma centers, 1 university-based tertiary care referral hospital, and 1 orthopaedic specialty hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One thousand two hundred seventy-eight patients treated for hip fractures between October 2014 and April 2020, including 136 patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic between February 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020. INTERVENTION: The Score for Trauma Triage in the Geriatric and Middle-Aged ORIGINAL (STTGMAORIGINAL) score was modified by adding COVID-19 virus as a risk factor for mortality to create the STTGMACOVID score. Patients were stratified into quartiles to demonstrate differences in risk distribution between the scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Inpatient and 30-day mortality, major, and minor complications. RESULTS: Both STTGMA score and COVID-19 positive/suspected status are independent predictors of inpatient mortality, confirming their use in risk assessment models for geriatric hip fracture patients. Compared with STTGMAORIGINAL, where COVID-19 patients are haphazardly distributed among the risk groups and COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities comprise 50% deaths in the minimal-risk and low-risk cohorts, the STTGMACOVID tool is able to triage 100% of COVID-19 patients and 100% of COVID-19 inpatient and 30 days mortalities into the highest risk quartile, where it was demonstrated that these patients have a 55% rate of pneumonia, a 35% rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a 22% rate of inpatient mortality, and a 35% rate of 30 days mortality. COVID-19 patients who are symptomatic on presentation to the emergency department and undergo surgical fixation have a 30% inpatient mortality rate compared with 12.5% for patients who are initially asymptomatic but later develop symptoms. CONCLUSION: The STTGMA tool can be modified for specific disease processes, in this case to account for the COVID-19 virus and provide a robust risk stratification tool that accounts for a heretofore unknown risk factor. COVID-19 positive/suspected status portends a poor outcome in this susceptible trauma population and should be included in risk assessment models. These patients should be considered a high risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 symptoms on presentation should have surgery deferred until symptoms improve or resolve and should be reassessed for surgical treatment versus definitive nonoperative treatment with palliative care and/or hospice care.

Ripening of tomato fruit is associated with several modifications such as loss of cell wall firmness and transformation of chloroplasts to chromoplasts. Besides a peak in H2O2, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are observed at the transition stage. However, the role of different components of oxidative stress metabolism in fruit ripening has been scarcely addressed. Two GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GGP) Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Micro-Tom mutants which have fruit with low ascorbic acid content (30% of wild type) were used in this work to unravel the participation of ascorbic acid and H2O2 in fruit maturation. Both GGP mutants show delayed fruit maturation with no peak of H2O2; treatment with ascorbic acid increases its own concentration and accelerates ripening only in mutants to become like wild type plants. Unexpectedly, the treatment with ascorbic acid increases H2O2 synthesis in both mutants resembling what is observed in wild type fruit. Exogenous supplementation with H2O2 decreases its own synthesis delaying fruit maturation in plants with low ascorbic acid content. The site of ROS production is localized in the chloroplasts of fruit of all genotypes as determined by confocal microscopy analysis. The results presented here demonstrate that both ascorbic acid and H2O2 actively participate in tomato fruit ripening.","Steelheart, Charlotte; Alegre, Matías Leonel; Baldet, Pierre; Rothan, Christophe; Bres, Cecile; Just, Daniel; Okabe, Yoshihiro; Ezura, Hiroshi; Ganganelli, Inti; Gergoff Grozeff, Gustavo Esteban; Bartoli, Carlos Guillermo",Planta,418,1

However, overlapping imaging findings with cardiogenic pulmonary edema is not uncommon. Reports comparing the chest CT features of these diseases have not been elaborated. Thus, we aimed to show the difference between the low-dose lung CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparing them to those with acute heart failure (HF). Methods This retrospective analysis enrolled hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=10) and acute heart failure (n=9) that exclusively underwent low-dose chest CT scans within 24 hours of admission. Clinical and lung CT characteristics were collected and analyzed. Results The appearance of ground-glass-opacities (GGOs) has been recorded in all individuals in the HF and COVID-19 groups. There was no significant statistical difference between the two groups for rounded morphology, consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lesion distribution, and parenchymal band (P&gt;0.05). However, diffuse lesions were more frequent in HF cases (55.6% vs. 0%) than in COVID-19 pneumonia, which had a predominantly multifocal pattern. Notably, CT images in HF patients were more likely to have signs of interstitial tissue thickening, such as the interlobular septums, fissures, and peribronchovascular interstitium (55.6% vs 0%, 88.9% vs 20% and 44.4% vs 0%, respectively), as well as cardiomegaly (77.8% vs 0%), increased artery to bronchus ratio (55.6% vs 0%), and pleural effusions (77.8% vs 0%). Conclusions Major overlaps of lung CT imaging features existed between COVID-19 pneumonia and acute HF cases. However, signs of fluid redistribution are clues that favor HF over COVID-19 pneumonia.","Suciadi, L. P.; William, Y.; Jorizal, P.; Tarigan, V. N.; Santoso, A.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum vitamin D level in elite male collegiate athletes and to analyze its effect on body fat percentage. METHODS: We enrolled a total of 42 elite male collegiate athletes in this prospective cohort study. In March 2020, body composition monitoring and blood test were performed. All athletes were provided with vitamin D3 supplement tablets of 25 µg/day. The use of the supplement was dependent on athletes' preference. During the study period, their club activities were stopped for 2 months due to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. A second examination, similar to the first one, was performed after approximately 3 months. Supplement usage by each athlete was also confirmed. The participants were divided into a non-supplement group (without supplementation, n = 15) and a supplement group (with supplementation, n = 27). RESULTS: Regarding baseline data at initial examination, the non-supplement and supplement groups showed significant differences in the mean body fat percentage (9.0% and 12.1%, respectively; P = 0.03) and serum 25(OH)D level (22.7 and 18.5 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.02). At the time of the second examination, there were no significant differences in the results of both the groups. In terms of mean change value from the first to the second examination, there were significant differences in body fat percentage (1.9 and 0.2%, respectively, P = 0.02) and serum 25(OH)D level (1.7 and 7.2 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.001) between the two groups. A significant negative correlation was observed between the change ratio of body fat percentage and change value of serum 25(OH)D level (r = - 0.37, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation of 25 µg/day significantly increased the serum 25(OH)D level in elite male collegiate athletes. Vitamin D supplementation may play a role in maintaining athletes' body fat percentage under circumstances where sports activity has decreased.","Kawashima, Itaru; Tsukahara, Takashi; Kawai, Ryosuke; Mizuno, Takafumi; Ishizuka, Shinya; Hiraiwa, Hideki; Imagama, Shiro",Nutr Metab (Lond),418,26

Holospora and Holospora-like bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria) are characterized by their ability for vertical and horizontal transmission in host populations, a complex biphasic life cycle, and pronounced preference for host species and colonized cell compartment. These bacteria are obligate intracellular parasites; thus, their metabolic repertoire is dramatically reduced. Nevertheless, they perform complex interactions with the host ciliate. We review ongoing efforts to unravel the molecular adaptations of these bacteria to their unusual lifestyle and the host's employment in the symbiosis. Furthermore, we summarize current knowledge on the genetic and genomic background of Paramecium-Holospora symbiosis and provide insights into the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this interaction. The diversity and occurrence of symbioses between ciliates and Holospora-like bacteria in nature is discussed in connection with transmission modes of symbionts, host specificity and compatibility of the partners. We aim to summarize 50 years of research devoted to these symbiotic systems and conclude trying to predict some perspectives for further studies.","Schrallhammer, Martina; Potekhin, Alexey",Results Probl Cell Differ,418,1

The main aim was to assess the association of complete blood indices measured at baseline with COVID-19 related in-hospital clinical outcomes, including length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, receiving mechanical ventilation, degree of lung injury and in-hospital death, and post-recovery status. This retrospective study included patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 infection from August 20, to September 25, 2020. The initial study cohort included 127 patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. Of whom 26 patients were excluded, leaving 101 patients for final analysis. low lymphocytes % [Odds ratio and confidence intervals = OR (CI)] [0.2(0.0-0.2, p=0.03] increased the odds of ICU stay length while high platelet mean volume (PMV) [0.9 (1.1-5, p<0.00], high platelet distribution width (PDW) [0.3(0.4-1.9), p<0.00], and low lymphocytes % [0.2 (0.0-0.2), p=0.02] increased the odds of length of hospital stay. Decreased lymphocytes % showed significant independent association with increased risk for mechanical ventilation use [0.9 (0.9-1), p=0.04], extensive degree of lung injury [0.2 (0.1-0.7), p<0.00], and in-hospital death [0.5 (0.3-0.8), p=0.01]. High lymphocytes %[0.9 (0.9-1), p<0.00] and high PMV [0.3 (0.3-0.8), p=0.02] were significantly associated with complete recovery while increased neutrophil % [1 (1-1.1), p=0.04] was associated with increased risk for post recovery fatigue. In conclusion, low lymphocytes % and high neutrophil % are useful markers for predicting adverse in-hospital outcome and post-recovery persistent fatigue, respectively. High PMV and lymphocyte % showed significant association with favorable short-term prognosis.","Al-Buthabhak, Karrar; Nafakhi, Hussein; Shukur, Mohammed H; Nafakhi, Ahmed; Alareedh, Mohammed; Shaghee, Foaad",Monaldi arch. chest dis,418,16

Here we model the effect of evictions on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, simulating viral transmission within and among households in a theoretical metropolitan area. We recreate a range of urban epidemic trajectories and project the course of the epidemic under two counterfactual scenarios, one in which a strict moratorium on evictions is in place and enforced, and another in which evictions are allowed to resume at baseline or increased rates. We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increases in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods. Our results provide a basis to assess eviction moratoria and show that policies to stem evictions are a warranted and important component of COVID-19 control.","Nande, Anjalika; Sheen, Justin; Walters, Emma L; Klein, Brennan; Chinazzi, Matteo; Gheorghe, Andrei H; Adlam, Ben; Shinnick, Julianna; Tejeda, Maria Florencia; Scarpino, Samuel V; Vespignani, Alessandro; Greenlee, Andrew J; Schneider, Daniel; Levy, Michael Z; Hill, Alison L",Nat Commun,418,16

Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan. Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed. We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. The distance between patients' home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS. RESULTS: All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0). Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0). Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly. Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital. Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.","Huang, Chunmei; Xu, Xinjie; Cai, Yuyang; Ge, Qinmin; Zeng, Guangwang; Li, Xiaopan; Zhang, Weide; Ji, Chen; Yang, Ling",J Med Internet Res,418,6

A 10% increase in robots per 1000 workers is associated with an approximately 10% reduction in the share of low-skilled individuals reporting poor health. Further analysis suggests that the reallocation of tasks partly explains this finding. A 10% increase in robots per 1000 workers is associated with an approximately 1.5% reduction in physical tasks supplied by low-skilled workers.","Gunadi, Christian; Ryu, Hanbyul",Health econ,418,16

In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the ability of long PP sessions to improve oxygenation in awake ICU patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to COVID-19. METHODS: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Galicia (code No. 2020-188), and all patients provided informed consent. In this case series, awake patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID-19 admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at University Hospital of Santiago from March 21 to April 5, 2020 were prospectively analyzed. Patients were instructed to remain in PP as long as possible, until the patient felt too tired to maintain that position. Light sedation was administered with dexmedetomidine. The following information were collected: number and duration of PP sessions, StO2 and blood gases before, during and following a PP session, need of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission and ICU outcome. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) were fit to estimate changes from baseline with a random effect for patient. RESULTS: Seven patients with moderate or severe ARDS by COVID 19 were included. All patients received at least one PP session. A total of 16 PP sessions were performed in the 7 patients during the period study. The median duration of PP sessions was 10 hours. Dexmedetomidine was used in all PP sessions. Oxygenation increased in all sixteen sessions performed in the seven patients. The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) significantly increased during PP (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 110 [19; 202]) and after PP, albeit not significantly (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 38 [-9.2; 85]) compared with previous supine position. Similarly, tissue oxygenation underwent a small improvement during PP (change from baseline and CI 97.5%: 2.6% [0.69; 4.6]) without significant changes after PP. Two patients required intubation. All patients were discharged from the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: We found that PP improved oxygenation in ICU patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS. PP was relatively well tolerated in our patients and may be a simple strategy to improve oxygenation trying to reduce patients in mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU, especially in COVID-19 pandemic.","Taboada, Manuel; González, Mariana; Álvarez, Antía; González, Irene; García, Javier; Eiras, María; Diaz Vieito, María; Naveira, Alberto; Otero, Pablo; Campaña, Olga; Muniategui, Ignacio; Tubio, Ana; Costa, Jose; Selas, Salomé; Cariñena, Agustín; Martínez, Adrián; Veiras, Sonia; Aneiros, Francisco; Caruezo, Valentín; Baluja, Aurora; Alvarez, Julian",,418,16

Further disruption due to COVID-19, forced Nurse Educators overnight to rapidly adopt and to innovatively use current and emerging technologies to maintain engagement with, and to continue delivering education to, students during the pandemic. Although the full extent of these enforced changes is unknown at this time, this paper argues that online delivery is a necessary and inevitable transition, addressing some of these pre-existing challenges, and that the pandemic has hastened this. It is therefore crucial that Nurse Educators lead the way in navigating this period of uncertainty, viewing the pandemic as an opportunity to plan for the future, to establish how online teaching and learning can continue to benefit Nurse Education in a post-COVID-19 world, not just in the UK, but across the globe.","Haslam, Michael B",Nurse Educ Today,418,21

MATERIAL AND METHODS The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale were used to evaluate the resilience and perceived stress of 600 medical staff members from the radiology departments in 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze factors related to resilience. RESULTS The total resilience score was 65.76±17.26, wherein the toughness dimension score was 33.61±9.52, the strength dimension score was 21.25±5.50, and the optimism dimension score was 10.91±3.15. There was a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and resilience (r=-0.635, P<0.001). According to multivariate analysis, the total perceived stress score (ß=-1.318, P<0.001), gender (ß=-4.738, P<0.001), knowledge of COVID-19 (ß=2.884, P=0.043), knowledge of COVID-19 protective measures (ß=3.260, P=0.042), and availability of adequate protective materials (ß=-1.268, P=0.039) were independent influencing factors for resilience. CONCLUSIONS The resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of COVID-19 was generally low, particularly regarding toughness. More attention should be paid to resilience influence factors such as high perceived stress, female gender, lack of understanding of COVID-19 and protective measures, and lack of protective materials, and targeted interventions should be undertaken to improve the resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Huang, Lei; Wang, Yun; Liu, Juan; Ye, Pengfei; Cheng, Bochao; Xu, Huayan; Qu, Haibo; Ning, Gang",Med Sci Monit,418,20

In order to be able to continue providing high-quality health care, it is important that organizations are well integrated at all organizational levels. The objective of this study was to to gain an understanding in which extent cooperation within an urban acute care network in the Netherlands (The Hague) improved because of the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: Exploratory mixed-methods questionnaire and qualitative interview study. Semistructured interviews with stakeholders in the acute care network at micro (n = 10), meso (n = 9), and macro (n = 3) levels of organization. Thematic analysis took place along the lines of the 6 dimensions of the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care. Results: In this study we identified themes that may act as barriers or facilitators to cooperation: communication, interaction, trust, leadership, interests, distribution of care, and funding. During the crisis many facilitators were identified at clinical, professional, and system level such as clear agreements about work processes, trust in each other's work, and different stakeholders growing closer together. However, at an organizational and communicative level there were many barriers such as interference in each other's work and a lack of clear policies. Conclusion: The driving force behind all changes in integration of acute care organizations in an urban context during the COVID-19 crisis seemed to be a great sense of urgency to cooperate in the shared interest of providing the best patient care. We recommend shifting the postcrisis focus from overcoming the crisis to overcoming cooperative challenges.","Minderhout, R. N.; Baksteen, M. C.; Numans, M. E.; Bruijnzeels, M. A.; Vos, H. M.

We call this statistic""sufficiently-labeled data""and prove its sufficiency and efficiency for finding the optimal hidden representations, on which competent classifier heads can be trained using as few as a single randomly-chosen fully-labeled example per class. Sufficiently-labeled data can be obtained from annotators directly without collecting the fully-labeled data first.

Currently, there is an unmet clinical and research need for non-invasive approaches to monitor lung inflammation through targeting immunoregulatory pathways contributing to ALI pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the role of targeted imaging of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), as a key integrin mediating the adhesion and recruitment of immune cells to inflamed tissues, in quantifying lung inflammation in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI. Methods: ALI was induced by a single intra-tracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (10, 20 or 40 µg per mouse) in C57BL/6J mice. Control mice were intra-tracheally instilled with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. VLA-4 targeted PET/CT was performed 24 hours after intravenous injection of a copper-64 (64Cu) labeled high-affinity peptidomimetic ligand, 64Cu-CB-TE1A1P-PEG4-LLP2A (64Cu-LLP2A), at day 2 after the induction of ALI. Ex vivo biodistribution of 64Cu-LLP2A was determined by Î³-counting of harvested organs. The severity of lung inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring the expression of inflammatory markers in the lung tissue lysates using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Intra-tracheal lipopolysaccharide instillation led to an acute inflammatory response in the lungs, characterized by increased expression of multiple inflammatory markers and infiltration of myeloid cells, along with a significant and specific increase in 64Cu-LLP2A uptake, predominantly in a peribronchial distribution. There was a strong correlation between the lipopolysaccharide dose and 64Cu-LLP2A uptake, as quantified by in vivo PET (R=0.69, P<0.01). Expression levels of both subunits of VLA-4, i.e., integrins &#945;4 and ß1, significantly correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, interleukin-1ß and nitric oxide synthase-2, highlighting the potential of VLA-4 as a surrogate marker of acute lung inflammation. Notably, in vivo 64Cu-LLP2A uptake significantly correlated with the expression of multiple inflammatory markers and VLA-4. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of molecular imaging of VLA-4, as a mechanistically-relevant target in ALI, and the accuracy of VLA-4 targeted PET in quantification of ongoing lung inflammation in a murine model.","Haddad, Joseph; Latoche, Joseph D; Nigam, Shubhanchi; Bellavia, Michael C; Day, Kathryn E; Zhu, Qin; Edwards, Wilson Barry; Anderson, Carolyn J; Tavakoli, Sina",J. nucl. med,418,1

RECENT FINDINGS: New data strengthen the evidence against a causal link between MS and vaccination. Recent consensus statements agree on the need to start vaccination early. Timings for vaccine administration should be adjusted to ensure safety and optimize vaccine responses, given the potential interference of DMDs. Patients treated with Ocrelizumab (and potentially other B-cell depleting therapies) are at risk of diminished immunogenicity to vaccines. This has relevant implications for the upcoming vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY: An early assessment and immunization of MS patients allows optimizing vaccine responses and avoiding potential interference with treatment plans. Vaccinations are safe and effective but some specific considerations should be followed when vaccinating before, during, and after receiving immunotherapy. A time-window for vaccination taking into account the kinetics of B cell repopulation could potentially improve vaccine responses. Further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response dynamics in MS patients under specific therapies will be key for defining the best vaccination strategy.","Otero-Romero, Susana; Ascherio, Alberto; Lebrun-Frénay, Christine",Curr Opin Neurol,418,27

However, lockdown and shutdown interventions have caused new social problems and designating policy resumption for infection control when reopening society remains a crucial issue. We investigated the effects of different resumption strategies on COVID-19 transmission using a modeling study setting. METHODS: We employed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks under five reopening strategies based on China's business resumption progress. The effect of each strategy was evaluated using the peak values of the epidemic curves vis-à-vis confirmed active cases and cumulative cases. Two-sample t-test was performed in order to affirm that the pick values in different scenarios are different. RESULTS: We found that a hierarchy-based reopen strategy performed best when current epidemic prevention measures were maintained save for lockdown, reducing the peak number of active cases and cumulative cases by 50 and 44%, respectively. However, the modeled effect of each strategy decreased when the current intervention was lifted somewhat. Additional attention should be given to regions with significant numbers of migrants, as the potential risk of COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening is intrinsically high. CONCLUSIONS: Business resumption strategies have the potential to eliminate COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening without special control measures. The proposed resumption strategies focused mainly on decreasing the number of imported exposure cases, guaranteeing medical support for epidemic control, or decreasing active cases.","Ge, Yong; Zhang, Wen-Bin; Wang, Jianghao; Liu, Mengxiao; Ren, Zhoupeng; Zhang, Xining; Zhou, Chenghu; Tian, Zhaoxing",BMC Public Health,418,15

This set the stage for legal sports betting—a new consumer behavior (or innovation) with the potential to increase fan engagement and create new revenue streams for leagues and teams. Although many believe sports betting will lead to positive marketing outcomes for leagues and teams, we question whether it can also lead to negative marketing outcomes. Across two experiments, consumers who bet on the home team and lost reported lower positive emotions and subsequent fan engagement than consumers who did not bet. Furthermore, consumers who bet on the home team and won did not report higher fan engagement than consumers who did not bet. Thus, we uncover a potential drawback of legal sports betting, which has major implications for leagues and teams that embrace it.","Stadler Blank, Ashley Loveland Katherine E.; Houghton, David M.",Journal of Business Research,418,12

Currently, chronic stress is classified as a ""risk indicator"" for periodontal disease. However, as the evidence in this field matures with additional clinically controlled trials, more homogeneous data collection methods, and a better grasp of the biologic underpinnings of stress-mediated dysbiosis, emerging evidence suggests that chronic stress and related diseases (depression, anxiety) may be significant contributing factors in periodontal/peri-implant disease progression and inconsistent wound healing following periodontal-related therapeutics.

People who wished to be reinstated were asked to complete a survey on gambling related issues and then watch the tutorial video. An online video-based tutorial designed to reduce gambling related harm and to provide information about treatment services was developed. The control group (N = 131) consisted of people who reinstated in the year prior to the implementation of the online tutorial. The experimental intervention group (N = 104) were those who reinstated after the implementation of the online tutorial. There was a significant decrease in gambling and problem gambling comparing pre-exclusion to during exclusion in both the experimental and control group. Furthermore, this drop in gambling problem was sustained for 6-months and 12-months after reinstatement. However, no main effect or interaction was found that supported the efficacy of the tutorial.

Using population nonlinear mixed-effects (pNLME) statistical inference and viral loads from 46 RV217 study participants, we developed a relatively simple HIV primary infection model that achieved an excellent fit to all data. We also discovered that Aptima assay values from the study strongly correlated with viral loads, enabling imputation of very early viral loads for 28/46 participants. Estimated times between infecting exposures and first positives were generally longer than prior estimates (average of two weeks) and were robust to missing viral upslope data. On simulated data, we found that tighter sampling before diagnosis improved estimation more than tighter sampling after diagnosis. Sampling weekly before and monthly after diagnosis was a pragmatic design for good timing accuracy. Our pNLME timing approach is widely applicable to other infections with existing mathematical models. The present model could be used to simulate future HIV trials and may help estimate protective thresholds from the recently completed antibody-mediated prevention trials.","Reeves, Daniel B.; Rolland, Morgane; Dearlove, Bethany L.; Li, Yifan; Robb, Merlin L.; Schiffer, Joshua T.; Gilbert, Peter; Cardozo-Ojeda, E.

Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. METHODS: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. RESULTS: We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time > 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. CONCLUSION: The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high.

Prophylactics and therapies are urgently needed to address this public health problem. We report here the efficacy of a vaccine consisting of chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV. In this study, a fusion of the canine parvovirus (CPV) VP2 structural protein gene with the RBD of MERS-CoV can self-assemble into chimeric, spherical VLP (sVLP). sVLP retained certain parvovirus characteristics, such as the ability to agglutinate pig erythrocytes, and structural morphology similar to CPV virions. Immunization with sVLP induced RBD-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. sVLP-specific antisera from these animals were able to prevent pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, with neutralizing antibody titers reaching 1: 320. IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-2 secreting cells induced by the RBD were detected in the splenocytes of vaccinated mice by ELISpot. Furthermore, mice inoculated with sVLP or an adjuvanted sVLP vaccine elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity.

Various types of topical anesthesia were reported, including nebulizer treatments. The most common forms of personal protective equipment utilized were gloves (>95%) and N95 masks (>67%). Powered‐air purifying respirators and general surgical masks were used infrequently. CONCLUSIONS: During the early re‐introduction, respondents reported generally continuing to perform office laryngology procedures, while greater mucosal manipulation affected decisions to stop procedures due to COVID‐19, perform preprocedural SARS‐Cov2 testing, and alter topical anesthesia. Gloves and N95 masks were the predominate PPE. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.","Calcagno, Haley; Anthony, Benjamin P.; Halum, Stacey L.; Parker, Noah P.",Laryngoscope Investig Otolaryngol,418,1

The impact of the pandemic and related public health interventions on specialized psychiatric emergency services has not been described. These services provide high intensity care for severely ill patients who are likely to be homeless and underserved. OBJECTIVE: We describe the change in total volume and psychiatric hospitalization rates among three psychiatric emergency services across the United States. METHODS: Change in volumes and hospitalization were assessed for statistical significance using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors model from January 2018 to December 2020. RESULTS: The pandemic’s impact on volumes and hospitalization varied by site. In Denver (CO), there was a statistically significant 9% decrease in overall volumes, although an 18% increase in hospitalizations was not significant. In New York City (NY), there was a significant 7% decrease in volumes as well as a significant 6% decrease in hospitalizations. In Portland (OR), volumes decreased by 4% and hospitalizations increased by 6% although differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: There has been a decrease in volume at these service after the pandemic, but there are substantial variations in the magnitude of change and demand for hospitalization by region. These findings suggest a need to understand where patients in crisis are seeking care and how systems of care must adapt to changing utilization in the pandemic era.","Simpson, Scott A.; Loh, Ryan M.; Cabrera, Maximilliam; Cahn, Megan; Gross, Anne; Hadley, Allison; Lawrence, Ryan E.",J Acad Consult Liaison Psychiatry,418,16

Given dominant ethical trends, such reactive ethics tends to lead to either individualized struggles over the right way to act or hasty sets of guidelines that leave out contextualizing questions concerning regimes of care. Good people will find themselves suggesting strange things, from setting up lifeboat scenarios to supporting structural racism. This essay argues against both these paths—crisis-ridden agonism or algorithmic resource-allocation—and turns instead to a form of ethics of care which takes its departure from older forms of ethics, while recognizing that modern and postmodern challenges no longer allow their grounding in animated relations, natural rights, or cosmological truths.","James, Paul",J Bioeth Inq,418,29

Patients have been reported with multi-organ dysfunction along with acute respiratory distress syndrome which implies a critical situation for patients and made them difficult to breathe and survive. Moreover, pathology of COVID-19 is also related to cytokine storm which indicates the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18 along with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Among them, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been reported to be induced via binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS)-CoV-2 to the host receptors. METHODOLOGY: Interleukin-6 blockade has been proposed to constitute novel therapeutics against COVID-19. Thus, in this study, 15 phytocompounds with known antiviral activity have been subjected to test for their inhibitory effect on IL-6. Based on the affinity prediction, top 3 compounds (isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide) with best scores were selected for 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation and MMGB/PBSA binding free energy analysis. RESULTS: Three phytocompounds including isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide have shown strong interactions with the targeted protein IL-6 with least binding energies (−7.1 to −7.7 kcal/mol). Drug-likeness and ADMET profiles of prioritized phytocompounds are also very prominsing and can be further tested to be potential IL-6 blockers and thus benficial for COVID-19 treatment. The moelcular dynamics simulation couple with MMGB/PBSA binding free energy estimation validated conformational stability of the ligands and stronger intermolecular binding. The mean RMSD of the complexes is as: IL6-isoorientin complex (3.97 Å ± 0.77), IL6-lupeol (3.97 Å ± 0.76), and IL6-andrographolide complex (3.96 Å ± 0.77). In addition, the stability observation was affirmed by compounds mean RMSD: isoorientin (0.72 Å ± 0.32), lupeol (mean 0.38 Å ± 0.08), and andrographolide (1.09 Å ± 0.49). A similar strong agreement on systems stability was unraveled by MMGB/PBSA that found net binding net ~ −20 kcal/mol for the complexes dominated by van der Waal interaction energy. CONCLUSION: It has been predicted that proposing potential IL-6 inhibitors with less side effects can help critical COVID-19 patients because it may control the cytokine storm, a major responsible factor of its pathogenesis. In this study, 3 potential phytocompounds have been proposed to have inhibitory effect on IL-6 that can be tested as potential therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2.","Malik, Arif; Naz, Anam; Ahmad, Sajjad; Hafeez, Mansoor; Awan, Faryal Mehwish; Jafar, Tassadaq Hussain; Zahid, Ayesha; Ikram, Aqsa; Rauff, Bisma; Hassan, Mubashir",Bioinform Biol Insights,418,1

This population-based study aimed to develop prediction models for determining the risk of influenza-related pneumonia and death. METHODS: We included patients diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza between 2016 and 2017 (main cohort, n = 25 659), those diagnosed between 2015 and 2016 (validation cohort 1, n = 16 727), and those diagnosed between 2017 and 2018 (validation cohort 2, n = 34 219). Prediction scores were developed based on the incidence and independent predictors of pneumonia and death identified using multivariate analyses, and patients were categorized into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups based on total scores. RESULTS: In the main cohort, age, gender, and certain comorbidities (dementia, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and others) were independent predictors of pneumonia and death. The 28-day pneumonia incidence was 0.5%, 4.1%, and 10.8% in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups, respectively (c-index, 0.75); the 28-day mortality was 0.05%, 0.7%, and 3.3% in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups, respectively (c-index, 0.85). In validation cohort 1, c-indices for the models for pneumonia and death were 0.75 and 0.87, respectively. In validation cohort 2, c-indices for the models were 0.74 and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed and validated simple-to-use risk prediction models, which would promptly provide useful information for treatment decisions in primary care settings.","Miyashita, Koichi; Nakatani, Eiji; Hozumi, Hironao; Sato, Yoko; Miyachi, Yoshiki; Suda, Takafumi",Open Forum Infect Dis,418,1

Tissue-specific outcomes of infection are also evident in many infectious diseases, suggesting that the local microenvironment may instruct complex and diverse innate and adaptive cellular responses resulting in locally distinct molecular signatures. In turn, these molecular signatures may both drive and be responsive to local metabolic changes in immune as well as non-immune cells, ultimately shaping the outcome of infection. Given the spatial complexity of immune and inflammatory responses during infection, it is evident that understanding the spatial organization of transcripts, proteins, lipids, and metabolites is pivotal to delineating the underlying regulation of local immunity. Molecular imaging techniques like mass spectrometry imaging and spatially resolved, highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry and transcriptomics can define detailed metabolic signatures at the microenvironmental level. Moreover, a successful complementation of these two imaging techniques would allow multi-omics analyses of inflammatory microenvironments to facilitate understanding of disease pathogenesis and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we describe strategies for downstream data analysis of spatially resolved multi-omics data and, using leishmaniasis as an exemplar, describe how such analysis can be applied in a disease-specific context.","Tans, Roel; Dey, Shoumit; Dey, Nidhi Sharma; Calder, Grant; O’Toole, Peter; Kaye, Paul M.; Heeren, Ron M.

In addition to the countries affected by the COVID-19, such as China, European and American countries, Iran has appeared as one of the most affected countries with high infected cases and deaths. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of self-talk in predicting death anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and coping strategies in the face of COVID-19. Method: This descriptive and correlational study was conducted on 354 adults living in Ardabil, Iran, who were selected using cluster sampling from 21 January to 19 March 2020. Self-Talk questionnaires, Coping Strategies, Death Anxiety, and Obsessive-Compulsive questionnaires were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. Results: The findings revealed a significant positive relationship between self-talk and problem-centered coping style. Also, significant negative relationships were found between self-talk and emotional coping style, death anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Furthermore, based on the results of the regression test, self-talk predicted problem-centered style, emotional-coping style, death anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Conclusion: The results of this study emphasize the need for psychological crisis intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, this study provides an important step in shifting attention to self-talk skills from sport psychology fields toward clinical psychology, especially about the mental impacts of COVID-19.","Sadri Damirchi, Esmaeil; Mojarrad, Arezoo; Pireinaladin, Saeed; Grjibovski, Andrej M",Iran J Psychiatry,418,5

By investigating the effect of individuals' distance from the COVID‐19 epicenter (i.e., the geographical area in which COVID‐19 pandemic is currently most severe) on consumers' risk perception and subsequent behaviors, this research provides novel empirical findings that can offer practical insights for marketers. While intuitively, people expect individuals closer to the COVID‐19 epicenter to generate a greater risk perception of the pandemic, empirical evidence from four studies provides consistent results for the opposite effect. We find that a closer (vs. farther) distance to the epicenter associates with lower (vs. higher) perceived risk of the pandemic, leading to less (vs. more) irrational consumption behaviors. We refer to this phenomenon as the “distance proximity effect,” which holds for both physical and psychological distances. We further demonstrated that this effect is mediated by consumers' perception of uncertainty and moderated by individuals' risk aversion tendency. The current research contributes to the literature of consumers' risk perception and irrational consumption by highlighting a novel factor of distance proximity. It also offers some timely insights into managing and intervening COVID‐19 related issues inside and outside an epicenter.","Li, Shaobo (Kevin); Zhang, Zhe; Liu, Yue; Ng, Sharon",Psychol Mark,418,16

Prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME) is increasing as the number of PWUMA of childbearing age grows. Yet impacts of MA in pregnancy and effective interventions are not yet well understood. OBJECTIVE: We conducted an environmental scan of published and grey literature (2010-2020) to determine effects of MA use in pregnancy for mothers and their offspring, effective interventions and implications for Indigenous women. SEARCH STRATEGY: A strategic search of Ovid Medline, Embase, ProQuest-Public Health and CINAHL databases identified academic literature, while Google and ProQuest-Public Health identified grey literature. SELECTION CRITERIA: Article selection was based on titles, abstracts and keywords. The time frame captured recent MA composition and excluded literature impacted by coronavirus disease 2019. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extracted from 80 articles identified 463 results related to 210 outcomes, and seven interventions. Analysis focused on six categories: maternal, neonatal/infant, cognitive, behavioral, neurological, and interventions. MAIN RESULTS: Maternal outcomes were more congruent than child outcomes. The most prevalent outcomes were general neonatal/infant outcomes. CONCLUSION: A lack of Indigenous-specific research on PME and interventions highlights a need for future research that incorporates relevant historical and sociocultural contexts.","Ackerman, Melissa; Madampage, Claudia; Epp, Lynette J; Gartner, Kali; King, Alexandra",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,418,14

Disease-related literacy and factors such as age, gender, or education play a major role in shaping individual practices of protective behavior. This paper investigates different types and frequency of practicing protective behaviors, as well as socio-demographic factors that are associated with such behavioral change. Methods: Data stem from a cross-sectional survey in Germany. Three thousand seven hundred and sixty-five people were contacted, 3,186 participated in the survey. Information on behavior to lower the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 was assessed by nine items (answer options yes/no). For each item, logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR), using education, sex, and age as main predictors and adjusting for partnership status and household composition. Results: People with lower educational level were less likely to avoid gatherings (OR = 0.63; 95%CI = 0.48–0.83), adapt their work situation (OR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.52–0.82), reduce personal contacts and meetings (OR = 0.71; 95%CI = 0.55–0.93), or increase hand hygiene (OR = 0.53; 95%CI = 0.38–0.73). Being female was associated with higher odds of protective behavior for most outcomes. Exceptions were wearing face masks and adapting the own work situation. Associations between respondents' age and individual behavior change were inconsistent and mostly weak. Conclusion: Disease specific knowledge is essential in order to enable people to judge information on COVID-19. Health education programs aiming at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful to build up appropriate practices and reduce the spread of the disease. Strategies are needed to guarantee easy access and better dissemination of high-quality news and fact-checks. Socioeconomic characteristics should be taken into account in the development of infection control measures.","Lüdecke, Daniel; von dem Knesebeck, Olaf",Front Public Health,418,5

We report here an ad-interim analysis of data obtained after a 6-month follow-up in a cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs) who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. These new data provide more insight into whether and in whom a 3(rd) dose could be necessary. METHODS: : Our study compared the anti-S antibody kinetics at 2 weeks (T1), 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T4) after the first injection, and 2 weeks after the second injection (T2). The 201 participating HCWs were stratified according to their initial serological status. The vaccine effectiveness was also assessed through a medical questionnaire. RESULTS: : We report here a marked and statistically significant antibody decrease (P <0.0001) between T3 and T4, especially in naïve vaccinees. The analysis of potential confounding factors or known risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease did not reveal any influence on the drop observed. Six-month after vaccination, only one, symptomatic, infection was reported in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: : In a supply-limited environment, our results plead for reserving the 3(rd) dose scheme, in the upcoming months, to seronegative individuals prior to vaccination, especially when the serological status is easily accessible.","Tré-Hardy, Marie; Cupaiolo, Roberto; Wilmet, Alain; Antoine-Moussiaux, Thomas; Vecchia, Andrea Della; Horeanga, Alexandra; Papleux, Emmanuelle; Vekemans, Marc; Beukinga, Ingrid; Blairon, Laurent",J Infect,418,1

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a dire multisectoral crisis all around the world. This study investigates and characterizes local isolates from East Java, Indonesia. Methods: There were 54 patients suspected with SARS-COV-2 infection and 27 patients were COVID-19 positive. Virus isolates were obtained from COVID-19 inpatients’ nasopharyngeal swabs at the Dr Soetomo Teaching Hospital, Surabaya. There were only three isolates (#6, #11, #35) with good growth characteristics. Serial blind passage and cytopathic effect observation in the Vero E6 cell line were performed for virus isolation. Confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was proven by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions using SARS-CoV-2 specific primers, scanning electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy examination. Whole genome sequencing was performed using ARTIC protocol. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 characterization was identified through a western blot using rabbit serum immunized with inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and human natural COVID-19 infection serum. Results: Spike gene analysis of three samples (#6, #11, #35) found that the D614G mutation was detected in all isolates, although one isolate exhibited the D215Y and E484D mutation. Based on whole genome analysis, those three isolates were included in clade 20A, and two isolates were included in lineage B.1.6 with one isolate belongs to lineage B.1.4.7.

The Veterans Health Administration serves as the nation’s largest safety-net health system, serving a population with both a high level of medical comorbidities and socioeconomic factors that can create barriers to care. To expand access to vaccines beyond the regularly scheduled vaccine clinic hours, an ED-based COVID-19 vaccine program was developed. at our facility. Methods: The setting is a 27,000 visit Veterans Health Administration ED that is also an ACEP Level 1 Geriatric ED. The existing vaccine program used the Pfizer vaccine, with appointments scheduled through a vaccine clinic that operated 7 days a week. With the approval of the single dose Janssen vaccine, to expand our outreach and vaccinate more patients, an ED-based vaccination program was developed. At triage, the triage nurse reviewed the charts of all stable (ESI 3-5) patients to determine if they had already received at least one dose of vaccine, or were scheduled to receive a dose of vaccine in the outpatient clinic. If not, then a flag would be placed on the tracking board to alert the provider seeing the patient that they were a candidate for the single-dose Janssen vaccine. The provider would then screen for contraindications and obtain consent for the vaccine. Only patients who were checking into the ED for another complaint were screened;the ED was not advertised as an alternative site for vaccine-only visits. Results: From initiation of the program on March 16, 2021, until the pause on use of the Janssen vaccine on April 13, a total of 27 patients received the vaccine. A total of 37 patients were screened as eligible for the vaccine. For those not receiving the vaccine, 6 had documentation of a reason;1 had a contraindication, and 5 refused the vaccine. 4/27 were female (14.8%);female patients comprise 7% of our ED volume. The average age of the female patients was 37 (range, 24-55). 23/27 (85.2%) were male;their average age was 57 (range, 39-69). 15/27 (55.5%) patients resided in an urban area. 6/27 (22%) lived in areas classified as rural. 8/27 patients (30%) were Black, 3/27 (11%) were latino, and 16/27 (59%) were white. There were no documented allergic reactions or other immediate adverse events reported for any of the ED-vaccinated patients. Conclusion: We report preliminary results for an ED-based COVID vaccine program using the single-dose JAndJ/Janssen vaccine. Female patients represented a higher percentage of those receiving the vaccine than represented by their percentage of our total ED visits. Further research needs to be done into those who refuse the vaccine, as well as interventions to reduce the number of missed opportunities (patients who were flagged on the tracking board but did not receive further screening for vaccine eligibility by the ED provider). Adverse events were not reported in our cohort.","Maloney, G.; Carrol, B.; Wenzell, R.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,418,33

Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.","Fu, Haiyan; Li, Hongjuan; Tang, Xiaoqing; Li, Xiang; Shen, Jie; Zhou, Yujun; Xu, Bing; Luo, Yu",,418,12

IRB review was waived for this prospective matched-pairs study in which no patient data was used. Model radiology reports (n = 40) simulated those typical for an academic medical center. Six randomized radiologists dictated using speech-recognition software with and without a surgical mask. Dictations were compared to model reports and errors were classified according to type and severity. A statistical model was used to demonstrate that error rates for all types of errors were greater when masks are worn compared to when they are not (unmasked: 21.7 ± 4.9 errors per 1000 words, masked: 27.1 ± 2.2 errors per 1000 words; adjusted p < 0.0001). A sensitivity analysis was performed, excluding a reader with a large number of errors. The sensitivity analysis found a similar difference in error rates for all types of errors, although significance was attenuated (unmasked: 16.9 ± 1.9 errors per 1000 words, masked: 20.1 ± 2.2 errors per 1000 words; adjusted p = 0.054). We conclude that wearing a mask results in a near-significant increase in the rate of dictation errors in unedited radiology reports created with speech-recognition, although this difference may be accentuated in some groups of radiologists. Additionally, we find that most errors are minor single incorrect words and are unlikely to result in a medically relevant misunderstanding.","Femi-Abodunde, Abiola; Olinger, Kristen; Burke, Lauren M.

Evidence shows that these psychological challenges are especially prominent in healthcare workers (HCW); especially in nurses. Indeed, several studies report that nurses suffer more psychologically because of the consequences of the pandemic compared with medical doctors. To further look into this, we systematically review the recent literature to see whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic differs between medical doctors and nurses across studies and which aspects of mental health are especially affected in nurses. RECENT FINDINGS: Across studies, there is solid evidence that nurses show poorer mental health outcomes compared with medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially true for symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, prevalence rates in nurses are often higher than 50%. In contrast, general stress levels and burnout seem to be comparable between nurses and medical doctors. SUMMARY: Given that nurses suffer more from depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, special programs addressing their needs are required.","Kunz, Miriam; Strasser, Martina; Hasan, Alkomiet",Curr Opin Psychiatry,418,26

We treat the problem by adopting a partial differential equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model of epidemiology, which is achieved by replacing compartmental populations by their densities. Building on our recent work (Computat Mech 66:1177, 2020), we replace our earlier use of global polynomial basis functions with those having local support, as epitomized in the finite element method, for the spatial representation of the SIRD parameters. The time dependence is treated by inferring constant parameters over time intervals that coincide with the time step in semi-discrete numerical implementations. In combination, this amounts to a scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan and to all of Mexico, our system inference via field inversion infers spatio-temporally varying PDE SIRD parameters that replicate the progression of the pandemic with high accuracy. It also produces accurate predictions, when compared against data, for a three week period into 2021. Of note is the insight that is suggested on the spatio-temporal variation of infection, recovery and death rates, as well as patterns of the population’s mobility revealed by diffusivities of the compartments.

Social media becomes a reliable source for understanding public opinions toward this virus outbreak. Objective: This study aims to explore public opinions toward COVID-19 on social media by comparing the differences in sentiment changes and discussed topics between California and New York in the United States. Methods: A dataset with COVID-19-related Twitter posts was collected from March 5, 2020 to April 2, 2020 using Twitter streaming API. After removing any posts unrelated to COVID-19, as well as posts that contain promotion and commercial information, two individual datasets were created based on the geolocation tags with tweets, one containing tweets from California state and the other from New York state. Sentiment analysis was conducted to obtain the sentiment score for each COVID-19 tweet. Topic modeling was applied to identify top topics related to COVID-19. Results: While the number of COVID-19 cases increased more rapidly in New York than in California in March 2020, the number of tweets posted has a similar trend over time in both states. COVID-19 tweets from California had more negative sentiment scores than New York. There were some fluctuations in sentiment scores in both states over time, which might correlate with the policy changes and the severity of COVID-19 pandemic. The topic modeling results showed that the popular topics in both California and New York states are similar, with ""protective measures"" as the most prevalent topic associated with COVID-19 in both states.

To date, the most commonly used vectors are adeno-associated virus-based (AAV). The pre-existing humoral immunity against AAV (anti-AAV antibodies) has been well described and is expected as a consequence of prior AAV exposure. Anti-AAV antibodies may present an immune barrier to successful AAV transduction and hence negatively impact clinical efficacy and may also result in adverse events (AEs) due to the formation of large immune complexes. Patients may be screened for the presence of anti-AAV antibodies, including neutralizing (NAb) and total binding antibodies (TAb) prior to treatment with the GTx. Recommendations for the development and validation of anti-AAV NAb detection methods have been presented elsewhere.

Kentucky has poor health outcomes and limited broadband connectivity. Given these and other practice-specific constraints, the region serves as a unique context to explore the efficacy of telehealth in cardiology. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the limitations of telehealth accessibility, patient satisfaction with telehealth relative to in-person visits, and the perceived advantages and disadvantages to telehealth. Our intent was two-fold. First, we wanted to conduct a rapid postassessment of the mandated overhaul of the health care delivery system, focusing on a representative specialty field, and how it was affecting patients. Second, we intend to use our findings to make suggestions about the future application of a telehealth model in specialty fields such as cardiology. METHODS: We constructed an online survey in Qualtrics following the Patient Assessment of Communication During Telemedicine, a patient self-report questionnaire that has been previously developed and validated. We invited all patients who had a visit scheduled during the COVID-19 telehealth-only time frame to participate. Questions included factors for declining telehealth, patient satisfaction ratings of telehealth and in-person visits, and perceived advantages and disadvantages associated with telehealth. We also used electronic medical records to collect no-show data for in-person versus telehealth visits to check for nonresponse bias. RESULTS: A total of 224 respondents began our survey (11% of our sample of 2019 patients). Our recruitment rate was 86% (n=193) and our completion rate was 62% (n=120). The no-show rate for telehealth visits (345/2019, 17%) was nearly identical to the typical no-show rate for in-person appointments. Among the 32 respondents who declined a telehealth visit, 20 (63%) cited not being aware of their appointment as a primary factor, and 15 (47%) respondents cited their opinion that a telehealth appointment was not medically necessary as at least somewhat of a factor in their decision. Both in-person and telehealth were viewed favorably, but in-person was rated higher across all domains of patient satisfaction. The only significantly lower mean score for telehealth (3.7 vs 4.2, P=.007) was in the clinical competence domain. Reduced travel time, lower visit wait time, and cost savings were seen as big advantages. Poor internet connectivity was rated as at least somewhat of a factor by 33.0% (35/106) of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: This study takes advantage of the natural experiment provided by the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the efficacy of telehealth in cardiology. Patterns of satisfaction are consistent across modalities and show that telehealth appears to be a viable alternative to in-person appointments. However, we found evidence that scheduling of telehealth visits may be problematic and needs additional attention. Additionally, we include a note of caution that patient satisfaction with telehealth may be artificially inflated during COVID-19 due to external health concerns connected with in-person visits.","Singh, Aniruddha; Mountjoy, Natalie; McElroy, Doug; Mittal, Shilpi; Al Hemyari, Bashar; Coffey, Nicholas; Miller, Kristen; Gaines, Kenneth",JMIR Cardio,418,21

DESIGN: Multicentre randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 8 acute care hospitals in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: 905 adults (≥40 years) who resided in areas with mobile phone coverage and were to be discharged from hospital after non-elective surgery were randomised either to virtual care and RAM (n=451) or to standard care (n=454). 903 participants (99.8%) completed the 31 day follow-up. INTERVENTION: Participants in the experimental group received a tablet computer and RAM technology that measured blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and body weight. For 30 days the participants took daily biophysical measurements and photographs of their wound and interacted with nurses virtually. Participants in the standard care group received post-hospital discharge management according to the centre’s usual care. Patients, healthcare providers, and data collectors were aware of patients’ group allocations. Outcome adjudicators were blinded to group allocation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was days alive at home during 31 days of follow-up. The 12 secondary outcomes included acute hospital care, detection and correction of drug errors, and pain at 7, 15, and 30 days after randomisation. RESULTS: All 905 participants (mean age 63.1 years) were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised. Days alive at home during 31 days of follow-up were 29.7 in the virtual care group and 29.5 in the standard care group: relative risk 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.02); absolute difference 0.2% (95% confidence interval −0.5% to 0.9%). 99 participants (22.0%) in the virtual care group and 124 (27.3%) in the standard care group required acute hospital care: relative risk 0.80 (0.64 to 1.01); absolute difference 5.3% (−0.3% to 10.9%). More participants in the virtual care group than standard care group had a drug error detected (134 (29.7%) v 25 (5.5%); absolute difference 24.2%, 19.5% to 28.9%) and a drug error corrected (absolute difference 24.4%, 19.9% to 28.9%). Fewer participants in the virtual care group than standard care group reported pain at 7, 15, and 30 days after randomisation: absolute differences 13.9% (7.4% to 20.4%), 11.9% (5.1% to 18.7%), and 9.6% (2.9% to 16.3%), respectively. Beneficial effects proved substantially larger in centres with a higher rate of care escalation. CONCLUSION: Virtual care with RAM shows promise in improving outcomes important to patients and to optimal health system function.

ABSTRACT: Sexual health concerns, both physical and psychological, are common and represent an unmet need among women with and surviving cancer. Sexual challenges and conditions negatively impact body image, satisfaction, relationships, well-being, and quality of life, yet are widely reported to be under-recognized and undertreated. To guide clinical care and future research on sexual function in women with cancer, we performed a scoping review of interventions for sexual health concerns, including sexual function, body image, genitourinary symptoms, and hot flashes. Relevant publications between 2005 and 2020 were identified by searching PubMed with a combination of medical subject headings and keywords. Articles were included if they focused on the aforementioned topics, were primary research publications, and included female cancer survivors. Studies focusing on women receiving hormone therapy for breast cancer were also included. A total of 91 investigations conducted in the US and abroad were reviewed. Most commonly, interventions included a component of psychoeducation, although pharmacologic, exercise, and other approaches have been evaluated. Many studies have focused on survivors of breast or gynecologic cancer, among other sampling and methodological limitations. These limitations underscore the need for more work on this vital survivorship issue. Recommendations for future research in this area are also offered.","Sopfe, Jenna; Pettigrew, Jessica; Afghahi, Anosheh; Appiah, Leslie C.; Coons, Helen L.",Cancers (Basel),418,21

However, last few decades saw a huge investment and steady increase in large scale integrated food processing units to combat globalization, food security and India’s export demands. Recent outbreak of COVID-19 has manifested the drawbacks in the existing production and supply chain system with a wide range of issues and enforces the need for a more balanced approach. This scenario can be commonly observed in many other agrarian developing nations. This article discusses various issues concerning the existing integrated food processing sectors such as high energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and food insecurity during disasters and pandemic outbreaks. Moreover, we emphasise a more sustainable approach with a better balance and understanding between SFSC and integrated food processing. A potential solution in this scenario would be, rejuvenating SFSC and traditional food processing approaches along with integrated food processing units. An approach of this kind, opens up new possibilities for a next generation process-supply system.","Thulasiraman, Venkatesh; Nandagopal, M. S. Giri; Kothakota, Anjineyulu",J Food Sci Technol,418,24

The viral structural proteins (gp200, gp140/gp66, gp100/gp120, p52, and gp24/p20) were detected in radiolabeled cell extracts by 9 to 12 hours post-infection, as well as two possible non-structural proteins with apparent mol.wts. of 36,000 and 32,000. The predominant 52,000 nucleocapsid protein could be detected in cell lysates as soon as 6 to 8 hours after infection; it was initially resolved as a complex of 3 closely migrating species with mol.wts. ranging from 46,000 to 52,000. Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that gp200 arose from a putative precursor with mol.wt. of 150,000 to 170,000, that underwent glycosylation. Proteolytic cleavage of gp200, in turn, probably yielded the gp100 and gp120 species. The unique TCV hemagglutinin protein originated from a primary precursor with mol.wt. of 60,000, which underwent rapid dimerization by disulfide bond formation and glycosylation to yield gp140. The peplomeric and matrix proteins were both shown to be N-glycosylated, as indicated by their sensitivity to tunicamycin (TM) and their resistance to sodium monensin (SM). In the presence of TM, proteins with mol.wts. of 90,000, 120–130,000, and 150,000 accumulated in TCV-infected cells rather than peplomeric glycoproteins, and the matrix protein E1 was only detected in its unglycosylated form. The addition of TM to the culture medium interfered with the maturation of progeny viral particles, as suggested by the absence of peplomers at the surface of the intravacuolar and extracellular virions, and the accumulation of amorphous material not found in the absence of the glycosylation inhibitor. High yields of virus replication were obtained, in the presence of SM, even at concentrations which greatly affected the cellular functions.","Dea, S.; Garzon, S.; Tijssen, P.",Arch Virol,418,0

Participants: Unplanned adult medical admissions discharged over 3 months (11 March 2020 to 13 June 2020 ) from two hospitals (YH for model development; SH for external model validation) based on admission NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours of admission. We used logistic regression modelling to predict the risk of COVID-19 using NEWS2 (Model M0') versus enhanced cNEWS models which included age + sex (model M1') + subcomponents (including diastolic blood pressure + oxygen flow rate + oxygen scale) of NEWS2 (model M2'). The ICD-10 code U071 was used to identify COVID-19 admissions. Model performance was evaluated according to discrimination (c statistic), calibration (graphically), and clinical usefulness at NEWS2 [≥]5. Results The prevalence of COVID-19 was higher in SH (11.0%=277/2520) than YH (8.7%=343/3924) with higher index NEWS2 (3.2 vs 2.8) but similar in-hospital mortality (8.4% vs 8.2%). The c-statistics for predicting COVID-19 for cNEWS models (M1',M2') was substantially better than NEWS2 alone (M0') in development (M2': 0.78 (95%CI 0.75-0.80) vs M0' 0.71 (95%CI 0.68-0.74)) and validation datasets (M2': 0.72 (95%CI 0.69-0.75) vs M0' 0.65 (95%CI 0.61-0.68)). Model M2' had better calibration than Model M0' with improved sensitivity (M2': 57% (95%CI 51%-63%) vs M0' 44% (95%CI 38%-50%)) and similar specificity (M2': 76% (95%CI 74%-78%) vs M0' 75% (95%CI 73%-77%)) for validation dataset at NEWS2[≥]5. Conclusions Model M2' is reasonably accurate for predicting the on-admission risk of COVID-19.

However, due to the novelty of this approach, nucleic acid nanoparticles (NANPs) are not yet used in the clinic. The immune recognition of NANPs is among the areas of preclinical investigation aimed at enabling the translation of these novel materials into clinical settings. NANPs’ interactions with the complement system, coagulation systems, and immune cells are essential components of their preclinical safety portfolio. It has been established that NANPs’ physicochemical properties—composition, shape, and size—determine their interactions with immune cells (primarily blood plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes), enable recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and mediate the subsequent cytokine response. However, unlike traditional therapeutic nucleic acids (e.g., CpG oligonucleotides), NANPs do not trigger a cytokine response unless they are delivered into the cells using a carrier. Recently, it was discovered that the type of carrier provides an additional tool for regulating both the spectrum and the magnitude of the cytokine response to NANPs. Herein, we review the current knowledge of NANPs’ interactions with various components of the immune system to emphasize the unique properties of these nanomaterials and highlight opportunities for their use in vaccines and immunotherapy.","Bila, Dominika; Radwan, Yasmine; Dobrovolskaia, Marina A.; Panigaj, Martin; Afonin, Kirill A.",Molecules,418,24

Moreover, with the recent COVID‐19 sudden transition to online learning, there is even less guidance on how to effectively teach quantitative ecology online. Here, I synthesize a prescription of pedagogical best practices for teaching quantitative ecology online based on a broad review of the literature on multiple quantitative disciplines. These best practices include the following: (1) design and implement the class to meet learning goals using online strategies specifically; (2) create an open, inclusive, and welcoming online environment that promotes a sense of learning community; (3) acknowledge the diversity of talents and learning strategies; (4) use real‐world examples and assessments; (5) account for gaps in knowledge; (6) emphasize the modeling cycle process; (7) focus on developing ideas rather than tools or procedures; (8) if needed, introduce computational tools thoroughly before combining them with mathematical or statistical concepts; (9) evaluate the course constantly; and (10) put your heart and soul into the class. I hope these practices help fellow instructors of quantitative ecology facing similar challenges in providing our students with the knowledge and skills needed to meet the challenges of the future.","Acevedo, Miguel A.",Ecol Evol,418,20

METHOD: An online survey was distributed to investigate the sources of stress and support across individual, task and organisational domains. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The survey was completed by 1542 paramedics, police, community nurses and child protection workers from all states and territories of Australia. This study describes the data for the 632 rural participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main measures of well-being were the Public Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), workplace engagement, intention to quit and COVID-19-related stress. RESULTS: The mean depression and anxiety scores were 8.2 (PHQ9) and 6.8 (GAD7). This is 2-3 times that found in the general community. Over half (56.1%) of respondents showed high emotional exhaustion (burnout). The emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment mean scores were 28.5, 9.3 and 34.2, respectively. The strongest associations with burnout and psychological distress were workload, provision of practical support, training and organisational communication. A significant proportion of respondents were seriously considering quitting (27.4%) or looking for a new job with a different employer (28.5%) in the next 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has increased the workload and stress on rural front-line community staff. The major sources of stress were related to organisations' responses to COVID-19 and not COVID-19 per se. The data suggest the most effective mental health interventions are practical and preventive, such as firstly ensuring fair and reasonable workloads.","Roberts, Russell; Wong, Alfred; Jenkins, Stacey; Neher, Alain; Sutton, Clare; O'Meara, Peter; Frost, Mark; Bamberry, Larissa; Dwivedi, Abhishek",Aust. j. rural health,418,28

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those institutions without such facilities or 2019-nCoV. This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2V uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2V infection. The anti-viral activities and anti-viral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs, including cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC(50)] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10(−4)vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP had potent anti-viral activities against both viral entry (0.46 ± 0.12, vs.1.00 ± 0.37 t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication ([6.18 ± 0.95] × 10(−4)vs. 1.00 ± 0.43, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and further study of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.","Fan, Hua-Hao; Wang, Li-Qin; Liu, Wen-Li; An, Xiao-Ping; Liu, Zhen-Dong; He, Xiao-Qi; Song, Li-Hua; Tong, Yi-Gang",Chin Med J (Engl),418,26

Studies confirm that multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury lesions contain myelinating cells and their progenitors. Recruiting these endogenous cells to remyelinate may be of therapeutic value. This review addresses the use of antibodies reactive to CNS antigens to promote remyelination. Antibody-induced remyelination in a virus-mediated model of chronic spinal cord injury was initially observed in response to treatment with CNS reactive antisera. Monoclonal mouse and human IgMs, which bind to the surface of oligodendrocytes and myelin, were later identified that were functionally equivalent to antisera. A recombinant form of a human remyelination-promoting IgM (rHIgM22) targets areas of CNS injury and promotes maximal remyelination within 5 weeks after a single low dose (25 μg/kg). The IgM isoform of this reparative antibody is required for in vivo function. We hypothesize that the IgM clusters membrane domains and associated signaling molecules on the surface of target cells. Current therapies for MS are designed to modulate inflammation. In contrast, remyelination promoting IgMs are the first potential therapeutic molecules designed to induce tissue repair by acting within the CNS at sites of damage on the cells responsible for myelin synthesis.","Warrington, A.

This study aims to evaluate the factors associated with stigmas and the effects of stigmatization in HCWs during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This study was conducted by an anonymous online survey of 452 actively working HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. All subjects provided informed consent electronically before registration and completed the sociodemographic data form, a questionnaire about COVID-19 pandemics, a COVID-19 stigmatization questionnaire for health-care workers, a hospital anxiety depression scale form (HADS), a psychological well-being scale form, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale short form (WHO-QOL BREF) and Coping Styles Scale brief form (CBSS-BF). RESULTS: Perception of stigma score was significantly higher among HCWs with one or more of the following characteristics: they had worked with patients with COVID-19 (+) but had no specific training related to coronavirus, experienced COVID-19 symptoms themselves, delayed testing due to anxiety, received psychological support during COVID-19 pandemics, suffered from a psychological disorder, or had suicidal thoughts/attempts before or during the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.05). A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the perception of stigmatization score and HAD-S (p<0.05). A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between the perception of the stigmatization score and the Psychological Well-Being Score, CSS-BF problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping, and all subscales of WHOQOL-BRIEF (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings of our study showed that the negative perception of stigma in HCWs could affect their psychological well-being and life satisfaction. During the pandemic, it is necessary to prevent stigmatizing HCWs and improve coping strategies to protect their mental health and increase their life quality.","Teksin, Gulsen; Uluyol, Ozlem Bas; Onur, Ozge Sahmelikoglu; Teksin, Meryem Gul; Ozdemir, Haci Mustafa",Sisli Etfal Hastan Tip Bul,418,20

Recently, intussusceptive angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Herein, we conducted a narrative review according to the SANRA guidelines to review and discuss data regarding splitting angiogenesis including mechanisms, drivers, regulators and putative roles. Relevant angiogenic features in Covid-19, including their potential role in inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and permeability, as well as their use as prognostic markers and therapeutic roles are reviewed. Splitting angiogenesis in Covid-19 involve hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factors, classic angiogenic mediators, such as the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Angiopoietins, hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, and dysregulation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, which combined, interact to promote intussusception. Data regarding the use of angiogenic mediators as prognostic tools is summarized and suggest that angiopoietins and VEGF are elevated in Covid-19 patients and predictors of adverse outcomes. Finally, we reviewed the scarce data regarding angiogenic mediators as therapeutic targets.

Cells harboring a disrupted ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10) allele survived reovirus infection, and subsequently ADAM10 was shown by RNA interference to be important for replication of HIV-1. RESULTS: Silencing ADAM10 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) 48 hours before infection significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and in CD4(+ )cell lines. In agreement, ADAM10 over-expression significantly increased HIV-1 replication. ADAM10 down-regulation did not inhibit viral reverse transcription, indicating that viral entry and uncoating are also independent of ADAM10 expression. Integration of HIV-1 cDNA was reduced in ADAM10 down-regulated cells; however, concomitant 2-LTR circle formation was not detected, suggesting that HIV-1 does not enter the nucleus. Further, ADAM10 silencing inhibited downstream reporter gene expression and viral protein translation. Interestingly, we found that while the metalloprotease domain of ADAM10 is not required for HIV-1 replication, ADAM15 and γ-secretase (which proteolytically release the extracellular and intracellular domains of ADAM10 from the plasma membrane, respectively) do support productive infection. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that ADAM10 facilitates replication at the level of nuclear trafficking. Collectively, our data support a model whereby ADAM10 is cleaved by ADAM15 and γ-secretase and that the ADAM10 intracellular domain directly facilitates HIV-1 nuclear trafficking. Thus, ADAM10 represents a novel cellular target class for development of antiretroviral drugs.","Friedrich, Brian M; Murray, James L; Li, Guangyu; Sheng, Jinsong; Hodge, Thomas W; Rubin, Donald H; O'Brien, William A; Ferguson, Monique R",Retrovirology,418,1

The additive effects of electrolytes, carbohydrate, and protein on rehydration were assessed using BHI. Nineteen healthy young adults completed four test sessions in randomized order: deionized water (W), electrolytes only (E), carbohydrate-electrolytes (C + E), and 2 g/L dipeptide (alanyl-glutamine)-electrolytes (AG + E). One liter of beverage was consumed, after which urine and body mass were obtained every 60 min through 240 min. Compared to W, BHI was higher (p = 0.007) for C + E (1.15 ± 0.17) after 120 min and for AG + E (p = 0.021) at 240 min (1.15 ± 0.20). BHI did not differ (p > 0.05) among E, C + E, or AG + E; however, E contributed the greatest absolute net effect (>12%) on BHI relative to W. Net fluid balance was lower for W (p = 0.048) compared to C + E and AG + E after 120 min. AG + E and E elicited higher (p < 0.001) overall urine osmolality vs. W. W also elicited greater reports of stomach bloating (p = 0.02) compared to AG + E and C + E. The addition of electrolytes alone (in the range of sports drinks) did not consistently improve BHI versus water; however, the combination with carbohydrate or dipeptides increased fluid retention, although this occurred earlier for the sports drink than the dipeptide beverage. Electrolyte content appears to make the largest contribution in hydration properties of beverages for young adults when consumed at rest.","Millard-Stafford, Mindy; Snow, Teresa K.; Jones, Michael L.; Suh, HyunGyu",Nutrients,418,17

Pylorus-preserving single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-SG) is a modified duodenal switch technique. Gastric plication (GP) is an alternate to SG. METHODS: Morbidly obese (BMI of > 40, or > 35 in the presence of diabetes or prediabetes) patients were recruited and operated on to perform SADI with GP. Complications related to surgery were recorded to assess the feasibility of the procedure. Weight-loss outcomes were analysed to determine efficacy. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2) was recorded after 1 year of follow-up, and test scales were used to describe physiological phenomena. RESULTS: Seventeen middle-aged (mean: 40 years) patients were involved in our study; 15 of them were females. The mean duration of surgery was 205 min. There were no complications of conversion, death, bleeding, VTE or 30-day readmission to hospital. We did experience CD4a (pulmonary insufficiency due to chronic lung disease) and a CD3b (anastomosis leakage treated laparoscopically) complications. Vomiting occurred in three cases (CD1). Obesity-related comorbidities showed favourable resolution rates (77.8% for hypertension, 81.2% for dyslipidaemia, 100% for diabetes at the 1-year follow-up). Weight-loss outcomes were favourable (53.20 EWL%, and 35.58 TWL% at 1-year follow-up). Greater weight loss caused significantly higher levels of Depression (t(13.958) = − 2.373; p = 0.00; p < 0.05) and Low Positive Emotions (t(13.301) = − 2.954; p = 0.00; p < 0.05) and Introversion/Low Positive Emotionality (t(13.408) = − 1.914; p = 0.02; p < 0.05) in MMPI-2 data. CONCLUSION: According to our safety study, SADI-GP is a promising malabsorptive procedure, but a long-term high-volume case series or a randomised controlled trial is necessary to evaluate complication rates and weight-loss outcomes. Emotional dysregulation is common among bariatric surgery patients according to personality inventory data; therefore, psychological follow-up and psychotherapeutic support are necessary for weight-loss maintenance.

We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales.

Pandemic incidence of COVID-19 has created a severe threat to global public health, necessitating the development of effective drugs or inhibitors or therapeutics agents against SARS-CoV-2. Spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in entering viruses into the host cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), and this specific interaction represents a promising drug target for the identification of potential drugs. This study aimed at the receptor-binding domain of S protein (RBD of nCoV-SP) and the ACE-2 receptor as a promising target for developing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Over 100 different flavonoids with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties from different literatures were taken as a ligand or inhibitor for molecular docking against target protein RBD of nCoV-SP and ACE-2 using PyRX and iGEMDOCK. Top flavonoids based on docking scores were selected for the pharmacokinetic study. Selected flavonoids (hesperidin, naringin, ECGC, and quercetin) showed excellent pharmacokinetics with proper absorption, solubility, permeability, distribution, metabolism, minimal toxicity, and excellent bioavailability. Molecular dynamics simulation studies up to 100 ns exhibited strong binding affinity of selected flavonoids to RBD of nCoV-SP and ACE-2, and the protein-ligand complexes were structurally stable. These identified lead flavonoids may act as potential compounds for developing effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 by potentially inhibiting virus entry into the host cell.","Bhowmik, Deep; Nandi, Rajat; Prakash, Amresh; Kumar, Diwakar",Heliyon,418,0

However, few studies have investigated the mental health of parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: To investigate the depression, anxiety and stress of the students’ parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the influence factors, especially the influence of social support and family-related factors. METHODS: The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Perceived Stress Scale-10 and Social Support Rating Scale were applied to 1163 parents to measure the parents’ depression, anxiety, stress and social support. RESULTS: (1) The detection rates of depression and anxiety in parents were 6.1% and 4.0%. The depression, anxiety and perceived stress of parents in central China were significantly higher than those in non-central China. The anxiety of college students’ parents was lower than that of parents of the primary, middle and high school students. The depression, anxiety and perceived stress of parents with conflicts in the family were significantly higher than those with a harmonious family. Other factors that influence parents’ depression, anxiety and perceived stress include marital satisfaction, social support, parents’ history of mental illness and parenting style, etc. (2) The regression analysis results showed that perceived stress, social support, marital satisfaction, family conflicts, child’s learning stage as well as parents’ history of mental illness had significant effects on parents’ anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of parents was affected by a variety of factors. Good marital relationships, good social support, family harmony and parents without a history of mental illness may be protective factors for parents’ mental health, while perceived stress and child in middle or high school are risk factors for parents’ mental health.","Wu, Mengting; Xu, Wenyan; Yao, Yuhong; Zhang, Lei; Guo, Lei; Fan, Juan; Chen, Jue",Gen Psychiatr,418,24

Five classes of disinfectants (phenol, quaternary ammonium compound, sodium hypochlorite, oxidizing agent, and quaternary ammonium/glutaraldehyde combination) were evaluated in vitro at varying concentrations, both in the presence and absence of swine feces, and at three different temperatures. No infectious PEDV was recovered after treatment with evaluated disinfectants. Additionally, all tested disinfectants except for 0.17% sodium hypochlorite dramatically reduced qRT-PCR values. However, no disinfectants eliminated RT-PCR detection of PEDV across all replicates; although, 0.52%, 1.03% and 2.06% solutions of sodium hypochlorite and 0.5% oxidizing agent did intermittently produce RT-PCR negatives. To simulate field conditions in a second aim, PEDV was applied to pitted aluminum coupons, which were then treated with either 2.06% sodium hypochlorite or 0.5% oxidizing agent. Post-treatment surface swabs of the coupons tested RT-PCR positive but were not infectious to cultured cells or naïve pigs. Ultimately, viable PEDV was not detected following application of each of the tested disinfectants, however in most cases RT-PCR detection of viral RNA remained.

Once, neither an anti-viral drug nor an effective vaccines are available, studies on new anti-ASFV molecules are urgently need. Recently, it has been shown that ASFV type II topoisomerase (ASFV-topo II) is inhibited by several fluoroquinolones (bacterial DNA topoisomerase inhibitors), raising the idea that this viral enzyme can be a potential target for drug development against ASFV. Here, we report that genistein hampers ASFV infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations in Vero cells and porcine macrophages. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of this isoflavone, previously described as a topo II poison in eukaryotes, is maximal when it is added to cells at middle-phase of infection (8 hpi), disrupting viral DNA replication, blocking the transcription of late viral genes as well as the synthesis of late viral proteins, reducing viral progeny. Further, the single cell electrophoresis analysis revealed the presence of fragmented ASFV genomes in cells exposed to genistein, suggesting that this molecule also acts as an ASFV-topo II poison and not as a reversible inhibitor. No antiviral effects were detected when genistein was added before or at entry phase of ASFV infection. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that genistein may interact with four residues of the ATP-binding site of ASFV-topo II (Asn-144, Val-146, Gly-147 and Leu-148), showing more binding affinity (−4.62 kcal/mol) than ATP(4−) (−3.02 kcal/mol), emphasizing the idea that this viral enzyme has an essential role during viral genome replication and can be a good target for drug development against ASFV.","Arabyan, Erik; Hakobyan, Astghik; Kotsinyan, Armen; Karalyan, Zaven; Arakelov, Vahram; Arakelov, Grigor; Nazaryan, Karen; Simonyan, Anna; Aroutiounian, Rouben; Ferreira, Fernando; Zakaryan, Hovakim",Antiviral Res,418,33

Using our subgenomic DI system, we have studied the effects of sequences flanking the MHV transcription consensus sequence on subgenomic RNA transcription. We obtained the following results. (i) Insertion of a 12-nucleotide-long sequence including the UCUAAAC transcription consensus sequence at different locations of the DI RNA resulted in different efficiencies of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis. (ii) Differences in the amount of subgenomic DI RNA were defined by the sequences that flanked the 12-nucleotide-long sequence and were not affected by the location of the 12-nucleotide-long sequence on the DI RNA. (iii) Naturally occurring flanking sequences of intergenic sequences at gene 6–7, but not at genes 1–2 and 2–3, contained a transcription suppressive element(s). (iv) Each of three naturally occurring flanking sequences of an MHV genomic cryptic transcription consensus sequence from MHV gene 1 also contained a transcription suppressive element(s).

We apply mathematical modeling to assess the impact of testing strategies together with social distancing protocols on the spread of the novel coronavirus during ocean cruises using an individual-level stochastic model of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We model the contact network, the potential importation of cases arising during shore excursions, the temporal course of infectivity at the individual level, the effects of social distancing strategies, different testing scenarios characterized by the test’s sensitivity profile, and testing frequency. Our findings indicate that PCR testing at embarkation and daily testing of all individuals aboard, together with increased social distancing and other public health measures, should allow for rapid detection and isolation of COVID-19 infections and dramatically reducing the probability of onboard COVID-19 community spread. In contrast, relying only on PCR testing at embarkation would not be sufficient to avert outbreaks, even when implementing substantial levels of social distancing measures.","Chowell, Gerardo; Dahal, Sushma; Bono, Raquel; Mizumoto, Kenji",Sci Rep,418,16

However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D MR studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used two-sample MR to assess the effect of circulating 25OHD levels on Covid-19 susceptibility. METHODS: Genetic variants strongly associated with 25OHD levels in a 443,734-participant genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables. GWASs of Covid-19 susceptibility and severity from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative were used to test the effect of 25OHD levels on these outcomes. Cohorts from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS included up to 966,395 individuals of European ancestry. RESULTS: Genetically increased 25OHD levels by one standard deviation on the logarithmic scale had no clear effect on susceptibility but tended to increase the odds ratio of hospitalization (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.11) and severe disease (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 0.87, 5.55). Extensive sensitivity analyses probing the assumptions of MR provided consistent estimates. CONCLUSION: These findings do not support a protective role of increased 25OHD levels on Covid-19 outcomes and may suggest harm. At present, individuals should not use vitamin D supplements to protect against Covid-19 outcomes, and on-going supplementation trials should closely monitor for signals of harm.","Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Nakanishi, Tomoko; Mooser, Vincent; Morrison, David R; Abdullah, Tala; Adeleye, Olumide; Mamlook, Noor; Kimchi, Nofar; Afrasiabi, Zaman; Rezk, Nardin; Giliberti, Annarita; Renieri, Alessandra; Chen, Yiheng; Zhou, Sirui; Forgetta, Vincenzo; Richards, J Brent",,418,21

A simulator training model for endocrine procedures (SimLife) was developed at an academic center. The model consisted of a realistic operating environment with a coherent simulated patient dynamized by pulsatile vascularization with simulated blood warmed to 37 °C, and ventilation. Training sessions were designed for adrenal and thyroid surgery, as well as neck dissection. The primary outcome of interest was to evaluate learners’ performance and satisfaction. Learners’ performance was evaluated based on a scoring scale that followed the Downing method for the assessment of competency. While learners’ satisfaction was evaluated using a Likert scale of 1 to 10 on four items (ease of learning, anatomic correspondence of landmarks, realism, and overall satisfaction). Participants were engaged in 32 training sessions. These included 24 adrenalectomies (conventional and laparoscopic both transabdominal and posterior), and 4 thyroid lobectomies with concomitant functional lateral compartment neck dissection. competency scores were procedure-specific addressing specific core components of a given procedure. Learners’ performance scored above average in all procedures evaluated. Satisfaction scores for the specified four items ranged between 8.43 (SD 0.87) and 8.89 (SD 0.96). No major events were reported for the adrenalectomies, while only one jugular vein injury occurred during neck dissection. SimLife is a hyper-realistic training model that allows for satisfactory acquisition of skills and the evaluation of performance progression. It has the potential to become a cornerstone in specialized surgical training.

To enable such customization of HIV care and treatment delivery, the research evidence explaining factors associated with patients’ clinical stages is needed. Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to produce such scientific evidence by analyzing the most recent data for patients at outpatient clinics in the provinces of Kinshasa and Haut-Katanga and to examine the patient characteristics associated with WHO stages of disease progression. Methods: Using a quantitative retrospective cohort study design, we analyzed data from 49,460 people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) from 241 HIV/AIDS clinics located in Haut-Katanga and Kinshasa provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We performed Chi-square and multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results: A small proportion (i.e., 4.4%) of PLHIV were at WHO’s clinical progression stage 4, whereas 30.7% were at clinical stage 3, another 22.9% at stage 2, and the remaining 41.9% were at stage 1, the least severe stage. After controlling for other demographic and clinical factors included in the model, the likelihood of being at stage 1 rather than stage 3 or 4 was significantly higher (at p ≤ 0.05) for patients with no tuberculosis (TB) than those with TB co-infection (adjusted odds ratio or AOR, 5.73; confidence interval or CI, 4.98–6.59). The odds of being at stage 1 were significantly higher for female patients (AOR, 1.35; CI, 1.29–1.42), and those with the shorter duration on ART (vs. greater than 40.37 months). Patents in rural health zones (AOR, 0.32) and semi-rural health zones (AOR, 0.79) were less likely to be at stage 1, compared to patients in urban health zones. Conclusions: Our study showed that TB co-infection raised the risk for PLHIV to be at the severe stages of clinical progression of HIV. Such variation supports the thesis that customized HIV management approaches and clinical regimens may be imperative for this high-risk population. We also found significant variation in HIV clinical progression stages by geographic location and demographic characteristics. Such variation points to the need for more targeted efforts to address the disparities, as the programs attempt to improve the effectiveness of HIV care and treatment. The intersectionality of vulnerabilities from HIV, TB, and COVID-19-related hardships has elevated the need for customized care and treatment even more in the COVID-19 era.","Ewetola, Raimi; Shah, Gulzar H.; Maluantesa, Lievain; Etheredge, Gina; Waterfield, Kristie; Mulenga, Astrid; Kilundu, Apolinaire",Int J Environ Res Public Health,418,20

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (83.31%), ground glass opacities with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%), and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%), and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had three or more lobes involved (70.81%). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included ground glass opacities and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.","Bao, Cuiping; Liu, Xuehuan; Zhang, Han; Li, Yiming; Liu, Jun",J Am Coll Radiol,418,1

Yet, there is limited research testing the effectiveness of this approach compared to other implementation strategies. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a VLC compared to Technical Assistance (TA) among community oncology practices implementing ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends), an evidence-based, early palliative care telehealth, psycho-educational intervention for patients with newly diagnosed advanced cancer and their caregivers. METHODS: Using Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) and Proctor’s Implementation Outcomes Frameworks, this two-arm hybrid type-III cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare two implementation strategies, VLC versus TA, among the 48 National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) practice clusters that have not historically provided palliative care to all patients with advanced cancer. Three cohorts of practice clusters will be randomized to the study arms. Each practice cluster will recruit 15–27 patients and a family caregiver to participate in ENABLE. The primary study outcome is ENABLE uptake (patient level), i.e., the proportion of eligible patients who complete the ENABLE program (receive a palliative care assessment and complete the six ENABLE sessions over 12 weeks). The secondary outcome is overall program implementation (practice cluster level), as measured by the General Organizational Index at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Exploratory aims assess patient and caregiver mood and quality of life outcomes at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks. Practice cluster randomization will seek to keep the proportion of rural practices, practice sizes, and minority patients seen within each practice balanced across the two study arms. DISCUSSION: This study will advance the field of implementation science by evaluating VLC effectiveness, a commonly used but understudied, implementation strategy. The study will advance the field of palliative care by building the capacity and infrastructure to implement an early palliative care program in community oncology practices.

Up to 50% of patients develop shock with cardiac dysfunction but presentation with acute abdominal pain is common and difficult to distinguish from appendicitis. METHOD Prospective case series of PIMS-TS patients presenting to a single UK tertiary paediatric centre. RESULTS As of 16 September 2020, 89 patients have presented with PIMS-TS to our institution; 19 (21.3%) were referred for surgical review. Pyrexia and acute abdominal pain were seen in all 19 patients. Diarrhoea was reported in 14 (73%) and vomiting in 12 (63%). On examination, eight (42%) had right abdominal tenderness, of which five had right iliac fossa (RIF) peritonism. C-reactive protein (CRP) was universally raised: median 176 (15-463)mg/l. Abdominal imaging was performed in 17 (89%), with 11 undergoing abdominal ultrasonography (65%) and 8 abdominal computed tomography (47%); two required both. Findings included nonspecific features of inflammation in the RIF. Eight patients (42%) had an abnormal echocardiogram at admission. Two (10%) patients, with classical signs and symptoms of appendicitis, underwent appendicectomy without radiological imaging and were subsequently diagnosed with PIMS-TS. During the same period, 18 patients underwent appendicectomy for histologically confirmed appendicitis. Serum CRP and ferritin levels were significantly higher in the PIMS-TS cohort compared with children with appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS PIMS-TS is a novel paediatric condition that may mimic appendicitis. It should be considered in patients presenting with abdominal pain to avoid unnecessary surgery in children at risk of cardiovascular instability.","Coles, V; Yardley, I; Hameed, S; Brennan, K",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,418,24

This clinical presentation has been referred as “long COVID.” We here present a retrospective analysis of (18)F-FDG brain PET of long COVID patients from the same center with a biologically confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent functional complaints at least 3 weeks after the initial infection. METHODS: PET scans of 35 patients with long COVID were compared using whole-brain voxel-based analysis to a local database of 44 healthy subjects controlled for age and sex to characterize cerebral hypometabolism. The individual relevance of this metabolic profile was evaluated to classify patients and healthy subjects. Finally, the PET abnormalities were exploratory compared with the patients’ characteristics and functional complaints. RESULTS: In comparison to healthy subjects, patients with long COVID exhibited bilateral hypometabolism in the bilateral rectal/orbital gyrus, including the olfactory gyrus; the right temporal lobe, including the amygdala and the hippocampus, extending to the right thalamus; the bilateral pons/medulla brainstem; the bilateral cerebellum (p-voxel < 0.001 uncorrected, p-cluster < 0.05 FWE-corrected). These metabolic clusters were highly discriminant to distinguish patients and healthy subjects (100% correct classification). These clusters of hypometabolism were significantly associated with more numerous functional complaints (brainstem and cerebellar clusters), and all associated with the occurrence of certain symptoms (hyposmia/anosmia, memory/cognitive impairment, pain and insomnia) (p < 0.05). In a more preliminary analysis, the metabolism of the frontal cluster which included the olfactory gyrus was worse in the 7 patients treated by ACE drugs for high blood pressure (p = 0.032), and better in the 3 patients that had used nasal decongestant spray at the infectious stage (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a profile of brain PET hypometabolism in long COVID patients with biologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and persistent functional complaints more than 3 weeks after the initial infection symptoms, involving the olfactory gyrus and connected limbic/paralimbic regions, extended to the brainstem and the cerebellum. These hypometabolisms are associated with patients’ symptoms, with a biomarker value to identify and potentially follow these patients. The hypometabolism of the frontal cluster, which included the olfactory gyrus, seems to be linked to ACE drugs in patients with high blood pressure, with also a better metabolism of this olfactory region in patients using nasal decongestant spray, suggesting a possible role of ACE receptors as an olfactory gateway for this neurotropism.","Guedj, E.; Campion, J.

Methods: Our narrative review, developed using MEDLINE and EMBASE, summarizes the main evidences in favor or against the current proposed treatment regimens for COVID-19, with a particular focus on antiviral agents. Results: Although many agents have been proposed as possible treatment, to date, any of the potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be safe and effective for treating COVID-19. Despite the lack of definitive evidence, remdesivir remains the only antiviral with encouraging effects in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: In such a complex moment of global health emergency, it is hard to demand scientific evidence.

Candida species are major constituents of the human mycobiome and the main cause of invasive fungal infections, with a high mortality rate. Invasive yeast infections (IYIs) are increasingly recognized as s complication of severe COVID-19. Despite the marked immune dysregulation in COVID-19, no prominent defects have been reported in immune cells that are critically required for immunity to Candida. This suggests that relevant clinical factors, including prolonged ICU stays, central venous catheters, and broad-spectrum antibiotic use, may be key factors causing COVID-19 patients to develop IYIs. Although data on the comparative performance of diagnostic tools are often lacking in COVID-19 patients, a combination of serological and molecular techniques may present a promising option for the identification of IYIs. Clinical awareness and screening are needed, as IYIs are difficult to diagnose, particularly in the setting of severe COVID-19. Echinocandins and azoles are the primary antifungal used to treat IYIs, yet the therapeutic failures exerted by multidrug-resistant Candida spp. such as C. auris and C. glabrata call for the development of new antifungal drugs with novel mechanisms of action.","Arastehfar, Amir; Carvalho, Agostinho; Nguyen, M.

While the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa compared to other continents has so far been low, there are concerns about under-reporting, inadequate diagnostic tools, and insufficient treatment facilities. Moreover, proactiveness on the part of African governments has been under scrutiny. For instance, issues have emerged regarding the responsiveness of African countries in closing international borders to limit trans-continental transmission of the virus. Overdependence on imported products and outsourced services could have contributed to African governments’ hesitation to shut down international air and seaports. In this era of emerging and re-emerging pathogens, we recommend that African nations should consider self-sufficiency in the health sector as an urgent priority, as this will not be the last outbreak to occur. In addition to the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement fund (US$600 million) provided by the World Bank for strengthening health systems and disease surveillance, each country should further establish an epidemic emergency fund for epidemic preparedness and response. We also recommend that epidemic surveillance units should create a secure database of previous and ongoing pandemics in terms of aetiology, spread, and treatment, as well as financial management records. Strategic collection and analysis of data should also be a central focus of these units to facilitate studies of disease trends and to estimate the scale of requirements in preparation and response to any future pandemic or epidemic.","Oboh, Mary Aigbiremo; Omoleke, Semeeh Akinwale; Imafidon, Christian Eseigbe; Ajibola, Olumide; Oriero, Eniyou Cheryll; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred",J Prev Med Public Health,418,33

Similarly, academic conferences as one key pillar of dissemination and interaction around research and development have taken a hit. We analyse an interesting focal point as to how conferences in the area of Computer Science have reacted to this disruption with respect to their mode of offering and registration prices, and whether their response is contingent upon specific factors such as where the conference was to be hosted, its ranking, its publisher or its original scheduled date. To achieve this, we collected metadata associated with 170 conferences in the area of Computer Science and as a means of comparison; 25 Psychology conferences. We show that conferences in the area of Computer Science have demonstrated agility and resilience by progressing to an online mode due to COVID-19 (approximately 76% of Computer Science conferences moved to an online mode), many with no changes in their schedule, particularly those in North America and those with a higher ranking. Whilst registration fees have lowered by an average of 42% due to the onset of COVID-19, conferences still have to facilitate attendance on a large scale due to the logistics and costs involved.

But the degree to which this has happened and community and institutional characteristics of hospitals where capacity limits have been reached is largely unknown. Objective: To determine changes in intensive care capacity in US acute care hospitals between September and early December, 2020, and to identify whether hospitals serving more vulnerable populations were more likely to exceed critical levels of ICU occupancy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective observational cohort of US acute care hospitals reporting to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from September 4, 2020 to December 3, 2020. Hospitals in this cohort were compared to all US acute care hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between community socioeconomic factors and hospital-structural features with a hospital reaching critical ICU capacity. Exposure: Community-level socioeconomic status and hospital-structural features Main Outcomes and Measures: Our primary outcome was reaching critical ICU capacity (>90%) for at least two weeks since September 4. Secondary outcomes included the weekly capacity and occupancy tabulated by state and by hospital referral region. Results: 1,791 hospitals had unsuppressed ICU capacity data in the HHS Protect dataset, with 45% of hospitals reaching critical ICU capacity for at least two weeks during the study period. Hospitals in the South (OR = 2.79, p<0.001), Midwest (OR = 1.76, p=0.01) and West (OR = 1.85, p<0.01) were more likely to reach critical capacity than those in the Northeast. For-profit hospitals (OR = 2.15, p<0.001), rural hospitals (OR = 1.40, p<0.05) and hospitals in areas of high uninsurance (OR = 1.94, p<0.001) were more likely to reach critical ICU capacity, while hospitals with more intensivists (OR = 0.92, p=0.044 and higher nurse-bed ratios (OR = 0.95, p=0.013) were less likely to reach critical capacity. Conclusions and Relevance: Nearly half of U.S. hospitals reporting data to HHS Protect have reached critical capacity at some point since September. Those that are better resourced with staff were less likely to do so while for for-profit hospitals and those in poorer communities were more likely to reach capacity. Continued non-pharmacologic interventions are clearly needed to mitigate spread of the disease to ensure ICUs remain open for all patients needing critical care.","Tsai, T. C.; Jacobson, B.

Understanding the clinical correlations of antibodies produced by infected individuals will be critical for incorporating antibody results into clinical management. This study was an observational cohort study to evaluate antibody responses in individuals with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, including 48 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a large tertiary care medical center. Serum samples were obtained from patients at various time points during the disease course and tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Medical records were reviewed, and antibody levels were compared with clinical and laboratory findings. Patients did not have high levels of antibodies within one week of symptoms, but most had detectable IgM and IgG antibodies between 8 and 29 days after onset of symptoms. Some individuals did not develop measurable levels of IgM or IgG antibodies. IgM antibodies were associated with elevated ALT, but there were no other significant associations. We did not observe significant associations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with clinical outcomes, including intubation and death. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were unlikely to be detected in the first week of infection or in severely immunocompromised individuals. Although we did not observe associations with clinical outcomes, IgM antibodies were associated with higher ALT levels. Antibody production reflects the virus-specific immune response, which is important for immunity but also drives pathology, and antibody levels may be important for guiding treatment of individuals with COVID-19.","DeSimone, M.; Simmons, D.

We validated several structural elements predicted in silico and discovered structural features that affect the translation and abundance of subgenomic viral RNAs in cells. The structural data informed a deep learning tool to predict 42 host proteins that bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Strikingly, antisense oligonucleotides targeting the structural elements and FDA-approved drugs inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA binding proteins dramatically reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells derived from human liver and lung tumors.

Soon, it has spread out across the world and become an ongoing pandemic. In Bangladesh, the first case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected on March 8, 2020. Since then, not many significant studies have been conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. In this study, we estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. Methods: The data of daily confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh and the reported values of generation time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for Singapore and Tianjin, China, were collected. We calculated the basic reproduction number R0 by applying the exponential growth (EG) method. Epidemic data of the first 76 days and different values of generation time were used for the calculation. Results: The basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is estimated to be 2.66 [95% CI: 2.58-2.75], optimized R0 is 2.78 [95% CI: 2.69-2.88] using generation time 5.20 with a standard deviation of 1.72 for Singapore.

An interdisciplinary research team at University of Calgary partnered with Kaeja d’Dance to pilot test the effects of an intervention designed to facilitate embodied social connections among older adults. Within a mixed methods study design, pre and post behavioral tests and qualitative surveys about experiences of the body and connecting were administered to thirteen participants along with test instruments of loneliness and body appreciation. In the short-term, no significant changes were found on quantitative tests. Exploratory analysis revealed intervention improvements on individual body appreciation questions only. This indication of change was strongly supported by converging qualitative data and identified as relating to: increased connection through task-based collaboration, increased awareness of interpersonal boundaries, and a shift to experiencing the body as responsive. These indications of increased relational capacity were deemed likely to cause further impact in the long term. Examining this possibility and the subsequently arisen factor of COVID-19 risks and restrictions, test instruments were administered again to 10 participants 4 and 5 months after the intervention. A significant increase in loneliness was found. Despite this negative impact of COVID-19 isolation, several positive intervention changes remained detectable and some continued to increase over time. Seventy percent of the participants, who made new social contacts during the intervention and later sought continued contact, improved significantly across all body appreciation measures over the full study. The qualitative data from the last two time-points revealed both consistent values and new, negative changes. While these preliminary findings speak to the durability of intervention changes, they also identify areas of urgent priority to help older adults restore embodied relational capacity that has declined during COVID-19. Within the limitations of a small-sample pilot study, converging mixed methods results support the hypothesis that dance interventions designed for the purpose can positively affect the social inclusion of older adults. Although we recommend further study, these promising results also indicate that dance interventions can help older adults recover from pandemic isolation.","Hansen, Pil; Main, Caitlin; Hartling, Liza",Front Psychol,418,1

Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were recruited via social media and invited to participate in an online survey released between 13(th) May and 24(th) June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. FINDINGS: While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family’s health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women’s partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree. CONCLUSION: This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further service changes and future service redesign.

In these countries, due to unfavorable meteorological conditions, such as elevated ambient temperature, high relative humidity, and natural events such as dust storms, people spend a substantial amount of their time in indoor environments. In addition, production of physical and biological aerosols from air conditioners, cooking activities, burning of Arabian incense, and overcrowding due to pilgrimage programs are common causes of low quality indoor air in this region. Thus, due to infiltration of outdoor sources as well as various indoor sources, people living in the GCC countries are highly exposed to indoor air pollutants. Inhalation of indoor air pollutants causes mortalities and morbidities attributed to cardiorespiratory, pulmonary, and lung cancer diseases. Hence, the aim of this review study is to provide a summary of the major findings of indoor air pollution studies in different microenvironments in six GCC countries. These include characterization of detected indoor air pollutants, exposure concentration levels, source identifications, sustainable building designs and ventilation systems, and the mitigation strategies. To do so, >130 relevant indoor air pollution studies across the GCC countries were critically reviewed. Particulate matters (PM(10) and PM(2.5)), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), carbon dioxide (CO(2)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and heavy metals were identified as the reported indoor air pollutants. Apart from them, indoor Radon and bioaerosols were studied only in specific GCC countries. Thus, future studies should also focus on the investigation of emerging indoor air pollutants, such as ultrafine and nanoparticles and their associated health effects. Furthermore, studies on the mitigation of indoor air pollution through the development of advanced air purification and ventilation systems could improve the indoor air quality (IAQ) in the GCC region.","Amoatey, Patrick; Omidvarborna, Hamid; Baawain, Mahad Said; Al-Mamun, Abdullah",Environ Int,418,0

HLH has clinical manifestations related to abnormal prolonged activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages with an excess of proinflammatory cytokines. The main causes of secondary HLH are malignancies and infectious diseases. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 54-year-old man, originally from Eastern Africa, who had lived in Northern Europe for 30 years. Here we describe the clinical features, laboratory parameters, diagnostic workup, management and outcome data of a previously healthy 54-year-old man diagnosed with HLH secondary to tuberculosis. The patient was initially treated for a community-acquired pneumonia. He developed multiorgan failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypertransaminasemia, and kidney and bone marrow dysfunction. The clinical course together with a simultaneous increase in serum ferritin raised the suspicion of HLH. The patient fulfilled seven out of eight diagnostic criteria for HLH. A thorough diagnostic workup with respect to HLH and a potential underlying disease was initiated. Cultivation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, stool and urine, and polymerase chain reaction of epithelioid cell granulomas in the bone marrow were all positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He was treated for both HLH and tuberculosis, and he survived without any sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: We present one of few published cases of a patient who survived HLH triggered by miliary tuberculosis.

This study aimed to analyze the progression of the consumption of anxiolytics (ATC classification: N05B) dispensed in pharmacies in Castile and Leon, Spain, from 2015 to 2020, with a special focus on the possible impact of COVID-19 on the use of these drugs. A quantitative-qualitative analysis of usage was carried out using the total number of packs and the packs per 1000 inhabitants. Overall, the use of anxiolytics grew by 14.41% during 2015–2020. The most commonly used drugs were the short-acting benzodiazepine derivatives lorazepam (whose use increased by 15.18%) and alprazolam (whose use increased by 21.40%), and the dispensing of the long-acting derivative diazepam increased the most, by 31.83%. Anxiolytics consumption increased significantly in 2020 and peaked in March. The pattern of use remained the same in 2020. The consumption of anxiolytics has continued to increase in Castile and Leon over the last six years. The COVID-19 pandemic situation affected the dispensing of these drugs, causing a sharp increase in prescriptions, especially during March, when the confinement of the population was initiated.","Sánchez Díaz, Miryam; Martín-Calvo, María Luisa; Mateos-Campos, Ramona",Int J Environ Res Public Health,418,5

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of English-language articles published December 31, 2019-June 19, 2020. Studies of any design that performed tests on ≥10 patients and reported or inferred correlative statistics were included. Studies were evaluated using elements of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) guidelines. RESULTS: We conducted a narrative and tabular synthesis of studies organized by their reference standard strategy or comparative agreement method, resulting in six categorizations. Critical study details were frequently unreported, including the mechanism for patient/sample selection and researcher blinding to results, which lead to concern for bias. CONCLUSIONS: Current studies estimating test performance characteristics have imperfect study design and statistical methods for the estimation of test performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 tests. The included studies employ heterogeneous methods and overall have an increased risk of bias. Employing standardized guidelines for study designs and statistical methods will improve the process for developing and validating rRT-PCR and NAAT for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Axell-House, Dierdre B.; Lavingia, Richa; Rafferty, Megan; Clark, Eva; Amirian, E.

All over the world, since the very beginning of the pandemic, older adults have been considered one of the groups at highest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death due to COVID-19. The aim of the study was to evaluate the severity of anxiety symptoms related to COVID-19 in the older adults who are participants of the Universities of the Third Age in Poland. Material and methods: The study included participants of the University of the Third Age in Poland. A total of 296 persons were enrolled, including 258 women and 38 men. The study was a diagnostic survey, conducted with the use of the following validated psychometric scales: General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: In two scales (STAI and SHAI), the mean scores demonstrated mild symptoms indicative of anxiety disorders in the older respondents. Women and men did differ significantly in terms of the scores obtained in STAI X-1 and STAI X-2. Single respondents differed significantly from divorced ones in terms of STAI X-1 scores. Moreover, widows/widowers differed significantly from divorced ones in terms of STAI X-2, and GAD-7 scores. Respondents declaring their financial status as average differed significantly from those declaring their financial status as good in terms of: STAI X-1, STAI X-2, SHAI, and GAD-7 scores. Conclusions: The subjective experience of anxiety symptoms associated with fear of contracting COVID-19 was increased due to the ongoing pandemic, but was not significantly high in the analysed population of older people. COVID-19-related anxiety was significantly more common in lonely individuals and in those of worse financial status. Women and men differed significantly in terms of perceived state anxiety and trait anxiety measured by STAI. More studies addressing COVID-19-related anxiety in older people participating in the Polish Universities of the Third Age are needed to determine a more accurate distribution of this phenomenon in Poland.","Cybulski, Mateusz; Cwalina, Urszula; Sadowska, Dorota; Krajewska-Kułak, Elżbieta",J Clin Med,418,16

Models for the transmission dynamics of rotavirus are critical both for estimating current burden from imperfect surveillance and for assessing potential effects of vaccine intervention strategies. We examine rotavirus infection in the Maradi area in southern Niger using hospital surveillance data provided by Epicentre collected over two years. Additionally, a cluster survey of households in the region allows us to estimate the proportion of children with diarrhea who consulted at a health structure. Model fit and future projections are necessarily particular to a given model; thus, where there are competing models for the underlying epidemiology an ensemble approach can account for that uncertainty. We compare our results across several variants of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartmental models to quantify the impact of modeling assumptions on our estimates. Model-specific parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We then use Bayesian model averaging to generate ensemble estimates of the current dynamics, including estimates of [Formula: see text] , the burden of infection in the region, as well as the impact of vaccination on both the short-term dynamics and the long-term reduction of rotavirus incidence under varying levels of coverage. The ensemble of models predicts that the current burden of severe rotavirus disease is 2.6–3.7% of the population each year and that a 2-dose vaccine schedule achieving 70% coverage could reduce burden by 39–42%.","Park, Jaewoo; Goldstein, Joshua; Haran, Murali; Ferrari, Matthew",Vaccine,418,24

However, cutaneous, skin histopathological manifestations of COVID‐19 infection are not well described. Our study aims are to present heterogeneous cutaneous, histopathological manifestations in COVID‐19 patients, to investigate the possible relationship between cutaneous manifestations and histopathological features in COVID‐19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systemic review in PubMed database and Chinese medical journal search engines which were wangfang.data (http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/), Science China (http://www.cnki.net/) until June 17(th), 2020. Search terms “COVID‐19”, “SARS‐Coronavirus‐2” and “Coronavirus” were used in combination with “cutaneous”, “rash”, “skin”, “dermatology”. RESULTS: 75 papers were included with confirmed COVID‐19 infection. The most frequent cutaneous manifestation of COVID‐19 present was erythema, nearly 38.4%. Trunk was the most affected location, presenting in 51.4% patients. Rash occurred before onset of other symptoms was in 5.3% patients. 77 patients were received treatments. Rash was dismissed in 49% patients, improved in 21.2% patients ranged from 0‐17 days. The histopathological examination present in 39 patients. CONCLUSION: Skin is one of target organs affected by COVID‐19 infection. Cutaneous manifestations should be paid more attention. It can help doctors diagnose COVID‐19 infection in prodromal stage, understand progression, and determine prognosis of COVID‐19 infection. This article is protected by copyright.

A clear and unambiguous understanding of a positive work environment, as perceived by healthcare professionals, is crucial for gaining systematic objective insights into the work environment. The aim of this study was to gain consensus on the concept of a positive work environment in the hospital. METHODS: This was a three-round Delphi study to establish consensus on what defines a positive work environment. A literature review and 17 semi-structured interviews with experts (transcribed and analyzed by open and thematic coding) were used to generate items for the Delphi study. RESULTS: The literature review revealed 228 aspects that were clustered into 48 work environment elements, 38 of which were mentioned in the interviews also. After three Delphi rounds, 36 elements were regarded as belonging to a positive work environment in the hospital. DISCUSSION: The work environment is a broad concept with several perspectives. Although all 36 elements are considered important for a positive work environment, they have different perspectives. Mapping the included elements revealed that no one work environment measurement tool includes all the elements. CONCLUSION: We identified 36 elements that are important for a positive work environment. This knowledge can be used to select the right measurement tool or to develop interventions for improving the work environment. However, the different perspectives of the work environment should be considered.","Maassen, Susanne M.; van Oostveen, Catharina; Vermeulen, Hester; Weggelaar, Anne Marie",PLoS One,418,8

Analysis of the S1 gene showed that isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 was a tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus, with a nucleotide sequence similarity of 99%. However, a complete genomic sequence analysis showed that ck/CH/LGX/130530 was more closely related to a Massachusetts type strain (95% similarity to strain H120) than to the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (86%), suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, and it showed that isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 emerged from a recombination event between parental IBV H120 strain and pathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus. The results obtained from the pairwise comparison and nucleotide similarity showed that the recombination breakpoint was located in the nsp14 gene at nucleotides 17055–17083. In line with the high S1 gene sequence similarity, the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate was serotypically close to that of the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (73% antigenic relatedness). Furthermore, vaccination with the LDT3-A vaccine, which was derived from the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain by serial passaging in chicken eggs, provided good protection against challenge with the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, in contrast to the poor protection offered with the H120 vaccine. Interestingly, isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 exhibited low pathogenicity toward specific-pathogen-free chickens compared with the nephropathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, which was likely due to natural recombination in the 5′ 17-kb region of the genome. Our results also indicate that the replicase gene of IBV isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 is associated with viral pathogenicity.","Han, Zongxi; Zhang, Tingting; Xu, Qianqian; Gao, Mengying; Chen, Yuqiu; Wang, Qiuling; Zhao, Yan; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Virus Res,418,16

As always, natural disasters or infectious disease outbreaks have the potential to cause emergency department (ED) volume changes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the influence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on ED visits and the impact on the handling of patients requiring urgent revascularization. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all patients presenting to the ED of Hospital Sainte Anne (Toulon, France) from March 23 to April 5, 2020 and compared them with those of the same period in 2019. Then we analyzed complementary data on acute coronary syndrome (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]) and neurovascular emergencies (strokes and transient ischemic attacks). RESULTS: The total number of visits decreased by 47%. The number of people assessed as triage level 2 was 8% lower in 2020. There were five fewer cases of NSTEMI in 2020, but the same number of STEMI. The number of neurovascular emergencies increased (27 cases in 2019 compared with 30 in 2020). We observed a reduction in the delay between arrival at the ED and the beginning of coronary angiography for STEMI cases (27 min in 2019 and 22 min in 2020). In 2020, 7 more stroke patients were admitted. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic probably dissuaded “non-critical” patients from coming to the hospital, whereas the same number of patients with a critical illness attended the ED as attended prior to the pandemic.

Mass drug administration (MDA) has been proposed as one strategy to reduce transmission. The success of MDA is contingent upon high levels of acceptance among the target population. To inform the design of future MDA campaigns, this rapid ethnographic assessment examined malaria-related knowledge and attitudes toward malaria MDA among residents of a transmission focus in Santo Domingo. METHODS: In October 2019, a rapid ethnographic assessment was conducted in the Los Tres Brazos transmission focus, which had not previously received MDA. National malaria programme staff conducted 61 structured interviews with key informants, recorded observations, and held 72 informal conversations. Using a grounded theory approach, data were analysed during three workshop sessions with research team members. RESULTS: Among those who had heard of malaria in the structured interviews (n = 39/61; 64%), understanding of the disease was largely based on personal experience from past outbreaks or through word-of-mouth. Community health workers (promotores) were trusted for health information and malaria diagnosis more so than professional clinicians. No participant (0%) was familiar with malaria MDA. After learning about MDA, almost all study participants (92%) said that they would participate, seeing it as a way to care for their community. Reasons for not participating in future MDA included not trusting drug administrators, feeling reluctant to take unprescribed medicine, and fear of missing work. Additional identified challenges to MDA included reaching specific demographic groups, disseminating effective MDA campaign messages, and managing misinformation and political influence. CONCLUSION: Residents appear accepting of MDA despite a lack of prior familiarity. Successful MDA will depend on several factors: fostering relationships among community-based health workers, clinicians, community leaders, and others; developing clear health messages that use local terms and spreading them through a variety of media and social networks; and contextualizing MDA as part of a broader effort to promote community health.","Keys, Hunter; Ureña, Keyla; Reyes, Jhefres; Bardosh, Kevin; Pell, Christopher; Puello, Jose; Blount, Stephen; Noland, Gregory S.",Malar J,418,1
