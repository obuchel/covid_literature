The main mechanism of action of TF has been suggested at the level of cell-mediated immunity, as it induces the production of migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). Otherwise, TF can inhibit nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and decrease tumoral necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-4 levels. Given these biological effects, TF has been prescribed for a wide variety of conditions including infections, allergies, autoimmunity, and cancer, with inconsistent results. The exact nature of TF, however, remains unknown, so it has been impossible to accurately define its pharmacokinetics or dosage. This is further complicated because researchers have used TF in a variety of ways across the different studies: antigen-specific or non-antigen-specific, orally or subcutaneously administered, human and non-human origin. In this review we summarize the most important data about what TF is, its mechanism of action, how it is produced, its biological effects, and the available clinical trials using it, in order to establish its role and potential clinical applications in modern medicine.","Macias, Alejandro E; Guaní-Guerra, Eduardo",Archives of medical research,905,19
