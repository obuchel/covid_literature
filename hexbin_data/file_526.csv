It is known that egg production decreases over time, while animal maintenance costs remain stable. It would, however, be desirable to keep hens as long as possible to obtain maximal amounts of antibodies. To identify a suitable length of time that animals can be kept and to optimize the cost:yield ratio, we monitored the number of eggs laid, the total amount of chicken IgY, and the specific antibody titer from individually prepared eggs over a 2-yr period. The plant toxin ricin and the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins type A and B were used to immunize 4 chickens. The number of eggs laid in 2 yr was approximately 600 per hen (about 80% of the maximum egg number), yielding about 20 to 40 g of total IgY per hen. A stable antibody titer of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000, as measured by ELISA, was obtained following up to 11 injections of 10 to 20 μg of immobilized native toxin. Laying capacities were found to decrease, on average, from 7 eggs/wk at the point of first immunization to 2 eggs/wk after more than 2 yr. In parallel, the yield of total and specific IgY increased over time, so that the antibody recovery remained high, even after prolonged immunization times. Using purified IgY preparations, classical immunological assays such as ELISA and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, the IgY showed neutralizing capacity when used to block the functional activity of the toxins both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the total IgY content over time demonstrated a complex biological oscillation (and the antigen-specific titer), with a shorter time period of around 7 d (circaseptan rhythm). In summary, we successfully immunized chickens with ricin and botulinum neurotoxins and monitored laying capacity, IgY concentration, and specific antibody titer over an extended period of 2 yr.","Pauly, D.; Dorner, M.; Zhang, X.; Hlinak, A.; Dorner, B.; Schade, R.",Poult Sci,526,28

Indeed, the toll of smoking in China is much greater than its status as the world’s most populous country. There is a persistent and continuing need for China to implement the measures specified in the global tobacco control treaty, the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which China ratified in 2005. The theme for the 2021 WHO World No Tobacco Day focuses on the need to support smoking cessation. This article presents findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Policy Evaluation Project cohort surveys in China, in comparison to ITC cohort surveys in two neighboring countries: Japan and the Republic of Korea. These findings demonstrate that smokers in China very much want to quit, but these intentions are not being translated into quit attempts, relative to smokers in Japan and the Republic of Korea. Additionally, about 80% of Chinese smokers want the Chinese government to do more to control smoking. These findings reaffirm the need for China to implement strong, evidence-based measures to reduce smoking. The objective of Healthy China 2030 to reduce deaths from non-communicable diseases by 30% can be achieved by reducing smoking prevalence from its current 26.6% to 20%, and this reduction can be achieved through strong implementation of FCTC measures.","Fong, Geoffrey T.; Yuan, Jiang; Craig, Lorraine V.; Xu, Steve Shaowei; Meng, Gang; Quah, Anne C.K.; Seo, Hong-Gwan; Lee, Sungkyu; Yoshimi, Itsuro; Katanoda, Kota; Tabuchi, Takahiro",China CDC Wkly,526,1

Despite the importance of patient portals, inconclusive data exist regarding the effect of patient portal use on patient satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the relationship between the postadoptive use of patient portals and patient satisfaction outcomes. METHODS: Postadoptive use of patient portals has a positive relationship with the 3 dimensions of patient satisfaction, mediated by gratification, health self-awareness, and health perceptions. A total of 504 valid patient portal user responses were collected, and partial least squares analysis was performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction was captured using three dimensions: care team interaction, atmosphere, and instruction effectiveness. The results show that postadoptive use of patient portals has a positive influence on all 3 dimensions of patient satisfaction through the mediating variables of gratification, health self-awareness, and health perceptions. Specifically, postadoptive use had significant positive influence on gratification, health self-awareness, and health perceptions. Each of the 3 patient perceptions had significant positive influence on all 3 dimensions of patient satisfaction: care team interaction, atmosphere, and instruction effectiveness. Specifically, our model explained 31.8% of the care team interaction, 40.6% of the atmosphere, and 39.1% of the instruction effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that patient portal use can influence patient satisfaction through the mediating effects of gratification, health self-awareness, and health perception. Patient satisfaction is an important outcome for health care organizations. Therefore, by promoting effective patient portal use and fostering patient perceptions, health care organizations can improve patient satisfaction.","Kinney, Aaron P; Sankaranarayanan, Balaji",J Med Internet Res,526,5

Studies of the pathway in mice have strongly shaped the view that mammalian piRNAs are essential for male but not for female fertility. Here, we report that the role of the piRNA pathway substantially differs in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), the piRNA pathway setup of which more closely resembles that of other mammals, including humans. The loss of the Mov10l1 RNA helicase—an essential piRNA biogenesis factor—leads to striking phenotypes in both sexes. In contrast to mice, female Mov10l1(–/–) hamsters are sterile because their oocytes do not sustain zygotic development. Furthermore, Mov10l1(–/–) male hamsters have impaired establishment of spermatogonia accompanied by transcriptome dysregulation and an expression surge of a young retrotransposon subfamily. Our results show that the mammalian piRNA pathway has essential roles in both sexes and its adaptive nature allows it to manage emerging genomic threats and acquire new critical roles in the germline.","Loubalova, Zuzana; Fulka, Helena; Horvat, Filip; Pasulka, Josef; Malik, Radek; Hirose, Michiko; Ogura, Atsuo; Svoboda, Petr",Nat Cell Biol,526,1

To advance from identifying to intervening in such intersectional health disparities, studies that examine the underlying mechanisms are required. Although much research demonstrates the negative health impacts of perceived discrimination along single axes, quantitative approaches to assessing the role of discrimination in generating intersectional health disparities remain in their infancy. Members of our team recently introduced the Intersectional Discrimination Index (InDI) to address this gap. The InDI comprises three measures of enacted (day-to-day and major) and anticipated discrimination. These attribution-free measures ask about experiences of mistreatment because of who you are. These measures show promise for intersectional health disparities research but require further validation across intersectional groups and languages. In addition, the proposal to remove attributions is controversial, and no direct comparison has ever been conducted. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to cognitively and psychometrically evaluate the InDI in English and Spanish and determine whether attributions should be included. METHODS: The study will draw on a preliminary validation data set and three original sequentially collected sources of data: qualitative cognitive interviews in English and Spanish with a sample purposively recruited across intersecting social status and position (gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and nativity); a Spanish quantitative survey (n=500; 250/500, 50% sexual and gender minorities); and an English quantitative survey (n=3000), with quota sampling by race and ethnicity (Black, Latino/a/x, and White), sexual or gender minority status, and gender. RESULTS: The study was funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities in May 2021, and data collection began in July 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The key deliverables of the study will be bilingual measures of anticipated, day-to-day, and major discrimination validated for multiple health disparity populations using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods.

MATERIAL/METHODS: The present observational cohort study included a total of 244 children with OSAHS during December 2017 to December 2018. The patients were divided into the LTPABT group, the LTPAUT group, and the control group that received traditional bilateral tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and the lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO(2)) were measured. The patients’ pain condition was determined using the Visual Analog Score (VAS) and intraoperative indices were collected. Patients’ quality of life was assessed by OSA-18 scale and patients’ immune function was determined. RESULTS: The postoperative VAS scores were remarkably lower in the LTPABT and LTPAUT groups. At 6 months after surgery, the AHI significantly had decreased and LSaO(2) levels were significantly enhanced for all groups, and the AHI was significantly lower and LSaO(2) was markedly higher in the LTPABT group. The ratio of patients with efficacy of cured and remarkably effective was remarkably higher in the LTPABT group. The rates of postoperative hemorrhage and infection were significantly lower in the LTPABT and LTPAUT groups, and 4 cases showed tonsillar hyperplasia. OSA-18 scores were lowest in the LTPABT group. No significant difference was found in levels of IgM, IgA and IgG, and T lymphocyte subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The low-temperature plasma-assisted bilateral tonsillectomy combined with adenoidectomy had the best efficacy.

The main mechanism of this effect is impairment by the HIV-1 protein Nef of the ABCA1 interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin, which leads to a block in ABCA1 maturation followed by its degradation. However, ABCA1 is also downmodulated by Nef delivered with the extracellular vesicles, suggesting involvement of a direct Nef:ABCA1 interaction at the plasma membrane. Here, we present an optimized model of the Nef:ABCA1 interaction, which identifies interaction sites and provides an opportunity to perform a virtual screening for potential inhibitors. Interestingly, the predicted sites on Nef involved in the ABCA1 interaction overlap with those involved in the interaction with calnexin. The compounds previously shown to block Nef:calnexin interaction were among the top ranking ligands in docking simulations with ABCA1-interacting sites on Nef, suggesting the possibility that both interactions can be inhibited by the same chemical compounds. This study identifies a series of compounds for potential development as inhibitors of Nef-mediated co-morbidities of HIV infection.","Adzhubei, Alexei A.; Kulkarni, Amol; Tolstova, Anna P.; Anashkina, Anastasia A.; Sviridov, Dmitri; Makarov, Alexander A.; Bukrinsky, Michael I.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,526,5

The two most common forms of undergraduate research are those in traditional settings (such as internships and research-for-credit in academic research labs) and course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). Both of these settings offer many benefits to students, yet they have unique strengths and weaknesses that lead to trade-offs. Traditional undergraduate research experiences (UREs) offer the benefits of personalized mentorship and experience in a professional setting, which help build students’ professional communication skills, interest, and scientific identity. However, UREs can reach only a limited number of students. On the other end of the trade-off, CUREs offer research authenticity in a many-to-one classroom research environment that reaches more students. CUREs provide real research experience in a collaborative context, but CUREs are not yet necessarily equipping students with all of the experiences needed to transition into a research lab environment outside the classroom. We propose that CURE instructors can bridge trade-offs between UREs and CUREs by deliberately including learning goals and activities in CUREs that recreate the benefits of UREs, specifically in the areas of professional communication, scientific identify, and student interest. To help instructors implement this approach, we provide experience- and evidence-based guidance for student-centered, collaborative learning opportunities.","Burmeister, Alita R.; Dickinson, Katie; Graham, Mark J.",,526,1

METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of literature published between 2005 and 2019 on barriers to health services for adolescents in low- and middle-income countries. The review was guided by a framework that conceptualized barriers across multiple dimensions of access (availability, geographic accessibility, affordability, and acceptability), utilization, and effective coverage. RESULTS: We identified 339 studies that assessed barriers related to at least one dimension of the operational framework. Acceptability (93%) and availability (88%) of health services were the most frequently studied access dimensions; affordability (45%) and geographic access (32%) were studied less frequently. Less than half (40%) of the studies evaluated utilization, and none of the 339 studies assessed effective coverage. Attention to equity stratifiers (e.g., income, disability) was limited. Topics studied reflected only a subset of the major causes of adolescent death and disability. CONCLUSIONS: Holistic, equity-oriented approaches are needed to better understand barriers across multiple dimensions that together determine whether health services are accessible, used, and effectively meet the needs of different adolescent groups.","Stierman, Elizabeth K.; Kalbarczyk, Anna; Oo, Htet Nay Lin; Koller, Theadora Swift; Peters, David H.",J Adolesc Health,526,1

Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop a questionnaire to investigate the importance attributed to smell, taste and flavour and socio-cultural differences among individuals. METHODS: Cross-cultural adaptation of the questionnaire was executed by two professional translators and one bilingual investigator and pre-tested on a pilot group of 25 subjects with normal smell and taste abilities. The final version of the questionnaire was sent by e-mail to 850 healthy subjects. The Google form consisted of three parts: “The importance of olfaction” developed by Croy et al. in 2010, “The importance of taste and flavour” developed by our team and a section to collect demographic data. The questions were classified into “association”, “application”, “consequence” and “aggravation”. Statistical differences were assessed using t-test with p ≤ 0.05. Correlations were calculated using Spearman’s test. Internal consistency was assessed using the Cronbach’s Alpha, while test-retest reliability was analysed by calculating the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC2k). RESULTS: The questionnaire received a non-response rate of 10.7%. Calculation of Cronbach’s alpha showed good internal reliability (a = 0.87). Test-retest evaluation was satisfactory for all subscales, with an overall ICC2k = 0.84 (CI 0.79-0.89). Statistical analysis showed that smell, taste and flavour appeared to be more important for women when compared to men (p < 0.001). No statistical differences were seen between individuals with various educational background (p > 0.05), and the importance of smell (r = 0.16; p < 0.01), taste and flavour (r = 0.08; p < 0.05) did not decline with age. CONCLUSIONS: The development of this original test provides an overview into the importance of smell, taste and flavour among individuals. Although further research is needed, it can help in the evaluation and investigation of aspects that influence people to seek medical attention in the presence of sensory alterations.","Trecca, Eleonora M.C.; Fortunato, Francesca; Gelardi, Matteo; Petrone, Paolo; Cassano, Michele",Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,526,1

Adherence to dietary quality indices also have shown to have potential favorable effects on obesity-related health outcomes. However, no study has examined the interaction between rs17782313 and the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MDS) on cardio-metabolic risk factors and hypothalamic hormones. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to examine whether adherence to these dietary quality indices modifies the association of the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism with cardio-metabolic risk factors and hypothalamic hormones among obese adults. METHOD: Two hundred eighty-eight healthy obese adults were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Diet quality indices, including DASH score and MDS, were calculated from a validated 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). MC4R s17782313 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). An ANCOVA multivariate interaction model was used to assess the gene-diet interaction. RESULTS: Significant interactions were detected between DASH score and MC4R rs17782313 genotypes on systolic blood pressure (SBP), atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and serum glucose and triglyceride (TG) among the female group (p(Interaction) < 0.05). In the male group, there were gene-DASH and gene-MDS interactions in relation to serum glucose concentration and plasma α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) levels, but these were found only in multi-adjusted interaction models (p(Interaction) < 0.05). In addition, there was a significant interaction between MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism and DASH score on plasma agouti-related peptide (AgRP) concentrations in the female group in a multivariate interaction model (p(Interaction) < 0.05). An inverse association between DASH score and chance of having the CC genotype in a multivariate-adjusted model among women was also revealed. CONCLUSION: MC4R rs17782313 interacts with healthy dietary pattern (DASH score and MDS) to influence cardio-metabolic risk factors and hypothalamic hormones in obese individuals.

Student feedback was assessed via an end-of-semester survey designed specifically to analyze the students’ perceptions of the Spring 2020 transition to remote learning, as well as a comparison of Spring 2020 and Spring 2019 (when the course was taught in-person) student performance deliverables. Student performance was comparable to (or even better than) that in 2019. Students responded very positively to the transition, with most students agreeing or strongly agreeing that they had the resources needed to succeed (4.43 on a Likert scale), although on average, the students also found that the shift made learning more challenging, with increased effort required to engage with the material. Students especially found the recorded demonstration of laboratory techniques, asynchronous lectures, the learning management system chat feature, and virtual office hours useful. Many students felt that even with these resources, they still lost some of the experience that comes with in-person hands-on application, and some students found working in teams to be more challenging. While the overall approach implemented in the abrupt transition was effective in terms of student learning outcomes, engagement and immersion in a more realistic experience is a concern moving forward in Fall 2020. Based on our outcomes and on data from the literature, we will add gamified virtual lab simulations, shown to enhance student experience and create a more engaging and effective learning environment in lieu of in-person instruction.

Whereas in the past a service system could only exchange information of the service provider at the request of the user, information can now be provided by automatically analyzing a particular need, even without a direct user request. This also holds for online platforms of used-vehicle sales. In the past, consumers needed to inconveniently determine and classify the quality of information through static data provided by service and information providers. As a result, this service field has been harmful to consumers owing to such problems as false sales, fraud, and exaggerated advertising. Despite significant efforts of platform providers, there are limited human resources for censoring the vast amounts of data uploaded by sellers. Therefore, in this study, an algorithm called YOLOv3+MSSIM Type 2 for automatically censoring the data of used-vehicle sales on an online platform was developed. To this end, an artificial intelligence system that can automatically analyze an object in a vehicle video uploaded by a seller, and an artificial intelligence system that can filter the vehicle-specific terms and profanity from the seller’s video presentation, were also developed. As a result of evaluating the developed system, the average execution speed of the proposed YOLOv3+MSSIM Type 2 algorithm was 78.6 ms faster than that of the pure YOLOv3 algorithm, and the average frame rate per second was improved by 40.22 fps. In addition, the average GPU utilization rate was improved by 23.05%, proving the efficiency.","Kim, Kapyol; Jeong, Incheol; Cho, Jinsoo",Sensors (Basel),526,1

What makes Cocon different from standard type theories is the presence of first-class contexts and contextual objects to describe syntax trees that are closed with respect to a given context of assumptions. Following M. Hofmann’s work, we use a presheaf model to characterise HOAS trees. Surprisingly, this model already provides the necessary structure to also model Cocon. In particular, we can capture the contextual objects of Cocon using a comonad [Formula: see text] that restricts presheaves to their closed elements. This gives a simple semantic characterisation of the invariants of contextual types (e.g. substitution invariance) and identifies Cocon as a type-theoretic syntax of presheaf models. We express our category-theoretic constructions by using a modal internal type theory that is implemented in Agda-Flat.","Pientka, Brigitte; Schöpp, Ulrich",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,526,1

Perhaps because Singapore is routinely identified as one of the safest countries in the world, Singapore’s past disasters have not been studied extensively with few events captured in major global databases such as EM-DAT. In this article, we fill the disaster data gap for postwar Singapore (1950–2020) using specified metrics through an archival search, review of literature, and analysis of secondary sources. We present four key lessons from cataloging these events. First, we expand Singapore’s disaster catalog to 39 events in this time period and quantify the extent of this data gap. Second, we identify the mitigating actions that have followed past events that contribute to Singapore’s present-day safety. Third, we discuss how these past events uncover continuities among vulnerability bearers in Singapore. Last, we identify limitations of a disaster catalog when considering future risks. In expanding the disaster catalog, this case study of Singapore supports the need for comprehensive understanding of past disasters in order to examine current and future disaster resilience.","Lin, Yolanda C.; Khan, Feroz; Jenkins, Susanna F.; Lallemant, David",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,526,1

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the specific role of chol in infectivity and the driving force behind Env clustering remain unknown. Here, gp41 is demonstrated to directly interact with chol in the viral membrane via residues 751–854 in the cytoplasmic tail (CT(751–854)). Super‐resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy analysis of Env distribution further demonstrates that both truncation of gp41 CT(751–854) and depletion of chol leads to dispersion of Env clusters in the viral membrane and inhibition of virus entry. This work reveals a direct interaction of gp41 CT with chol and indicates that this interaction is an important orchestrator of Env clustering.","Nieto‐Garai, Jon Ander; Arboleya, Aroa; Otaegi, Sara; Chojnacki, Jakub; Casas, Josefina; Fabriàs, Gemma; Contreras, F‐Xabier; Kräusslich, Hans‐Georg; Lorizate, Maier",Adv Sci (Weinh),526,0

Up to 80% of human infections and 60–70% of hospital-acquired infections have a biofilm origin, with Staphylococcus aureus one of the leading causes of these infections. Microorganisms in biofilms exhibit significant antimicrobial resistance which poses important treatment challenges, hence the urgent need to identify novel antibiofilm strategies. Microbes form biofilms in response to various factors, and once these 3-dimentional structures form they are highly recalcitrant to removal. The switch from planktonic lifestyle to the biofilm protected mode of growth results in a phenotypic shift in the behavior of the microorganisms in terms of growth rate and gene expression. Given these changes, investigation of microbial gene expression and their modulation at different stages of biofilm maturation is needed to provide vital insight into the behavior of biofilm cells. In this study, we analyzed publicly available transcriptomic dataset of S. aureus biofilms at different stages of maturation to identify consistently upregulated genes irrespective of the biofilm maturation stage. Our reanalysis identified a total of 6 differentially expressed genes upregulated in both 48 and 144-h old S. aureus biofilms. Functional analysis revealed that these genes encode for proteins which play a role in key microbial metabolic pathways. However, these genes, as yet, are unrelated or fully studied in the context of biofilm. Moreover, the findings of this in silico work, suggest that these genes may represent potential novel targets for the development of more effective antibiofilm strategies against S. aureus biofilm-associated infections.","Nassar, Rania; Hachim, Mahmood; Nassar, Mohannad; Kaklamanos, Eleftherios G.; Jamal, Mohamed; Williams, David; Senok, Abiola",Front Microbiol,526,1

Encouragingly, results from human studies, although limited in number, appear to support this preclinical basis, with improvements in cognitive performance and disease risk observed across healthy and disease states. Therefore, citrus fruits – both as whole fruit and 100% juices – should be encouraged within the diet for their potential neurological benefit.

Accordingly, this study was performed in order to find any differentiating CT criteria that would help during the expected clinical overlap during the current Influenza season. RESULTS: This study was retrospectively conducted during the period from June till November 2020, on acute symptomatic 130 patients with no history of previous pulmonary diseases; 65 patients had positive PCR for COVID-19 including 50 mild patients and 15 critical or severe patients; meanwhile, the other 65 patients had positive PCR for H1N1 including 50 mild patients and 15 critical or severe patients. They included 74 males and 56 females (56.9%:43.1%). Their age ranged 14–90 years (mean age 38.9 ± 20.3 SD). HRCT findings were analyzed by four expert consultant radiologists in consensus. All patients with COVID-19 showed parenchymal or alveolar HRCT findings; only one of them had associated airway involvement. Among the 65 patients with H1N1; 56 patients (86.2%) had parenchymal or alveolar HRCT findings while six patients (9.2%) presented only by HRCT signs of airway involvement and three patients (4.6%) had mixed parenchymal and airway involvement. Regarding HRCT findings of airway involvement (namely tree in bud nodules, air trapping, bronchial wall thickening, traction bronchiectasis, and mucous plugging), all showed significant p value (ranging from 0.008 to 0.04). On the other hand, HRCT findings of parenchymal or alveolar involvement (mainly ground glass opacities) showed no significant relation. CONCLUSION: HRCT can help in differentiation between non-severe COVID-19 and H1N1 based on signs of airway involvement.","Samir, Ahmed; Naguib, Nagy N.

Observational studies focusing on the determinants of dental service use drawing on the Andersen model were included; Results: In sum, 41 studies have been included (ten studies investigating children/adolescents and 31 studies investigating adults). Among children, particularly higher age (predisposing characteristic), higher income (enabling resource) and more oral health problems (need factor) were associated with increased dental service use. Among adults, findings are, in general, less consistent. However, it should be noted that one half of the studies found an association between increased education (predisposing characteristic) and increased dental service. In general, study quality was rather high. However, it should be noted that most studies did not report how they dealt with missing data; Conclusions: Our systematic review revealed that all components (i.e., predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and need factors) of the Andersen model tend to be associated with dental service use among children, whereas the findings are more mixed among adults. In conclusion, beyond need factors, dental service use also tend to be driven by other factors.

In fact, cracks are an early indication of the decaying of the structure that can lead to severe consequences. Manual inspection is time-consuming, costly, and contingent on the subjective judgment of inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose to use state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision to approach the crack delineation problem as a semantic segmentation task where pixels of the same class (background or crack) are clustered together. Our proposed method uses dilated convolution to enlarge the receptive field and preserve the spatial resolution. In this work, we present a fully convolutional network that consists of an encoder, a cascaded dilation module, and a decoder. While the encoder extracts the feature maps from input images, the cascaded dilation module aggregates multi-scale contextual information and finally, the decoder fuses low-level features, performs pixel-wise classification, restores the initial resolution of the images and subsequently outputs the segmentation results. Based on the same meta-architecture, we compare three different dilated encoder-decoder (DED) models: DED-VGG16, DED-ResNet18, and DED-InceptionV3. The three models have been trained and validated using a dataset comprised of 40000 images. For evaluation purposes, we used common performance metrics for semantic segmentation tasks: Precision, Recall, F1-score, IoU, and ROC curves.

It also emerged that decisions that were made to cancel, postpone or significantly scale down such festivals or pilgrimages may have saved the world from aggravated circumstances causing a spike in COVID-19 numbers. The chapter recommends that aggressive marketing for religious and pilgrimage tourism be embarked on once COVID-19 has been contained and people are comfortable travelling again.

There are limited published data on the outcomes and survival rate of RB-CDH. We aimed at investigating the clinical characteristics and analyzing the risk factors of survival in neonates with RB-CDH treated in our center over a period of 13 years. RESULTS: Fifteen infants with RB-CDH were identified. Most of the patients were full term (74%). The mean birth weight was 2.90± 0.72 kg. The ratio of male to female was 2:1. The mean APGAR score at 1 min was 5.31±2.34, and 7.30±1.59 at 5 min. Ten patients (67%) were imaged by antenatal ultrasound. Eleven patients (73.33%) survived to go for surgical repair. The hernia sac was found in 5 patients (45%). Most hernial defects were closed in a primary fashion. The mean age at the operative repair was 8.11±9.90 days. The average NICU stay for all patients was 40.47±50.38 days. The mean follow-up period was 20.45±9.34 months. Three patients had postoperative complications. The total survival rate in neonates with RB-CDH was 9/15 (60%). Nine out of 11 (82%) neonates survived after surgical repair. Four patients (27%) died before surgical repair. Ventilation-related bilateral pneumothorax was a contributing cause of death in three patients. Birth weight was found lower in the non-survivor’s group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the degree of pulmonary hypertension was more severe among non-survivors. No statistical significance was observed between other variables and mortality. CONCLUSION: We found that low birth weight and the presence of severe PHTN were risk factors for mortality in neonates with RB-CDH. These results are in line with previous studies on prognostic factors in CDH. Ventilator-related pneumothorax appears to be a significant contributing cause of death. Long-term follow-up studies of infants born with RB-CDH are needed as small number of cases limits large-volume RB-CDH studies.","Alghamdi, Alshaima; Raboe, Enaam",Ann Pediatr Surg,526,24

With the economic and social impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, it became even more evident that food security is a challenge. This workshop took an innovative approach to addressing the challenges of future agriculture by considering sustainable, circular agricultural systems. Participants presented research results on algae-based food, edible insects, mushrooms, novel concepts for nutrient management, bioreactor-based farming, sustainable food culture, as well as sensor- and remote-controlled automatic food production. This special issue presents the papers contributed to the workshop and the results of the discussions.","Rahmann, Gerold; Azim, Khalid; Brányiková, Irena; Chander, Mahesh; David, Wahyudi; Erisman, Jan Willem; Grimm, Daniel; Hammermeister, Andrew; Ji, Li; Kuenz, Anja; Løes, Anne-Kristin; Wan-Mohtar, Wan Abd Al Qadr Imad; Neuhoff, Daniel; Niassy, Saliou; Olowe, Victor; Schoeber, Mia; Shade, Jessica; Ullmann, Jörg; van Huis, Arnold",Org,526,1

The first set of actions, so-called short-term measures, are expected to be implemented by 2023 and result in a reduction of emission intensity by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 2008 levels. Compliance may be achieved through a reduction in sailing speeds, but certain countries have raised concerns on the ramifications of longer transit times on their exports, particularly for perishable products. In this paper, we present a methodology to assess the impacts of various short-term measures on perishable products. We use an extension of a nested modal split model to examine shifts towards other modes of transport. We demonstrate our methodology with a transpacific case study carrying perishable products from South America to China. We compare the short-term measures currently under discussion, in one of the first academic studies to explore these issues. These include a speed limit approach, a power limit, and a goal-based measure. Our results show that a power limit or a goal-based measure would offer some advantages to liner shipping operators using more efficient vessels, unlike a speed limit. Using 2008 as the benchmark year has resulted in small speed reductions required by the liner shipping sector to reach its targets. For perishable cargoes, small speed reductions can be tolerated by the shippers without significant modal shift. Choosing the right short-term strategy is of utmost importance to promote clean shipping practices in the following years.","Zis, Thalis P. V.; Psaraftis, Harilaos N.",Marit Econ Logist,526,1

Myocardial stress is characterized by abnormal metabolism, excessive reactive oxygen species production, an insufficient energy supply, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis. Mitochondria, the main organelles contributing to the energy supply of cardiomyocytes, are key determinants of cell survival and death. Mitophagy is important for cardiomyocyte function and metabolism because it removes damaged and aged mitochondria in a timely manner, thereby maintaining the proper number of normal mitochondria. In this review, we first introduce the general characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of mitophagy. We then describe the three classic mitophagy regulatory pathways and their involvement in myocardial stress. Finally, we discuss the two completely opposite effects of mitophagy on the fate of cardiomyocytes. Our summary of the molecular pathways underlying mitophagy in myocardial stress may provide therapeutic targets for myocardial protection interventions.","Ji, Haizhe; Wu, Dan; Kimberlee, O’Maley; Li, Ruibing; Qian, Geng",Front Physiol,526,4

We administered a social needs screening tool and needs assessment survey to assess SDOH and evaluate for trends in the population of patients visiting our ED. METHODS: A survey was distributed via convenience sampling to adult ED patients to capture self-reported demographic information and data about social needs. We categorized the questions related to SDOH based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding format and created a composite variable called “SDOH Strata” based on the SDOH Index scores (0–5-low, 6–10-middle, or ≥11-high). We conducted bivariate analyses using the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and their SDOH Strata using Fisher’s exact test. We then conducted multinomial logistic regression to examine the association between the patients’ sociodemographic characteristics and the SDOH Strata. RESULTS: A total of 269 surveys were collected. We observed that Hispanic/Latino patients were more than two times as likely (odds ratio: 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12,−6.51) to be in the higher impact stratum than in the lower impact stratum. Those who were undocumented had 3.43 times increased adjusted odds (95% CI, 1.98, 9.53) of being in the higher than the lower impact stratum compared to US citizens. Additionally, people speaking Spanish as their primary language were 5.16 times as likely to be in the higher impact stratum compared to the reference (English-speaking and lower impact stratum). CONCLUSION: In our patient population, patients noted to have the highest impact burden of the SDOH were those who identified as Hispanic/Latino, Spanish-speaking, and undocumented immigrant status.","Ordonez, Edgardo; Dowdell, Katherine; Navejar, Natasha M.; Dongarwar, Deepa; Itani, Aya; Salihu, Hamisu M.",West J Emerg Med,526,1

Previous studies have analyzed the components of residency program websites; however, there is a paucity of information regarding EM program websites. The purpose of our study was to analyze information on EM residency program websites. METHODS: In April–May 2020, we evaluated 249 United States EM residency program websites for presence or absence of 38 items relevant to EM applicants. Descriptive statistics were performed, including means and standard deviations. RESULTS: Of the 249 EM websites evaluated, the websites contained a mean of 20 of 38 items (53%). Only 16 programs (6%) contained at least three-quarters of the items of interest, and no programs contained all 38 items. The general categories with the least amount of items were social media use (9%), research (46%), and lifestyle (49%), compared to the other general categories such as application process (58%), resident information (63%), general program information (67%), and facility information (69%). The items provided by programs most often included program description (98%), blocks and rotations (91%), and faculty listing (88%). The items provided least often included housing/neighborhood information (17%) and social media links (19%). CONCLUSION: Our comprehensive review of EM residency websites in the US revealed the absence of many variables on most programs’ websites. Use of this information to enhance accessibility of desired information stands to benefit both applicants and programs in the increasingly competitive specialty of EM.","Pollock, Jordan R.; Weyand, Jeffery A.; Reyes, Amy B.; Senemar, Shiva; Swenson, Aunika L.; Lindor, Rachel A.; Homme, James L.",West J Emerg Med,526,1

Vagal manoeuvres are internationally recommended therapy in stable patients. The head down deep breathing (HDDB) technique was previously described as an acceptable vagal manoeuvre, but there are no studies comparing its efficacy to other vagal manoeuvres. Our objective in this study was to compare the rates of successful cardioversion with HDDB and the commonly practiced, modified Valsalva manoeuvre (VM). METHODS: We conducted a randomised controlled trial at an acute hospital ED. Patients presenting with SVT were randomly assigned to HDDB or modified VM in a 1:1 ratio. A block randomisation sequence was prepared by an independent biostatistician, and then serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes were opened just before the intervention. Patients and caregivers were not blinded. Primary outcome was cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Secondary outcome(s) included adverse effects/complications of each technique. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were randomised between 1 August, 2018–1 February, 2020 (20 HDDB and 21 modified VM). Amongst the 41 patients, three spontaneously cardioverted to sinus rhythm before receiving the allocated treatment and were excluded. Cardioversion was achieved in six patients (31.6%) and seven patients (36.8%) with HDDB and modified VM, respectively (odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 0.33, 4.84, P = 0.733). Seventeen (89.5%) patients in the HDDB group and 14 (73.7%) from the modified VM group did not encounter any adverse effects. No major adverse cardiovascular events were recorded. CONCLUSION: Both the head down deep breathing technique and the modified Valsalva manoeuvre appear safe and effective in cardioverting patients with SVT in the ED.","Lim, Hoon Chin; Seah, Yi-En Clara; Iqbal, Arshad; Tan, Vern Hsen; Lai, Shieh Mei",West J Emerg Med,526,1

WBAN consists of miniaturized sensors designed to collect and transmit data through wireless network, enabling medical specialists to monitor patients during their normal daily life and providing real time opinions for medical diagnosis. Many wireless technologies have proved themselves in WBAN applications, while others are still under investigations. The choice of the technology to adopt may depend on the disease to monitor and the performance requirements, i.e. reliability, latency and data rate. In addition, the suitable sensor is essential when seeking to extract the data related to a medical measure. This paper aims at surveying the wireless technologies used in WBAN systems. In addition to a detailed survey on the existing technologies, the use of the emerging Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, and the future 5G, B5G and 6G is investigated, where the suitability of these technologies to WBAN applications is studied from several perspectives. Furthermore, medical applications of WBAN are discussed by presenting their methodologies, the adopted wireless technologies and the used sensors. Given that each medical application requires the appropriate sensor to extract the data, we highlight a wide range of the sensors used in the market for medical systems.

The β2-AR expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry and an immunoreactive scoring (IRS) system in 57 different head and neck cancer specimens, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting in four head and neck cancer cell lines (HNCCLs). Cell viability and proliferation assays were performed using 0, 1, 5 and 10 µM of NE and 1 µM of propranolol in four HNCCLs. The expression of β2-AR was positive in the majority of head and neck cancer tissues (55/57, 96.5%); however, it was significantly higher in oral cavity cancer than in pharyngeal cancer (median IRS: 9 vs. 3; P<0.001). All HNCCLs exhibited β2-AR expression, with a higher expression level detected in the oral cavity cancer cell line than in the others. NE stimulated viability (oral cavity, 206%; larynx, 156%; pharynx, 130%; nasal cavity, 137%; 10 µM NE) and proliferation (124, 176, 131 and 127%, respectively) in a dose-dependent manner in all HNCCLs. Conversely, propranolol attenuated such viability (55, 42, 18 and 22%, respectively) and proliferation (22, 40, 61 and 48%, respectively). In conclusion, the viability and proliferation of various head and neck cancers may be directly stimulated by stress and this may be attenuated by β-blockers.","Kwon, Soon Young; Chun, Kyung Ju; Kil, Hong Kwon; Jung, Narae; Shin, Hyun-Ah; Jang, Jeon Yeob; Choi, Hyo Geun; Oh, Kyoung-Ho; Kim, Min-Su",Oncol Lett,526,1

Bevezetés: A SARS-CoV-2-világjárvány terjedése drasztikus változásokat okozott a mindennapi betegellátásban, amelyek érintették a szervadományozás és -átültetés területét is, így csökkent az élő és az elhunyt donorokból történő donációk és transzplantációk száma világszerte. Az esetszám csökkenése mellett a transzplantált és egyben immunszupprimált betegek védelme érdekében további biztonsági intézkedéseket kellett bevezetni. Módszer: A vizsgálat célja a COVID-19-járvány hazai donációs és transzplantációs aktivitásra gyakorolt hatásának kimutatása volt 2020-ban, a megelőző évvel történő összehasonlításban.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in drastic changes in day-to-day patient care, which has also affected the field of organ donation and transplantation, thus reducing the number of donations and transplants from living and deceased donors worldwide. In addition to the reduction in the number of cases, additional safety measures had to be introduced to protect transplanted and implicatively immunosuppressed patients. METHOD The aim of the study was to demonstrate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on domestic donation and transplantation activity in 2020, compared to the previous year. We also compared the Hungarian results with the data of the Eurotransplant and the European Union member states. RESULTS In terms of population-weighted, registered COVID-19 infection and mortality, we did not find a significant difference in Hungary in 2020 compared to the Eurotransplant member states. The national organ donation potential did not diminish in the period under review, however, the number of brain-dead organ donors decreased by 38.33% in Hungary, while in the Eurotransplant it did by 8.64% on average and in 23 reporting European countries by 17.55%. The number of organ transplants from the deceased decreased by 29.27%, especially regarding heart and liver transplants. Both the number and the proportion of organs received from abroad increased by 21.13% and 12.34%, respectively. The number of living donor kidney transplants did not change. In 2020, 25% fewer new patients were registered than in 2019 and the mortality on waiting list increased by 28% compared to the previous year, especially among those waiting for a kidney transplant. CONCLUSION The national organ transplantation program is safe: donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 transmission did not occur in Hungary. In addition to the organ donation potential and the COVID-19 pandemic, organ donation and transplantation activity decreased significantly in Hungary from March 2020 until the end of the year. Transient and smaller reductions in organ donation rates have been reported in most European countries. The number of organ transplants did not decrease as much as the number of donors, because more donor organs arrived in Hungary from the Eurotransplant than we sent abroad.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 90 patients with brain metastases from ALK-rearranged NSCLC were identified from six institutions; 84 of 90 patients received radiotherapy to the brain (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] or whole-brain radiotherapy [WBRT]), and 86 of 90 received tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Estimates for overall (OS) and intracranial progression-free survival were determined and clinical prognostic factors were identified by Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS Median OS after development of brain metastases was 49.5 months (95% CI, 29.0 months to not reached), and median intracranial progression-free survival was 11.9 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 18.2 months). Forty-five percent of patients with follow-up had progressive brain metastases at death, and repeated interventions for brain metastases were common. Absence of extracranial metastases, Karnofsky performance score ≥ 90, and no history of TKIs before development of brain metastases were associated with improved survival (P = .003, < .001, and < .001, respectively), whereas a single brain metastasis or initial treatment with SRS versus WBRT were not (P = .633 and .666, respectively). Prognostic factors significant by multivariable analysis were used to describe four patient groups with 2-year OS estimates of 33%, 59%, 76%, and 100%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSION Patients with brain metastases from ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with radiotherapy (SRS and/or WBRT) and TKIs have prolonged survival, suggesting that interventions to control intracranial disease are critical. The refinement of prognosis for this molecular subtype of NSCLC identifies a population of patients likely to benefit from first-line SRS, close CNS observation, and treatment of emergent CNS disease.","Johung, Kimberly L; Yeh, Norman; Desai, Neil B; Williams, Terence M; Lautenschlaeger, Tim; Arvold, Nils D; Ning, Matthew S; Attia, Albert; Lovly, Christine M; Goldberg, Sarah; Beal, Kathryn; Yu, James B; Kavanagh, Brian D; Chiang, Veronica L; Camidge, D Ross; Contessa, Joseph N",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,526,20

Lead exposure is a serious hazard that can affect the cognitive and behavior development. People can be exposed to Pb through occupational and environmental sources. Fingerprinting based on stable Pb isotopes in environmental media is often used to trace natural and anthropogenic sources but is rarely paired with blood data. The objective of this study was to determine the main factors associated with high Blood Lead Levels (BLL). Soil, manioc tubers, food bowls, beverages, wild games, lead pellets and children blood were sampled in small villages along the Oyapock River. children BLL ranged between 5.7 and 35 µg dL-1, all exceeding 5 µg dL-1, the reference value proposed in epidemiologic studies for lead poisoning. Among the different dietary sources, manioc tubers and large game contained elevated Pb concentrations while manioc-based dishes were diluted. The isotopes ratios (207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb) of children blood overlapped these of lead shots and meals. These first results confirm for the first time, the diary consumption of manioc-based food as the main contributor to Amerindian children's BLL in French Guiana, but don't exclude the occasional exposure to lead bullets by hunting activities. This is a specific health concern, since previous studies have shown that these same villagers present high levels of mercury (Hg).

METHODS Nine patients who sustained fingertip injuries were treated with one-stage Integra coverage. In all cases, Integra was placed directly on bone. Static two-point discrimination and the Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test (SWMFT) were used to determine the sensations of the affected and opposite unaffected digit. The QuickDASH, Cold Intolerance Symptom Severity (CISS), visual analog scale (VAS), and a 0-10-point pain scale were administered to assess patient function, satisfaction, and pain levels. RESULTS The mean age was 53.1 years (39-61). There were 8 males and 1 female. The average area covered was 2.3 cm(2) (1.0-3.2). The mean follow-up duration was 16 months (8-46). The median QuickDASH, CISS score, VAS patient satisfaction, and 0-10 pain score were 9.1 (2.3-40.9), 18 (4-30), 10 (most satisfied) (7-10), and 0 (0-3), respectively. Five patients were evaluated for their digital sensory perception. The mean static two-point discrimination was 9.6 mm for the affected digit and 4.6 mm for the opposite unaffected digit. The median SWMFT was 4.31 for the affected digit and 3.61 for the opposite unaffected digit. CONCLUSION For small soft tissue and bone defects involving the fingertip, the use of Integra without further skin grafting appears to be effective, avoids the morbidity of the donor site, and avoids a second surgery. Despite mild sensory deficits, patients were satisfied with the results and fully functional during short-term follow-up.","Jacoby, Sidney M; Bachoura, Abdo; Chen, Neal C; Shin, Eon K; Katolik, Leonid I",Hand,526,1

The variations are captured from four perspectives: passenger throughput, network connectivity, airport centrality, and international connections. Further, this work also considers both global and local connectivity-based metrics for the network analysis. Supported by real-world data, we show that the performance of the WATN has experienced a dynamic pattern of decline and recovery in 2020. Interestingly, the network metrics undergo tremendous variations in a very short period after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, with the number of flights and connections dropping by more than 40% within only the first four weeks. Intuitively, the passenger throughput’s changing rate is highly correlated to confirmed cases’ growth rate during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the air transport response to the pandemic condition is very diverse among different countries. The major airports in the WATN fluctuate gradually in different pandemic stages, which is further influenced by the domestic pandemic situation that restricts airport operations. Also, the restoration speed of local connectivity is faster than that of global connectivity because the recovery of international aviation is geographically dependent on different policies of travel restriction, conditional openings, and the number of COVID-19 cases. The analysis deepens our understanding to formulate bilateral policies for pandemic-induced ATN design and management.","Li, Siping Zhou Yaoming Kundu Tanmoy Sheu Jiuh-Biing",Transport Policy,526,22

In Aotearoa New Zealand, there are long-standing ethnic inequalities in cervical-cancer screening, incidence, and mortality; particularly for indigenous M[a]ori women, as well as Pacific, and Asian women. Methods: We invited never- and markedly under-screened ([≥]5 years overdue) 30-69-year-old M[a]ori, Pacific, and Asian women to participate in an open-label, three-arm, community-based, randomised controlled trial, with a nested sub-study. We aimed to assess whether two specific invitation methods for self-sampling improved screening participation over usual care among the least medically served populations. Women were individually randomised 3:3:1 to: clinic-based self-sampling (CLINIC: invited to take a self-sample at their usual general practice); home-based self-sampling (HOME: mailed a kit and invited to take a self-sample at home); and usual care (USUAL: invited to attend a clinic for collection of a standard cytology sample). Neither participants nor research staff could be blinded to the intervention. In a subset of general practices, women who did not participate within three months of invitation were opportunistically invited to take a self-sample, either next time they attended a clinic or by mail. Findings: We randomised 3,553 women: 1,574 to CLINIC, 1,467 to HOME, and 512 to USUAL. Participation was highest in HOME (14.6% among M[a]ori, 8.8% among Pacific, and 18.5% among Asian) with CLINIC (7.0%, 5.3% and 6.9%, respectively) and USUAL (2.0%, 1.7% and 4.5%, respectively) being lower. In fully adjusted models, participation was statistically significantly more likely in HOME than USUAL: M[a]ori OR=9.7, (95%CI 3.0-31.5); Pacific OR=6.0 (1.8-19.5); and Asian OR=5.1 (2.4-10.9). There were no adverse outcomes reported. After three months, 2,780 non-responding women were invited to participate in a non-randomised, opportunistic, follow-on substudy. After 6 months,192 (6.9%) additional women had taken a self-sample. Interpretation: Using recruitment methods that mimic usual practice, we provide critical evidence that self-sampling increases screening among the groups of women (never and under-screened) who experience the most barriers in Aotearoa New Zealand, although the absolute level of participation through this population approach was modest. Follow-up for most women was routine but a small proportion required intensive support.","Brewer, N.; Bartholomew, K.; Grant, J.; Maxwell, A.; McPherson, G.; Wihongi, H.; Bromhead, C.; Scott, N.; Crengle, S.; Foliaki, S.; Cunningham, C.; Douwes, J.; Potter, J.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey yielded a sample of 1,573 respondents from 99 countries. Independent samples t-test, Analysis of variance (ANOVA), cluster, factor and regression analyses were used. Findings: Respondents expected to pay less for robot-delivered services than human-delivered services. Two clusters were identified: one cluster willing to pay nearly the same price for robotic services as for human-delivered services, whilst the other expected deep discounts for robotic services. The willingness-to-pay was positively associated with the attitudes towards robots in tourism, robotic service experience expectations, men and household size. It was negatively associated to travel frequency, age and education. Research limitations/implications: The paper’s main limitation is its exploratory nature and the use of a hypothetical scenario in measuring respondents’ willingness to pay. The data were gathered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and do not reflect the potential changes in perceptions of robots due to the pandemic. Practical implications: Practitioners need to focus on improving the attitudes towards robots in tourism because they are strongly and positively related to the willingness to pay. The marketing messages need to form positive expectations about robotic services.

Furthermore, geographic distributions of expected clinical severity of COVID-19 may be closely linked to prior history of respiratory diseases and changes in humidity, temperature, and air quality. In this context, we postulate that by tracking topological features of atmospheric conditions over time, we can provide a quantifiable structural distribution of atmospheric changes that are likely to be related to COVID-19 dynamics. As such, we apply the machinery of persistence homology on time series of graphs to extract topological signatures and to follow geographical changes in relative humidity and temperature. We develop an integrative machine learning framework named Topological Lifespan LSTM (TLife-LSTM) and test its predictive capabilities on forecasting the dynamics of SARS-CoV2 cases.

They apply this method to the well-documented cases of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States and France. In the United States (using data for 1972-2002), the authors observed strong short-range correlations between several states and their immediate neighbors, as well as robust long-range spreading patterns resulting from large domestic air-traffic flows. The stability of these results over time allowed the authors to draw conclusions about the possible impact of travel restrictions on epidemic spread. The authors also applied this method to the case of France (1984-2004) and found that on the regional scale, there was no transportation mode that clearly dominated disease spread.

As of 20 March 2020, cases have been reported in 166 countries/regions, including cases of human-to-human transmission around the world. The proportions of this epidemics is probably one of the largest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. According to the current epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number, R_0 ~ 2.3, number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals, as well as an asymptomatic period (up to 14 days) in which infectious individuals are undetectable without further analysis, pave the way for a major crisis of the national health capacity systems. Recent scientific reports have pointed out that the detected cases of COVID19 at young ages is strikingly short and that lethality is concentrated at large ages. Here we adapt a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) metapopulation mobility model to capture the spread of COVID-19. We propose a model that stratifies the population by ages, and account for the different incidences of the disease at each strata. The model is used to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population through time, permitting investigation of control measures. The model is applied to the current epidemic in Spain, using the estimates of the epidemiological parameters and the mobility and demographic census data of the national institute of statistics (INE). The results indicate that the peak of incidence will happen in the first half of April 2020 in absence of mobility restrictions. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and can be adapted to precise mobility restrictions at the level of municipalities. The current estimates largely compromises the Spanish health capacity system, in particular that for intensive care units, from the end of March. However, the model allows for the scrutiny of containment measures that can be used for health authorities to forecast with accuracy their impact in prevalence of COVID--19. Here we show by testing different epidemic containment scenarios that we urge to enforce total lockdown to avoid a massive collapse of the Spanish national health system.","Arenas, Alex; Cota, Wesley; Gomez-Gardenes, Jesus; Gómez, Sergio; Granell, Clara; Matamalas, Joan T.; Soriano-Panos, David; Steinegger, Benjamin",,526,11

Single-cell profiling methods enable the investigation of cell population distributions and transcriptional changes along the airways. Methods We have explored cellular heterogeneity of the human airway epithelium in 10 healthy living volunteers by single-cell RNA profiling. 77,969 cells were collected by bronchoscopy at 35 distinct locations, from the nose to the 12th division of the airway tree. Results The resulting atlas is composed of a high percentage of epithelial cells (89.1%), but also immune (6.2%) and stromal (4.7%) cells with peculiar cellular proportions in different sites of the airways. It reveals differential gene expression between identical cell types (suprabasal, secretory, and multiciliated cells) from the nose (MUC4, PI3, SIX3) and tracheobronchial (SCGB1A1, TFF3) airways. By contrast, cell-type specific gene expression was stable across all tracheobronchial samples. Our atlas improves the description of ionocytes, pulmonary neuro-endocrine (PNEC) and brush cells, which are likely derived from a common population of precursor cells.

Evolutionary advancements in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in Deep Learning, have enabled it to become one of the most promising technologies for solving problems related to the current pandemic and other epidemics in the past. This study presents a Concept Mapping based Research Framework, abbreviated as DL-CoTAUM, to review the usage of Deep Learning Techniques for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic using multiple steps. Through the first step, different concepts around Deep Learning are presented. Multiple deep learning techniques using the basic concepts are studied through the second step. In the next step, various epidemics from the past are learned from the Deep Learning perspective. In the fourth step, multiple use-cases for COVID-19 management are covered up, like trend forecasting, virus and drug discovery, patient diagnosis, clinical analysis, and monitoring for maintaining social distancing & face masks. The last step presents the various evaluation parameters available for analyzing the modeling techniques’ performance under Deep Learning. In this review study, it was found that Deep Learning is gaining importance for various applications under COVID-19 management. Techniques like LSTM, CNN, RNN, and GANs were found to be prominently used modeling techniques for growth curve fitting and image analysis. Accuracies of more than 90% have been reported for Deep Learning techniques in COVID-19 use-cases, which is higher than the other baseline methods. This study will be useful for researchers, academicians, and practitioners in Epidemiological Modeling and Image Processing.

One of the impacts of the advancement of e-commerce is the emergence of many online-based marketplaces or so-called e-marketplaces. However, a lot of these online marketplaces sell 90% imported products. In addition, the outbreak of Covid-19 in Indonesia has prompted the government to establish several policies that have significantly reduced MSME performance by up to 70-100%. This study aimed to provide an empirical analysis of the influence of factors based on the Technology of Acceptance Model (TAM) approach, namely e-marketplace self-efficacy, complexity, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, behavioral intention to use, and actual technology use in e-marketplaces. The sample consisted of MSMEs in East Java, especially those engaged in the food and beverage industry sector with ready-to-eat processed food products whose business activities use the Shopee e-marketplace application platform. This is an online shopping marketplace focused on mobile platforms. There were 150 respondents. The Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used. E-marketplace self-efficacy, complexity, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, behavioral intention to use, and actual technology use in e-marketplaces all had positive effects on each other. This showed that a system that offers convenience will improve behavior, habits, and performance for MSMEs in using e-marketplace activities.

However, in recent times, it has become evident that public health is a vital factor influencing demand and in turn oil price. In US, oil price reached a negative value for the first time in history by April 2020. Personnel and public health have been shown to have profound effect on operational expenditure (OPEX) of organizations, this in turn affecting the profitability of such organizations. Extra measures involving cost, had to be taken by organizations all over the world to ensure health and safety of their personnel in their sites. In Nigeria, effect of covid-19 measures for companies were, shut in of production, declaration of force majeure on ongoing contracts, slashing of costs, suspension on evaluation of future projects, profile assets for sale, remote/tele working, etc. Huge costs were also incurred as a part of corporate social responsibility for host communities/states where they operate. The consequential outcome is that there are reports of lower than planned profitability and liquidity positions. This paper examines action taken during this covid crisis and their impact on the financial status of their organizations. Using a quantitative and descriptive research design, an online survey has been used to gather information from respondents from different oil and gas companies of cost incurred by them. Secondary data was also obtained from quarterly reports of some companies of the oil majors to show their profitability comparing Q1-Q4 of 2019 and 2020.

Numerous variants have emerged in SARS-CoV-2 that are currently posing a serious challenge to the global vaccination effort and COVID-19 management. The evolutionary dynamics of this virus are only beginning to be explored. In this work, we have analysed 1.79 million spike glycoprotein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the virus is fine-tuning the spike with numerous amino acid insertions and deletions (indels). Indels seem to have a selective advantage as the proportions of sequences with indels were steadily increasing over time, currently at over 89%, with similar trends across countries/variants. There were as many as 420 unique indel positions and 447 unique combinations of indels. Despite their high frequency, indels resulted in only minimal alteration, including both gain and loss, of N-glycosylation sites. As indels and point mutations are positively correlated and sequences with indels have significantly more point mutations, they have implications in the context of evolutionary dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.","Prasad Rao, R.

Among them, a central role has been attributed to long noncoding (lnc)RNAs, more than 200 nucleotides in length, which are also crucially involved in cancer and autoimmunity. LncRNAs epigenetically control the transcription of genes presiding over cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis, by directly or indirectly binding cellular or foreign nucleic acids, including viral genomes. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate in silico the presence of a nucleotide sequence complementarity between the RNA genome of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human ncRNA genes and to analyze any associations between SARS-CoV-2 gene-matching ncRNAs and human diseases. Methods: The FASTA sequence of each of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 genes (ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10, S, E, M, N) was retrieved from NCBI.nlm.nih.gov/gene (reference sequence NC-045512.2). The ensembl.org library for human ncRNA genes was interrogated for any base-pair match and detected human ncRNAs analyzed for their functional activity. Finally, the associations between ncRNAs and human diseases were searched on GWAS databases (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas and https://www.genecards.org). Results: A total of 252 matches between SARS-CoV-2 genes and human ncRNAs were recorded (ORF1ab: 28;ORF3a: 9;ORF6: 50;ORF7a: 31;ORF7b: 16;ORF8: 23;ORF10: 5;S: 24;E: 17;M: 32;N: 17). With the exception of two small nuclear RNAs (RNVU1-4 and RNU4-74P corresponding to ORF6 and ORF10, respectively), all of them were lncRNAs, mostly expressed in testis and central nervous system under physiological conditions. Percentage of alignment ranged from 91.30% to 100%, with a mean nucleotide alignment length of 17.5±2.4. Polymorphic variants of these transcripts have mostly been reported in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer and dysmetabolism. Of note, we found 13 and 15 complementarities with lncRNAs associated with immune-mediated diseases Table 1. and immunological pathways (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-12R, IL-13, IL-17, M-CSF, CXCL-10, TRAIL-R2 and IgG glycosylation), respectively. Conclusion: This pivotal study shows that SARS-CoV-2 genes contain complementary sequences to human ncRNAs in turn associated with several diseases, including autoimmunity. The biological effects of this interaction remain to be elucidated.","Talotta, R.; Bahrami, S.; Laska, M. J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,526,1

However, the changes in the structure of the teachers' personality were not limited only to informational and methodological competences. The relevance of this research is to test the hypothesis about the emergence of a new type of teacher's pedagogical culture, characterized by a special awareness of the humanistic and social role of a teacher in the course of e-learning. The aim is to study the content of a new type of pedagogical culture, as well as its structural components performed by the competences, the presence of which was actualized during the pandemic. The theoretical research methods (study and analysis of scientific publications on the teachers' competences, especially in demand during the pandemic, synthesis, systematization, comparison, etc.) and empirical methods (conversation, questioning, observation) were used in the study. The conducted empirical research, as well as the analysis of domestic and foreign publications show that, despite a short-term nature of remote learning, the transformations in pedagogical culture have the character of a qualitative leap and are global in nature, as they have affected the teachers in all countries. This allows us to declare the emergence of a new type of pedagogical culture, namely the “electronic” pedagogical culture of a higher school teacher, which is a natural result of the development of “basic” culture and is characterized by a change in priorities in the structure and in the content of its constituent blocks of competences. The article compares real changes in the structure of a teacher's personality with forecasts regarding the “competences of the future”, as well as with the “information pedagogical culture”, which is believed to have arisen in the process of information technologies penetration into the educational process. The scientific novelty of the research consists in substantiating the possibility of transforming the “basic” pedagogical culture of the teacher under the influence of external and internal factors. In theoretical terms, the study expands the scientific understanding of the essence of the teacher's pedagogical culture, the patterns of its development and transformation, as well as its competence-based structural organization. © 2021 Moscow Polytechnic University.

Methods Anti-spike RBD antibody titers, ACE2 competition and virus neutralizing activities were longitudinally assessed in 151 healthcare workers and older adults (overall aged 24-98 years) up to three months after vaccination. Results Older adults exhibited lower antibody responses after one and two vaccine doses for all measures. In multivariable analyses correcting for sociodemographic, chronic health and vaccine-related variables, age remained independently associated with all response outcomes. The number of chronic health conditions was additionally associated with lower binding antibody responses after two doses, and male sex with lower ACE2 competition activity after one dose. Responses waned universally at three months after the second dose, but binding antibodies, ACE2 competition and neutralizing activities remained significantly lower with age. Older adults also displayed reduced ability to block ACE2 binding by the Delta variant. Conclusions The humoral immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is significantly weaker with age, and universally wanes over time. This will likely reduce antibody-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant as the pandemic progresses.

Many patients exhibit cognitive deficits, particularly during disease flare. The connection between colonic inflammation and neuroinflammation remains unclear and characterization of the neuroinflammatory phenotype in the brain during colitis is ill-defined. Methods Transgenic mice expressing a bioluminescent reporter of active caspase-1 were treated with 2% Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) for 7 days to induce acute colitis, and colonic, systemic and neuroinflammation were assessed. In some experiments, mice were prophylactically treated with paquinimod (ABR-215757) to inhibit S100A9 inflammatory signaling. As a positive control for peripheral-induced neuroinflammation, mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Colonic, systemic and brain inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured by cytokine bead array (CBA) and Proteome profiler mouse cytokine array. Bioluminescence was quantified in the brain and caspase activation was confirmed by immunoblot. Immune cell infiltration into the CNS was measured by flow cytometry, while light sheet microscopy was used to monitor changes in resident microglia localization in intact brains during DSS or LPS-induced neuroinflammation. RNA sequencing was performed to identify transcriptomic changes occurring in the CNS of DSS-treated mice. Expression of inflammatory biomarkers were quantified in the brain and serum by qRT-PCR, ELISA and WB. Results DSS-treated mice exhibited clinical hallmarks of colitis, including weight loss, colonic shortening and inflammation in the colon. We also detected a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines in the serum and brain, as well as caspase and microglia activation in the brain of mice with ongoing colitis. RNA sequencing of brains isolated from DSS-treated mice revealed differential expression of genes involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This inflammatory phenotype was similar to the signature detected in LPS-treated mice, albeit less robust and transient, as inflammatory gene expression returned to baseline following cessation of DSS. Pharmacological inhibition of S100A9, one of the transcripts identified by RNA sequencing, attenuated colitis severity and systemic and neuroinflammation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that local inflammation in the colon drives systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, and this can be ameliorated by inhibition of the S100 alarmin, S100A9.","Talley, Sarah; Valiauga, Rasa; Anderson, Lillian; Cannon, Abigail R.; Choudhry, Mashkoor A.; Campbell, Edward M.",bioRxiv,526,25

The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of COVID-19 infection among immunized versus non-immunized COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. Method A prospective observational cohort study, including all COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit between January 1st, 2021 and June 30th, 2021 were eligible for inclusion. A comparison of severity upon hospitalization of immunized versus non-immunized patients on a 7-level ordinal scale was conducted, using ordinal logistic regression. Results 592 patients were enrolled, 524 (88.5%) non-immunized, 63 (10.6%) partially immunized, and 5 (0.9%) fully immunized, partially and fully immunized patients were grouped together. Majority of immunized patients (86.7%) were symptomatic before 21 days of immunization. Non-immunized group had fewer patients in the lower severity categories, while more patients in the higher severity categories compared to immunized group. At least one dose of immunization was associated with reduction of odds of moving up severity scale (OR = 0.2 [95% CI: 0.15–0.4]; p < 0.001) in a well fitted ordinal logistic regression model. At least one dose of immunization was associated with lower adjusted odds of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR = 0.45 [95% CI: 0.23–0.89]; p = 0.02). Non-immunized group had higher mortality rate (43.9% versus 29.4% [95% CI: 1.5 to 25.8]; p = 0.02). Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were non-immunized, most of the partially immunized patients got infected before immunity could develop, and fully immunized patients were likely non-responders. At least one dose of immunization significantly decreases severity of the disease across all ordinal severity categories, and is significantly associated with lower 30 day all-cause mortality.

Older women showed poorer mental health indicators, were more likely to adhere to home isolation and believe in the effectiveness of this measure, and felt more self-confident to self-isolate at home. Stronger perceived vulnerability to Covid-19 and awareness of the gravity of the disease were related to poorer mental health indicators among women.

The aim of this research is to examine the impact of coronavirus anxiety, academic self-sufficiency and life satisfaction levels of students in the faculty of sports sciences over their attitudes towards online learning. Material and Methods A total of 379 sports science faculty students voluntarily participated for the cross-sectional data collection. A simple random sampling method was used in the selection of students from four universities in the Eastern Anatolian region, which make up the universe of the study. Data were collected electronically and analysed by IBM SPSS and AMOS statistical package program. Results: The structural equity model results revealed that academic self-sufficiency and life satisfaction are positive predictors of online learning attitudes and negative predictors of coronavirus anxiety. Online learning attitude was found to be positively correlated with other variables other than coronavirus anxiety. In addition, it has been determined that the scale total scores are slightly above average, except for coronavirus anxiety. Conclusions: The results have been discussed in terms of their meaning for the environment of physical education. In this research, which created a model for understanding online learning attitudes in students of the faculty of sports sciences, it was understood that coronavirus anxiety has a statistically significant effect on online learning attitudes while academic self-sufficiency and life satisfaction do not have a statistically significant effect.

In this work, we investigate the possible causes. If we think of TV robots (robotic cameras, dollys) as social robots, their level of adoption in the industry would depend on how Social they are, which we can improve through positive perception and an effective Human-Robot Interaction framework. To validate this, we interviewed a crew of camera operators about TV robots. 60% reported negative feelings;fears of loss of jobs and relevance, but 60% wanted to learn more. Based on that, we developed an Internet of Things (IoT)- enabled Robotic Camera Dolly (IRCD) for the operators, with a companion interview/guidance protocol;the Pre and Post Interview Protocol, to monitor their reactions. Next, we deployed the IRCD at their TV station, where they completed a set of filming tasks using the IRCD. There was a jump in perception, with 60% positive feelings, 95% wanting to learn more, and 95% successfully completing their robot-powered filming tasks. Also, the IRCD registered a 0.15s response time and 5s video delay time, well within industry limits. These results show that positive perception and effective HRI could stimulate the adoption of Robotics in the TV Film industry.

Distance correlation characterizes independence: it is zero if and only if the random vectors are independent. The notion of covariance with respect to a stochastic process is introduced, and it is shown that population distance covariance coincides with the covariance with respect to Brownian motion; thus, both can be called Brownian distance covariance. In the bivariate case, Brownian covariance is the natural extension of product-moment covariance, as we obtain Pearson product-moment covariance by replacing the Brownian motion in the definition with identity.

SCD patients are commonly affected by pulmonary complications such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE) and pneumonia that contribute significantly to mortality risks. Aim: The study was aimed at showing the impact of SARS-COV viral pandemic on SCD patients. Presentation of Case: A 42-year-old male known sickle cell disease patient, who presented with a 5 days' history of chest pain and difficulty in breathing with a pain score of 8/10. Pain was said to be localized and, subside on the ingestion of analgesics (Tab DF118/60mg and PCM 1000mg) with no known aggravating factor, but there was associated history of difficulty in breathing. The patient was being managed as a case of vaso-occlusive crises R/O acute chest syndrome, and was commenced on adequate hydration, oxygen saturation was between 95-85%. On examination, respiratory rate was 20 cycles per minute, pulse rate -96 beats/minute, BP and chest examination were essentially normal. CBC showed the Packed Cell Volume of 31%, White Blood Cells 15.04 x 109/L, Neutrophils 7.51x10(3)/mu L Lymphocyte 6.50 x10(3)/mu L, Monocyte 0.76 x10(3)/mu L Eosinophils 0.20x10(3)/mu L, Basophils 0.05x10(3)/mu L, Platelet 358. The electrolytes (Na-135 mmol/L, K 3.5mmol/L, HCO3-20), urea -10 mmol/L and creatinine (88mmol/L) were normal, the chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly but the lung fields were clear. The patient was administered ceftriaxone (prophylactic antibiotics - 1 g daily). The patient tested positive to COVID-19 and was immediately transferred to the isolation centre for proper management. He was commenced on oral medication, azithromycin, dexamethasone, ivermectine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, vitamin C, clexane and the analgesic was changed to paracetamol and dihydrocodeine to alternate 3 hourly with accordance to the national guidelines. In addition, he was administered subcutaneous enoxaparin due to the hypercoagulability state of SCD. The patient's health status improved within 24hours of commencement of the above medications and remained stable all through the period of isolation and a repeat covid-19 test was done 15 days of admission using and reverse transcriptase PCR and was discharged home according to the National protocol. Conclusion: Studies and clinical trials are essential to evaluate effective diagnostic and management options for SCD patients and other high-risk conditions like diabetes hypertension, cancer patients and so on that are associated with fatal complications when infected with COVID19 and similar diseases.","Kingsley, A.; Betta, E.

Detailed compositional and lineage analysis of long read IGH repertoire sequencing, combining examples of pandemic, epidemic and endemic viral infections with control and vaccination samples, demonstrates general responses including increased use of IGHV4-39 in both EBOV and COVID-19 infection cohorts. We also show unique characteristics absent in RSV infection or yellow fever vaccine samples: EBOV survivors show unprecedented high levels of class switching events while COVID-19 repertoires from acute disease appear underdeveloped. Despite the high levels of clonal expansion in COVID-19 IgG1 repertoires there is a striking lack of evidence of germinal centre mutation and selection. Given the differences in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality with age, it is also pertinent that we find significant differences in repertoire characteristics between young and old patients.

Upon co-infection with infectious standard virus (STV), DIPs interfere with STV replication through competitive inhibition. Thus, DIPs are proposed as potent antivirals for treatment of the influenza disease. To select corresponding candidates, we studied de novo generation of DIPs and propagation competition between different defective interfering (DI) vRNAs in a STV co-infection scenario in cell culture. A small-scale two-stage cultivation system that allows long-term semi-continuous propagation of IAV and its DIPs was used. Strong periodic oscillations in virus titers were observed due to the dynamic interaction of DIPs and STVs. Using next-generation sequencing, we detected a predominant formation and accumulation of DI vRNAs on the polymerase-encoding segments. Short DI vRNAs accumulated to higher fractions than longer ones, indicating a replication advantage. Yet, a sweet spot of fragment length was observed. Some DI vRNAs showed breaking points in a specific part of their bundling signal (belonging to the packaging signal), suggesting its dispensability for DI vRNA propagation. Over a total cultivation time of 21 days, several individual DI vRNAs accumulated to high fractions, while others decreased. Using reverse genetics for IAV, purely clonal DIPs derived from highly replicating DI vRNAs were generated. We confirm that these DIPs exhibit a superior in vitro interfering efficacy than DIPs derived from lowly accumulated DI vRNAs and suggest promising candidates for efficacious antiviral treatment. Importance Defective interfering particles (DIPs) emerge naturally during viral infection and typically show an internal deletion in the viral genome. Thus, DIPs are propagation-incompetent. Previous research suggests DIPs as potent antiviral compounds for many different virus families due to their ability to interfere with virus replication by competitive inhibition. For instance, the administration of influenza A virus (IAV) DIPs resulted in a rescue of mice from an otherwise lethal IAV dose. Moreover, no apparent toxic effects were observed when only DIPs were administered to mice and ferrets. IAV DIPs show antiviral activity against many different IAV strains, including pandemic and highly pathogenic avian strains, and even against non-homologous viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, by stimulation of innate immunity. Here, we used a cultivation/infection system, which exerted selection pressure toward accumulation of highly competitive IAV DIPs. These DIPs showed a superior interfering efficacy in vitro, and we suggest them for effective antiviral therapy.","Pelz, Lars; Rüdiger, Daniel; Dogra, Tanya; Alnaji, Fadi G.; Genzel, Yvonne; Brooke, Christopher B.; Kupke, Sascha Y.; Reichl, Udo",bioRxiv,526,13

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the concordance of MammaPrint results (70-gene signature) and BluePrint results (80-gene signature) between core needle biopsies (CNB) and surgical resection (SR) specimens using prospectively collected matched tissues from patients enrolled in the FLEX trial (NCT03053193). Methods: We analyzed 113 matched CNB and SR tumor specimens from women with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in the FLEX trial. Each patient enrolled in the trial receives a MammaPrint recurrence risk classification test with or without BluePrint molecular subtyping. Concordance of MammaPrint is reported using overall percentage agreement, positive predictive value (PPV, High Risk), negative predictive value (NPV, Low Risk), and Cohens kappa coefficient. Additionally, correlations between sample types are reported using Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: We found good concordance for MammaPrint results between CNB and SR tumor samples (90.3%, k = 0.803), with a 95.1% NPV and 84.6% PPV. There was also a strong correlation of MammaPrint indices between CNB and SR specimens (r = 0.94). In addition to our primary objective, we determined the concordance of BluePrint subtyping in the matched tumor samples, and found excellent concordance (98.2%) and strong correlation of BluePrint scores within each subtype. Conclusion: CNB samples demonstrated overall high concordance with paired SR samples for MammaPrint risk classification, ensuring that physicians are provided with accurate prognostic information for therapy decisions based on testing of core biopsy tissue. Further, BluePrint molecular subtyping also had good concordance between the sample types, outperforming concordance rates based on traditional IHC based classification. Overall, with an increase in neoadjuvant therapy, physicans and patients can be assured that MammaPrint and BluePrint provide reliable results that guide timely and appropriate therapies using preoperative CNB specimens.","Crozier, J.

In this study, it was aimed to raise awareness by determining the fear of COVID-19, medical prophylaxis, isolation and general approaches of the anesthesiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic process. Method: Faculty members, specialist and residents, specialists working in the field of anesthesia all over Turkey were included in the study. The link of the questionnaire prepared including demographic data, COVID-19 fear scale, perceived fear level and medical prophylaxis they used was sent online to anesthetists via e-mail and WhatsApp. Results: Two hundred and twenty-seven participants responded to the questionnaire and the answers of the respondents were analyzed. While 19% of the participants indicated that they had met with COVID-19 positive or suspected patients every day, and 10.2% of them stated that they never had contact with them. Fear of Covid-19 was statistically significantly higher in women, specialists and participants with chronic diseases (p=0.003, p=0.024 and p=0.014, respectively). Anesthetists working in the COVID 19 intensive care unit at the beginning of the pandemic had a higher level of perceived fear (p=0.006). Covid-19 scores of anesthetists who changed their smoking habits were found to be statistically significantly higher (p&lt;0.001). About half of the anesthetists were taking vitamin supplements for prophylaxis, while one fourth were using hydroxychloroquine. Conclusion: As a result of these findings, it is seen that the fear of Covid-19, in anesthetists, causes notable psychological effects and need for prophylaxis. We hope that these data will raise awareness in the near and distant future to protect the mental health of anesthetists and to reduce their fears by psychological support.","Özgünay, Ş E.; Akça, F.; Karasu, D.; Eminoğlu, Ş Gamlı M.",Anestezi Dergisi,526,23

Cancer services have faced challenges as a result of COVID-19, including suspension of screening and diagnostic services;delays in diagnosis leading to higher mortality rates;cancellation/deferral of life-saving treatments;changes in treatment regimens and suspension of vital research. For organisations that provide support to cancer patients, declining income, the need to reduce staff and move to virtual working practices has put extra strain while demand for support due to the pandemic has increased. Methods: 5 coalitions surveyed their member organisations. A number of coalitions consulted their members by individual surveys or consultations. Results: A survey of 157 organisations representing advanced breast, bladder, lymphoma, ovarian and pancreatic cancer patient groups from 56 countries found that 57% experienced an average increase of 44% in patient calls and emails. 45% reported that their future viability may be under threat because of the impact of COVID-19 on income. Examples of good practice were reported where healthcare systems have acted to protect patients and cancer services. These include the introduction of COVID-free centres, separation of cancer patients from those who may have COVID-19, and the introduction of virtual and telemedicine services. Organisations have also introduced new ways of working including virtual psychological support services and appbased support groups. These best practices should form part of a global plan of action for future health crisis. Conclusions: Collaboration between patient advocacy organisations, governments and health services is needed to ensure the ground lost to the COVID-19 pandemic is regained. Action is required to restore cancer services safely and effectively without delay. Additional resources for organisations that support cancer patients are required to ensure that they continue to provide vital services.

We recently reported that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (S1) induces pro-inflammatory responses by activating toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in macrophages. ETAS®50, a standardized extract of Asparagus officinalis stem, is a unique functional food that elicits anti-photoaging effects by suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling in hydrogen peroxide- and ultraviolet B-exposed skin fibroblasts. To elucidate its potential in preventing excessive inflammation in COVID-19, we examined the effects of ETAS®50 on pro-inflammatory responses in S1-stimulated murine peritoneal exudate macrophages. Co-treatment of the cells with ETAS®50 significantly attenuated S1-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 in a concentration-dependent manner without reducing cell viability. ETAS®50 also markedly suppressed the S1-induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-1β. However, among the TLR4 signaling proteins, ETAS®50 did not affect the degradation of inhibitor κBα, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 subunit, and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase p54 subunit after S1 exposure. In contrast, ETAS®50 significantly suppressed S1-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt. Attenuation of S1-induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-1β by the MAPK kinase inhibitor U0126 was greater than that by the Akt inhibitor perifosine, and the effects were potentiated by simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors. These results suggest that ETAS®50 attenuates S1-induced IL-6 and IL-1β production by suppressing p44/42 MAPK and Akt signaling in macrophages. Therefore, ETAS®50 may be beneficial in regulating excessive inflammation in patients with COVID-19.","Shirato, Ken; Takanari, Jun; Kizaki, Takako",bioRxiv,526,24

Here, we investigated the state of adaptive immunity in bone marrow (BM) of patients and mice with T2D. We also tested if inhibition T cell co-stimulation by Abatacept could rescue the immune profile of T2D mice. Methods Flow-cytometry and cytokine analyses were performed on BM samples from patients with or without T2D. Moreover, we studied the immune profile of db/db and control wt/db mice. A cohort of db/db mice was randomized to receive Abatacept or vehicle for 4 weeks, with endpoints being immune cell profile and indexes of insulin sensitivity and heart performance. Results T2D patients showed increased frequencies of BM CD4+ (2.8-fold, p=0.001) and CD8+ T cells (1.8-fold, p=0.01), with upregulation of the activation marker CD69 and homing receptor CCR7 in CD4+ (1.64-fold, p=0.003 and 2.27-fold, p=0.01, respectively) and CD8+ fractions (1.79-fold, p=0.05 and 1.69-fold, p=0.02, respectively). CCL19 (CCR7 receptor ligand) and CXCL10/11 (CXCR3 receptor ligands), implicated in T cell migration and activation, were the most differentially modulated chemokines. Studies in mice confirmed the activation of adaptive immunity in T2D. Abatacept reduced the activation of T cells and levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Additionally, Abatacept improved indexes of cardiac systolic function, but not insulin sensitivity. Conclusions These novel findings support the concept of BM adaptive immune activation in T2D. Modulation of T cell co-stimulation could represent an attractive and immediately available modality to dampen inappropriate activation of adaptive immune response and protect from target organ damage.","Santopaolo, Marianna; Sullivan, Niall; Thomas, Anita C.; Alvino, Valeria; Nicholson, Lindsay; Gu, Yue; Spinetti, Gaia; Kallikourdis, Marinos; Blom, Ashley; Madeddu, Paolo",bioRxiv,526,24

All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 – 60 d of age), and carryover effects on post-weaning (61 – 90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and acetate:proprionate proportion - C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre and post-weaning (P ≤ 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil (P ≤ 0.001) and platelet (P ≤ 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P ≤ 0.001), revealing a long-term treatment immunological effect. Lastly, the effect on fecal scores was also significant (P ≤ 0.05) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. BEO contributed for ruminal manipulation on pre-weaning and carry over effect on post-weaning; immunity improvement and a decrease morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in pre-weaning phase.","Campolina, Joana P.; Coelho, Sandra G.; Belli, Anna Luiza; Machado, Fernanda S.; Pereira, Luiz G.

Nine classification algorithms were selected for evaluating the most appropriate in predicting the prevalent COVID-19 transmission mode in a geographic area. These include multinomial logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, naïve Bayes, C5.0, bagged classification and regression trees, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting. Five COVID-19 datasets were employed for classification. Predictive accuracy was determined using 10-fold cross validation with three repeats. The Friedman's test was conducted, and the outcome showed the performance of each algorithm is significantly different. The stochastic gradient boosting yielded the highest predictive accuracy, 81%. This finding should be valuable to health informaticians, health analysts, and others regarding which machine learning tool to adopt in the efforts to detect dominant transmission mode of the virus within localities. © This article published as an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License","Atsa'am, D.

We aimed to compare outcomes of TURBT using spinal anaesthesia (SA) alone versus SA+ONB in terms of rates of obturator reflex, bladder perforation, incomplete tumour resection, tumour recurrence and local anaesthetic toxicity. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, identifying studies comparing the outcomes of TURBT using SA versus SA+ONB. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs and the Newcastle- Ottawa scale for observational studies were used to assess the studies. Random effects modelling was used to calculate pooled outcome data. Results: Four randomised control trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies were identified, enrolling a total of 448 patients. The use of SA+ONB was associated with a significantly reduced risk of obturator reflex(P&lt;0.00001), bladder perforation(P=0.02), incomplete resection(P&lt;0.0001) and 12-month tumour recurrence(P=0.005). Obturator nerve block was not associated with an increased risk of local anaesthetic toxicity(0/159). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that TURBT employing SA+ONB is superior to the use of SA alone. During the COVID-19 pandemic, where avoidance of AGPs such as general anaesthesia is paramount, the use of SA+ONB is essential for the safety of both patients and staff without compromising care. Further high-quality RCTs with adequate sample sizes are required to compare the different techniques of obturator nerve block as well as comparing this method to general anaesthesia with complete neuromuscular blockade.","Krishan, A.; Bruce, A.; Khashaba, S.; Abouelela, M.; Ehsanullah, S.

The spread of COVID-19 may have an impact on the increase in TB morbidity, despite the decrease in the incidence rate, which is related to objective difficulties in detecting TB and complexity of the structure of clinical manifestations of the disease against the background of coronavirus infection and severe complications after COVID-19. The use of immunosuppressive therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 may cause immunosuppression, which will affect the results of TI immunodiagnostics using skin tests.

Our purpose was to determine which disparities are most prevalent and their impact on length of stay (LoS) and in hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with Covid-19. Methods De-Identified data for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was abstracted from the HCA enterprise database. Data was binned into summary tables. A negative binomial regression with LoS as the dependent variable and a logistic regression of in-hospital mortality data, using age, insurance status, sex, comorbidities as the dependent variables, were performed. Results From March 1, 2020 to August 23, 2020, of 111,849 covid testing patient records, excluding those with missing data (n=7), without confirmed COVID-19 (n=27,225), and those from a carceral environment (n=1,861), left 84,624 eligible patients. Compared to the US population, the covid cohort had more black patients (23.17% vs 13.4%). Compared to the white cohort, the black cohort had higher private insurance rates (28.52% vs. 23.68%), shorter LoS (IRR=0.97 CI=0.95-0.99, P<0.01) and lower adjusted mortality (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.97). Increasing age was associated with increased mortality and LoS. Patients with Medicare or Medicaid had longer LoS (IRR=1.07, 95% CI=1.04-1.09) and higher adjusted mortality rates (OR=1.11, 95% CI=1-1.23) than those with private insurance Conclusion Conclusions We found that when blacks have higher rates of private insurance, they have shorter hospitalizations and lower mortality than whites, when diagnosed with Covid-19.

Two parameters have been varied in this study: the time of use of the mask, and the electrical charging state of the particles. Mask aging has been carried out by wearing it for a prescribed period of time. Four different charging states of NaCl particles generated by evaporation-condensation have been examined: positively charged particles, negatively charged particles, uncharged particles, and a mixture of the three former types (the latter referred to as “mixed aerosol”). Aerosol charging was carried out with a low activity radioactive source so that most of the charged particles carried a single charge of either sign in all instances. The charging state of the aerosol exerts a considerable effect on filtration efficiency for the three types of masks. Highest filtration efficiencies are attained for positively and negatively charged particles, but polarity seems to play a role: some masks capture more efficiently particles of a given polarity, although differences in the capture efficiencies of positively and negatively charged particles are insignificant in comparison with those observed between charged and uncharged particles. Uncharged particles give the lowest efficiency and the mixed aerosol leads to filtration efficiencies between those of charged and uncharged particles. The time of use of the mask has also a great influence on its filtration performance: while hygienic masks give poor results from the very beginning, one of the two FFP2 masks assayed has shown a good performance even after 24 h of use, and the surgical mask also performed well after 8 h. The relative importance of mechanical (diffusion and or interception) and electrostatic particle deposition, as a function of particle diameter and aging time, has been estimated and discussed. The electrostatic mechanism generally dominates for small particles and short aging times. Pressure drop across the mask has also been measured: the largest pressure drop was observed for the FFP2 and the surgical masks. The time of use of the masks did not affect the pressure drop. Lack of a good fit between the mask and the face of the wearer drastically reduces the actual filtration efficiency of the mask because part of the incoming aerosol bypasses the filtering medium. A few additional efficiency measurements were done after cutting off a small surface area of the mask sample.","Carsí, M.; Alonso, M.",Journal of Aerosol Science,526,1

Access to hospitals has been restricted to selective oncological and urgent patients to minimize surgeries requiring Intensive Care Unit care. All other kind of non-urgent and benign surgeries have been rescheduled. The burden of oncological and urgent cases on the healthcare system has increased. METHODS: We have been asked to become the referral center for major oncological and urgent urological surgeries, increasing our surgical volume. Through meticulous hospital protocols on PPE, use of nasopharyngeal swabs, controlled hospital access and the prompt management of suspected/positive cases, we were able to perform 31% more urological surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: We observed a 72% increase in oncological surgical procedures and 150% in urgent procedures.

The active forms of these drugs are reported to target and inhibit viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase, which is derived from 3-chymotrypsin like protease, a viral replicase enzyme. The present in silico study explores the comparative efficacy of these drugs to inhibit 3-chymotrypsin like protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase, to plan therapeutic options for patients based on their disease severity. Active favipiravir and remdesivir molecules bind to 3-chymotrypsin like protease with energies of 6.18 and -6.52 kcal/mol in contrast to -5.62 and -3.91 kcal/mol for RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Further, hydrophobic interactions and salt bridge formations cement drug bindings with 3-chymotrypsin like protease, but not with RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Molecular dynamic simulation experiments, performed under certain experimental constraints reveal that the root mean square flexibilities of active residues in drug complexes with 3-chymotrypsin like protease are lower than in free 3-chymotrypsin like protease making the former more stable than the latter because of their rigidity and stabilities. Both drugs may hence serve as good therapeutic options for early stages of coronavirus disease 2019. However, more severe symptoms may be treated better with favipiravir due to its better binding with RNA dependent RNA polymerase, as compared to remdesivir. The ""one drug does not fit all"" concept is true for coronavirus disease 2019 as it is being currently realized by clinicians all around the world. Hence precise knowledge about critical interactions of these drugs with the viral enzymes will help medicos make vital therapeutic decisions on interventional options for patients who report to hospitals without over symptoms or with varying degrees of disease severity.","Dey, D.; Dey, N.; Ghosh, S.; Thiagarajan, P.",Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,526,22

Ample evidence indicates that risk for OUD is heritable. As a surrogate (or proxy) for OUD, we explored the genetic basis of using opioids ""not as prescribed"". We hypothesized that misuse of opiates might be a heritable risk factor for OUD. To test this hypothesis, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of problematic opioid use (POU; ""ever taking opioid prescriptions not as prescribed"") in 132,113 23andMe research participants of European ancestry (Ncases=27,805). Our GWAS identified two genome-wide significant loci (rs3791033, an intronic variant of KDM4A; rs640561, an intergenic variant near LRRIQ3). POU showed a positive genetic correlation with opioid dependence and OUD, as measured in the largest available GWAS (rg=0.57-0.80). We also identified numerous additional genetic correlations with POU, including alcohol dependence (rg=0.74), smoking initiation (rg=0.63), pain relief medication intake (rg=0.49), major depressive disorder (rg=0.44), chronic pain (rg=0.42), insomnia (rg=0.39), and loneliness (rg=0.28). Although POU was positively genetically correlated with risk-taking (rg=0.38), conditioning POU on risk-taking did not substantially alter the magnitude or direction of these genetic correlations, suggesting that POU does not simply reflect a general tendency for risky behavior. We conclude that opioid misuse can be measured in population-based cohorts and provides a cost-effective complementary strategy for understanding the genetic basis of OUD.","Sanchez-Roige, S.; Fontanillas, P.; Jennings, M.

Results from this study indicated that leisure scholars who are also mothers experience a great deal of pressure to be productive educators and researchers. This stems from unrealistic work expectations, unsupportive colleagues, and workplace policies that are difficult to navigate. The impacts of these are exacerbated by the pandemic conditions caused by COVID-19 due to existing patriarchal structures in academia. Community mitigation efforts result in working mothers balancing multiple full-time responsibilities, including providing childcare and education for their children while struggling to complete their paid work. We asked our previous research participants to share how their work and family experiences have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic conditions, specifically as it relates to performing simultaneously as both primary childcare providers and faculty members at their institutions. While necessary to address a global health emergency, transitioning to remote work has increased employment expectations for mothers employed in higher education. Leisure scientists reported that telecommuting has led to an unideal merger of their personal and professional spaces, disrupting any harmony that these mothers were working so tirelessly to achieve. Leaders in higher education must address this misguided “hurry up model” and lack of concern for their employees as both scholars and human beings that need leisure to ensure quality of life and wellbeing.","Burk, Brooke N.; Pechenik Mausolf, Anna; Oakleaf, Linda",Leis.

It is a highly contagious flu that can spread from human to human. For being so contagious, detecting patients with it and isolating them has become the primary concern for healthcare professionals. However, identifying COVID-19 patients with a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can sometimes be problematic and time-consuming. Therefore, detecting patients with this virus from X-ray chest images can be a perfect alternative to the de-facto standard PCR test. This article aims at providing such a decision support system that can detect COVID-19 patients with the help of X-ray images. To do that, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture, namely ModCOVNN, has been introduced. To determine whether the proposed model works with good efficiency, two CNN-based architectures – VGG16 and VGG19 have been developed for the detection task. The experimental results of this study have proved that the proposed architecture has outperformed the other two models with 98.08% accuracy, 98.14% precision, and 98.4% recall. This result indicates that proper detection of COVID-19 patients with the help of X-ray images of the chest is possible using machine learning methods with high accuracy.

177417,177417,177417,Comparative analysis of university education effect under the traditional teaching and online teaching mode,14.020315,0.666235,2021,"Over the past twenty years, the world has witnessed several viral epidemics such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza A subtype H1N1 virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and more recently the novel SARS-CoV coronavirus 2, which caused the disease COVID-19. The latest epidemic proved to be the most destructive and claimed more than 2 million lives. Today's efforts to combat COVID-19 are focused on controlling the spread of the coronavirus and identifying effective treatment options. Meanwhile, an analysis of data regarding the long-term clinical consequences of previous coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) shows that with the removal of the virus from the body, the pathological process in many cases does not end and can develop into long-term lung damage, in particular, fibrous interstitial disease or pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, pulmonary fibrosis can become an ongoing problem in patients recovering from COVID-19. Therefore, it is necessary now to determine the strategy of preventive measures both to counteract the development of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with COVID-19 during inpatient treatment, and to prevent its occurrence and progression in the long term. Although anti-fibrotic drugs such as pirfenidone and nintedanib have been shown to be effective in reducing the rate of deterioration in lung function, their results have not significantly improved patient recovery. In addition, the use of these drugs has been associated with serious side effects. In this regard, the purpose of this article is to consider the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACs) as an alternative epigenetic therapy strategy to prevent the development or progression of pulmonary fibrosis in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] За последние двадцать лет мир стал свидетелем нескольких вирусных эпидемий, таких как эпидемии коронавируса тяжелого острого респираторного синдрома (SARS-CoV), вируса гриппа A подтипа H1N1, коронавируса ближневосточного респираторного синдрома (MERS-CoV), а недавно и нового коронавируса SARS-CoV-2, вызвавшего заболевание COVID-19. Последняя эпидемия оказалась наиболее разрушительной и унесла с собой более 2 млн человеческих жизней. Сегодняшние усилия в борьбе с COVID-19 направлены, в основном, на контроль распространения коронавируса и определение эффективных вариантов лече- ния. Между тем анализ данных, касающихся долговременных клинических последствий предыдущих коронавирусных инфекций (SARS-CoV и MERS-CoV), показывает, что с выведением вируса из организма патологический процесс во многих случаях не за- вершается и может перерасти в длительное поражение легких, в частности, фиброзное интерстициальное заболевание, или фиброз легких. Таким образом, фиброз легких может стать постоянной проблемой у пациентов, выздоровевших от COVID-19. Поэтому необходимо уже сейчас определить стратегию превентивных мер как по противодействию развития фиброза легких у пациентов с COVID-19 в период стационарного лечения, так и по недопущению его возникновения и прогрессирования в отда- ленной перспективе. Такие антифибротические препараты, как пирфенидон и нинтеданиб показали свою эффективность в сни- жении скорости ухудшения функции легких, тем не менее результаты их применения не дали существенного улучшения в выздоровлении пациентов. Кроме того, прием этих препаратов был связан с развитием серьезных побочных эффектов. В этой свя- зи, цель работы - рассмотреть возможность использования ингибиторов гистондеацетилазы (HDAC, histonedeacetylase) в каче- стве альтернативной эпигенетической стратегии терапии для предотвращения развития или прогрессирования легочного фиб- роза у выздоровевших пациентов с SARS-CoV-2.

Although it is essential for public health efforts to comprehensively identify which interventions have the largest impact on preventing new cases, most of the modeling studies that support such decision-making efforts have only considered a very small set of interventions. In addition, previous studies predominantly represented interventions as independent or examined a single scenario in which every possible intervention was applied. Reality has been more nuanced, as a subset of all possible interventions may be in effect for a given time period, in a given place. In this paper, we use cloud-based simulations and a previously published Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 (Covasim) to measure the individual and interacting contribution of interventions on reducing new infections in the US over 6 months. Simulated interventions include face masks, working remotely, stay-at-home orders, testing, contact tracing, and quarantining. Through a factorial design of experiments, we find that mask wearing together with transitioning to remote work/schooling has the largest impact. Having sufficient capacity to immediately and effectively perform contact tracing has a smaller contribution, primarily via interacting effects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Li, J.; Giabbanelli, P.

A lack of objective criteria and monitoring toward satisfying the criteria can lead to another COVID-19 outbreak and business closures. Considering the pressing need to return to normalcy without a rebound of COVID-19 infections and deaths, an index that provides a data-driven and objective insight is urgently needed. Hence, a method was devised to assess the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and determine the degree of progress any state has made in containing the spread of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach Using measures such as the weekly averages of daily new deaths, ICU bed occupancy rates, positive cases and test positivity rates, two indexes were developed: COVID-19 reopening readiness and severity. Findings A clear difference in the pandemic severity trends can be observed between states, which is possibly due to the disparity in the state's response to coronavirus. A sharp upward trend in index values requires caution prior to moving to the next phase of reopening. Originality/value The composite indexes advanced in this study will provide a universal, standardized and unbiased view of each state's readiness to reopen and allow comparisons between states. This in turn can help governments and health-care agencies take counter measures if needed as to the anticipated demand for future health-care services and minimize adverse consequences of opening.","Suh, E.; Alhaery, M.",Library Hi Tech,526,16

Measures such as strategic natural ventilation and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration remain poorly implemented and mask mandates are often progressively lifted as vaccination rollout is enhanced. Methods: We adapted a previously developed aerosol transmission model to study the effect of interventions (natural ventilation, face masks, HEPA filtration, and their combinations) on the concentration of virus particles in a classroom of 160 m3 containing one infectious individual. The cumulative dose of viruses absorbed by exposed occupants was calculated. Results: The most effective single intervention was natural ventilation through the full opening of six windows all day during the winter (14-fold decrease in cumulative dose), followed by the universal use of surgical face masks (8-fold decrease). In the spring/summer, natural ventilation was only effective ([≥] 2-fold decrease) when windows were fully open all day. In the winter, partly opening two windows all day or fully opening six windows at the end of each class was effective as well ([≥] 2-fold decrease). Opening windows during yard and lunch breaks only had minimal effect ([≤] 1.2-fold decrease). One HEPA filter was as effective as two windows partly open all day during the winter (2.5-fold decrease) while two filters were more effective (4-fold decrease). Combined interventions (i.e., natural ventilation, masks, and HEPA filtration) were the most effective ([≥] 30-fold decrease). Combined interventions remained highly effective in the presence of a super-spreader. Conclusions: Natural ventilation, face masks, and HEPA filtration are effective interventions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission. These measures should be combined and complemented by additional interventions (e.g., physical distancing, hygiene, testing, contact tracing, and vaccination) to maximize benefit.","Villers, J.; Henriques, A.; Calarco, S.; Rognlien, M.; Mounet, N.; Devine, J.; Azzopardi, G.; Elson, P.; Andreini, M.; Tarocco, N.; Vassella, C.

At 4 days she began with injury and nihilistic delusions. The corticosteroids were progressively reduced, adding 2.5 mg Risperidone, resolving after ten days.ResultsCorticosteroids are currently being used to treat the systemic inflammatory response associated with COVID-19, but they can produce other effects such as psychiatric symptoms (3-6%): 75% affective (mainly hypomanic symptoms);and 25% psychotic.

One of the non-military threats is the danger of an epidemic, which includes a threat with a public safety dimension. The growth of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases has been very fast. As of August 4, 2020, globally 18.14 million cases were confirmed worldwide with 691,013 deaths or a Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) of 3.8%. The 2019-nCoV Outbreak became a COVID-19 pandemic which has an impact on public health and the world economy. ASEAN Plus member countries are deploying militaries to help contain the spread and control the effects of this pandemic. The military is deployed because it is considered a trained resource and is better prepared to deal with emergencies. The purpose of this study is to analyze the joint action of the regional military in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study uses an explanative qualitative method using NVivo as a data processing tool and data analysis using Soft System Methodology (SSM). The results of this study found that the joint regional military actions that have been carried out to stem the spread of COVID-19 are dominated by activities carried out by the ASEAN Center of Military Medicine (ACMM) as the leading sector, activities that have been carried out are the exchange of information and sharing practical activities in managing COVID-19, holding a Tabletop Exercise (TTX) for public health emergency response, joint research and sharing health materials among ASEAN Plus member countries.

We sought to assess the efficacy of one such program by analyzing wastewater RNA load data in relation to SARS-CoV-2 cases identified through individual surveillance testing. Almost 80% of the cases on campus were associated with positive wastewater tests, resulting in an overall positive predictive value of ~79% (Chi square 48.1, Df = 1, p < 0.001). However, half of the positive wastewater samples occurred in the two weeks following the return of a student to the residence hall following isolation, and therefore were not useful in predicting new infections. When these samples were excluded, the positive predictive value of a positive wastewater sample was ~54%. Overall, we conclude that the continued shedding of viral RNA by patients past the time of potential transmission confounds the identification of new cases using wastewater surveillance, and decreases its effectiveness in managing SARS-CoV-2 infections on a residential college campus.","Landstrom, M.; Braun, E.; Larson, E.; Miller, M.; Holm, G.

Here we propose an evolutionary model based on the thorough dissection of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 – the closest bat relative – spike dynamics, kinetics and binding to ACE2. Our results indicate that both spikes share nearly identical, high affinities for Rhinolophus affinis bat and human ACE2, pointing out to negligible species barriers directly related to receptor binding. Also, SARS-CoV-2 spike shows a higher degree of dynamics and kinetics optimization that favors ACE2 engagement. Therefore, we devise an affinity-independent evolutionary process that likely took place in R. affinis bats and limits the eventual involvement of other animal species in initiating the pandemic to the role of vector.","Castelli, Matteo; Scietti, Luigi; Clementi, Nicola; Cavallaro, Mattia; Faravelli, Silvia; Pinnola, Alberta; Criscuolo, Elena; Diotti, Roberta Antonia; Clementi, Massimo; Forneris, Federico; Mancini, Nicasio",bioRxiv,526,1

These result from a succession of crises that have affected the media in the context of a combined process of liberalization and digitalization. In addition to changes in production routines, newsrooms underwent restructuring operations, responsible for the recomposition of their workforce. Between collective redundancies, increased unemployment, fixed-term contracts, “green receipts”, discontinuous and intermittent forms of work, low wages, free work and low cost of interns, precariousness began, step by step, to characterize the journalistic condition. Based on the results of the “Study on the Effects of the State of Emergency on Journalism in the Context of Pandemic Covid-19”, this article aims to analyse the implications of these policies on journalists’ employment relations. The main objective is to understand to what extent media companies’ response to this new reality represents a setback of the logic behind precariousness or, on the contrary, its acceleration. The study aims, firstly, to produce a diagnosis on employment relationships before the state of emergency declaration (SED) — between March and April 2020 —, namely the incidence of temporary modalities and their relationship with factors such as gender or age.

Recently, inhibition of the Jak/STAT pathway with baricitinib, a Jak1/Jak2 inhibitor, has been demonstrated to accelerate clinical improvements in a trial of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, who had a mean BMI of 32. Currently, we aimed to examine effects of long-term treatment with baricitinib on AT inflammation and metabolism in diet-induced obese mice. Starting from 3 months old, male C57BL/6J mice were fed high fat diet (HFD) and concurrently received daily oral gavage of baricitinib (10mg/kg) or vehicle for 12 weeks. Compared to vehicle control, baricitinib treatment significantly improved insulin resistance examined by insulin tolerance test and increased UCP1 (a key browning marker) expression in perigonadal (pAT) and inguinal AT (iAT), but did not affect weight gain and AT mass. Strikingly, total T cells were reduced by ~50% in iAT and pAT in baricitinib group vs. control group. CD4+ IFNγ-expressing Th1 cells, IL5-expressing Th2 cells, and TNFα-expressing T cells were decreased in pAT, but not in iAT, of mice from baricitinib group vs. control group. Unexpectedly, percentage of TNFα-expressing cells in CD8+ T cells were higher in iAT of baricitinib-treated mice than controls. Finally, baricitinib compared to control reduced M1/M2 ratio in pAT, but not iAT, and reduced eosinophils in iAT and pAT. Baricitinib inhibition of Jak/STAT pathway in diet-induced obese mice improved insulin sensitivity and changed immune cells in AT, with dramatic reductions of T cells in particular, indicating an important role of Jak/STAT-mediated inflammation in metabolism in obesity. Given the fact that obesity and insulin resistance are associated with increased severity of COVID-19, our data also point to the need for further studies on AT immune cells, COVID-19, and baricitinib.","Lian, Zeqin Perrard Xiaoyuan Ballantyne Christie M.; Wu, Huaizhu",Diabetes,526,16

While naturopathy is practiced by approximately 75 000 to 100 000 naturopathic practitioners in at least 98 countries, little is known about the international prevalence of history of consultation with a naturopathic practitioner. This study reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies describing the global prevalence of history of consultation with a naturopathic practitioner by the general population. Setting: The included literature was identified through a systematic search of eight databases between September and October 2019, as well as the grey literature. Participants: Studies were included if they reported the prevalence rate of consultations with a naturopathic practitioner by the general population Interventions: Survey items needed to report consultations with a naturopathic practitioner as defined in the country where data was collected, and not combine naturopathic consultations with other health services or only report consulations for illness populations. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary measures used for the analysis was consultations in the previous 12-months. Other prevalence timeframes were reported as secondary measures. Methods: Meta-analysis of prevalence data was conducted using random effects models based on individual countries and World Health Organisation (WHO) world regions. Results: The literature search identified eight manuscripts summarizing 13 studies reporting prevalence for inclusion in the review. All included studies had a low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of the included studies by world region found the 12-month prevalence of history of naturopathy consultations ranged from 1% in the Region of the Americas to 6% in the European and Western Pacific Regions.

Despite blatant electoral fraud and procedural violations, the official results declared Aleksandr Lukashenka reelected for a sixth term.

What made this election different? This analysis of current affairs looks at the 2020 events through the lens of authoritarian consolidation theory, suggesting the unprecedented political mobilization was enabled by erosion in the three pillars of authoritarian stability: repression, cooptation, and legitimation. A majority of the population had been accepting the political status quo out of fear, for social and monetary security provided in exchange for loyalty, or a general understanding that there were no alternatives. Lukashenka did not realize this had largely changed. Nine months later, the foundation of the authoritarian regime is in an even worse shape. The regime’s reliance on repression further counteracts the legitimacy of the system. As a result, it seems it will be difficult for the authorities to re-consolidate authoritarianism, at least in the near future, no matter how the ‘revolution’ unfolds.","Bedford, Sofie",Nationalities Papers,526,1

We aimed to evaluate the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in naturally-ventilated hospital settings by measuring parameters of ventilation and comparing these findings with results of bioaerosol sampling. Methods: We measured outdoor and room CO2 to estimate absolute ventilation (liters per second [L/s]) from 9 hospitals in Bangladesh during October 2020 - February 2021. We estimated infectious risk across different spaces using a modified Wells-Riley equation. We collected air samples from these same spaces at 12.5 L/min over 30 minutes and performed RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 N-gene. We used multivariable linear regression and calculated elasticity to identify characteristics associated with ventilation. Results: Based on ventilation of 86 patient care areas and COVID-19 case numbers, we found that over a 40-hour exposure period, outpatient departments posed the highest median risk for infection (5.4%), followed by COVID intensive care units (1.8%). We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 18.6% (16/86) of air samples. Ceiling height and total open area of doors and windows were found to have the greatest impact on ventilation. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that naturally-ventilated healthcare settings may pose a high risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, particularly among non-COVID designated spaces, but improving parameters of ventilation can mitigate this risk.","Styczynski, A.; Hemlock, C.; Hoque, K.

To investigate if shifts in types of accidents or injuries occurred, especially regarding non-accidental injuries. Design: Retrospective observational multicenter study. Setting: 37 German PICUs. Patients: 1444 children and adolescents < 18 years admitted to German PICUs due to trauma or injuries during the first German lockdown period (16.3.-31.5.2020) and during the same periods of the years 2017-2019. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the severity of disease, admission reasons, types of accidents, injury patterns, surgeries and procedures, and outcomes. Disease severity did not differ from previous years. We found an increase in ingestions (SMR 1.41 (CI 0.88 - 2.16)) and a decrease in aspirations (0.77 (0.41 - 1.32)) and burns (0.82 (0.59 - 1.12)). The total number of admissions for trauma remained constant, but traffic accidents (0.76 (0.56 - 1.01) and school/kindergarten accidents (0.25 (0.05 - 0.74) decreased. Household (1.32 (1.05 - 1.64)) and leisure accidents (1.32 (1.05 - 1.65)) increased. Injured structures did not change, but less neurosurgeries (0.69 (0.42 - 1.07)) and more visceral surgeries (2.00 (1.14 - 3.24)) were performed.

Educators were challenged to provide synchronous classes, asynchronous instruction, and also teach students without the use of the internet. Limited research investigating parents’ experiences and suggestions for remote learning has been conducted, yet they are a significant partner in providing remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to gain insight from parents by asking the question: How would you like educators to support you with teaching your kids at home during COVID-19 school closures? Results from 122 online survey showed that educators could adapt how they provide assignments/tasks regarding differentiation, instructions, and modality;make additional considerations for how families, students, and teachers communicate and access materials;and indicated a variety of reactions to remote learning such as satisfaction, teacher mindsets of understanding and flexibility, and the format of school during COVID-19. Recommendations stemming from the data have the ability to impact future remote learning related to COVID-19 or additional school closures as a result of weather and professional development. © 2021, Florida Gulf Coast University.

In this paper, we explore the usage of deep learning models as a ubiquitous, low-cost, pre-testing method for detecting COVID-19 from audio recordings of breathing or coughing taken with mobile devices or via the web. We adapt an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks that utilise raw breathing and coughing audio and spectrograms to classify if a speaker is infected with COVID-19 or not. The different models are obtained via automatic hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimisation combined with HyperBand. The proposed method outperforms a traditional baseline approach by a large margin. Ultimately, it achieves an Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 74.9%, or an Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 80.7% by ensembling neural networks, considering the best test set result across breathing and coughing in a strictly subject independent manner.

Asthma is one such condition, which may be exacerbated by both prolonged adverse in-home exposures if quarantining in unhealthy homes and prolonged outdoor exposures if the ambient air quality is unhealthy or hazardous. As both are often the case in Environmental Justice (EJ) communities, here we have analyzed data at the census tract (CT) level for Louisiana to assess any correlation between social and environmental vulnerability and health issues like COVID-19 and asthma. Higher Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Particulate Matter less than 2.5 m in diameter (PM2.5) and Ozone levels were associated with higher rates of cumulative COVID-19 incidence at various time points during the pandemic, as well as higher average annual asthma hospitalization rates and estimated asthma prevalence. Further, cumulative COVID-19 incidence during the first three months of the pandemic was moderately correlated with both asthma hospitalizations and estimated prevalence, suggesting similar underlying factors may be affecting both conditions. Additionally, 137 CTs were identified where social and environmental vulnerabilities co-existed, of which 75 (55%) had high estimated prevalence of asthma. These areas are likely to benefit from asthma outreach that considers both social and environmental risk factors. Fifteen out of the 137 CTs (11%) not only had higher estimated prevalence of asthma but also a high burden of COVID-19. Further research in these areas may help to elucidate any common social determinants of health that underlie both asthma and COVID-19 burdens, as well as better clarify the possible role of the environment as related to the COVID-19 burden in Louisiana.","Bakshi, A.; Van Doren, A.; Maser, C.; Aubin, K.; Stewart, C.; Soileau, S.; Friedman, K.; Williams, A.",,526,1

Findings The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique risk scenario that is beyond the scope of most existing risk management literature. The impact of the pandemic is very multi-faceted, not location specific but very global and experienced throughout the entire supply chain, across industries and over a much extended timeline with multiple time horizons. In manufacturing operations, there have been major instances of supply chain heroism in the first year of the pandemic and there is a lot more work ahead. Originality/value The authors' co-created paper enriches the perspective on COVID-19 research in manufacturing and supply chain operations by pointing at empirical opportunities, the need for more inter disciplinary research and the need to consider multiple time horizons.","van Hoek, R.; Loseby, D.",International Journal of Operations & Production Management,526,22

Although the significance remains unclear, intestinal organoid lines display heterogeneity in their growth and morphology. We hypothesized that organoids will also display variability in the degree to which they are susceptible to infectious agents. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a model, we found orders of magnitude differences in the amount of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from small intestinal and colonic organoids generated from different donors. SARS-CoV-2 burden did not correlate with demographic or clinical features associated with donors, but rather reflected the expression level of the virus receptor ACE2. Remarkably, organoid ACE2 transcript levels matched the amount of ACE2 detected in primary tissue from the same individual, indicating that certain properties of the intestinal epithelium are retained during ex vivo differentiation. Longitudinal transcriptomics of organoids identified a delayed yet robust interferon signature, the magnitude of which corresponded to the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that intestinal organoids display substantial heterogeneity in their ability to support viral infections and can potentially inform mechanisms behind interindividual differences in susceptibility to infectious disease.","Jang, Kyung Ku; Kaczmarek, Maria E; Dallari, Simone; Chen, Ying-Han; Axelrad, Jordan; Stapleford, Kenneth A; Cadwell, Ken",bioRxiv,526,19

However, the major obstacle to its use has been the difficulty in delivering these large anionic molecules in vivo. A potential approach to solving this problem is the chemical conjugation of siRNA to the cationic CPPs (cell-penetrating peptides), Tat-(48-60) (transactivator of transcription) and penetratin, which have been shown previously to mediate protein and peptide delivery in a host of animal models. In this transaction, we review recent studies on the utility of siRNA for the investigation of protein function in the airways/lung.

We evaluated efficacy of clinically relevant hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PI) against SARS-CoV-2 and their interactions with remdesivir, the only direct-acting antiviral approved for COVID-19 treatment. HCV PI showed differential potency in short-term treatment assays based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in VeroE6 cells. Linear PI boceprevir, telaprevir and narlaprevir had 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of â¼40 µM. Among macrocyclic PI, simeprevir had the highest (EC50 15 µM) and glecaprevir the lowest (EC50 >178 µM) potency, with paritaprevir, grazoprevir, voxilaprevir, vaniprevir, danoprevir and deldeprevir in between. Acyclic PI asunaprevir and faldaprevir had EC50 of 72 and 23 µM, respectively. ACH-806, inhibiting the HCV NS4A protease cofactor, had EC50 of 46 µM. Similar and slightly increased PI potencies were found in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells and human lung carcinoma A549-hACE2 cells, respectively. Selectivity indexes based on antiviral and cell viability assays were highest for linear PI. In short-term treatments, combination of macrocyclic but not linear PI with remdesivir showed synergism in VeroE6 and A549-hACE2 cells. Longer-term treatment of infected VeroE6 and A549-hACE2 cells with 1-fold EC50 PI revealed minor differences in barrier to SARS-CoV-2 escape. Viral suppression was achieved with 3- to 8-fold EC50 boceprevir or 1-fold EC50 simeprevir or grazoprevir, but not boceprevir, in combination with 0.4- to 0.8-fold EC50 remdesivir; these concentrations did not lead to viral suppression in single treatments.

To investigate the distribution and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a home with COVID-19 positive occupants, samples were collected from a household with two confirmed COVID-19 cases (one adult and one child). Home surface swab and dust samples were collected two months after symptom onset (and one month after symptom resolution) in the household. The strength of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular signal in fomites varied as a function of sample location, surface material and cleaning practices. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal was detected at several locations throughout the household although cleaning appears to have attenuated the signal on many surfaces. Of the 24 surfaces sampled, 46% were SARS-CoV-2 positive at the time of sampling. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in dust recovered from floor and HVAC filter samples ranged from 104 to 105 N2 gene copies/g dust. While detection of viral RNA does not imply infectivity, this study confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal can be detected at several locations within a COVID-19 isolation home and can persist after symptoms have resolved. In addition, the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 (normalized per unit mass of dust) recovered in home HVAC filters may prove useful for estimating SARS-CoV-2 airborne levels in homes. In this work, using the quantitative filter forensics methodology, we estimated an average integrated airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration of 69 ± 43 copies/m3. This approach can be used to help building scientists and engineers develop best practices in homes with COVID-19 positive occupants.","Maestre, Juan P; Jarma, David; Yu, Jia-Rong F; Siegel, Jeffrey A; Horner, Sharon D; Kinney, Kerry A",Sci Total Environ,526,29

As a result, most of the Spanish population had to self-isolate at home. The physical and psychological consequences of this unexpected scenario could be particularly worrisome for people older than 60 years. This study is aimed to examine the psychological well-being of older adults during the home isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate whether meeting the World Health Organization's global recommendations on physical activity (PA) for health is associated with their resilience, affect, and depressive symptoms. Design, setting, and participants: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 483 citizens whose ages ranged from 60 to 92 years (overall sample: M = 65.49, SD = 5.14) were recruited via a snowball sampling strategy to answer to an online questionnaire. Measurements: The four instruments used were The Connor-Davidson CD-RISC resilience scale, The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the six-item self-report scale of Depressive Symptoms, and The international Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results: Results showed that older adults who regularly engaged in vigorous (VPA) and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the quarantine reported higher scores in resilience (Locus, Self-efficacy, and Optimism), positive affect, and lower in depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These finding are the first quantitative evidence pointing toward a link between engagement in VPA and/or MVPA and resilience, positive affect, and depressive symptoms within the COVID-19 restrictions in Spain. Acknowledging these associations may be important in developing health promotion programs for older people during the remaining period of confinement or future ones.

Subject and methods: An online survey was distributed through social media to individuals with a diagnosis of PID to investigate behaviors and concerns during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: Five hundred and fifty seven responses were collected, of which 495 surveys were 100% complete; partial responses were analyzed. Respondents have been extremely cautious and have minimized their potential Covid-19 exposure risk. In this study, 56.6% (n = 289) participated in telehealth visits with the physician responsible for managing their PID during the Covid-19 pandemic. Respondents reported they would be somewhat comfortable with returning to normal activities if there was widespread herd immunity (40.9%, n = 209), an effective vaccine (46.0%. n = 235), or public health protections (44.0%, n = 225). The majority of respondents were extremely concerned (57.3%, n = 293) about additional waves of Covid-19 cases when their state or country reopens. Conclusion: The PID community is aware of the health risks posed by this public health crisis, and have done as much as possible to minimize their risk to community exposure. This pandemic has highlighted the importance of continuous medical care for a vulnerable population through the use of telemedicine. Healthcare providers should be aware of the emotional burden and increased psychiatric distress, often presenting as fear, anxiety, or depression, in patients with a chronic medical condition during a public health crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic.","Sowers, Kerri L; Galantino, Mary Lou",Z Gesundh Wiss,526,10

Compliance with these restrictions is vital and depends greatly on the level of trust in the institutions central to their development and implementation. The objectives of this study were to assess: (1) the effects of the Dutch lockdown measures imposed in March 2020 on trust in government and trust in science; and (2) whether these differ across social groups. We draw on unique data from the high-quality Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel, which comprises a true probability sample of Dutch households (average participation rate: 80.4%). Our data were collected on an ongoing basis from December 2017 to March 2020 (n = 2219). Using the implementation of lockdown measures in mid-March as a natural experiment, we employed difference-in-differences analyses to assess the causal effect of the Dutch lockdown measures on trust in government and trust in science. We estimated that the imposition of the measures caused an 18% increase (95% confidence interval (CI):15%-21%)) in trust in government and a 6% increase (95% CI: 4%-8%) in trust in science. The impact on trust in government was greater among the participants aged 65 and older and those with poor self-assessed health, although the relevant CIs were wide and, in the case of self-assessed health, included the null. No differential effects were observed for trust in science. Our study indicates that the strict public-health measures imposed in the Netherlands during an acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic generated trust in the institutions involved in drafting and implementing them, especially among those with a higher risk of serious health outcomes. This suggests that, to prevent a major public-health crisis, people appreciate firm government intervention during the acute phase of an infectious disease pandemic.","Oude Groeniger, Joost; Noordzij, Kjell; van der Waal, Jeroen; de Koster, Willem",Soc Sci Med,526,16

We sought to examine informatics and digital health strategies that supported the primary care response to COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, the review aims to answer: how Australian primary health care responded and adapted to COVID-19, the facilitators and inhibitors of the Primary care informatics and digital health enabled COVID-19 response and virtual models of care observed in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a rapid scoping review complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Two reviewers independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and synthesis of the included studies. Any disagreement in the eligibility screening, data extraction or synthesis was resolved through consensus meeting and if required. was referred to a third reviewer. Evidence was synthesised, summarised, and mapped to several themes that answer the research question s of this review. RESULTS: We identified 377 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Following title, abstract and full-text screening, 29 eligible papers were included. The majority were ""perspectives"" papers. The dearth of original research into digital health and COVID-19 in primary care meant limited evidence on effectiveness, access, equity, utility, safety, and quality. Data extraction and evidence synthesis identified 14 themes corresponding to 3 research questions. Telehealth was the key digital health response in primary care, together with mobile applications and national hotlines, to enable the delivery of virtual primary care and support public health. Enablers and barriers such as workforce training, digital resources, patient experience and ethical issues, and business model and management issues were identified as important in the evolution of virtual primary care. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has transformed Australian primary care with the rapid adaptation of digital technologies to complement ""in-person"" primary care with telehealth and virtual models of care. The pandemic has also highlighted several literacy, maturity/readiness, and micro, meso and macro-organisational challenges with adopting and adapting telehealth to support integrated person-centred health care. There is a need for more research into how telehealth and virtual models of care can improve the access, integration, safety, and quality of virtual primary care.","Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Godinho, Myron Anthony; Liaw, Siaw-Teng",Int J Med Inform,526,32

While ACE2 has been identified as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses, the mechanism underlying cell entry remains unknown. Human immunodeficiency virus infects target cells via CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, CXCR4 interacts with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26/DPPIV), an enzyme that cleaves CXCL12/SDF-1, which is the chemokine that activates this receptor. By analogy, we hypothesized that ACE2 might also be capable of interactions with RAS-associated G-protein coupled receptors. Using resonance energy transfer and cAMP and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling assays, we found that human ACE2 interacts with RAS-related receptors, namely the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R), and the MAS1 oncogene receptor (MasR). Although these interactions lead to minor alterations of signal transduction, ligand binding to AT1R and AT2R, but not to MasR, resulted in the upregulation of ACE2 cell surface expression. Proximity ligation assays performed in situ revealed macromolecular complexes containing ACE2 and AT1R, AT2R or MasR in adult but not fetal mouse lung tissue. These findings highlight the relevance of RAS in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of ACE2-containing complexes as potential therapeutic targets.","Franco, Rafael; Lillo, Alejandro; Rivas-Santisteban, Rafael; Rodríguez-Pérez, Ana I; Reyes-Resina, Irene; Labandeira-García, José L; Navarro, Gemma",Int. j. mol. sci.

We aimed to further describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of discharged COVID-19 cases and evaluate the public health interventions. METHODS: We collected epidemiological and clinical data of all discharged COVID-19 cases as of 17 February 2020 in Shanghai. The key epidemiological distributions were estimated and outcomes were also compared between patients whose illness were before 24 January and those whose illness were after 24 January. RESULTS: Of 161 discharged COVID-19 cases, the median age was 45 years, and 80 (49.7%) cases were male. All of the cases were categorized as clinical moderate type. The most common initial symptoms were fever (85.7%), cough (41.0%), fatigue (19.3%), muscle ache (17.4%), sputum production (14.9%), and there were six asymptomatic cases. 39 (24.2%) cases got infected in Shanghai, and three of them were second-generation cases of Shanghai native cases. The estimated median of the time from onset to first medical visit, admission, disease confirmation, and discharge for 161 cases was 1.0 day (95% CI, 0.6-1.2), 2.0 days (95% CI, 1.5-2.6), 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.6-5.7), 18.1 days (95% CI, 17.4-18.8), respectively. The estimated median of the time from admission to discharge was 14.0 days (95% CI, 13.3-14.6). The time from onset to first medical visit, admission and disease confirmation were all shortened after the Shanghai's first-level public health emergency response. In Cox regression model, the significant independent covariates for the duration of hospitalization were age, the time from onset to admission and the first-level public health emergency response. CONCLUSIONS: Local transmission had occurred in Shanghai in late January 2020. The estimated median of the time from onset to discharge of moderate COVID-19 was 18.1 days in Shanghai. Time intervals from onset to first medical visit, admission and disease confirmation were all shortened after the Shanghai's first-level public health emergency response.

We aimed to examine whether preceding use of ACEIs and ARBs affected the clinical manifestations and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. One hundred fifty-one consecutive patients (mean age 60 ± 19 years) with polymerase-chain-reaction proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were admitted to six hospitals in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, were analyzed in this multicenter retrospective observational study. Among all COVID-19 patients, in the multiple regression analysis, older age (age &#8805; 65 years) was significantly associated with the primary composite outcome (odds ratio (OR) 6.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.28-22.78, P < 0.001), which consisted of (i) in-hospital death, (ii) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (iii) mechanical ventilation, including invasive and noninvasive methods, and (iv) admission to the intensive care unit.

However, the epitaxial process used to grow these materials is expensive; therefore, InGaAs-based photodetectors are limited to space exploration and military applications. Many researchers have expended considerable efforts to address the problem of SWIR photodetector development using lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs). Along with their cost-efficient solution processability and flexible substrate compatibility, PbS QDs are highly interesting for the quantum-size-effect tunability of their bandgaps, spectral sensitivities, and wide absorption ranges. However, the performance of PbS QD-based SWIR photodetectors is limited owing to inefficient carrier transfer and low photo and thermal stabilities. In this study, a simple method is proposed to overcome these problems by incorporating CdS in PbS QD shells to provide efficient carrier transfer and enhance the long-term stability of SWIR photodetectors against oxidation. The SWIR photodetectors fabricated using thick-shell PbS/CdS QDs exhibited a high on/off (light/dark) ratio of 11.25 and a high detectivity of 4.0 × 1012 Jones, which represents a greater than 10 times improvement in these properties relative to those of PbS QDs. Moreover, the lifetimes of thick-shell PbS/CdS QD-based SWIR photodetectors were significantly improved owing to the self-passivation of QD surfaces.","Kwon, Jin-Beom; Kim, Sae-Wan; Kang, Byoung-Ho; Yeom, Se-Hyuk; Lee, Wang-Hoon; Kwon, Dae-Hyuk; Lee, Jae-Sung; Kang, Shin-Won",Nano Converg,526,14

The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of an outpatient surgery protocol for acute closed ankle fractures. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 262 patients underwent outpatient surgery for their closed ankle fractures at our level-1 trauma centre. A total of 196 patients met our inclusion criteria and were ultimately included in the final analysis. Our primary outcomes' measures included post-operative admission to the emergency department within 30 days after surgery and unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days after surgery. Our secondary outcome measure included the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) within 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (16.3%) had an unplanned emergency department visit within 30 days of fracture fixation and two patients (1.0%) required hospital readmission within 30 days of their surgery. Sixteen patients (8.2%) developed SSI, which included 11 (5.6%) superficial and five (2.6%) deep infections. CONCLUSION: Strategic outpatient management of acute closed ankle fractures is associated with acceptable rates of unplanned emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, and SSIs. In the context of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, outpatient management of these injuries may aide in the mitigation of nosocomial infections and the preservation of finite healthcare resources.","Bullock, Travis S; Gutierrez-Naranjo, Jose M; DelBello, Robert G; Karia, Ravi A; Zelle, Boris A",Int. orthop,526,25

OBJECTIVE: We aim to examine the dissemination of this Miyara et al. study among Twitter users and whether a shift in their attitudes towards smoking occurred after its publication on April 21st, 2020. METHODS: Twitter posts were crawled between April 14th and May 4th, 2020 by the Tweepy stream API, using a COVID-19 related keyword query. After filtering, the final 1,929 tweets were classified into three groups: 1) tweets not related to Miyara et al. study before it was published; 2) tweets not related to Miyara et al. study after it was published; 3) tweets related to Miyara et al. study after it was published. The tweets' attitudes towards smoking were compared among the above three groups using multinomial logistic regression models in statistical analysis software R. RESULTS: The temporal analysis showed a peak in the number of tweets discussing the results from the Miyara et al. study right after its publication. Multinomial logistic regression models on sentiment scores showed the proportion of negative attitudes toward smoking in tweets related to Miyara et al. study after it was published (17.07%) was significantly lower than tweets not related to the Miyara et al. study either before (34.92%, P < 0.001) or after the Miyara et al. study was published (34.34%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The public's attitude toward smoking shifted in a positive direction after the Miyara et al. study found a lower incidence of COVID-19 cases in daily smokers.","Tao, Chunliang; Diaz, Destiny; Xie, Zidian; Chen, Long; Li, Dongmei; O039,; Connor, Richard",,526,24

Well beyond its health effects, the pandemic has wrought major changes in people’s everyday lives as they confront restrictions imposed by physical distancing and consequences such as loss of work, working or learning from home and reduced contact with family and friends. This edited collection covers a diverse range of experiences, practices and representations across international contexts and cultures (UK, Europe, North America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand). Together, these contributions offer a rich account of COVID society. They provide snapshots of what life was like for people in a variety of situations and locations living through the first months of the novel coronavirus crisis, including discussion not only of health-related experiences but also the impact on family, work, social life and leisure activities. The socio-material dimensions of quotidian practices are highlighted: death rituals, dating apps, online musical performances, fitness and exercise practices, the role of windows, healthcare work, parenting children learning at home, moving in public space as a blind person and many more diverse topics are explored. In doing so, the authors surface the feelings of strangeness and challenges to norms of practice that were part of many people’s experiences, highlighting the profound affective responses that accompanied the disruption to usual cultural forms of sociality and ritual in the wake of the COVID outbreak and restrictions on movement. The authors show how social relationships and social institutions were suspended, re-invented or transformed while social differences were brought to the fore. At the macro level, the book includes localised and comparative analyses of political, health system and policy responses to the pandemic, and highlights the differences in representations and experiences of very different social groups, including people with disabilities, LGBTQI people, Dutch Muslim parents, healthcare workers in France and Australia, young adults living in northern Italy, performing artists and their audiences, exercisers in Australia and New Zealand, the Latin cultures of Spain and Italy, Asian-Americans and older people in Australia. This volume will appeal to undergraduates and postgraduates in sociology, cultural and media studies, medical humanities, anthropology, political science and cultural geography. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Deborah Lupton and Karen Willis.","Lupton, D.; Willis, K.",The COVID-19 Crisis: Social Perspectives,526,22

However, few research has been performed on the prediction of disease progression in particular group of patients in the early stages of COVID-19. METHODS: The study included 338 patients with COVID-19 treated at two hospitals in Wuhan, China, from December 2019 to March 2020. Predictors of the progression of COVID-19 from mild to severe stages were selected by the logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: COVID-19 progression to severe and critical stages was confirmed in 78 (23.1%) patients. The average value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in patients in the disease progression group than in the improvement group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated NLR, LDH and IL-10 were independent predictors of disease progression. The optimal cut-off value of NLR was 3.75. The values of the area under the curve, reflecting the accuracy of predicting COVID-19 progression by NLR was 0.739 (95%CI: 0.605-0.804). The risk model based on NLR, LDH and IL-10 had the highest area under the ROC curve. CONCLUSIONS: The performed analysis demonstrates that high concentrations of NLR, LDH and IL-10 were independent risk factors for predicting disease progression in patients at the early stage of COVID-19. The risk model combined with NLR, LDH and IL-10 improved the accuracy of the prediction of disease progression in patients in the early stages of COVID-19.","Xu, Jianjun; Gao, Yang; Hu, Shaobo; Li, Suzhen; Wang, Weimin; Wu, Yuzhe; Su, Zhe; Zhou, Xing; Cheng, Xiang; Zheng, Qichang",Ann Clin Biochem,526,16

Based on that, several anticoagulation guidelines have been proposed. We aimed to determine whether anticoagulation therapy modifies the risk of developing severe COVID-19. Methods and Results Patients with COVID-19 initially admitted in medical wards of 24 French hospitals were included prospectively from February 26 to April 20, 2020. We used a Poisson regression model, Cox proportional hazard model, and matched propensity score to assess the effect of anticoagulation on outcomes (intensive care unit admission or in-hospital mortality). The study enrolled 2878 patients with COVID-19, among whom 382 (13.2%) were treated with oral anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization. After adjustment, anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55-0.88). Analyses performed using propensity score matching confirmed that anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.29-0.63) for intensive care unit admission and adjusted hazard ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61-0.98) for composite criteria intensive care unit admission or death. In contrast, therapeutic or prophylactic low- or high-dose anticoagulation started during hospitalization were not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions Anticoagulation therapy used before hospitalization in medical wards was associated with a better prognosis in contrast with anticoagulation initiated during hospitalization. Anticoagulation therapy introduced in early disease could better prevent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and endotheliopathy, and lead to a better prognosis.","Chocron, Richard; Galand, Vincent; Cellier, Joffrey; Gendron, Nicolas; Pommier, Thibaut; Bory, Olivier; Khider, Lina; Trimaille, Antonin; Goudot, Guillaume; Weizman, Orianne; Alsac, Jean Marc; Geneste, Laura; Schmeltz, Armand; Panagides, Vassili; Philippe, Aurélien; Marsou, Wassima; Ben Abdallah, Iannis; Deney, Antoine; El Batti, Salma; Attou, Sabir; Juvin, Philippe; Delmotte, Thomas; Messas, Emmanuel; Pezel, Théo; Planquette, Benjamin; Duceau, Baptiste; Gaussem, Pascale; Sutter, Willy; Sanchez, Olivier; Waldman, Victor; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Mirault, Tristan; Bonnet, Guillaume; Cohen, Ariel; Smadja, David M",J Am Heart Assoc,526,1

However, research on the effect of diosgenin on autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is lacking. In this study, transcriptomics was used to comprehensively analyse the protective effect of diosgenin against AIT in rats and the possible mechanism. The results showed that in the diosgenin-intervention group, compared to the model group, the expression of serum triiodothyronine, thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine was decreased and that of thyroid-stimulating hormone was increased; these changes were accompanied by the downregulation of thyroglobulin, TSH receptor antibody and thyroid peroxidase expression in serum. Furthermore, transcriptome detection, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry verification revealed that in thyroid tissue, the relative mRNA and protein expression of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element-binding protein (Creb) were increased and the mRNA expression of S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) was decreased in the diosgenin groups. In summary, diosgenin alleviates the development of AIT, possibly via the activation of the cAMP/PKA/Creb pathway and downregulation of S100A9 gene expression.","Zhang, Chengfei; Qin, Lingling; Sun, Boju; Wu, You; Zhong, Fengying; Wu, Lili; Liu, Tonghua",Sci Rep,526,1

To date at least six different inflammasome signalling platforms have been reported (Bauernfeind & Hornung, EMBO Mol Med. 2013;5:814-26; Broz & Dixit, Nat Rev Immunol. 2016;16:407). This review focuses on the complex molecular machinery involved in activation and regulation of the best characterised inflammasome, NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), and the development of molecular agents to modulate NLRP3 inflammasome function. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces inflammation via secretion of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) proinflammatory cytokines, with orchestration of pyroptotic cell death, to eliminate invading microbial pathogens. This field has gradually moved from an emphasis on monogenic autoinflammatory conditions, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), to the broad spectrum of innate immune-mediated disease. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is also linked to a range of common disorders in humans including type 2 diabetes (Krainer et al., J Autoimmun. 2020:102421), cystic fibrosis (Scambler et al., eLife. 2019;8), myocardial infarction, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (Savic et al., Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2020:1-16) and cancers such as mesotheliomas and gliomas (Moossavi et al., Mol Cancer. 2018;17:158). We describe how laboratory-based assessment of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is emerging as an integral part of the clinical evaluation and treatment of a range of undifferentiated systemic autoinflammatory disorders (uSAID) (Harrison et al., JCI Insight. 2016;1), where a DNA-based diagnosis has not been possible. In addition, this review summarises the current literature on physiological inhibitors and features various pharmacological approaches that are currently being developed, with potential for clinical translation in autoinflammatory and immune-mediated conditions. We discuss the possibilities of rational drug design, based on detailed structural analyses, and some of the challenges in transferring exciting preliminary results from trials of small-molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome, in animal models of disease, to the clinical situation in human pathology.","Caseley, Emily A; Poulter, James A; Rodrigues, François; McDermott, Michael F",Genes immun,526,20

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the need to have more service robots in our everyday lives, to minimise the risk of human to-human transmission. One such example would be coffee shops, which have become intrinsic to our everyday lives. However, serving an excellent cup of coffee is not a trivial feat as a coffee blend typically comprises rich aromas, indulgent and unique flavours and a lingering aftertaste. Our work addresses this by proposing a computational model which recommends optimal coffee beans resulting from the user's preferences. Specifically, given a set of coffee bean properties (objective features), we apply different supervised learning techniques to predict coffee qualities (subjective features). We then consider an unsupervised learning method to analyse the relationship between coffee beans in the subjective feature space. Evaluated on a real coffee beans dataset based on digitised reviews, our results illustrate that the proposed computational model gives up to 92.7 percent recommendation accuracy for coffee beans prediction. From this, we propose how this computational model can be deployed on a service robot to reliably predict customers' coffee bean preferences, starting from the user inputting their coffee preferences to the robot recommending the coffee beans that best meet the user's likings.","Berardinis, Jacopo de; Pizzuto, Gabriella; Lanza, Francesco; Chella, Antonio; Meira, Jorge; Cangelosi, Angelo",,526,10

The safety profile of tocilizumab (TCZ) administration in candidemia patient still debatable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54 year-old woman presenting with weakness on the left side of her body was diagnosed with COVID-19. After 7âdays of admission, her condition worsened and developed respiratory distress and was having respiratory distress despite standard treatment. DIAGNOSES: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID 19 was diagnoses based on real time-PCR swab, deterioration of PaO2/FiO2 and increased of acute phase reactants. INTERVENTIONS: Anti Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was considered to tackle her inflammatory condition. Prior to TCZ administration, blood culture was performed and the result came with Candida tropicalis in the absence of bacterial growth. OUTCOMES: No major complications associated with intravenous antifungal or TCZ occurred. After 40âdays of hospitalization, the patient's clinical condition improved and was finally discharged. LESSONS: This case underscores the safety profile of giving TCZ in candidemia as a secondary infection in severe COVID-19 patient.","Sari, Anggraini Permata; Darnindro, Nikko; Yohanes, Aryan; Mokoagow, Muhammad Ikhsan",Medicine (Baltimore),526,6

Trends in such reports over time are likely to reflect behaviour of the ongoing epidemic within the wider community, potentially capturing valuable information across a broader severity profile of cases than hospital admission data. We present a fully reproducible analysis of temporal trends in NHS Pathways reports until 14th May 2020, nationally and regionally, and demonstrate that rates of growth/decline and effective reproduction number estimated from these data may be useful in monitoring transmission. This is a particularly pressing issue as lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted and evidence of disease resurgence must be constantly reassessed. We further assess the correlation between NHS Pathways reports and a publicly available NHS dataset of COVID-19-associated deaths in England, finding that enquiries to 111/999 were strongly associated with daily deaths reported 16 days later. Our results highlight the potential of NHS Pathways as the basis of an early warning system. However, this dataset relies on self-reported symptoms, which are at risk of being severely biased.

There is a substantial unmet need for rehabilitation service to all patients affected by Covid-19 directly or indirectly. This article aims to describe how to rapidly reconfigure and bring rehabilitation services back during the pandemic. METHOD: The Steer committee meeting was held for the development of a strategic preparedness plan and safety management based on principles and evidence of rehabilitation, which will lead to effective mitigation of consequences resulted from Covid-19. RESULTS: Five measures were taken in Southwest China during the pandemic, which includes the ""First contact responsibility"" and management system; the full-coverage system for nosocomial infection control; the ""Closed-off management"" system; the full-coverage system for body temperature monitoring; the adoption of 5G-based telerehabilitation. With the implementation of these measures, the capacity and capability were enhanced to safely reopen and operate rehabilitation facilities in Southwest China. CONCLUSION: Further measurement of quality of care and outcomes during and beyond the pandemic is needed in transforming the healthcare system and improving rehabilitation services. Hopefully, the positive message conveyed by this paper could encourage and support communities and the society of physical medicine and rehabilitation worldwide during this challenging time. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Rehabilitation services are essential and there is an unmet need posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. A feasible strategic plan and safety management measures are critical to reconfigure the capacity and capability of rehabilitation services suspended by Covid-19. The adoption of tele-rehabilitation technology has the potential to reshape public health emergency responses and the delivery of care. Measurement of quality and outcomes is of great importance to inform transformation and adaptation of rehabilitation services during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.","Zhu, Siyi; Zhang, Liming; Xie, Suhang; He, Hongchen; Wei, Quan; Du, Chunping; Yang, Yonghong; Liu, Zuoyan; He, Chengqi; Gao, Qiang; Yang, Lin",Disabil Rehabil,526,2

OBJECTIVES: We assessed of the risk of illness due to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing in indoor environments. METHODS: A risk assessment model, AirCoV2, for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets was developed. Previously published data on droplets expelled by breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing by an infected person were used as inputs. Scenarios encompassed virus concentration, exposure time, and ventilation. Newly collected data of virus RNA copies in mucus from patients are presented. RESULTS: The expelled volume of aerosols was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough, singing, speaking, and breathing. After 20 min of exposure, at 107 RNA copies/mL in mucus, all mean illness risks were largely estimated to be below 0.001, except for the ""high"" sneeze scenario. At virus concentrations above 108 RNA copies/mL, and after 2 h of exposure, in the high and ""low"" sneeze scenarios, the high cough scenario and the singing scenario, risks exceeded 0.01 and may become very high, whereas the low coughing scenario, the high and low speaking scenarios and the breathing scenario remained below 0.1. After 2 h of exposure, singing became the second highest risk scenario. One air exchange per hour reduced risk of illness by about a factor of 2. Six air exchanges per hour reduced risks of illness by a factor of 8-13 for the sneeze and cough scenarios and by a factor of 4-9 for the other scenarios. DISCUSSION: The large variation in the volume of expelled aerosols is discussed. The model calculations indicated that SARS-CoV-2 transmission via aerosols outside of the 1.5-m social distancing norm can occur. Virus concentrations in aerosols and/or the amount of expelled aerosol droplets need to be high for substantial transmission via this route. AirCoV2 is made available as interactive computational tool. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7886.","Schijven, Jack; Vermeulen, Lucie C; Swart, Arno; Meijer, Adam; Duizer, Erwin; de Roda Husman, Ana Maria",Environ Health Perspect,526,32

Utilisée dans un premier temps comme antipaludéen puis dans les maladies rhumatismales, l’HCQ a été employée dans diverses affections parmi lesquelles des maladies infectieuses, des troubles de l’immunité, le diabète, la dyslipidémie ou les néoplasies. Sur le plan des maladies systémiques, l’HCQ est le traitement de référence du lupus érythémateux systémique (LES) et les dernières directives européennes préconisent son utilisation chez tous les patients ne présentant pas de contre-indications ou d’effets indésirables. Les effets positifs de l’HCQ dans le LES ont été démontrés pour des critères robustes tels que l’accumulation de dommages, l’activité de la maladie et la survie. Des effets pléiomorphiques ont également été observés : moindre besoin de glucocorticoïdes, risque réduit de lupus néonatal, diminution de la glycémie à jeun et protection contre le diabète, le risque thrombotique, la dyslipidémie, les infections, etc. L’HCQ peut en outre être utilisée pendant la grossesse et l’allaitement. En dehors du LES, le rôle de l’HCQ dans le syndrome des antiphospholipides (SAPL) et le syndrome de Gougerot-Sjögren (SGS) est encore controversé. En revanche, de récentes études n’ont fait apparaître qu’un intérêt limité dans la polyarthrite rhumatoïde, en particulier parce que l’HCQ ne prévient pas les dommages structuraux.

We describe the joint dynamics of infection and the economy and discuss the trade-off between production and fatalities. In particular, we carefully study the conditions for the existence of the optimal policy response and its uniqueness. Uniqueness crucially depends on the marginal rate of substitution between the statistical value of a human life and GDP; we show an example with a phase transition: above a certain threshold, there is a unique optimal containment policy; below the threshold, it is optimal to abstain from any containment; and at the threshold itself there are two optimal policies.

While rural health theory recognizes the importance of the social determinants of health, there is a lack of insight into public perspectives for improving rural health beyond the provision of health-care services. Gaining insight into perceived solutions, that include and go beyond health- care, can help to inform resource allocation decisions to improve rural health. OBJECTIVE: To identify and describe shared perspectives within a remote-rural community on how to improve rural health. METHOD: Using Q methodology, a set of 40 statements were developed representing different perceptions of how to improve rural health. Residents of one remote-rural island community ranked this statement set according to their level of agreement. Card-sorts were analysed using factor analysis to identify shared points of view and interpreted alongside post-sort qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Sixty-two respondents participated in the study. Four shared perspectives were identified, labelled: Local economic activity; Protect and care for the community; Redistribution of resources; and Investing in people. Factors converged on the need to relieve poverty and ensure access to amenities and services. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Factors represent different elements of a multifaceted theory of rural health, indicating that 'lay' respondents are capable of comprehending various approaches to health improvement and perspectives are not homogenous within rural communities.

While nearly all service coordinators report that most or all residents have reliable phone access, under a quarter report that most or all have reliable internet access; they also report limited access to technology for video calls. Lack of internet access and technology literacy are perceived as barriers to medical visits and food procurement for low-income older adult residents of affordable housing. Policies to expand internet access as well as training and support to enable use of online services are required to overcome these barriers.","Ellison-Barnes, Alejandra; Moran, Alyssa; Linton, Sabriya; Chaubal, Manotri; Missler, Michelle; Evan Pollack, Craig",J Appl Gerontol,526,30

OHT during the pandemic presents unique challenges in terms of feasibility and safety. METHODS: Chart review was performed for consecutive OHT recipients with COVID-19 and waitlisted patients who underwent OHT from March 1, 2020 to May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Of the approximately 400 OHT recipients followed at our institution, 22 acquired COVID-19. Clinical characteristics included median age 59 (range, 49-71) years, 14 (63.6%) were male, and median time from OHT to infection was 4.6 (2.5-20.6) years. Symptoms included fever (68.2%), gastrointestinal complaints (55%), and cough (46%). COVID-19 was severe or critical in 5 (23%). All patients had elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Immunosuppression was modified in 85% of patients. Most (nâ¯=â¯16, 86.4%) were hospitalized, 18% required intubation, and 14% required vasopressor support. Five patients (23%) expired.

This study aims to investigate, factors associated with COVID-19 positivity in hospital for 1,436 UK Biobank participants; compared with individuals who tested negative, and with the untested, presumed negative, rest of the cohort. Methods: We studied 7,099 participants from the UK Biobank who had been tested for COVID-19 in hospital. We considered the following exposures: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, ACEi/ARB use, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and smoking. We undertook comparisons between (1) COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative tested participants; and (2) COVID-19 tested positive and the remaining participants (tested negative plus untested, n = 494,838). Logistic regression models were used to investigate univariate and mutually adjusted associations. Results: Among participants tested for COVID-19, Black, Asian, and Minority ethnic (BAME) ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI were independently associated with a positive result. BAME ethnicity, male sex, greater BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking were independently associated with COVID-19 positivity compared to the remaining cohort (test negatives plus untested). However, similar associations were observed when comparing those who tested negative for COVID-19 with the untested cohort; suggesting that these factors associate with general hospitalization rather than specifically with COVID-19. Conclusions: Among participants tested for COVID-19 with presumed moderate to severe symptoms in a hospital setting, BAME ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI are associated with a positive result. Other cardiometabolic morbidities confer increased risk of hospitalization, without specificity for COVID-19.

Agents that inhibit components of the pro-inflammatory cascade have garnered interest as potential treatment options with hopes that dampening the proinflammatory process may improve clinical outcomes. Baricitinib is a reversible Janus-associated kinase (JAK)-inhibitor that interrupts the signaling of multiple cytokines implicated in COVID-19 immunopathology. It may also have antiviral effects by targeting host factors that viruses rely for cell entry and by suppressing type I interferon driven angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 upregulation. However, baricitinib's immunosuppressive effects may be detrimental during acute viral infections by delaying viral clearance and increasing vulnerability to secondary opportunistic infections. The lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor patients' immune status as illness evolves complicates deployment of immunosuppressive drugs like baricitinib. Furthermore, baricitinib carries the risk of increased thromboembolic events, which is concerning given the proclivity towards a hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19. In this article, we review available data on baricitinib with an emphasis on immunosuppressive and antiviral pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and current progress in COVID-19 clinical trials.","Jorgensen, Sarah C J; Tse, Christopher L Y; Burry, Lisa; Dresser, Linda D",Pharmacotherapy,526,1

Our aim was to investigate whether the severity of chest imaging findings among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) correlates with the risk of acute neuroimaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 who received care at our hospital between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, and underwent chest imaging within 10 days of neuroimaging. Chest radiographs were assessed using a previously validated automated neural network algorithm for COVID-19 (Pulmonary X-ray Severity score). Chest CTs were graded using a Chest CT Severity scoring system based on involvement of each lobe. Associations between chest imaging severity scores and acute neuroimaging findings were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 93 patients (26%) included in the study had positive acute neuroimaging findings, including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 7), infarction (n = 7), leukoencephalopathy (n = 6), or a combination of findings (n = 4). The average length of hospitalization, prevalence of intensive care unit admission, and proportion of patients requiring intubation were significantly greater in patients with acute neuroimaging findings than in patients without them (P < .05 for all). Compared with patients without acute neuroimaging findings, patients with acute neuroimaging findings had significantly higher mean Pulmonary X-ray Severity scores (5.0 [SD, 2.9] versus 9.2 [SD, 3.4], P < .001) and mean Chest CT Severity scores (9.0 [SD, 5.1] versus 12.1 [SD, 5.0], P = .041). The pulmonary x-ray severity score was a significant predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 and acute neuroimaging findings had more severe findings on chest imaging on both radiographs and CT compared with patients with COVID-19 without acute neuroimaging findings. The severity of findings on chest radiography was a strong predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19.","Lang, M; Li, M D; Jiang, K Z; Yoon, B C; Mendoza, D P; Flores, E J; Rincon, S P; Mehan, W A; Conklin, J; Huang, S Y; Lang, A L; Giao, D M; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Kalpathy-Cramer, J; Little, B P; Buch, K",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,526,29

Such environments deliver a wide variety of Recreational Ecosystem Services (RES) to visitors. This paper explores RES delivery in different types of UGS, differentiated with respect to their naturalness and distance from the city centre. Furthermore, it investigates how the identified use patterns are affected by an abrupt change in access. We extract data from Instagram, posted at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, for Warsaw, Poland, and use it to measure both the intensity of use of UGS, and the experience of Instagram users. Furthermore, we compare these data with data from the same period for the previous year (2019). Our results indicate that, in typical conditions, the wilder the area, the fewer visitors. RES patterns changed, however, when access to UGS was restricted. The recent COVID-19 outbreak showed that soon after restrictions on visiting UGS were lifted, recreation shifted towards wilder green areas. Moreover, users became more oriented to wild nature. We conclude that the number of visitors, and the pattern of recreational use of UGS, are highly dependent on the character of green spaces across the urban wilderness continuum, and that they are influenced by abrupt changes in access.","Grzyb, Tomasz Kulczyk Sylwia Derek Marta Woźniak Edyta",Ecosystem Services,526,30

The aim of this study was to characterize the D614 G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, which may affect viral infectivity. METHODS: The effect of D614 G mutation on the structure and thermodynamic stability of S-protein was analyzed using DynaMut and SCooP. HDOCK and PRODIGY were used to model furin protease binding to the S-protein RARR cleavage site and calculate binding affinities. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to predict S-protein apo structure, S-protein-furin complex structure, and the free binding energy of the complex. RESULTS: The D614 G mutation in the G clade of SARS-CoV-2 strains introduced structural mobility and decreased thermal stability of S-protein (&#916;&#916;G: -0.086 kcal/mol). The mutation resulted in a stronger binding affinity (Kd = 1.6 × 10-8) to furin which may enhance S-protein cleavage. Results were corroborated by MD simulations demonstrating higher binding energy of furin to S-protein D614 mutant (-61.9 kcal/mol compared with -56.78 kcal/mol for wild-type S-protein). CONCLUSIONS: The D614 G mutation in the G clade induced the flexibility of S-protein, resulting in increased furin binding which may enhance S-protein cleave and infiltration of host cells. As such, SARS-CoV-2 D614 G mutation may result in a more virulent strain.","Mohammad, Anwar; Alshawaf, Eman; Marafie, Sulaiman K; Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Abubaker, Jehad; Al-Mulla, Fahd",Int. j. infect. dis,526,16

We conceptualise urban air pollution as entwined in its making and consequence with the diverse rhythms of technologies, social practices and socio-temporal structures, environmental and atmospheric processes, bodily movements in space and time, and rhythmically constituted corporeality. Through this interdisciplinary account we position urban air pollution as integral to the ‘beat’ of the city, both a product of and constituent part of its evolving spatiotemporal form. We build on this foundation to develop a polyrhythmic conceptualisation of how certain places and lives are more dominated by pollution than others. Unequal patternings are made through the structuring effects of rhythmic repetition and by fatal intersections between the rhythms of polluted air and unequal capacities to avoid harmful breathing in and to resist the arrhythmic corporeal consequences that can follow. Understanding inequalities as manifest not within a static landscape of spatial relations, but in sets of unequally unfolding and structured polyrhythmic relations has implications for revealing patterns of inequality and for extending evidence-making more deeply into how rhythms intersect. Which and whose rhythms are to be intervened in are also considered as key ethical and political questions. We draw out implications for activism and community action, and identify the potential for bringing rhythmanalysis into productive engagement with broader environmental justice concerns, including in relation to recent COVID-19 experiences.","Walker, Gordon; Booker, Douglas; J Young, Paul",Environ.

Method: A cross-sectional investigation was carried out in several stages. Participants (N = 699) between the ages of 18 and 73 (M = 27.79; SD = 12.68) completed both the FCV-19S and the Hospital, Anxiety, and Depression Scale (HADS). We performed descriptive, exploratory factorial (n = 349), confirmatory (n = 350), and scale reliability analyses. Results: The results confirmed the factor structure of the original scale as well as the scale's goodness-of-fit indices and good internal consistency (&#945; = .91, &#969; = .98). The correlations between the Spanish FCV-19S and the HADS support the scale's validity, especially for the subdimension of anxiety. Conclusions: The Spanish version of the FCV-19S appears to be a valid measure for the assessment of fear in an adult population. The present study moves research forward by providing a confirmatory analysis of the gender variable's influence on the factor analysis. The FCV-19S-Spanish provides a valid brief measure to evaluate fear of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results also revealed that fear was higher among women than among men, which is important as it suggests that more attention needs to be paid to assessing and treating women's fear.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to evaluate the prevalence of ""loss of smell"" in COVID-19 as well as its utility for prognosticating the disease severity. METHODS: An exhaustive search of the PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LitCovid NIH, and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted through August 6th, 2020. All studies reporting the prevalence of ""loss of smell"" (anosmia and/or hyposmia/microsmia) in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Pooled prevalence for cases (positive COVID-19 through reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) and/or serology IgG/IgM) and controls (negative RT-PCR and/or serology) was compared, and the odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and the p-value were calculated. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies with 11074 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Of these, 21 studies used a control group with 3425 patients.

They have been extensively produced since 1940s due to enormous applications as a surface-active agent, and water and oil repellent characteristics. PFASs are made to be non-biodegradable, therefore, many of them have been found in the environment albeit strict regulations have been in place since 2002. PFASs are extremely toxic compounds that can impart harm in both fauna and flora. Recent investigations have shown that wetlands might be useful for their removal from the environment as a passive and nature-based solution. To this end, understanding the role of plants, microbes, and their combined plant-microbe interplay is crucial because it could help design a sophisticated passive treatment wetland system. This review focuses on how these components (plants, microbe, substrate) can influence PFASs removal in wetlands under natural and controlled conditions. The information on underlying removal mechanisms is mostly retrieved from laboratory-based studies; however, pilot- and field-scale data are also presented to provide insights on their real-time performance. Briefly, a traditional wetland system works on the principles of phytouptake, bioaccumulation, and sorption, which are mainly due to the fact that PFASs are synthetic compounds that have very low reactivity in the environment. Nevertheless, recent investigations have also shown that Feammox process in wetlands can mineralize the PFASs; thus, opens new opportunities for PFASs degradation in terms of effective plant-microbe interplay in the wetlands.

A very prominentfeature associated with severe COVID-19 is T cell lymphopenia. However, homeostatic and functional properties of T cells are ill-defined in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled individuals with mild and severe COVID-19 into our multicenter cohort and performed a cross-sectional analysis of phenotypic and functional characteristics of T cells using 40-parameter mass cytometry, flow cytometry, targeted proteomics, and functional assays. RESULTS: Compared tomild disease, we observed strong perturbations of peripheral T cell homeostasis and function in severe COVID-19. Individuals with severe COVID-19 showed T cell lymphopenia and redistribution of T cell populations, including loss of naïveT cells, skewing toward CD4+ T follicular helper cells and cytotoxic CD4+ T cells,and expansion of activated and exhausted T cells. Extensive T cell apoptosis was particularly evident with severe disease and T cell lymphopenia,which in turn was accompanied by impaired T cell responses to several common viral antigens. Patients with severe disease showed elevated interleukin-7 and increased T cell proliferation. Furthermore, patients sampled at late time points after symptom onset had higher T cell counts and improved antiviral T cell responses. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that severe COVID-19 is characterized by extensiveT cell dysfunction and T cell apoptosis, which is associated with signs of homeostatic T cell proliferation and T cell recovery.","Adamo, Sarah; Chevrier, Stéphane; Cervia, Carlo; Zurbuchen, Yves; Raeber, Miro E; Yang, Liliane; Sivapatham, Sujana; Jacobs, Andrea; Baechli, Esther; Rudiger, Alain; Stüssi-Helbling, Melina; Huber, Lars C; Schaer, Dominik J; Bodenmiller, Bernd; Boyman, Onur; Nilsson, Jakob",Allergy,526,10

With emphasis on the most recent data (2015-2020), Kosovo official statistics, international and local organizations, mass media materials, with high involvement of interviews and surveys conducted during working trips to the Balkan region, and long-term observations, this paper is urged to remove this gap and to answer the question of economic independence and viability, directly concerned with the fundamental matter of sovereignty. Despite the thesis on favorable starting conditions in a form of abundance of various natural resources and ready-made industrial base, widely used in public rhetoric during separatist movement, the words have mostly remained just words - no significant structural changes have taken place in Kosovo's economy since its self-declared independence in 2008. Reports reflect some increase of economic activity since 2015, but in almost all key directions - administrative reform, fundamental rights, fight against corruption and organized crime, regional cooperation development, etc. - there has been a very little progress up to date. Huge informal sector, desperate situation with youth's unemployment, gender disproportion in the labor and legal fields - these are among the strongest economic challenges and the highest barriers for Kosovo on its way to European integration. In recent years, local economy drivers were state investments into infrastructure and private consumption, which is still mostly based on large transactions from abroad, together with increasing salary rates and lending. Economic diversification goes slowly. Base metals and mineral products dominate - same as during previous years - in regional export of goods, providing slightly less than a half of its entire volume. Excessive reliance on import is another feature of economic development in contemporary Kosovo. List of services and goods providers remains stable for the past decade, led by Germany and Italy, with growing influence of China and Turkey. Some improvement of business climate co-exists with essential economic problems. Kosovo's economy still highly depends on external incomes and internal trade sector. Local educational system does not match local labor market needs. Financial discipline, efficient distribution of resources, optimization of sectoral interaction, fight against corruption and crime - these tasks remain the ones of high priority and are still in the current economic agenda today, like they were five and 10 years ago. Kosovo's real investment attractiveness is in question;however, much work has been done in the legal field to speed up and secure the fundraising process. Unresolved problems of property rights and lack of political will to handle these issues hurt investment perspectives and slow down economic development. COVID-2019 brings additional damage to Kosovo's economy, but its overall results are to be yet evaluated.","Arlyapova, E. S.; Ponomareva, E. G.",Mirovaya Ekonomika I Mezhdunarodnye Otnosheniya,526,16

This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the oral health of adults in Wuhan and other places of China amid the epidemic and to evaluate attitudes towards dental care in the post-epidemic period. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey based on a questionnaire of 22 questions was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 3352 valid questionnaires were collected. Participants from Wuhan tended to be relatively psychologically affected and more concerned about future dental treatment. Toothbrushing frequency did not differ significantly between participants from Wuhan and other places and was associated with the prevalence of oral problems people encountered. Gingival bleeding, bad breath and oral ulcers were the three most common oral problems amid the epidemic, and significantly more participants in Wuhan experienced oral problems than other places in China. CONCLUSION: The three most common oral problems amid the epidemic were gingival bleeding, bad breath and oral ulcers. Adults in Wuhan tended to be more seriously affected and suffered more oral problems than people from other places in China. Maintaining good oral health behaviours plays an important role in preventing dental problems.

Methods: This study was retrospectively conducted on patients registered in the Korean acute-on-chronic liver failure study cohort, and on 474 consecutive cirrhotic patients hospitalized with variceal bleeding from January 2013 to December 2013 at 21 university hospitals. ACLF was defined as described by the European Association for the Study of Liver-Chronic Liver Failure Consortium. Results: Among a total of 474 patients, 61 patients were diagnosed with ACLF. The cumulative overall survival (OS) rate was lower in the patients with ACLF than in those without (P<0.001), and patients with higher ACLF grades had a lower OS rate (P<0.001). The chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA) score was identified as a significant prognostic factor in patients hospitalized with variceal bleeding (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.50; P<0.001), even in ACLF patients with variceal bleeding (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19-1.46, P<0.001). Concerning the prediction of the mortality risk at 28- and 90-day using CLIF-SOFA scores, c-statistics were 0.895 (95% CI, 0.829-0.962) and 0.897 (95% CI, 0.842-0.951), respectively, and the optimal cut-off values were 6.5 and 6.5, respectively. Conclusions: In cirrhotic patients hospitalized with variceal bleeding, the prognosis was poor when accompanied by ACLF, especially depending upon CLIF-SOFA score. CLIF-SOFA model well predicted the 28-day or 90-day mortality for cirrhotic patients who experienced variceal bleeding.","Shin, Jongbeom; Yu, Jung Hwan; Jin, Young-Joo; Yim, Hyung Joon; Jung, Young Kul; Yang, Jin Mo; Song, Do Seon; Kim, Young Seok; Kim, Sang Gyune; Kim, Dong Joon; Suk, Ki Tae; Yoon, Eileen L; Lee, Sang Soo; Kim, Chang Wook; Kim, Hee Yeon; Jang, Jae Young; Jeong, Soung Won",Clin. mol. hepatol (Online),526,16

We sought to evaluate whether current levels of vaccine coverage and contact reduction could mitigate a potential 4th wave fueled by the Delta variant, or whether the reinstitution of more intense public health measures will be required. MethodsWe developed an age-stratified dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in a mid-sized city (population 500,000) currently experiencing a relatively low, but increasing, infection rate in Step 3 of Ontarios Wave 3 recovery. We parameterized the model using the medical literature, grey literature, and government reports. We estimated the current level of contact reduction by model calibration to cases and hospitalizations. We projected the number of infections, number of hospitalizations, and the time to re-instate high intensity public health measures over the fall of 2021 under different levels of vaccine coverage and contact reduction. ResultsMaintaining contact reductions at the current level, estimated to be a 17% reduction compared to pre-pandemic contact levels, results in COVID-related admissions exceeding 20% of pre-pandemic critical care capacity by late October, leading to cancellation of elective surgeries and other non-COVID health services. At high levels of vaccination and relatively high levels of mask wearing, a moderate additional effort to reduce contacts (30% reduction compared to pre-pandemic contact levels), is necessary to avoid re-instating intensive public health measures. Compared to prior waves, the age distribution of both cases and hospitalizations shifts younger and the estimated number of pediatric critical care hospitalizations may substantially exceed 20% of capacity. DiscussionHigh rates of vaccination coverage in people over the age of 12 and mask wearing in public settings will not be sufficient to prevent an overwhelming resurgence of COVID-19 in the Fall of 2021. Our analysis indicates that immediate moderate public health measures can prevent the necessity for more intense and disruptive measures later.","Cipriano, Lauren E.; Haddara, Wael M.

This study aimed to explore the correlates of fatigue amongst a number of clinical parameters in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), in order to better understand potential contributing factors and resulting consequences. METHODS: Twenty-six clinically stable CIDP patients underwent assessments of motor and sensory function, disability, quality of life and depression and anxiety. Experienced fatigue was assessed using the Rasch-built fatigue severity scale and Checklist of Individual Strength. RESULTS: The two utilized fatigue scales showed significant inter-correlation. Only depression scores and grip strength predicted experienced fatigue levels in multivariate regression analyses. Fatigue scores inversely correlated with strength, sensory, disability and quality of life scores. DISCUSSION: Experienced fatigue is likely multifactorial in CIDP, with both physical and neuropsychiatric components. Fatigue is associated with lower functional and quality-of-life outcomes in CIDP.

The pandemic has posed special challenges to these federal systems. Although federal systems typically have many advantages—they can adapt policies to local conditions, for example, and experiment with different solutions to problems—pandemics and people cross regional borders, and controlling contagion requires a great deal of national coordination and intergovernmental cooperation. The four federal systems vary in their relative distribution of powers between regional and national governments, in the way that health care is administered, and in the variation in policies across regions. We focus on the early responses to COVID-19, from January through early May 2020. Three of these countries—Australia, Canada, and Germany—have done well in the crisis. They have acted quickly, done extensive testing and contact tracing, and had a relatively uniform set of policies across the country. The United States, in contrast, has had a disastrous response, wasting months at the start of the virus outbreak, with limited testing, poor intergovernmental cooperation, and widely divergent policies across the states and even within some states. The article seeks to explain both the relative uniform responses of these three very different federal systems, and the sharply divergent response of the United States.","Rozell, Mark J.; Wilcox, Clyde",Am.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical validity and utility of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: First month of testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on nasopharyngeal swabs at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland (11 066 persons). PARTICIPANTS: Of the 11 066 tested persons, 115 (1%) were hospitalized adults investigated for COVID-19. Clinical record review was performed to classify them into a COVID-19 case group (n = 60) or a non-COVID-19 control group (n = 55). The laboratory control groups comprised 513 persons not tested by NAAT: 160 healthy laboratory employees, 101 persons positive for IgG antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen, 215 positive for thyroperoxidase antibody, and 37 positive for rheumatoid factor. MEASUREMENTS: Serum IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay were 0.976 (95% CI, 0.928 to 0.995) and 0.988 (CI, 0.974 to 0.995), respectively, when performed 14 days or later after symptom onset, but sensitivity decreased at earlier time points. Immunoglobulin G developed rapidly and was sustained at high levels throughout follow-up (up to 58 days). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 predicted the odds of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, which increased by 62% (CI, 48% to 81%; P < 0.001) for every 2-fold increase in IgG. Of 11 066 NAAT-tested patients, 457 were repeatedly NAAT-negative, and serum samples were obtained for 18 such patients (6 COVID-19 case patients and 12 non-COVID-19 control patients). Antibodies were present in 5 of 6 case patients and none of the 12 control patients (P = 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The study was retrospective and performed at a single center; the sample was small; follow-up was limited; and selection bias may have occurred. CONCLUSION: Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate infection when measured at least 14 days after symptom onset, are associated with clinical severity, and provide valuable diagnostic support in patients who test negative by NAAT but remain clinically suspicious for COVID-19.

As a result, developing efficient catalysts with simultaneously high ORR activity and excellent antipoisoning methanol capability remains challenging. Here, we report a class of Pd-Te hexagonal nanoplates (HPs) with a Pd20Te7 phase that simultaneously overcome the activity and methanol-tolerant issues in alkaline DMFC. Because of the specific arrangement of Pd atoms deviated from typical hexagonal close-packing, Pd-Te HPs/C displays extraordinary methanol tolerance with high ORR performance compared with commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal that the high performance of Pd-Te HPs can be attributed to the breakthrough of the linear relationship between OOH* and OH* adsorption, which leaves sufficient room to improve the ORR activity but suppresses the methanol oxidation reaction. The concurrent high ORR activity and excellent methanol tolerance endow Pd-Te HPs as practical electrocatalysts for DMFC and beyond.","Zhang, Ying; Huang, Bolong; Luo, Gan; Sun, Tu; Feng, Yonggang; Wang, Yucheng; Ma, Yanhang; Shao, Qi; Li, Yafei; Zhou, Zhiyou; Huang, Xiaoqing",Sci Adv,526,22

Restricted by 40 and 14 HLA-class I and II allotypes, respectively, these responses have wide population coverage and might be of considerable academic, diagnostic and therapeutic interest. The broad coverage of epitopes and HLA overcame the otherwise confounding effects of HLA diversity and non-HLA background providing the first evidence of T cell immunodomination in humans. Also, double-staining of CD4+ T cells with tetramers representing the same HLA-binding core, albeit with different flanking regions, demonstrated an extensive diversification of the specificities of many CD4+ T cell responses. We suggest that this could reduce the risk of pathogen escape, and that multi-tetramer staining is required to reveal the true magnitude and diversity of CD4+ T cell responses. Our T cell epitope discovery approach uses a combination of (1) overlapping peptides representing the entire Yellow Fever virus proteome to search for peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell epitopes, (2) predictors of peptide-HLA binding to suggest epitopes and their restricting HLA allotypes, (3) generation of peptide-HLA tetramers to identify T cell epitopes, and (4) analysis of ex vivo T cell responses to validate the same. This approach is systematic, exhaustive, and can be done in any individual of any HLA haplotype. It is all-inclusive in the sense that it includes all protein antigens and peptide epitopes, and encompasses both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. It is efficient and, importantly, reduces the false discovery rate. The unbiased nature of the T cell epitope discovery approach presented here should support the refinement of future peptide-HLA class I and II predictors and tetramer technologies, which eventually should cover all HLA class I and II isotypes. We believe that future investigations of emerging pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) should include population-wide T cell epitope discovery using blood samples from patients, convalescents and/or long-term survivors, who might all hold important information on T cell epitopes and responses.","Stryhn, Anette; Kongsgaard, Michael; Rasmussen, Michael; Harndahl, Mikkel Nors; Østerbye, Thomas; Bassi, Maria Rosaria; Thybo, Søren; Gabriel, Mette; Hansen, Morten Bagge; Nielsen, Morten; Christensen, Jan Pravsgaard; Randrup Thomsen, Allan; Buus, Soren",Front Immunol,526,30

The study of sequential samples collected up to 64 days post-vaccination showed that serological assays measuring IgG against Wuhan-Hu-1 antigens were a poor proxy for VoCs neutralization. In addition, in subjects who had asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 prior to vaccination the loss of nAbs following disease can be rapid and protection from re-infection post-vaccination is often no better than in naive subjects. Interestingly, in health care workers naive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination induced a rapid and transient reactivation of pre-existing seasonal coronaviruses IgG responses that was associated with a subsequent reduced ability to neutralize some VoCs.","Dispinseri, Stefania; Marzinotto, Ilaria; Brigatti, Cristina; Pirillo, Maria Franca; Tolazzi, Monica; Bazzigaluppi, Elena; Canitano, Andrea; Borghi, Martina; Gallinaro, Alessandra; Caccia, Roberta; Vercesi, Riccardo; McKay, Paul F; Ciceri, Fabio; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Negri, Donatella; Cinque, Paola; Cara, Andrea; Lampasona, Vito; Scarlatti, Gabriella",,526,24

Previously it was estimated that there were 1.2 million YLLs associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the USA through 11 July 2020. The aim of this study is to update YLL estimates for the first full year of the pandemic. METHODS: We employed data regarding COVID-19 deaths in the USA through 31 January 2021 by jurisdiction, gender and age group. We used actuarial life expectancy tables by gender and age to estimate YLLs. RESULTS: We estimated roughly 3.9 million YLLs due to COVID-19 deaths, which correspond to roughly 9.2 YLLs per death. We observed a large range across states in YLLs per 10 000 capita, with New York City at 298 and Vermont at 12. Nationally, the YLLs per 10 000 capita were greater for males than females (136.3 versus 102.3), but there was significant variation in the differences across states.

Steps the urological community can take include increasing involvement in medical school curricula, increasing faculty mentor availability, and broadening students' range of urological experiences. Strategies to encourage interest in urology fall into three categories: creating interest, supporting interest, and removing barriers for students considering urology.

METHODS: Prospective multicentric cohort study in four olfactory ENT units and a screening center for COVID-19. RESULTS: i) Among a subset of 55 patients consulting for primarily recent loss of smell, we found that 51 (92.7%) had a COVID-19 positive test (median viral load of 28.8 cycle threshold). Loss of smell was mostly total (anosmia), rarely associated with nasal obstruction but associated with a taste disorder in 80%. Olfactory dysfunction occurred suddenly, either as first complaint or preceded by mild symptoms occurring a median of 3 days. The majority of patients (72.9%) partially recovered the sense of smell within 15 days. ii) In a population of 1824 patients tested for COVID-19, the positive predictive value and the specificity of loss of smell and/or taste were 78.5% and 90.3% respectively (sensitivity (40.8%), negative predictive value (63.6%)).

For this purpose, we collected wastewater from two European cities during the Covid-19 pandemic and evaluated the sensitivity of RT-qPCR detection of viral RNA after four concentration methods (two variants of ultrafiltration-based method and two adsorption and extraction-based methods). Further, we evaluated one external (bovine corona virus) and one internal (pepper mild mottle virus) reference virus. We found a consistently higher recovery of spiked virus using the modified ultrafiltration-based method. This method also had a significantly higher efficiency (p-value <0.01) for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detection. The ultracentrifugation method was the only method that detected SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater of both cities.

Common clinical manifestations of HLH are acute unremitting fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and multiorgan failure. Due to a massive cytokine release, this clinical condition is considered as a cytokine storm syndrome. HPS has primary and acquired (secondary, reactive) forms. Its primary form is mostly seen in childhood and caused by various mutations with genetic inheritance and, therefore, is called familial HLH. Secondary HLH may be caused in the presence of an underlying disorder, that is, secondary to a malignant, infectious, or autoimmune/autoinflammatory stimulus. This paper aims to review the pathogenesis and the clinical picture of HLH, and its severe complication, the cytokine storm, with a special emphasis on the developed classification criteria sets for rheumatologists, since COVID-19 infection has clinical symptoms resembling those of the common rheumatologic conditions and possibly triggers HLH. MED-LINE/Pubmed was searched from inception to April 2020, and the following terms were used for data searching: ""hemophagocytic syndrome"" OR ""macrophage activation syndrome"" OR ""hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"", OR ""cytokine storm"". Finally, AND ""COVID-19"" was included in this algorithm. The selection is restricted to the past 5 years and limited numbers of earlier key references were manually selected. Only full-text manuscripts, published in an English language peer-reviewed journal were included. Manuscript selection procedure and numbers are given in Fig. 2. Briefly, the database search with the following terms of ""Hemophagocytic syndrome"" OR ""Macrophage activation syndrome"" OR ""Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"" OR ""Cytokine storm"" yielded 6744 results from inception to April 2020. The selection is restricted to the past 5 years and only limited numbers of earlier key references were selected, and this algorithm resulted in 3080 manuscripts. The addition of (AND ""COVID-19"") resulted in 115 publications of which 47 studies, together with four sections of an online book were used in the final review. No statistical method was used. HLH is triggered by genetic conditions, infections, malignancies, autoimmune-autoinflammatory diseases, and some drugs. In COVID-19 patients, secondary HLH and cytokine storm may be responsible for unexplained progressive fever, cytopenia, ARDS, neurological and renal impairment. Differentiation between the primary and secondary forms of HLH is utterly important, since primary form of HLH requires complicated treatments such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Further studies addressing the performance of HScore and other recommendations in the classification of these patients is necessary.","Soy, Mehmet; Atagündüz, Pamir; Atagündüz, Isik; Sucak, Gülsan Türköz",Rheumatol.Int,526,1

Unfortunately, the Web is plagued by reference rot which causes important Web resources to disappear. Web archive collections help reduce the costly effects of reference rot by saving Web resources that chronicle important stories/events before they disappear. These collections often begin with URLs called seeds, hand-selected by experts or scraped from social media. The quality of social media content varies widely, therefore, we propose a framework for assigning multi-dimensional quality scores to social media seeds for Web archive collections about stories and events. We leveraged contributions from social media research for attributing quality to social media content and users based on credibility, reputation, and influence. We combined these with additional contributions from the Web archive research that emphasizes the importance of considering geographical and temporal constraints when selecting seeds. Next, we developed the Quality Proxies (QP) framework which assigns seeds extracted from social media a quality score across 10 major dimensions: popularity, geographical, temporal, subject expert, retrievability, relevance, reputation, and scarcity. We instantiated the framework and showed that seeds can be scored across multiple QP classes that map to different policies for ranking seeds such as prioritizing seeds from local news, reputable and/or popular sources, etc. The QP framework is extensible and robust. Our results showed that Quality Proxies resulted in the selection of quality seeds with increased precision (by ~0.13) when novelty is and is not prioritized. These contributions provide an explainable score applicable to rank and select quality seeds for Web archive collections and other domains.","Nwala, Alexander C.; Weigle, Michele C.; Nelson, Michael L.",,526,22

In order to contain the spread of the virus, a large number of countries across the globe have shut their schools to handle the pandemic. However, it has adversely affected students' learning and school attendance. In this regard, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on the learning loss, school dropout, and the economic costs in term of foregone earnings for children in Pakistan. The study finds a substantial decrease in Learning Adjusted Years of Schooling (LAYS) with worsening consequences for girls than boys. Likewise, the aggregate economic cost amounts to 107 billion dollars when adjusted for human capital utilisation. Besides, our simulation results suggest that about 7.2 million children dropout due to a reduction in household expenditure by 50 percent. In comparison, the dropout is more pronounced at the primary level of schooling. The results recommend that the government design robust social protection and remote education strategies to mitigate school closure’s adverse effect on children's learning. The emphasis should be rather on the long run strategies to cope with a resilient education system of futuristic orientation.","Jehangir Khan, Muhammad Ahmed Junaid",Children and Youth Services Review,526,1

A good understanding of the dynamic of the disease would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID19. However, to the best of our knowledge, the unique features of the outbreak have limited the applications of all existing dynamic models. In this paper, a novel stochastic model was proposed aiming to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We found that: (1) instead of aberration, there was a remarkable amount of asymptomatic virus carriers, (2) a virus carrier with symptoms was approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic virus carrier, (3) the transmission rate reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, and (4) it was expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the selected provinces and cities in China.","Zhang, Yuan; You, Chong; Cai, Zhenhao; Sun, Jiarui; Hu, Wenjie; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",Sci Rep,526,2

The process is based on the application of a liquid film on the surface or object under sterilization (OUS). A beacon signal is required to self-steer the transmitted power from the designed retrodirective antenna array (RDA) towards the OUS;once the liquid film reaches the required temperature, the sterilization can be considered complete. Results suggest that the process takes 5 minutes or less for an angular coverage range over 60 whilst abiding by the relevant safety protocols. This paper also models the power incident onto the OUS and results are consistent with full-wave simulations. A practical RDA system is developed operating at 2.5 GHz and tested through the positioning of a representative target aperture surface. Measurements, developed by sampling the power transmitted by the heterodyne RDA, are reported for various distances and angles, operating in the near-field of the system. To further validate the methodology, an additional experiment investigating virus deactivation through microwave heating was also reported using live Coronavirus (strain 229E). Possible applications of the method include the sterilization of ambulances, medical equipment, and internet of things (IoT) devices. CCBY","Kossenas, K.; Podilchak, S. K.; Comite, D.; Hilario Re, P.

In particular, the data from Nepal, a developing country having an open border provision with highly COVID-19 affected country India, has shown a biphasic pattern of epidemic, a controlled phase (until July 21, 2020) followed by an outgrown phase (after July 21, 2020). To uncover the effective strategies implemented during the controlled phase, we develop a mathematical model that is able to describe the data from both phases of COVID-19 dynamics in Nepal. Using our best parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval, we found that during the controlled phase most of the recorded cases were imported from outside the country with a small number generated from the local transmission, consistent with the data. Our model predicts that these successful strategies were able to maintain the reproduction number at around 0.21 during the controlled phase, preventing 442,640 cases of COVID-19 and saving more than 1,200 lives in Nepal. However, during the outgrown phase, when the strategies such as border screening and quarantine, lockdown, and detection and isolation, were altered, the reproduction number raised to 1.8, resulting in exponentially growing cases of COVID-19. We further used our model to predict the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 in Nepal and found that without any interventions the current trend may result in about 18.76 million cases (10.70 million detected and 8.06 million undetected) and 89 thousand deaths in Nepal by the end of 2021. Finally, using our predictive model, we evaluated the effects of various control strategies on the long-term outcome of this epidemics and identified ideal strategies to curb the epidemic in Nepal.","Adhikari, Khagendra; Gautam, Ramesh; Pokharel, Anjana; Uprety, Kedar Nath; Vaidya, Naveen K",J Theor Biol,526,1

OBJECTIVE: This study aim to investigate the possibility of ocular toxicity and the need for ophthalmic counseling to prescribe this therapeutic protocol. METHODS: All the articles that were most relevant to the COVID-19 therapeutic or prophylactic options and CQ derivative ocular toxicity, were founded by a literature search and were thoroughly reviewed. RESULTS: Anecdotal recent reports introduce CQ/HCQ as an effective therapeutic or prophylactic choice for COVID-19. Because of the short time prescribe and the insignificant cumulative dose of the drug on the one hand and higher risk of cross infection during ophthalmic examination on the other hand, ophthalmologic consult is not recommended except in high-risk patients for retinal toxicity. CONCLUSION: This study recommended ophthalmic evaluation before CQ/HCQ prescription for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19 only in preexisting maculopathy.","Bagheri, Masood; Rashe, Zahra; Ahur, Mohammad Hosein; Eidizadeh, Mojtaba",Recent patents on anti-infective drug discovery (Online),526,29

TCP inhibits secretion of sex hormones. Similar to CPF, TCP can bind to sex steroid hormone receptors and decrease the secretion of sex hormones. However, little attention has been paid to the ability of TCP and CPF to interfere with androgen receptor (AR) in Sertoli cells. This study aimed to explain how TCP promotes the inhibitory effect of CPF on the paracrine function of Sertoli cells. Western blotting indicated that after 20 weeks of exposure, expression of AR in testes was significantly reduced by CPF. An in vitro assay measured the cytotoxicity of CPF, TCP and diethylphosphate (DEP) on viability of Sertoli cells by Cell Counting Kit-8. CPF cytotoxicity was greater than that of TCP, and TCP cytotoxicity was greater than that of DEP at concentrations of 1000 µmol/L. Western blotting indicated that TCP and CPF both decreased expression of AR and cAMP-response element binding protein phosphorylation, while DEP had no effect in Sertoli cells, which are important in regulating paracrine function of Sertoli cells. The fluorescence measurements and docking studies revealed that testosterone, CPF and TCP showed four types of intermolecular interactions with AR, highlighting alkyl bonds with some of the same amino acids. Compared with testosterone, CPF and TCP also showed significant synergistic interaction with AR. CPF interacted with more amino acids and interaction energy than TCP did. This research elucidates TCP in the antiandrogenic effect of CPF on the paracrine function and suggests that TCP or chemicals with a trichloropyridine structure must be considered during reproductive toxicity assessment of potential environmental pollutants.","Gao, Haina; Li, Jinwang; Zhao, Guoping; Li, Yixuan",Toxicology,526,19

While pandemic management differs insofar as the responsibility lies with the public rather than identifiable regulatory bodies, and governments must weigh competing risks in creating policy, we conclude that many of the strategies identified in our trust model can be successfully applied to the maintenance of trust in public health officials prior to, during, and after pandemics.","Henderson, Julie; Ward, Paul R; Tonkin, Emma; Meyer, Samantha B; Pillen, Heath; McCullum, Dean; Toson, Barbara; Webb, Trevor; Coveney, John; Wilson, Annabelle",Front Public Health,526,1

The purpose of this study was to report the rates of documented oral and oropharyngeal manifestations among these patients and to determine the association of these findings with other MIS-C symptoms. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian. Patients fulfilling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for MIS-C were included in this study. The documented signs, symptoms, and laboratory values were collected and compared with the presence of oral or oropharyngeal findings. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) age of MIS-C patients was 9.0 (5.0) years (range, 1.3-20.0 years), and there was no obvious sex difference (51.1% male, 48.9% female). With respect to oral findings, 23 patients (48.9%) had red or swollen lips, whereas only 5 (10.6%) had a strawberry tongue. Oral or oropharyngeal findings were associated significantly with the presence of systemic rash (P = .04) and conjunctivitis (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of oral or oropharyngeal changes may be an early indicator of MIS-C and should be considered suggestive of MIS-C in the setting of COVID-19 infection. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dental care providers may play an integral role both in the early detection of oral manifestations of MIS-C and in the identification of oral lesions in hospitalized patients with confirmed MIS-C.","Halepas, Steven; Lee, Kevin C; Myers, Aaron; Yoon, Richard K; Chung, Wendy; Peters, Scott M",J Am Dent Assoc,526,10

We pursue insights about inequity in leveraging online information, spanning challenges with access and abilities to effectively seek and use digital information2-4. We observe a widening of digital inequalities through a population-scale study of 55 billion everyday web search interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic across 25,150 US ZIP codes. We observe that ZIP codes with low socioeconomic status (SES) and high racial/ethnic diversity did not leverage health information and pandemic-relevant online resources (e.g., online learning, online food delivery) as much as regions with higher SES and lower levels of diversity. We also show increased shifts in online information access to financial or unemployment assistance for ZIP codes with low SES and high racial/ethnic diversity. These findings demonstrate that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities in online information access and highlight the role of large-scale, anonymized data about online search activities in digital disparities research. The results frame important questions and future research on identifying and targeting interventions for vulnerable subpopulations that could reduce further widening of digital access inequalities and associated downstream outcomes including health, education, and employment3.","Suh, Jina; Horvitz, Eric; White, Ryen W.; Althoff, Tim",,526,23

The article took note of all the necessary interpretations and introductions to the book of Lamentations and concluded that it can be read as lament and, in particular, communal lament The language of lament, sometimes lost in a world of technology and positivity, can be helpful to verbalise loss and trauma This elicited a discussion of trauma and biblical studies, and how they interact Much of literature that originated in traumatic circumstances became ‘meaning-making literature’ It was the case with Lamentations back in the wake of 586 BCE and also in many other instances when the book was re-read This article provided examples of these instances The invitation was then accepted to read some of the verses in Lamentations through the lens of the trauma created by COVID-19, and many similarities were found Contribution: Although Jerusalem was destroyed by an enemy that could be seen, and COVID-19 is caused by an enemy that cannot be seen, there are many similarities between the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation in Jerusalem as lamented by Lamentations As ‘meaning-making literature’, lament is sometimes the only fitting response to the incomprehensible reality of pain and suffering Lament defies the cheap answers so often given by religion when it is confronted with mystery, doubt and despair This seemed to be the case in Lamentations It was concluded that Lamentations can help readers through the process of trauma therapy as it opens the wound and helps the individual to connect with the bigger community in trying to make sense of it all and to involve others in the pain The newness of the COVID-19 pandemic and a response from an Old Testament perspective, made the scope of this article relevant","Serfontein, Johan L.",In die Skriflig,526,20

With the increase in cases & mortality rate, various health issues viz., stress, mental disorders and altered health-related quality of life have been noted as a result of pandemic and lockdowns. This study aimed to assess the association of COVID-19 pandemic stress with health-related quality of life in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methodology: It was a cross-sectional analytical study. Subjects included 878 citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia aged 18 years and above. Convenience, non-probability sampling technique was used. A web-based, self-administered, electronic questionnaire in Arabic language having three sections; Sociodemographic & clinical profile, Standard PSS-10, and Standard SF-12 was used as the study tool and distributed through various social media means. The study period was of 2 months. Data were analyzed using SPS version 25. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, independent sample t-test and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed for suitable statistical analysis. Results: Almost two-thirds of the subjects were between the age of 18 to < 40 and majority (74.1%) being females. Majority (83.0%) reported as having no chronic diseases, and 69.5% had no contact history with COVID-19 cases. The mean of MCS & PCS was (32.34 ± 25.30) & (41.65 ± 11.82), respectively. Majority (67.6%) had a moderate level of COVID-19 stress. A significant negative relationship between total stress scores and HRQOL domains was observed. Conclusion: Majority subjects had a moderate level of stress related to COVID-19 lockdown. Stress during COVID-19 has a significant negative association with both physical and mental HRQOL in which MCS was significantly lower than PCS. It is recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of stress management program and follow a holistic approach.","Hawash, Manal Mohammed; Alhazmi, Amani Hamad; Wafik, Wagida; Muzammil, Khursheed; Mushfiq, Sakeena; Ahmed, Hala Awad",Front Public Health,526,2

However, the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2-induced EMT has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 induces EMT phenotypic change and stemness in breast cancer cell model and subsequently identified Snail as a modulator for this regulation. The in-depth analysis identifies the spike protein (S), but not envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), or membrane protein (M), of SARS-CoV-2 induces EMT marker changes. Suppression of Snail expression in these cells abrogates S protein-induced invasion, migration, stemness, and lung metastasis, suggesting that Snail is required for SARS-CoV-2-mediated aggressive phenotype in cancer.

Susan Bredlau has recently presented a reading of Plato's dialogue Charmides, which portrays Socrates as a pioneer of the phenomenological approach to illness. I use a critical discussion of Bredlau's interpretation of the Charmides to show that the phenomenology of illness also has its shortcomings and needs to be complemented by still other approaches. While Bredlau does make a number of highly apt and relevant suggestions as to how a narrow biomedical approach to illness may be corrected, some (but not all) of which are related to phenomenology, the attribution to Plato's Socrates of a phenomenological approach is mistaken. Characteristically, Socrates shows little interest in the personal experience of a patient. He is more concerned with the patient's lifestyle and conduct and so suggests an alternative or complementary perspective, stressing the importance of education and prevention to health care.","Klausen, Søren Harnow",J. med. philos,526,13

However, COVID-19, with it associated restrictions, has brought changes to various aspects of Ghanaians’ lives. In this paper, we review information from government websites, online media websites, social media, academic articles, and anecdotal evidence to track changes brought about by the pandemic. Specifically, we focus on economic well-being, education and schooling, family interaction, mental health and communication in community as well ethnic, cultural, and social class variations. Findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic is changing life for all Ghanaians, notably by reinforcing existing inequalities and highlighting previously known gaps in service, coverage, and access across multiple sectors, including healthcare, business and education. Family patterns are changing for both the nuclear and extended family units. The pandemic has created both challenges and opportunities for parents to engage with their children. Anxiety levels are heightened and psychological services have consequently been made widely available. Education has slowly and unevenly gone virtual. Further, the crisis has generated local innovations to meet the nation’s needs during the pandemic. The findings call for national reforms in the production and distribution of goods and services in all sectors as well as empirical work into the long-term effects of the pandemic on Ghanaians.Alternate abstract: En tant que pays à revenu intermédiaire de la tranche inférieure, le Ghana est réputé pour son économie, son système de santé et ses tendances familiales progressistes.

Plus précisément, nous nous concentrons sur le bien-être économique, l'éducation et la scolarité, l'interaction familiale, la santé mentale et la communication au sein de la communauté ainsi que les variations de classe ethnique, culturelle et sociale. Les résultats montrent que la pandémie de COVID-19 change la vie de tous les Ghanéens, notamment en renforçant les inégalités existantes et en mettant en évidence les lacunes précédemment connues en matière de services, de couverture et d'accès dans plusieurs secteurs, notamment les soins de santé, les affaires et l'éducation.

Looking back in history, airborne transimission diseases have caused huge casualties several times. COVID-19 as a typical airborne disease caught our attention and reminded us of the importance of preventing such diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on finding a new way to guard against the spread of these diseases such as COVID-19. This paper studies the dynamic electromechanical response of metal-core piezoelectric fiber/epoxy matrix composites, designed as mass load sensors for virus detection, by numerical modelling. The dynamic electromechanical response is simulated by applying an alternating electric current field to make the composite vibrate. Furthermore, both concentrated and distributed loads are considered to assess the sensitivity of the biosensor during modelling of the combination of both biomarker and viruses. The design parameters of this sensor, such as the resonant frequency, the position and size of the biomarker, will be studied and optimized as the key values to determine the sensitivity of detection. The novelty of this work is to propose functional composites that can detect the viruses from changes of the output voltage instead of the resonance frequency change using piezoelectric sensor and piezoelectric actuator. The contribution of this detection method is that it does not require fast Fourier transform (FFT) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT) analysis and will shorten the detection time. The outcome of this research offers a reliable numerical model to optimize the design of the proposed biosensor for virus detection, which will contribute to the production of high-performance piezoelectric biosensors in the future.","Wang, Yinli; Shi, Yu; Narita, Fumio",Sens Actuators A Phys,526,24

All mammals use fever to deal with infections and heat has been used throughout human history in the form of hot springs, saunas, hammams, steam-rooms, sweat-lodges, steam inhalations, hot mud and poultices to prevent and treat respiratory infections and enhance health and wellbeing. This paper reviews the evidence for using heat to treat and prevent viral infections and discusses potential cellular, physiological and psychological mechanisms of action. In the initial phase of infection, heat applied to the upper airways can support the immune system's first line of defence by supporting muco-ciliary clearance and inhibiting or deactivating virions in the place where they first lodge. This may be further enhanced by the inhalation of steam containing essential oils with anti-viral, mucolytic and anxiolytic properties. Heat applied to the whole body can further support the immune system's second line of defence by mimicking fever and activating innate and acquired immune defences and building physiological resilience. Heat-based treatments also offer psychological benefits by directing focus on positive action, enhancing relaxation and sleep, inducing 'forced-mindfulness', and invoking the power of positive thinking and remembered wellness. Heat is a cheap, convenient and widely accessible therapeutic modality and while no clinical protocols exist for using heat to treat COVID-19, protocols that draw from traditional practices and consider contraindications, adverse effects and infection control measures could be developed and implemented rapidly and inexpensively on a wide scale. While there are significant challenges in implementing heat-based therapies during the current pandemic, these therapies present an opportunity to integrate natural medicine, conventional medicine and traditional wellness practices, and support the wellbeing of both patients and medical staff, while building community resilience and reducing the likelihood and impact of future pandemics.","Cohen, Marc",F1000Res,526,20

Aim: To describe the epidemiological behavior of COVID-19 in response to the control strategies implemented by the Chilean Ministry of Health and its similarities with the socio-economic distribution of TB in the Metropolitan Region (MR) of Chile. Material and Methods: The 2018 Tuberculosis rates and average income of districts belonging to the MR were described, as well as the incidence rates of COVID-19. A Pearson correlation analysis was applied between the rates of both diseases, to assess similarities in the epidemiological distribution patterns. Results: The RM accounts for over 50% of the total national cases of COVID-19. After the implementation of selective quarantines, only four districts in the RM managed to control the outbreak (those with the highest incomes). In the rest, a clear increase in cases was observed. The districts with the highest increase in cases were the most disadvantaged, and those with the highest TB rates during 2018, with a correlation coefficient of 0.6.

In this paper, we study maximizing the network lifetime of an energy-harvesting LoRa network. Such a network is characterized by heterogeneous recharging capabilities across the nodes that is not taken into account in existing work. We propose a link-layer protocol to achieve a long-lived LoRa network which dynamically enables the nodes with depleting batteries to exploit the superfluous energy of the neighboring nodes with affluent batteries by letting a depleting node offload its packets to an affluent node. By exploiting the LoRa's capability of adjusting multiple transmission parameters, we enable low-cost offloading by depleting nodes instead of high-cost direct forwarding. Such offloading requires synchronization of wake-up times as well as transmission parameters between the two nodes which also need to be selected dynamically. The proposed protocol addresses these challenges and prolongs the lifetime of a LoRa network through three novel techniques. (1) We propose a lightweight medium access control protocol for peer-to-peer communication to enable packet offloading which circumvents the synchronization overhead between the two nodes. (2) We propose an intuitive heuristic method for effective parameter selections for different modes (conventional vs. offloading). (3) We analyze the energy overhead of offloading and, based on it, the protocol dynamically selects affluent and depleting nodes while ensuring that an affluent node is not overwhelmed by the depleting ones. Simulations in NS-3 as well as real experiments show that our protocol can increase the network lifetime up to $4$ times while maintaining the same throughput compared to traditional LoRa network.","Fahmida, Sezana; Modekurthy, Venkata P; Rahman, Mahbubur; Saifullah, Abusayeed; Brocanelli, Marco",,526,16

Government mitigation strategies included a series of behavior-based prevention policies that had a likely impact on the spread of other contagious respiratory illnesses, such as seasonal influenza. Our aim was to explore how 2019-2020 influenza tracked onto COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation methods. Materials and Methods: We linked the WHO FluNet database and COVID-19 confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University) for four countries across the northern (Canada, the United States) and southern hemispheres (Australia, Brazil) for the period 2016-2020. Graphical presentations of longitudinal data were provided. Results: There was a notable reduction in influenza cases for the 2019-2020 season. Northern hemisphere countries experienced a quicker ending to the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza cases (shortened by 4-7 weeks) and virtually no 2020 fall influenza season. Countries from the southern hemisphere experienced drastically low levels of seasonal influenza, with consistent trends that were approaching zero cases after the introduction of COVID-19 measures. Conclusions: It is likely that the COVID-19 mitigation measures played a notable role in the marked decrease in influenza, with little to no influenza activity in both the northern and southern hemispheres. In spite of this reduction in influenza cases, there was still community spread of COVID-19, highlighting the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza. These results, together with the higher mortality rate from SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza, highlight that COVID-19 is a far greater health threat than influenza.","Stojanovic, Jovana; Boucher, Vincent G; Boyle, Jacqueline; Enticott, Joanne; Lavoie, Kim L; Bacon, Simon L",Front Public Health,526,16

Predictions made using a geostatistical model have uncertainty that typically varies spatially. However, this uncertainty is difficult to map with the estimate itself and is often not included as a result, thereby generating a potentially misleading sense of certainty about disease burden or other important variables. To remedy this, we propose simultaneously visualising predictions and their associated uncertainty within a single map by varying pixel size. We illustrate our approach using examples of malaria incidence, but the method could be applied to predictions of any spatial continua with associated uncertainty.","Taylor, Aimee R; Watson, James A; Buckee, Caroline O",,526,22

METHODS: Twenty-five participants completed self-report measures assessing worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ), anxiety (Anxiety Sensitivity Index, ASI-3), and trait mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS) at T0 (pre-lockdown, 4 November 2019-17 February 2020) and T1 (at the end of lockdown, 26 April-30 April 2020). We compared assessments at the two time points in the whole sample and in high and low worriers (defined at T0 by scores on PSWQ respectively above and below 1.5 SD from mean of the Italian normative sample). OUTCOMES: High worriers showed at T1 a significant increase of anxiety sensitivity and fear of mental health in comparison to low worriers. Moreover, in the whole sample, at T1 trait mindfulness was inversely related to worry and fear of mental health. INTERPRETATION: A valuable approach to support individuals experiencing anxiety related to the COVID-19 outbreak could be represented by mindfulness-based interventions improving the ability to focus attention and awareness on the present moment.","Baiano, Chiara; Zappullo, Isa; Conson, Massimiliano",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),526,10

Additionally, accurate assessment of the evolution, extent and dynamics of the outbreak are required to understand the transmission of the virus amongst seemingly unrelated cases and provide critical epidemiological information. To address these challenges, we evaluated a new high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS), respiratory viral panel (RVP) that includes 40 viral pathogens with the aim of analyzing viral subtypes, mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, model to understand the spread of the virus in the state of Georgia, USA, and to assess other circulating viruses in the same population. MethodsThis study evaluated a total of 522 samples that included 483 patient samples and 42 synthetic positive control material. The performance metrics were calculated for both clinical and reference control samples by comparing detection results with the RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection (LoD) studies were conducted as per the FDA guidelines. Inference and visualization of the phylogeny of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences were performed through the Nextstrain Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, utilizing the associated augur and auspice toolkits. ResultsThe performance metrics calculated using both the clinical samples and the reference controls revealed a PPA, NPA and accuracy of 95.98%, 85.96% and 94.4%, respectively. The LoD was determined to be 10 copies/ml with all 25 replicates detected across two different runs. The clade for pangolin lineage B that contains certain distant variants, including P4715L in ORF1ab, Q57H in ORF 3a and, S84L in ORF8 covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation were the most prevalent, early in the pandemic, in Georgia, USA. In our analysis, isolates from the same county formed paraphyletic groups, which indicated virus transmission between counties. ConclusionThe study demonstrates the clinical and public health utility of the NGS-RVP to identify novel variants that can provide actionable information to prevent or mitigate emerging viral threats, models that provide insights into viral transmission patterns and predict transmission/ resurgence of regional outbreaks and provide critical information on co-circulating respiratory viruses that might be independent factors contributing to the global disease burden.","Sahajpal, Nikhil Shri; Mondal, Ashis K; Njau, Allan; Petty, Zachary; Chen, Jiani; Ananth, Sudha; Ahluwalia, Pankaj; Williams, Colin; Ross, Ted M; Chaubey, Alka; DeSantis, Grace; Schroth, Gary P.; Bahl, Justin; Kolhe, Ravindra",,526,24

The need to share individual-level medical data to accelerate innovation in precision medicine continues to grow, and has never been more urgent, as scientists grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, enthusiasm for the use of big data has been tempered by a fully appropriate concern for patient autonomy and privacy. That is, the ability to extract private or confidential information about an individual, in practice, renders it difficult to share data, since significant infrastructure and data governance must be established before data can be shared. Although HIPAA provided de-identification as an approved mechanism for data sharing, linkage attacks were identified as a major vulnerability. A variety of mechanisms have been established to avoid leaking private information, such as field suppression or abstraction, strictly limiting the amount of information that can be shared, or employing mathematical techniques such as differential privacy. Another approach, which we focus on here, is creating synthetic data that mimics the underlying data. For synthetic data to be a useful mechanism in support of medical innovation and a proxy for real-world evidence, one must demonstrate two properties of the synthetic dataset: (1) any analysis on the real data must be matched by analysis of the synthetic data (statistical fidelity) and (2) the synthetic data must preserve privacy, with minimal risk of re-identification (privacy guarantee). In this paper we propose a framework for quantifying the statistical fidelity and privacy preservation properties of synthetic datasets and demonstrate these metrics for synthetic data generated by Syntegra technology.","Mendelevitch, Ofer; Lesh, Michael D.",,526,29

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 39 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in an experienced ECMO center at a tertiary hospital during March/April 2020. Among the recruited participants, 10 (25.6%) required ECMO (ICU-ECMO group) and 29 (74.4%) did not have ECMO support (ICU group). Immunological parameters were assessed both at ICU admission and on a daily basis for 7 consecutive days. RESULTS: The absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly in the ICU-ECMO group compared to the ICU group in which it remained relatively stable: ß for the time variable was 127.1 [95% CI 68.9 - 185.3], p < 0.001 and for the interaction term -141.36 [-208.95 - -73.77], p < 0.001. On the other hand, globally, no significant differences were observed over time for the lymphocyte percentage, although it was higher in the ICU patients. Neutrophil counts were overall higher in the ICU-ECMO group (ß -4,275.38 [-6,845.21 - 1,705.55], p = 0.001). In regard to neutrophil percentage, a significant decrease over time was reported (ß -1.76 [-3.16 - -0.36], p = 0.014), namely in the ICU-ECMO group (ß for the interaction 2.09 [0.45 - 3.73], p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we found ECMO support seems to provide a less aggressive immune response in COVID-19 patients with severe and refractory respiratory dysfunction.","Fragao-Marques, Mariana; Barroso, Isaac; Loureiro, Hugo; Duarte-Gamas, Luis; Pinheiro, Dolores; Guimarães, João T",Clin. lab,526,1

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the utilization of health and rehabilitation services and the general health and physical status of children with CP. In addition, the second aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers' quality of life (QOL) and their fear of COVID-19. METHODS: The utilization of children health and rehabilitation services during the pandemic, the general health and physical status of the children during the pandemic, and the children and caregivers' history of COVID-19 infections were questioned. Furthermore, the caregivers' level of fear of COVID-19 and their QOL were examined. RESULTS: One hundred twenty caregivers were contacted by phone, and 94 (78.33%) caregivers agreed to participate in the study. Sixty-three of 94 children (67.1%) did not attend their routine control check-up during the pandemic. Twelve children (12.8%) discontinued their physical therapy sessions during the pandemic. Caregivers physical and mental QOL significantly decreased during the pandemic (p < 0.05). The median of caregivers' Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) was 17.5 (7-35). CONCLUSION: We think that more attention should be given to telerehabilitation and telemedicine services of the clinicians who deal with the children with CP, and their caregivers in order to prevent the negative effects of future pandemic periods.","Cankurtaran, Damla; Tezel, Nihal; Yildiz, Sadik Yigit; Celik, Gulnur; Unlu Akyuz, Ece",Ir. j. med. sci,526,5

These mobility reports help to quantify the effect of the population movement restrictions on the evolution of the active infection cases. We also approximate the number of the population infected unreported, the proportion of those that need hospitalization, and estimate the end of the epidemic wave. Moreover, we use our model to estimate the second wave of the COVID-19 Algeria and Morocco and to project the end of the second wave. Finally, we suggest some additional measures that can be considered to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 and would lead to a second wave of the spread of the virus in these countries.","Djilali, Salih; Benahmadi, Lahbib; Tridane, Abdessamad; Niri, Khadija",,526,26

This study examines the characteristics of air pollutants, including PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 µm), gas pollutants, water-soluble ions (WSIs), black carbon (BC) and elements, as well as the source apportionment of PM2.5 in Suzhou before, during and after the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday of 2020 (when China was under an unprecedented state of lockdown to restrict the COVID-19 outbreak). Compared to those before CNY, PM2.5, BC, SNA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), other ions, elements, and NO2 and CO mass concentrations decreased by 9.9%-64.0% during CNY. The lockdown policy had strong (weak) effects on the diurnal variations in aerosol chemical compositions (gas pollutants). Compared to those before CNY, source concentrations and contributions of vehicle exhaust during CNY decreased by 72.9% and 21.7%, respectively. In contrast, increased contributions from coal combustion and industry were observed during CNY, which were recorded to be 2.9 and 1.7 times higher than those before CNY, respectively. This study highlights that the lockdown policy that was imposed in Suzhou during CNY not only reduced the mass concentrations of air pollutants but also modified their diurnal variations and the source contributions of PM2.5, which revealed the complex responses of PM2.5 sources to the rare, low emissions of anthropogenic pollutants that occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Wang, Honglei; Miao, Qing; Shen, Lijuan; Yang, Qian; Wu, Yezheng; Wei, Heng",Environ Pollut,526,25

The initial step to identifying potential candidates usually involves in vitro screening that includes standard cytotoxicity controls. Under-appreciated is that viable, but stressed or otherwise compromised cells, can also have a reduced capacity to replicate virus. A refinement proposed herein for in vitro drug screening thus includes a simple growth assay to identify drug concentrations that cause cellular stress or ""cytomorbidity"", as distinct from cytotoxicity or loss of viability. METHODS: A simple rapid bioassay is presented for antiviral drug screening using Vero E6 cells and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 induced cytopathic effects (CPE) measured using crystal violet staining. We use high cell density for cytotoxicity assays, and low cell density for cytomorbidity assays. RESULTS: The assay clearly illustrated the anti-viral activity of remdesivir, a drug known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. In contrast, nitazoxanide, oleuropein, cyclosporine A and ribavirin all showed no ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 CPE. Hydroxychloroquine, cyclohexamide, didemnin B, Î³-mangostin and linoleic acid were all able to inhibit viral CPE at concentrations that did not induce cytotoxicity. However, these drugs inhibited CPE at concentrations that induced cytomorbidity, indicating non-specific anti-viral activity. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the methodology for a simple in vitro drug screening assay that identifies potential anti-viral drugs via their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE. The additional growth assay illustrated how several drugs display anti-viral activity at concentrations that induce cytomorbidity. For instance, hydroxychloroquine showed anti-viral activity at concentrations that slow cell growth, arguing that its purported in vitro anti-viral activity arises from non-specific impairment of cellular activities. The cytomorbidity assay can therefore rapidly exclude potential false positives.","Yan, Kexin; Rawle, Daniel J; Le, Thuy T; Suhrbier, Andreas",Virol J,526,5

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms ""Prevention coronavirus,"" ""Prevention COVID-19,"" ""Prevención coronavirus,"" and ""Prevención COVID-19"". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was ""wash your hands frequently"" (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to ""stay home if you feel unwell"" (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39). According to the country of publication (Spain versus the United States), significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations such as ""wash your hands frequently"" (OR 9.82), ""cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze"" (OR 4.59), or ""stay home if you feel unwell"" (OR 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations when seeking information on COVID-19 preventive measures on the internet. In this way, users will be able to obtain high-quality information more frequently, and such websites may improve their accessibility and positioning, given that search engines justify the positioning of links obtained in a search based on the frequency of access to them.","Hernández-García, Ignacio; Giménez-Júlvez, Teresa",JMIR Public Health Surveill,526,26

We assessed patterns of greenspace use in relation to individual and environmental factors and their relationship with experiencing psychological symptoms under the pandemic. We conducted an online survey recruiting participants from social media for adults in Korea for September-December 2020. The survey collected data on demographics, patterns of using greenspace during the pandemic, and major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) were applied to identify probable cases of MD and GAD. A logistic regression model assessed the association decreased visits to greenspace after the outbreak compared to 2019 and probable MD and GAD. Among the 322 survey participants, prevalence of probable MD and GAD were 19.3% and 14.9%, respectively. High rates of probable MD (23.3%) and GAD (19.4%) were found among persons currently having job-related and financial issues. Of the total participants, 64.9% reported decreased visits to greenspace after the COVID-19 outbreak. Persons with decreased visits to greenspace had 2.06 higher odds (95% CI: 0.91, 4.67, significant at p < 0.10) of probable MD at the time of the survey than persons whose visits to greenspace increased or did not change. Decreased visits to greenspace were not significantly associated with GAD (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.63, 3.34). Findings suggest that barriers to greenspace use could deprive people of mental health benefits and affect mental health during pandemic; an alternative explanation is that those experiencing poor mental health may be less likely to visit greenspaces during pandemic. This implies the need of adequate interventions on greenspace uses under an outbreak especially focusing on how low-income populations may be more adversely affected by a pandemic and its policy responses.","Heo, Seulkee; Desai, Miraj U; Lowe, Sarah R; Bell, Michelle L",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),526,24

We aimed to investigate how these changes have been perceived by patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and identify determinants of increased anxiety. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An anonymized 32-item survey in the specialized lower gastrointestinal cancer outpatient clinics at a tertiary cancer center in North West England between May 18 and July 1, 2020. Self-reported anxiety was based on the General Anxiety Disorder-7 screening tool. RESULTS: Of 143 participants who completed the survey (response rate, 67%), 115 (82%) were male, and the median age group was 61 to 70 years. A total of 112 (78%) participants had telephone consultation (83% met needs), and 57 (40%) had radiologic scan results discussed over the phone (96% met needs). In total, 23 (18%) participants were considered to have anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7 score &#8805; 5), with 7 (5.5%) scoring for moderate or severe anxiety. Those concerned about getting COVID-19 infection, and worried COVID-19 would have effect on their mental health, and affect their experience of cancer care, were most likely to have anxiety (P < .05, multivariate analysis). The majority did not feel they needed support during this phase of the pandemic. Participants felt that friends and family had been very supportive, but less so the primary care services (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this survey suggest that some of the service changes implemented may have already improved the overall experience of cancer care among patients with colorectal cancer at our institute. Reassuringly, the incidence of participants with moderate to severe anxiety levels during the peak of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom was much lower than anticipated. Importantly, patients were much more concerned about their cancer treatment than COVID-19, emphasizing the need to continue to provide comprehensive cancer care even with a ""second wave"" of COVID-19.","Kamposioras, Konstantinos; Saunders, Mark; Jonathan Lim, Kok Haw; Marti, Kalena; Anderson, Daniel; Cutting, Mark; McCool, Danielle; Connell, Jacqueline; Simpson, Lilly; Hasan, Jurjees; Braun, Michael; Lavin, Victoria; Mullamitha, Saifee; Barriuso, Jorge",Clin. colorectal cancer,526,16

Here, we investigated the diagnostic performance of chest computed tomography (CT) as an alternative to RT-PCR in patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 27,824 patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection who underwent unenhanced low-dose chest CT from 20 February, 2020 to 21 May, 2020 were evaluated. Patients were recruited from seven specifically designated hospitals for patients with COVID-19 infection affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. In each hospital, images were interpreted by two independent radiologists. CT findings were considered as positive/negative for COVID-19 infection based on RSNA diagnostic criteria. Then, the correlation between the number of daily positive chest CT scans and number of daily PCR-confirmed cases and COVID-19-related deaths in Tehran province during this three-month period was assessed. The trends of admission rate and patients with positive CT scans were also evaluated. RESULTS: A strong positive correlation between the numbers of daily positive CT scans and daily PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (râ¯=â¯0.913, p < 0.001) was observed. Furthermore, in hospitals located in regions with a lower socioeconomic status, the admission rate and number of positive cases within this three-month period was higher as compared to other hospitals. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chest CT is a safe, rapid and reliable alternative to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-prevalence regions. In addition, our study provides further evidence for considering patients' socioeconomic status as an important risk factor for COVID-19.","Zali, Alireza; Sohrabi, Mohammad-Reza; Mahdavi, Ali; Khalili, Nastaran; Taheri, Morteza Sanei; Maher, Ali; Sadoughi, Mohammadmehdi; Zarghi, Afshin; Ziai, Seyed Ali; Shabestari, Abbas Arjmand; Bakhshayeshkaram, Mehrdad; Haghighatkhah, Hamidreza; Salevatipour, Babak; Abrishami, Alireza; Raoufi, Masoomeh; Dehghan, Pooneh; Bagheri, Arash Khameneh; Khoshnoud, Reza Jalili; Hanani, Khatereh",Acad. radiol,526,16

The key indicator of Ukrainian Protestant digital outreach is the increased number of livestreams in different styles and formats. I use ""All-Ukrainian Sobor"" NGO's YouTube livestreams catalog as a working statistic model. In the course of study, two peaks in the overall number of views of all videos of a given YouTube channel were singled out. These peaks were (1) from 500K to 100K and (2) from 50K to 10K. Analysis of the views rating of a single YouTube channel proved to be somewhat random and non-indicative;nevertheless, views number enables a Church to draw attention to its activity online. Analysis of the recent history of Church YouTube channels showed two other peaks: in the years 2013-15 (Euromaidan, annexation of Crimea and armed conflict at Donbas) and the year 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic), proving that Ukrainian Protestants react at least to the main societal tendencies. For those believers, livestreams became a relatively appealing instrument, actively used since 2017-19. Though Baptists and Pentecostals outnumber Adventists, the latter accumulates existing staff, financial, and technological resources more successfully. This is noticeable in the work of TV Hope Channel UA, affiliated with Adventists. As a context for the study, a survey among Ukrainian Baptist ministers conducted during the current pandemic is cited. The survey showed that (1) middle-aged Protestant ministers have a stable demand for consuming information online, (2) they are present at social networks firstly as owners of personal accounts, whereas Church pages tend to fall behind, (3) almost two-thirds of surveyed congregations livestream their regular services, and (4) this practice needs stable activists and a strategic vision.","Balaklytskyi, M.",Occasional Papers on Religion in Eastern Europe,526,30

Every day, service providers collect the personal information of billions of individuals, information that sustain their infrastructure by marketing profiles labeled with this information to personal data consumers, such as advertisers. Not all uses of this personal data are for marketing; data consumers can also include, for instance, public health authorities tracking pandemics. In either case, individuals have undergone a process of Personal Data Gentrification, as data ownership has shifted from individuals to service providers and data consumers, as if the data is worth nothing to the individuals; these new owners then harness the data to obtain large profits. Current privacy-enhancing technologies are beginning to allow individuals to control and share less information. However, not sharing individuals' personal information at all could lead to Personal Data Blight, in which the potential of personal data in applications that benefit all of society remains forever latent. In this paper, we propose Personal Data Enfranchisement as a middle ground, empowering individuals to control the sharing of their personal information to shift the business flows of personal information. Based on these insights, we propose a model to gradually and incrementally make a shift from our current situation towards one of Personal Data Enfranchisement.

A better understanding of factors shaping the memory B cell response will allow tailored development of efficient preventative vaccines against emerging acute viral infections, therapeutic vaccines, and immunotherapies for chronic viral infections. Here, we use recent data obtained by profiling antigen-specific B cell responses in hepatitis B as a framework to explore lessons that can be learnt from different viral infections about the diverse influences on humoral immunity. Hepatitis B provides a paradigm where successful B cell responses in resolved or vaccinated individuals can be contrasted to the failed response in chronic infection, while also exemplifying the degree to which B cell responses within infected individuals can differ to two antigens from the same virus. Drawing on studies in other human and murine infections, including emerging data from COVID-19, we consider the influence of antigen quantity and structure on the quality of the B cell response, the role of differential CD4 help, the importance of germinal center vs extrafollicular responses and the emerging concept that responses residing in non-lymphoid organs can participate in B cell memory.","Burton, Alice R; Maini, Mala K",Immunol Rev,526,6

Endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery is thought to be among the highest-risk aerosol-generating procedures for surgeons and operating room personnel. OBJECTIVE: To validate the efficacy and clinical feasibility of a novel surgical device. METHODS: A low-cost, modifiable, and easily producible negative pressure, face-mounted antechamber was developed utilizing 3D printing and silicone molding. Efficacy was evaluated using an optical particle sizer to quantify aerosols generated during both cadaver and intraoperative human use with high-speed drilling. RESULTS: Particle counts in the cadaver showed that drilling led to a 2.49-fold increase in particles 0.3 to 5 µm (P = .001) and that the chamber was effective at reducing particles to levels not significantly different than baseline. In humans, drilling led to a 37-fold increase in particles 0.3 to 5 µm (P < .001), and the chamber was effective at reducing particles to a level not significantly different than baseline. Use of the antechamber in 6 complex cases did not interfere with the ability to perform surgery. Patients did not report any facial discomfort after surgery related to antechamber use. CONCLUSION: The use of a negative pressure facial antechamber can effectively reduce aerosolization from endoscopic drilling without disturbing the flow of the operation. The antechamber, in conjunction with appropriate PPE, will be useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during flu season and any future viral outbreaks.","Kim, Matthew; Lee, Mark; Schwarz, Justin; Kacker, Ashutosh; Schwartz, Theodore H",Oper. neurosurg.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of insurance type on the rate and type of initial concussion visits and the time from injury to the initial visit in youth. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed initial concussion-related medical visits for youth ages 10 to 17 from electronic health records. Patients must have visited Nationwide Children's Hospital's (NCH) concussion clinic at least once between 7/1/2012 and 12/31/2017. We evaluated the trends and patterns of initial concussion visits across the study period using regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 4955 unique concussion visits included, 60.1% were males, 80.5% were white, and 69.5% were paid by private insurance. Patients' average age was 13.9 years (SD = 3.7). The rate of the initial concussion visits per 10,000 NCH visits was consistently higher in privately insured than publicly insured youth throughout the study period (P < .0001). Privately insured youth had greater odds of initial concussion visits to sports medicine clinics (AOR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.20, 1.76) but lower odds of initial concussion visits to the ED/urgent care (AOR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.60, 0.90) than publicly insured youth. Days from injury to initial concussion visit significantly decreased among both insurance types throughout the study (P < .0001), with a greater decrease observed in publicly insured than privately insured youth (P = .011). CONCLUSIONS: Results on the differences in the rate, type, and time of initial concussion-related visits may help inform more efficient care of concussion among youth with different types of insurance.","Radlicz, Chris; Jackson, Kenneth; Hautmann, Amanda; Shi, Junxin; Yang, Jingzhen",BMC Public Health,526,16

This growth has been particularly rapid during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many reports indicate informal services using IM, in particular WhatsApp, have arisen spontaneously, in the absence of any formal guidelines and little consideration of consent. This study documents the consent practices of healthcare professionals using IM for clinical activities in District Hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and compares these practices with the literature. Methods: As part of a larger audit of telemedicine activity in KwaZulu-Natal a survey questioned clinicians' use of IM, including consent practices and awareness of regulatory guidelines. Concomitantly multiple electronic databases were searched for papers on WhatsApp use in clinical service. Inclusion criteria were: papers written in English, reported on WhatsApp in clinical use or potential clinical use, and addressed consent. Results: The survey confirmed anecdotal reports of widespread informal use of WhatsApp in District Hospitals. Most clinicians were unaware of regulatory guidelines, and few obtained consent for taking photographs or sharing of images and information with colleagues for consultation. The literature review found that consent was mentioned in only 28 papers. Of these 11 reported that written consent was obtained, of which 5 were for taking photographs and 4 for sharing information with colleagues. Discussion: The survey showed that more than half of the respondents who used IM did not consider this to be telemedicine, with the corresponding ethical requirements governed by national guidelines, thereby risking legal exposure. However, South Africa's regulatory guidelines do not align with common clinical practice. The literature shows that the majority of doctors shared patient information by IM without obtaining any form of consent. Conclusion: Practical guidelines are urgently required in South Africa and worldwide that balance practical conduct of medical care with sound contemporary ethical principles. Prudent guidance will ensure clinicians do not inadvertently breach patient privacy and confidentiality laws whilst permitting continued health-related use of instant messaging. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.","Morris, C.; Scott, R.

Objective: This narrative review summarizes the challenges of online education in nursing and explores the possible opportunities to improve or maintain the standards of nursing education. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was done to identify the challenges of online education in nursing. Seven primary studies meeting the inclusion criteria, published from the onset of COVID-19 until 5th September 2020 were included in this narrative review. Results: The available literature shows that, students are missing the practical aspects of nursing care, the real essence of nursing education during e-learning, cancellation of international training, loss of job opportunities due to lack of confidence in their skill are bothersome for students and educators. Success of e-learning is also affected by internet connectivity issues, problem with electricity and lack of computer literacy. At the same time, it is found that online education delivery is substituting theory learning to a great extent, however practical training remains indispensable for nursing education. Conclusion: Continuous engagement and motivation from the part of both the students and nurse educators is very essential in meeting the educational needs during this crisis.","Divya, K.

The purpose of this study is to summarize the outcomes of patients with novel COVID-19 pneumonia (NCP) at our institution. Methods: In this single-center study, we retrospectively included 118 cases of NCP, from January 16, 2020 to February 4, 2020. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 11, 2020. The outcomes of NCP patients were phase summarized at our institution. Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated. The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow-up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. Results: Six patients were improved to no-emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type. Besides, 13 patients progressed from the common type group to the emergency group (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type). Forty-two (35.6%) patients were discharged with a median hospital stay of 9.5 days (range, 4.0-15.0 days). Thus, the numbers in different responses were, 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no-emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no-emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no-emergency cases). No patient has died in our hospital to date. The median duration of progress observed from CT scans was 6 days (range, 2-14 days). The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. Conclusion: Most cases are no-emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment. Follow-up CT changes during the treatment can help evaluate the treatment response of patients with NCP.","Zhao, Wei; Zhong, Zheng; Xie, Xingzhi; Yu, Qizhi; Liu, Jun",Theranostics,526,6

Prior studies, with limited numbers, have included men in various stages of infection with most in the recovery phase of the illness. The timing of test results and severity of illness has made recruiting study participants a significant challenge. Our pilot study will examine semen from men with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as those in the convalescent phase to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be detected and its relationship, if any, with the severity of the disease. METHODS: Eighteen men with a median age of 32 (range, 24-57) who tested positive for COVID-19 by rt-PCR analysis were enrolled and provided a semen sample. The study group demonstrated symptoms of COVID-19 ranging from asymptomatic to moderate and none required hospitalization. Samples were subjected to viral RNA extraction and then processed by real-time RT-PCR using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) panel of 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) primers and probes to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Length of time from diagnosis to providing a specimen ranged from 1 to 28 days (median, 6 days). Fifteen participants were symptomatic and three were asymptomatic, including recovering men, at the time of semen collection. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in any of the semen samples. CONCLUSION: Based on these preliminary results and consistent with prior findings, we suggest SARS-CoV-2 is not present in semen during the acute or convalescent phase of COVID-19.","Burke, Corey A; Skytte, A B; Kasiri, Saghar; Howell, Dixie; Patel, Zamip P; Trolice, Mark P; Parekattil, Sijo J; Michael, Scott F; Paul, Lauren M",J Assist Reprod Genet,526,17

In the last decades there has been a resurgence of studies on psychological, psychiatric and neuroscientific aspects of mediumship, as well as studies assessing the claim that mediums can obtain anomalous information from deceased persons. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence for anomalous information reception about deceased people in texts produced through alleged mediumistic writing (psychographic letters) under strictly controlled experimental conditions. METHOD: Eight mediums and ninety-four sitters participated in the study. Eighteen mediumistic writing sessions were carried out using blind proxy sitters. Later, each sitter received the target mediumistic letter and five control letters paired by gender and age. Sitters blindly scored the accuracy of the six letters both with a global score and for each of the objectively verifiable items of information presented on the letters. Scores from target and control letters were compared. RESULTS: There was no difference in global evaluation and specific fit scores between control and target letters. The mediums involved in the research were not able to show evidence for providing anomalous information about deceased people when under our strict controlled conditions. We argue for establishing a reasonable compromise between ecological validity and controlled condition.","Freire, Elizabeth Schmitt; Rocha, Alexandre Caroli; Tasca, Victor Scio; Marnet, Mateus Moreira; Moreira-Almeida, Alexander",Explor.

Studies have shown this training increases bystanders' confidence and willingness to provide aid. One high-risk group might be better solicited to take the course: individuals who have been a victim of previous trauma, as high rates of recidivism after trauma are well-established. Given this group's risk for recurrent injury, we evaluated their attitudes toward STB concepts. METHODS: We surveyed trauma patients admitted to 3 urban trauma centers in Baltimore from January 8, 2020 to March 14, 2020. The survey was terminated prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trauma patients hospitalized on any inpatient unit were invited to complete the survey via an electronic tablet. The survey asked about demographics, prior exposure to life-threatening hemorrhage and first aid training, and willingness to help a person with major bleeding. The Johns Hopkins IRB approved waiver of consent for this study. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients completed the survey. The majority of respondents had been hospitalized before (92.9%) and had witnessed severe bleeding (60.7%). The majority had never taken a first aid course (60.7%) nor heard of STB (83.9%). Most respondents would be willing to help someone with severe bleeding form a car crash (98.2%) or gunshot wound (94.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients admitted for trauma had not heard about Stop the Bleed, but stated willingness to respond to someone injured with major bleeding. Focusing STB education on individuals at high-risk for trauma recidivism may be particularly effective in spreading the message and skills of STB.","Van Winkle, Bonnylin; DiBrito, Sandra R; Amini, Neda; Levy, Matthew J; Haut, Elliott R",J Surg Res,526,1

In this study, we applied a zero-valent nanosilver/titania-chitosan (nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS) filter bed, whose broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy has been proven previously, for the removal of viral aerosols to minimize the risk of airborne transmission. Methods: The photochemical deposition method was used to synthesize the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS antiviral material. The surface morphology, elemental composition, and microstructure of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS were analyzed by a scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and a transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The MS2 bacteriophages were used as surrogate viral aerosols. The antiviral efficacy of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS was evaluated by the MS2 plaque reduction assay (PRA) and filtration experiments. In the filtration experiments, the MS2 aerosols passed through the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter, and the MS2 aerosol removal efficiency was evaluated by an optical particle counter and culture method. Results and Conclusions: In the MS2 PRA, 3 g of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS inactivated 97% of MS2 bacteriophages in 20 mL liquid culture (2 ± 0.5 × 1016 PFU/mL) within 2 hours. The removal efficiency of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter (thickness: 6 cm) for MS2 aerosols reached up to 93%. Over 95% of MS2 bacteriophages on the surface of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter were inactivated within 20 minutes. The Wells-Riley model predicted that when the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter was used in the ventilation system, airborne infection probability would reduce from 99% to 34.6%. The nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter could remain at 50% of its original antiviral efficiency after continuous operation for 1 week, indicating its feasibility for the control of the airborne transmission.","Wang, I-Jen; Chen, Yen-Chi; Su, Chien; Tsai, Ming-Hsuan; Shen, Wan-Tien; Bai, Chun-Hsuan; Yu, Kuo-Pin",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,526,1

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic regulations on current and future PPRI. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey-based study that analyzed data from 400 surveyed dermatologists using a pre-validated questionnaire sent via email. Data regarding PPRI were collected over 1 week in July 2020 to compare demographics and practice standards from April 2019, April 2020, July 2020, and predictions for 2021. RESULTS: Virtual-only PPRI increased from 7.8% in April 2019 to 26.5% during April 2020 (mean difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6%&ndash;23.9%). Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3. LIMITATIONS: Relatively small sample size, especially among subgroups. Responses may have been retrospective estimates. There may also be selection bias given slightly increased representation of more experienced dermatologists. CONCLUSION: PPRI materially decreased during the initial COVID-19 peak but will likely return to baseline volume moving forward with a significant component being hybrid PPRI. Further studies may better elucidate the economic and clinical impact associated with these changes and their effect on dermatologists&rsquo; ability to provide patients with samples and educational materials.

Lockdown announcement day has been considered as the event for our study. We have taken a 40-day event window, i.e., 20 days before and 20 days after the date of the announcement. Secondary data is used in the study and the same is collected from the NSE website. Using MS Excel, we have applied three methods for analysis—mean-adjusted, market-adjusted, and risk-adjusted abnormal return. Auto, Bank, Financial Services, FMCG, IT, Media, Metal, Pharma, Private bank, PSU Bank, Realty, Oil & Gas, and Energy are sectors of NSE that were taken for the study. Our results indicated that most of the sectors performed positively and gained abnormal returns during 21 days after the announcement. It showed that these sectors recovered their position after going down the market index. This shows that investors were confident that the impact was due to the abnormal condition of the market and not due to the fault or fundamental problems of these sectors. Based on the results, investors may decide to hold their position in the stock that has recovered during the period. Also, investors can diversify their portfolio in those sectors to which abnormal return was positive besides the COVID-19 impact.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only available vaccine against TB but its efficacy varies throughout the world. Subunit vaccine candidates, based on recombinant viral vectors expressing mycobacterial antigens, are one of the strategies being developed to boost BCG-primed host immune responses and efficacy. A promising vaccination regimen composed of intradermal (i.d.) BCG prime, followed by intranasally (i.n.) administered chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1) and i.n. or i.d. modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA), both expressing Ag85A, has been previously reported to significantly improve BCG efficacy in mice. Effector and memory immune responses induced by BCG-ChAdOx1.85A-MVA85A (B-C-M), were evaluated to identify immune correlates of protection in mice.

The COVID-19 response was predicted, measured, and compared after 25%, 75%, and 95% social distancing interventions in Ethiopia. Social distancing strategies flatten and delay the epidemic curve, according to the model findings. The model result shows that most new events and hospitalizations were avoided when social distancing measures were in effect. Social distancing can provide a critical time for increasing healthcare capability, and the research findings could assist policymakers in estimating the immediate number of resources required and planning for potential COVID-19 initiatives in Ethiopia.","Bushira, Kedir Mohammed",Model Earth Syst Environ,526,16

Health care providers responded by rapidly transitioning from in-person to video consultations. Telemedicine (ie, video visits) is a potentially disruptive innovation; however, little is known about patient satisfaction with this emerging alternative to the traditional clinical encounter. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if patient satisfaction differs between video and in-person visits. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, we analyzed 38,609 Press Ganey patient satisfaction survey outcomes from clinic encounters (620 video visits vs 37,989 in-person visits) at a single-institution, urban, quaternary academic medical center in New York City for patients aged 18 years, from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. Time was categorized as pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 (before vs after March 4, 2020). Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests and multivariable linear regression were used for hypothesis testing and statistical modeling, respectively. RESULTS: We experienced an 8729% increase in video visit utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period last year. Video visit Press Ganey scores were significantly higher than in-person visits (94.9% vs 92.5%; P<.001). In adjusted analyses, video visits (parameter estimate [PE] 2.18; 95% CI 1.20-3.16) and the COVID-19 period (PE 0.55; 95% CI 0.04-1.06) were associated with higher patient satisfaction. Younger age (PE -2.05; 95% CI -2.66 to -1.22), female gender (PE -0.73; 95% CI -0.96 to -0.50), and new visit type (PE -0.75; 95% CI -1.00 to -0.49) were associated with lower patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction with video visits is high and is not a barrier toward a paradigm shift away from traditional in-person clinic visits. Future research comparing other clinic visit quality indicators is needed to guide and implement the widespread adoption of telemedicine.","Ramaswamy, Ashwin; Yu, Miko; Drangsholt, Siri; Ng, Eric; Culligan, Patrick J; Schlegel, Peter N; Hu, Jim C",J Med Internet Res,526,1

Questions have been raised as to the frailty of those succumbing to the COVID-19 infection. In this paper we employ standard life table methods to illustrate how the potential quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses associated with COVID-19 fatalities could be estimated, while adjusting for comorbidities in terms of impact on both mortality and quality of life. Contrary to some suggestions in the media, we find that even relatively elderly patients with high levels of comorbidity can still lose substantial life years and QALYs. The simplicity of the method facilitates straightforward international comparisons as the pandemic evolves. In particular, we compare five different countries and show that differences in the average QALY losses for each COVID-19 fatality is driven mainly by differing age distributions for those dying of the disease.","Briggs, Andrew H; Goldstein, Daniel A; Kirwin, Erin; Meacock, Rachel; Pandya, Ankur; Vanness, David J; Wisløff, Torbjørn",Health econ,526,13

Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to liver damage per se remains unknown. Here we reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with liver enzyme abnormality. METHODS: We received 156 patients diagnosed of COVID-19 from two designated centers in China, and compared clinical features between patients with elevated aminotransferase or not. Postmortem liver biopsies were obtained from two cases who had elevated aminotransferase. We investigated the patterns of liver impairment by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay, and pathological studies. RESULTS: 64 of 156 (41.0%) COVID-19 patients had elevated aminotransferase. The median levels of ALT were 50 U/L vs. 19 U/L, respectively, AST were 45.5 U/L vs. 24 U/L, respectively in abnormal and normal aminotransferase groups. The liver enzyme abnormality was associated with disease severity, as well as a series of laboratory tests including higher A-aDO2, higher GGT, lower albumin, decreased CD4+ T cells and B lymphocytes. Ultrastructural examination identified typical coronavirus particles characterized by spike structure in cytoplasm of hepatocytes in two COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 infected hepatocytes displayed conspicuous mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, and glycogen granule decrease. Histologically, massive hepatic apoptosis and a certain binuclear hepatocytes were observed. Taken together, both ultrastructural and histological evidence indicated a typical lesion of viral infection. Immunohistochemical results showed scanty CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. No obvious eosinophil infiltration, cholestasis, fibrin deposition, granuloma, massive central necrosis, or interface hepatitis were observed. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver is a crucial cause of hepatic impairment in COVID-19 patients.

We conducted an updated meta-analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO2/FIO2 ratios), and adverse events. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1371 participants were analyzed. The pooled analysis revealed that glucocorticoid use was associated with reduced mortality [relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.93; P < 0.01; I2 = 37], and the statistical power was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Glucocorticoids might also significantly increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (mean deviation 3.66 days, 95% CI 2.64-4.68; P < 0.01) and improve oxygenation (standardized mean difference 4.17; 95% CI 2.32-6.02; P < 0.01). In addition, glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risks of new infection (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.70-1.01; P = 0.07) and hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.99-1.23; P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The use of glucocorticoids might result in reduced mortality in patients with ARDS.

The pandemic requires adaptation of the health care standards, including epidemiologic surveillance, logistics of home supply, and monitoring. Potential lack of medical professionals may worsen the standard of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the medical staff resources in HPN units. RESULTS: The study was conducted by major Polish scientific societies in clinical nutrition. A questionnaire was distributed among all Polish adult HPN centers concerning statistics from the first 3 mo of the pandemic (March through May 2020). Data on medical staff resources and organizational issues of the units were collected. Modifications of the home procedures, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of HPN patients and health care workers (HCW) were analyzed. Influence of the pandemic on the rates of new qualifications for home artificial nutrition (HAN) was estimated. Fourteen of 17 adult Polish HPN units took part in the study. The point prevalence of HPN in Poland was 30.75/1 million citizens. Of HCWs, 344 were involved in patient care in Polish HPN units; 18.9% were physicians (49% surgeons, 18.46% internal medicine specialists, 15.38% anesthesiologists, 7.69% pediatricians, 1.54% palliative care specialists), 32.27% nurses, 5.23% dietitians, 9.01% pharmacists, 4.94% pharmacy technicians, 3.2% pharmacy assistants, 5.81% administrative workers, 3.49% physiotherapists. HAN patient-to-HCW ratios for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians were 49.5, 29.15, 111.6, and 181.6, respectively. Medium ages of physicians and nurses were 45.6 and 44.15 y, respectively. Slightly less than half (53.8%) of physicians and 31.53% of nurses worked parallelly in hospital wards. Thirty-one pharmacists overall were working in all HPN units (2.21 per unit) as were 18 dietitians (1.3 per unit). Nine patients had a confirmed COVID-19 infection (four HPN, five home enteral nutrition). All the units introduced telemedicine solutions in the first months of the pandemic. The number of new qualifications for HPN and home enteral nutrition in the units did not significantly decline from March through May in comparison with a similar period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: A shortage of HPN medical professionals requires attention when planning health care organization, especially during a pandemic. Severe restrictions in public health systems may not reduce the number of new qualifications for the HPN procedure. There is a need for the continuation of data collection during the evolution of the pandemic as it may have a detrimental effect on HPN including serious issues with access to professional HCWs.","Folwarski, Marcin; Klek, Stanislaw; Matras, Przemyslaw; Bartoszewska, Lidia; Bednarz, Slawomir; Jakubczyk, Marlena; Kamocki, Zbigniew; Krasowski, Grzegorz; Kunecki, Marek; Kwella, Bogna; Matysiak-Lusnia, Katarzyna; Matysiak, Konrad; Pierzynowska, Gabriela; Szafranski, Waldemar; Szopinski, Jacek; Urbanowicz, Krystyna; Sobocki, Jacek",Nutrition,526,33

In this paper, we examine how healthcare manufacturing firms cope with the operational disruptions and opportunities associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight the central role of organizational resilience and examine whether servitization and digitalization can improve the organizational resilience of healthcare manufacturing firms. On the basis of the organizational information processing theory, we suggest that servitization and digitalization can improve the stability and flexibility of operations, which make healthcare manufacturing firms more resilient to the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypotheses were tested using survey data from 163 manufacturing firms located in China. The results indicate that both servitization and digitalization improve the organizational resilience of healthcare manufacturing firms, leading to higher firm growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, organizational resilience mediates the impacts of servitization and digitalization on firm growth. Environmental dynamism strengthens the relationship between digitalization and organizational resilience. This study offers new insights for healthcare manufacturing firms to prepare for crisis events and achieve sustainable development in a highly competitive environment.","Zhang, Jingsi; Qi, Liangqun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),526,23

To understand if these mutations could affect the structural behavior of S protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the binding with S protein inhibitors (cepharanthine, nelfinavir, and hydroxychloroquine), molecular dynamic simulations and molecular docking were employed. It was found that these punctual mutations affect considerably the structural behavior of the S protein compared to wild type, which also affect the binding of its inhibitors into their respective binding site. Thus, further experimental studies are needed to explore if these affectations have an impact on drug-S protein binding and its possible clinical effect.","Sixto-López, Yudibeth; Correa-Basurto, José; Bello, Martiniano; Landeros-Rivera, Bruno; Garzón-Tiznado, Jose Antonio; Montaño, Sarita",Sci Rep,526,24

The current choice of molecular methods for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes nucleic acid-based testing (NAT) for viral genetic material and antigen-based testing for viral protein identification. Host exposure is detected using antibody detection assays. While NATs require sophisticated instrument and trained manpower, antigen tests are plagued by their low sensitivity and specificity. Thus, a test offering sensitive detection for presence of infection as a colorimetric readout holds promise to enable mass testing in resource constrained environments by minimally trained personnel. Here we present a novel HRPZyme Assisted Recognition of Infection by Optical Measurement (HARIOM) assay which combines specificity of NATs with sensitivity of enzymatic assays resulting in enhanced signal to noise ratios in an easily interpretable colorimetric readout. Using this assay, we could detect up to 102 copies of synthetic viral RNA spiked in saliva as a detection matrix. Validating our assay on suspected human subjects, we found concordance with PCR based readouts with visible colorimetric distinction between positive and negative samples in less than an hour. We believe that this assay holds the potential to aid in mass screening to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection by facilitating colorimetric detection with minimal resources and less trained personnel.","Ahmad, Mohd; Sharma, Pooja; Kamai, Asangla; Agrawal, Anurag; Faruq, Mohammed; Kulshreshtha, Ankur",Biosens Bioelectron,526,26

The assay integrates Si-OH magnetic beads (MBs)-based fast RNA extraction and rapid isothermal amplification in a single tube, thus bypassing the RNA elution step and directly amplifying on-beads RNA molecules with the visualized results. This one-tube assay has a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 200 copies/mL for sample input volumes of up to 600 µL, and can be performed in less than 1 h from sample collection to result readout. This assay demonstrated a 100% concordance with the gold standard test RT-qPCR test by using 29 clinical specimens and showed high specificity.

Two phenomena observed so far in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserve further attention. First, the relative absence of clinical signs of infections in children, second, the early appearance of IgG in certain patients. From the point of view of immune system physiology, such an early rise of specific IgG is expected in secondary immune responses when memory to a cross-reactive antigen is present, usually from an earlier infection with a coronavirus. It is actually typical for the immune system to respond, to what it already knows, a phenomenon that has been observed in many infections with closely related viruses and has been termed ""original antigenic sin."" The question then arises whether such cross-reactive antibodies are protective or not against the new virus. The worst scenario would be when such cross-reactive memory antibodies to related coronaviruses would not only be non-protective but even enhance infection and the clinical course. Such a phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has already been described in several viral infections. Thus, the development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the course of COVID-19 might not be a simple sign of viral clearance and developing protection against the virus. On the contrary, due to cross-reaction to related coronavirus strains from earlier infections, in certain patients IgG might enhance clinical progression due to ADE. The patient's viral history of coronavirus infection might be crucial to the development of the current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it poses a note of caution when treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent sera.","Fierz, Walter; Walz, Brigitte",Front Immunol,526,6

The current study aimed to identify potential COVID-19 therapeutic agents from a list of 29 bioactive compounds isolated from commonly used South African medicinal plants using molecular docking and molecular dynamics. Molecular docking identified arabic acid from Acacia senegal and L-canavanine found in Sutherlandia frutescens as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3C-like main protease. Similarly, hypoxoside isolated from Hypoxis hemerocallidea and uzarin from Xysmalobium undulatum, were identified as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent polymerase. These four bioactive compounds exhibited favourable binding orientations characterized by strong molecular interactions within respective inhibitors binding pockets of the target enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the binding of the identified inhibitors is characterized by structural perturbations which favour the inhibitory potency of these bioactive compounds.

Quickly after the identification of Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), both in vitro ligation and BAC-based reverse genetic technologies were engineered for MERS-CoV to study its basic biological properties, develop live-attenuated vaccines, and test antiviral drugs. Here, I will describe how lambda red recombination can be used with the MERS-CoV BAC to quickly and efficiently introduce virtually any type of genetic modification (point mutations, insertions, deletions) into the MERS-CoV genome and recover recombinant virus.","Fehr, Anthony R",Methods Mol Biol,526,16

AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare 3 chest compression (CC) methods used by paramedics wearing PPE. METHODS: The single­blinded, multicenter, randomized, crossover simulation study involved 67 paramedics wearing PPE AGP. They performed 2­minute continuous CCs in an adult with suspected or confirmed COVID­19 in 3 scenarios: 1) manual CCs; 2) CCs with the TrueCPR feedback device; 3) CCs with the LUCAS 3 mechanical CC device. RESULTS: The depth of CC was more frequently correct when using LUCAS 3 compared with TrueCPR and manual CC (median [IQR] 51 [50-55] mm vs 47 [43-52] mm vs 43 [38-46] mm; P = 0.005). This was also true for the CC rate (median [IQR]102 [100-102] compressions per minute [CPM] vs 105 [98-1114] CPM vs 116 [112-129] CPM; P = 0.027) and chest recoil (median [IQR]100% [98%-100%] vs 83% [60%-92%] vs 39% [25%-50%]; P = 0.001). A detailed analysis of 2­minute resuscitation with manual CCs showed a decrease in compression depth and full chest recoil after 1 minute of CCs. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that during simulated resuscitation with the use of PPE AGP in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID­19, CC with LUCAS 3 compared with manual CCs as well as the TrueCPR essentially increased the CC quality. In the case of manual CCs by paramedics dressed in PPE AGP, it is advisable to change the person performing resuscitation every minute.","Malysz, Marek; Smereka, Jacek; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Dabrowski, Marek; Nadolny, Klaudiusz; Ruetzler, Kurt; Ladny, Jerzy R; Sterlinski, Maciej; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Szarpak, Lukasz",Kardiol Pol,526,8

It is critical to discuss newborn care of infected mothers with COVID-19 based on the latest international guidelines and national guidelines of countries with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases.Objective: We discuss how to care for a newborn of a suspected or infected mother with COVID-19 using existing evidence.Method: As of 16 April 2020, we reviewed articles and guidelines related to COVID-19 in the reproductive health field, mother, and newborn health. Our review yielded in 10 categories (i) the risk of diagnostic procedures in suspected mothers on fetus/infant health, (ii) the risk of intrauterine or postpartum transmission to the fetus/infant, (iii) appropriate method and delivery time in women with confirmed COVID-19, (iv) umbilical cord clamping and skin to skin contact, (v) clinical manifestations of infected infants, (vi) confirmation of infection in a suspected neonate/infant, (vii) instructions for infant's care and how to feed her/him, (viii) bathing the baby, (ix) the criteria of discharging baby from the hospital, (x) the impact of isolation on the maternal mental health.Results: Our findings showed that the possibility of intrauterine or perinatal transmission of COVID-19 is still questionable and ambiguous. However, what has been agreed upon in the existing texts and guidelines is that the close contact of mother and infant after birth can transmit the virus to the baby through droplets or micro-droplets.Conclusions: Based on our findings, it is recommended to separate the baby from the mother with confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 infection for at least 2 weeks. Since the motivation and stable situation of mothers allow breastfeeding during the isolation, infected mothers should be taught about breast expression skills, common breast problems, the symptoms of their baby's infection, and the principles of personal hygiene to protect the infant against COVID-19 infection.","Shahbazi Sighaldeh, Shirin; Ebrahimi Kalan, Mohammad",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,526,22

For many communities in the Pacific Islands, who have relied largely on the market economy over the years, this means falling back on their communal way of life which has provided resilience for centuries. The revival of various forms of communal capital such as kinship exchange, subsistence farming and strengthening of social solidarity have become features of this bourgeoning moral economy. In the post-COVID era, there needs to be a major rethinking of how community-based moral economies can be mainstreamed as assurance for resilience and as a responsive mechanism against future economic calamities.

In the absence of a systematic database examining the details of the impact, this comment synthesises existing opinions, reviews and the limited available data to show how, not only the outbreak, but particularly our response to it, are increasing the incidence of domestic violence (DV) across the globe, including in India. Despite tackling a much higher Covid caseload and mortality rate than India has, countries such as France and Spain have prioritised responding to DV in their respective societies, working out contingent mitigation mechanisms. Admittedly, low resource settings (LRS) such as India, have a bevy of additional infrastructure and budgetary challenges; but would that imply we do not respond to DV? This comment argues that in reality we have two public health emergencies to confront, the Covid-19 and domestic violence.

However, the roll-out of vaccination strategies and their influence on the pandemic are still open problems. In order to compare the effect of various strategies proposed by the World Health Organization and other authorities, a previously developed SEIRS stochastic model of geographical spreading of the virus is extended by adding a compartment for vaccinated people. The parameters of the model were fitted to describe the pandemic evolution in Argentina, Mexico and Spain to analyze the effect of the proposed vaccination strategies. The mobility parameters allow to simulate different social behaviors (e.g. lock-down interventions). Schemes in which vaccines are applied homogeneously in all the country, or limited to the most densely-populated areas, are simulated and compared. The second strategy is found to be more effective. Moreover, under the current global shortage of vaccines, it should be remarked that immunization is enhanced when mobility is reduced. Additionally, repetition of vaccination campaigns should be timed considering the immunity lapse of the vaccinated (and recovered) people. Finally, the model is extended to include the effect of isolation of detected positive cases, shown to be important to reduce infections.","Barreiro, N. L.; Ventura, C.

METHODS: We included all consecutive patients with a confirmed pre- or postoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive status (operated in 27 hospitals) and negative control patients (operated in 4 hospitals) undergoing emergency or elective operations. A propensity score-matched comparison of clinical outcomes was performed between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and negative tested patients (control group). Primary outcome was overall 30-day mortality rate between both groups. Main secondary outcomes were overall, pulmonary, and thromboembolic complications. RESULTS: In total, 161 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and 342 control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 negative patients were included in this study. The 30-day overall postoperative mortality rate was greater in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive cohort compared with the negative control group (16% vs 4% respectively; P = .007). After propensity score matching, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive group consisted of 123 patients (median 70 years of age [interquartile range 59-77] and 55% male) were compared with 196 patients in the matched control group (median 69 years (interquartile range 58-75] and 53% male).

RESULTS: 88 patients (175 restorations) were treated; 43 received GH (83 restorations), 45 RC (92 restorations). 17â¯ GH and 19 RC showed total retention loss, 5â¯ GH were partially lost (pâ¯=â¯0.396/Cox). FDI ratings were not sufficiently different for any domain except surface luster, where RC showed higher score (pâ¯<â¯0.001). Costs were initially lower for GH (32.57; SD 16.36 ) than RC (44.25; SD 21.40 ), while re-treatment costs were similar (GH: 9.15; SD 15.70 ; RC: 7.35; SD 14.51 ), resulting in significantly lower costs for GH (GH: 41.72; SD 25.08 ) than RC (51.60; 26.17 ) (pâ¯<â¯0.001/GLM). CONCLUSIONS: While survival was not significantly different, GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC for restoring non-carious cervical lesions. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Within this trial, survival was not significantly different between GH and RC to restore sclerotic NCCLs. As GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC, using RC was only cost-effective for payers willing to invest high additional expenses per minimal survival gains.","Schwendicke, Falk; Müller, Anne; Seifert, Tilmann; Jeggle-Engbert, Linda-Maria; Paris, Sebastian; Göstemeyer, Gerd",J Dent,526,20

Because the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is implicated in ARDS pathogenesis, we investigated the presence of NETs and correlates of pathogenesis in blood and LRT samples of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Plasma NET levels peaked early after ICU admission and correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in sputum and levels of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines and inflammatory markers in plasma. Baseline plasma NET quantity correlated with disease severity, but was not associated with soluble markers of thrombosis nor with development of thrombosis. High NET levels were present in LRT samples and persisted during the course of COVID-19, consistent with the detection of NETs in bronchi and alveolar spaces in lung tissue from fatal COVID-19 patients. Thus, NETs are produced and retained in the LRT of critical COVID-19 patients and could contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS pathology. .","Ouwendijk, Werner J D; Raadsen, Matthijs P; van Kampen, Jeroen J A; Verdijk, Robert M; von der Thusen, Jan H; Guo, Lihui; Hoek, Rogier A S; van den Akker, Johannes P C; Endeman, Henrik; Langerak, Thomas; Molenkamp, Richard; Gommers, Diederik; Koopmans, Marion P G; van Gorp, Eric C M; Verjans, Georges M G M; Haagmans, Bart L",J. infect. dis,526,25

In total, the country had more than 20.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including over 582,764 fatalities. A set of emerging variants arose in the country, some of them posing new challenges for COVID-19 control. The goal of this study was to describe mutational events across samples from Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sequences publicly obtainable on Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data-EpiCoV (GISAID-EpiCoV) platform and to generate indexes of new mutations by each genome. A total of 16,953 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained, which were not proportionally representative of the five Brazilian geographical regions. A comparative sequence analysis was conducted to identify common mutations located at 42 positions of the genome (38 were in coding regions, whereas two were in 5′ and two in 3′ UTR). Moreover, 11 were synonymous variants, 27 were missense variants, and more than 44.4% were located in the spike gene. Across the total of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) identified, 32 were found in genomes obtained from all five Brazilian regions. While a high genomic diversity has been reported in Europe given the large number of sequenced genomes, Africa has demonstrated high potential for new variants. In South America, Brazil, and Chile, rates have been similar to those found in South Africa and India, providing enough “space” for new mutations to arise. Genomic surveillance is the central key to identifying the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and has shown that the country is one of the “hotspots” in the generation of new variants.","de Souza, Ueric José Borges; dos Santos, Raíssa Nunes; Campos, Fabrício Souza; Lourenço, Karine Lima; da Fonseca, Flavio Guimarães; Spilki, Fernando Rosado",Viruses,526,22

Further, an estimated 3.5 million people became/remained uninsured from COVID-19-related job losses. Patients with OSA that belong to a lower socioeconomic status (SES) are less likely to have access to healthcare and may be under or uninsured. Untreated OSA can lead to increased risk of symptoms and associated co-morbidities. Resources to help the uninsured to obtain PAP therapy were available pre-COVID, including two main sources, American Sleep Apnea Association (ASAA) and our local branch serving central Ohio, The Breathing Association. However, the COVID pandemic limited access or closed these programs. Our Sleep Medicine clinics saw 148 uninsured OSA patients between March-December, 2020. Given these difficulties, we re-evaluated available resources for the uninsured. METHODS: We conducted a search for current low cost ($100 or less) PAP therapy options for the uninsured, March 15, 2020-December 3, 2020, by: (1) contacting pre-COVID-19 resources, including Durable Medical Equipment (DME) providers, (2) consulting social work, and (3) completing a librarian assisted web-search not limited to PubMed, Embase, CINAHL for academic related articles and electronic searches using a combination of English complete word and common keywords: OSA, PAP, uninsured, no insurance, cheap, medically uninsured, resources, self-pay, low-income, financial assistance, US. Resources such as private sellers were not investigated. RESULTS: During COVID-19, assistance for PAP machines/supplies have closed or required a protracted wait-time. Options including refurbished items range from low, one-time fixed cost or income-based discounts from: one local charity (Joint Organization for Inner-City Needs) and DME (Dasco), and four national entities (ASAA, Second Wind CPAP, Reggie White Foundation, CPAP Liquidators). An Electronic Health Record-based tool was developed and distributed to increase provider awareness of pandemic available resources. CONCLUSION: Untreated OSA is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular co-morbidities. Access and cost may limit treatment in OSA patients from a lower SES. The COVID-19 pandemic has shuttered programs providing discount PAP and supplies, leaving fewer resources for these patients, thus further widening this health care disparity. Alternatives are needed and current resources are not easily accessible for providers and patients. Support (if any):","Malinky, Melissa; Oberla, Abigail; Khan, Meena; Melanie Lyons, M",Sleep,526,18

The disease severity in 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid 19) infection has varied from mild self-limiting flu-like illness to fulminant pneumonia, respiratory failure and death.

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic role of MPV in Covid patients with diabetes. Methods A total of 640 subjects (160 Covid patients with type 2 diabetes, 160 healthy controls, 160 patients with non-spesific infections and 160 Covid patients without type 2 diabetes) enrolled in the study. Results MPV was significantly higher (11.21 ± 0.61 fL) as compared to the results from the last routine visits of the the same individuals with diabetes (10.59 ± 0.96 fL) (p = 0.000).

Experts assume that it is particularly affecting people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), especially those with washing compulsions. Data, however, are currently lacking. 394 participants with OCD (n = 223 washers) participated in an online survey. Change in severity of OCD symptoms, reasons participants reported for the change (e.g., reduced mobility, reduced availability of cleaning products, economic factors, interpersonal conflicts), as well as participants’ beliefs and experience associated with COVID-19 were assessed. 72% of the participants reported an increase in OCD. This increase was significantly stronger in washers compared to non-washers. The worsening of symptoms was primarily associated with reduced mobility and interpersonal conflicts. Dysfunctional hygiene-related beliefs were significantly higher in washers than non-washers and were associated with greater symptom progression. Washers were more confident than non-washers about providing other people with helpful advice related to infection preventions. Washers, however, received more negative feedback from others in response to the advice they provided than non-washers. The majority of participants with OCD were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative effects were more pronounced in washers than in non-washers. Rapid interventions for OCD should be implemented to prevent long-term deterioration.","Jelinek, Lena; Moritz, Steffen; Miegel, Franziska; Voderholzer, Ulrich",J Anxiety Disord,526,22

A pre-requisite to an effective control strategy is that predictions need to be accompanied by estimates of their precision, to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of 'best guess' predictions. In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias.

IPV is associated with an increased risk of homicide, with firearms as the most commonly used weapon. We designed this study to better understand the correlation of interpersonal trauma exposures and demographic factors on firearm perceptions among a cohort of IPV-exposed women. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-seven women in central Pennsylvania with exposure to IPV were surveyed about perceptions of gun access, safety, and gun presence in the home. Trauma variables included IPV type, IPV recency, unwanted sexual exposure, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Multivariable analyses examined three questions examining firearm perceptions controlling for trauma exposures and demographics. RESULTS: Ease of firearm acquisition: Women who were older (mean 44.92 years +/− SD 12.05), compared to women who were younger (40.91 +/− SD 11.81 years) were more likely to describe it as easy or very easy to acquire a gun (aOR 1.05, 95%CI 1.004, 1.10). Perceived safety in the proximity of a gun: Women with the highest ACE score were less likely to feel safe with a gun nearby (aOR 0.31, 95%CI 0.14, 0.67). Odds of guns in the home: Women who were divorced or separated (aOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.09, 0.54), women were widowed or single (aOR0.23, 95%CI 0.08, 0.67), and women who were partnered (aOR 0.45 95%CI 0.20, 0.97) had lower odds of having a gun in the home, compared to married women. There was no significant effect of the trauma variables on the odds of having a gun at home. CONCLUSIONS: Women with more severe childhood trauma felt less safe around firearms, but trauma exposures did not predict the perception of gun prevalence in the local community or gun ownership.

Until safe and efficacious vaccines or antiviral drugs become widely available, viral testing remains the primary mitigation measure for rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals. We aimed to assess the economic trade-offs of expanding and accelerating testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the USA in different transmission scenarios. METHODS: We used a multiscale model that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and daily viral load dynamics at the individual level to assess eight surveillance testing strategies that varied by testing frequency (from daily to monthly testing) and isolation period (1 or 2 weeks), compared with the status-quo strategy of symptom-based testing and isolation. For each testing strategy, we first estimated the costs (incorporating costs of diagnostic testing and admissions to hospital, and salary lost while in isolation) and years of life lost (YLLs) prevented under rapid and low transmission scenarios. We then assessed the testing strategies across a range of scenarios, each defined by effective reproduction number (R(e)), willingness to pay per YLL averted, and cost of a test, to estimate the probability that a particular strategy had the greatest net benefit. Additionally, for a range of transmission scenarios (R(e) from 1·1 to 3), we estimated a threshold test price at which the status-quo strategy outperforms all testing strategies considered. FINDINGS: Our modelling showed that daily testing combined with a 2-week isolation period was the most costly strategy considered, reflecting increased costs with greater test frequency and length of isolation period. Assuming a societal willingness to pay of US$100 000 per YLL averted and a price of $5 per test, the strategy most likely to be cost-effective under a rapid transmission scenario (R(e) of 2·2) is weekly testing followed by a 2-week isolation period subsequent to a positive test result. Under low transmission scenarios (R(e) of 1·2), monthly testing of the population followed by 1-week isolation rather than 2-week isolation is likely to be most cost-effective. Expanded surveillance testing is more likely to be cost-effective than the status-quo testing strategy if the price per test is less than $75 across all transmission rates considered. INTERPRETATION: Extensive expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing programmes with more frequent and rapid tests across communities coupled with isolation of individuals with confirmed infection is essential for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, resources recouped from shortened isolation duration could be cost-effectively allocated to more frequent testing.

We aimed to investigate the association of sleep quality with clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We conducted a prospective cohort study in 205 adult hospitalized patients with diagnosed moderate COVID-19, with follow-up until hospital discharge or death. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assessed sleep quality before and after infection. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe or critical pneumonia, and the secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and laboratory measurements during the follow up. Among the 205 included hospitalized patients, 185 (90.2 %) experienced poorer sleep quality after infection than before according to the PSQI score, and 25 (12.2 %) developed severe or critical pneumonia during follow-up. In Cox regression models, the adjusted hazard ratio of developing severe or critical pneumonia associated with each 1 score increment in the PSQI score before and after infection was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.39) and 1.35 (95 % CI: 1.08, 1.67), respectively. Poorer sleep quality was also significantly associated with a prolonged hospital stay and more serious dysregulations in immune system indicated by several laboratory markers.

VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","Hernández, A.; Papadakos, P.

The difference in testing makes it difficult to compare the effect of different containment strategies. We propose methods to allow a direct comparison and we present the results of this comparison. DESIGN: Publicly available data on numbers of reported COVID-19 related deaths between January 1(st) and April 17(th) 2020 were compared between countries. RESULTS: The numbers of cases or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants give severely biased comparisons between countries. Only the number of deaths expressed as a percentage of the number of deaths on day 25 after the first reported COVID-19 related death allows a direct comparison between countries. From this comparison we observed clear differences between countries, associated with the timing of the implementation of containment measures. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons between countries are only possible when simultaneously taking into account that the virus did not arrive in all countries simultaneously, absolute numbers are incomparable due to different population sizes, rates per 100,000 of the population are incomparable because not all countries are affected homogeneously, susceptibility to death by COVID-19 can differ between populations, and a death will only be reported as a COVID-19 related death if the patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. With our methods, we accounted for all these factors and established an unbiased direct comparison between countries. This comparison confirms that early adoption of containment strategies is key in flattening the curve of the epidemic.","Middelburg, Rutger A.; Rosendaal, Frits R.",Int J Infect Dis,526,30

658451,658451,658451,Does retirement reduce familiarity with Information and Communication Technology?,14.022754,0.92976344,2021-07-03,"[Image: see text] A recently identified variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus, known as the United Kingdom (UK) variant (lineage B.1.1.7), has an N501Y mutation on its spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key protein for the viral entry into the host cells. Here, we report an efficient computational approach, including the simple energy minimizations and binding free energy calculations, starting from an experimental structure of the binding complex along with experimental calibration of the calculated binding free energies, to rapidly and reliably predict the binding affinities of the N501Y mutant with human ACE2 (hACE2) and recently reported miniprotein and hACE2 decoy (CTC-445.2) drug candidates. It has been demonstrated that the N501Y mutation markedly increases the ACE2-spike protein binding affinity (K(d)) from 22 to 0.44 nM, which could partially explain why the UK variant is more infectious. The miniproteins are predicted to have ∼10,000- to 100,000-fold diminished binding affinities with the N501Y mutant, creating a need for design of novel therapeutic candidates to overcome the N501Y mutation-induced drug resistance. The N501Y mutation is also predicted to decrease the binding affinity of a hACE2 decoy (CTC-445.2) binding with the spike protein by ∼200-fold. This convenient computational approach along with experimental calibration may be similarly used in the future to predict the binding affinities of potential new variants of the spike protein.","Williams, Alexander H.; Zhan, Chang-Guo",J Phys Chem B,526,27

METHODS: We followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods. FINDINGS: Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days. INTERPRETATION: The consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.

Here we present the clinical characteristics of 12 GBS patients from Suriname that were hospitalized between the beginning of 2016 and half 2018. Extensive diagnostic testing was performed for pathogens that are commonly associated with GBS, but also for arboviruses, in order to identify the preceding infection that might have led to GBS. With this extensive testing algorithm, we could identify a recent infection in six patients of which four of them had evidence of a recent Zika virus or dengue virus infection. These results suggest that arboviruses, specifically Zika virus but possibly also dengue virus, might be important causative agents of GBS in Suriname. Furthermore, we found that more accessibility of intravenous immunoglobulins or plasma exchange could improve the treatment of GBS in Suriname.","Langerak, Thomas; van Rooij, Irene; Doornekamp, Laura; Chandler, Felicity; Baptista, Mark; Yang, Harvey; Koopmans, Marion P.

This report describes the application of telehealth for medical screening, clinical decision making, and medical referral in a physical therapy practice. The patient described was a 50-year old man who contacted his physical therapist via telephone for a chief complaint of worsening left sided numbness and tingling that began insidiously 2 days prior. Further questioning revealed that the patient also complained of left ankle weakness, and slight unsteadiness with walking. He had not been feeling well and had been experiencing increasing bouts of unexplained fatigue over the previous two months that were now interfering with his work and recreational activities. The patient was evaluated by his physician the next day. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a large (4 cm) falcine meningioma in the right parietal region. The patient was immediately referred to a neurosurgeon and underwent a craniotomy and tumor resection ten days later and subsequent gamma knife radiosurgery of the residual tumor bed two months after craniotomy and tumor resection. Follow-up imaging one year later revealed no evidence of recurrence or residual tumor. This patient case underscores the importance of recognizing signs and symptoms of serious disease, and how referral following telehealth via telephone can inform diagnosis.","Boggs, Ryan; Frappa, Nicholas; Ross, Michael; Tall, Michael",International journal of telerehabilitation,526,20

However, many host-targeted agents are natural products which can be difficult to optimize using synthetic chemistry alone. We describe the orthogonal combination of bioengineering and semisynthetic chemistry to optimize the drug-like properties of sanglifehrin A, a known cyclophilin inhibitor of mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide origin in order to generate the drug candidate NVP018 (formerly BC556). NVP018 is a potent inhibitor of HBV, HCV and HIV-1 replication, shows minimal inhibition of major drug transporters and has a high barrier to generation of both HCV and HIV-1 resistance.","Hansson, Magnus Joakim; Moss, Steven James; Bobardt, Michael; Chatterji, Udayan; Coates, Nigel; Garcia-Rivera, Jose A; Elmér, Eskil; Kendrew, Steve; Leyssen, Pieter; Neyts, Johan; Nur-E-Alam, Mohammad; Warneck, Tony; Wilkinson, Barrie; Gallay, Philippe; Gregory, Matthew Alan",Chem Biol,526,5
