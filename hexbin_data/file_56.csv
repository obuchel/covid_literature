79,Open lung biopsy in early-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome,2006-07-19,"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has heterogeneous etiologies, rapid progressive change and a high mortality rate. To improve the outcome of ARDS, accurate diagnosis is essential to the application of effective early treatment. The present study investigated the clinical effects and safety of open lung biopsy (OLB) in patients with early-stage ARDS of suspected non-infectious origin. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of 41 patients with early-stage ARDS (defined as one week or less after intubation) who underwent OLB in two medical intensive care units of a tertiary care hospital from 1999 to 2005. Data analyzed included baseline characteristics, complication rate, pathological diagnoses, treatment alterations, and hospital survival. RESULTS: The age of patients was 55 ± 17 years (mean ± SD). The average ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) was 116 ± 43 mmHg (mean ± SD) at biopsy. Seventeen patients (41%) were immunocompromised. Postoperative complications occurred in 20% of patients (8/41). All biopsies provided a pathological diagnosis with a diagnostic yield of 100%. Specific pathological diagnoses were made for 44% of patients (18/41). Biopsy findings led to an alteration of treatment modality in 73% of patients (30/41). The treatment alteration rate was higher in patients with nonspecific diagnoses than in patients with specific diagnoses (p = 0.0024). Overall mortality was 50% (21/41) and was not influenced by age, gender, pre-OLB oxygenation, complication rate, pathological results, and alteration of treatment. There was no surgery-related mortality. The survival rate for immunocompromised patients was better than that for immunocompetent patients (71% versus 33%; p = 0.0187) in this study. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective study suggests that OLB was a useful and acceptably safe diagnostic procedure in some selected patients with early-stage ARDS.","Kao, Kuo-Chin; Tsai, Ying-Huang; Wu, Yao-Kuang; Chen, Ning-Hung; Hsieh, Meng-Jer; Huang, Shiu-Feng; Huang, Chung-Chi",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1751007/,56
1879,Common variants of NFE2L2 gene predisposes to acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe sepsis,2015-06-16,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether common variants across the nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) gene contribute to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe sepsis. NFE2L2 is involved in the response to oxidative stress, and it has been shown to be associated with the development of ARDS in trauma patients. METHODS: We performed a case–control study of 321 patients fulfilling international criteria for severe sepsis and ARDS who were admitted to a Spanish network of post-surgical and critical care units, as well as 871 population-based controls. Six tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NFE2L2 were genotyped, and, after further imputation of additional 34 SNPs, association testing with ARDS susceptibility was conducted using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: After multiple testing adjustments, our analysis revealed 10 non-coding SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium (0.75 ≤ r(2) ≤ 1) that were associated with ARDS susceptibility as a single association signal. One of those SNPs (rs672961) was previously associated with trauma-induced ARDS and modified the promoter activity of the NFE2L2 gene, showing an odds ratio of 1.93 per T allele (95 % confidence interval, 1.17–3.18; p = 0.0089). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the involvement of NFE2L2 gene variants in ARDS susceptibility and reinforce further exploration of the role of oxidant stress response as a risk factor for ARDS in critically ill patients.","Acosta-Herrera, Marialbert; Pino-Yanes, Maria; Blanco, Jesús; Ballesteros, Juan Carlos; Ambrós, Alfonso; Corrales, Almudena; Gandía, Francisco; Subirá, Carlés; Domínguez, David; Baluja, Aurora; Añón, José Manuel; Adalia, Ramón; Pérez-Méndez, Lina; Flores, Carlos; Villar, Jesus",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484894/,56

3601,Biomarkers for Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome and prospects for personalised medicine,2019-01-15,"Acute lung injury (ALI) affects over 10% of patients hospitalised in critical care, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) being the most severe form of ALI and having a mortality rate in the region of 40%. There has been slow but incremental progress in identification of biomarkers that contribute to the pathophysiology of ARDS, have utility in diagnosis and monitoring, and that are potential therapeutic targets (Calfee CS, Delucchi K, Parsons PE, Thompson BT, Ware LB, Matthay MA, Thompson T, Ware LB, Matthay MA, Lancet Respir Med 2014, 2:611–-620). However, a major issue is that ARDS is such a heterogeneous, multi-factorial, end-stage condition that the strategies for “lumping and splitting” are critical (Prescott HC, Calfee CS, Thompson BT, Angus DC, Liu VX, Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2016, 194:147–-155). Nevertheless, sequencing of the human genome, the availability of improved methods for analysis of transcription to mRNA (gene expression), and development of sensitive immunoassays has allowed the application of network biology to ARDS, with these biomarkers offering potential for personalised or precision medicine (Sweeney TE, Khatri P, Toward precision medicine Crit Care Med; 2017 45:934-939). Biomarker panels have potential applications in molecular phenotyping for identifying patients at risk of developing ARDS, diagnosis of ARDS, risk stratification and monitoring. Two subphenotypes of ARDS have been identified on the basis of blood biomarkers: hypo-inflammatory and hyper-inflammatory. The hyper-inflammatory subphenotype is associated with shock, metabolic acidosis and worst clinical outcomes. Biomarkers of particular interest have included interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), surfactant proteins (SPD and SPB), von Willebrand factor antigen, angiopoietin 1/2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In terms of gene expression (mRNA) in blood there have been found to be increases in neutrophil-related genes in sepsis-induced and influenza-induced ARDS, but whole blood expression does not give a robust diagnostic test for ARDS. Despite improvements in management of ARDS on the critical care unit, this complex disease continues to be a major life-threatening event. Clinical trials of β(2)-agonists, statins, surfactants and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) have been disappointing. In addition, monoclonal antibodies (anti-TNF) and TNFR fusion protein have also been unconvincing. However, there have been major advances in methods of mechanical ventilation, a neuromuscular blocker (cisatracurium besilate) has shown some benefit, and stem cell therapy is being developed. In the future, by understanding the role of biomarkers in the pathophysiology of ARDS and lung injury, it is hoped that this will provide rational therapeutic targets and ultimately improve clinical care (Seymour CW, Gomez H, Chang CH, Clermont G, Kellum JA, Kennedy J, Yende S, Angus DC, Crit Care 2017, 21:257).","Spadaro, Savino; Park, Mirae; Turrini, Cecilia; Tunstall, Tanushree; Thwaites, Ryan; Mauri, Tommaso; Ragazzi, Riccardo; Ruggeri, Paolo; Hansel, Trevor T.; Caramori, Gaetano; Volta, Carlo Alberto",J Inflamm (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6332898/,56
4002,Biomarker profiles of coagulopathy and alveolar epithelial injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome with idiopathic/immune-related disease or common direct risk factors,2019-08-19,"BACKGROUND: Altered coagulation and alveolar injury are the hallmarks of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, whether the biomarkers that reflect pathophysiology differ depending on the etiology of ARDS has not been examined. This study aimed to investigate the biomarker profiles of coagulopathy and alveolar epithelial injury in two subtypes of ARDS: patients with direct common risk factors (dARDS) and those with idiopathic or immune-related diseases (iARDS), which are classified as “ARDS without common risk factors” based on the Berlin definition. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study included adult patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a university hospital with a diagnosis of ARDS with no indirect risk factors. Plasma biomarkers (thrombin–antithrombin complex [TAT], plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI]-1, protein C [PC] activity, procalcitonin [PCT], surfactant protein [SP]-D, and KL-6) were routinely measured during the first 5 days of the patient’s ICU stay. RESULTS: Among 138 eligible patients with ARDS, 51 were excluded based on the exclusion criteria (n = 41) or other causes of ARDS (n = 10). Of the remaining 87 patients, 56 were identified as having dARDS and 31 as having iARDS. Among the iARDS patients, TAT (marker of thrombin generation) and PAI-1 (marker of inhibited fibrinolysis) were increased, and PC activity was above normal. In contrast, PC activity was significantly decreased, and TAT or PAI-1 was present at much higher levels in dARDS compared with iARDS patients. Significant differences were also observed in PCT, SP-D, and KL-6 between patients with dARDS and iARDS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that areas under the ROC curve for PC activity, PAI-1, PCT, SP-D, and KL-6 were similarly high for distinguishing between dARDS and iARDS (PC 0.86, P = 0.33; PAI-1 0.89, P = 0.95; PCT 0.89, P = 0.66; and SP-D 0.88, P = 0.16 vs. KL-6 0.90, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy and alveolar epithelial injury were observed in both patients with dARDS and with iARDS. However, their biomarker profiles were significantly different between the two groups. The different patterns of PAI-1, PC activity, SP-D, and KL-6 may help in differentiating between these ARDS subtypes.

10691,Increased mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with high levels of plasma phenylalanine,2020-04-30,"The effect of exposure to ultra‐low temperature (liquid nitrogen, LN) on viability of seeds desiccated to various water contents was investigated in 9 coffee species. Three groups of species could be distinguished based on seed survival after LN exposure. In group 1 species, no seedling production could be obtained after LN exposure due to endosperm injury. In group 2 species, recovery was very low or nil after rapid cooling, and only moderate after slow cooling. In group 3 species, very high percentages of seedling development were observed after both rapid and slow cooling. A high interspecific variability for the high moisture freezing limit was observed within the species of groups 2 and 3, since it ranged from 0.14 to 0.26 g H(2)O g(−1) dry weight. A very highly significant correlation was found for those species between the unfreezable water content, as determined from DSC analysis, and the high moisture freezing limit of their seeds. No significant correlation was found between seed lipid content, which varied from 9.8 to 34.6% dry weight, and survival after LN exposure. However, a negative relationship was found between seed unfreezable water content and lipid content. Interspecific differences in fatty acid composition of seed lipids resulted in a high variability in the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids, which ranged from 28.7 to 54.4% among the 9 species studied. For all species studied, a highly significant correlation was found between the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids and the percentage of seedling recovery after rapid or slow cooling.","Dussert, Stéphane; Chabrillange, Nathalie; Rocquelin, Gérard; Engelmann, Florent; Lopez, Marcel; Hamon, Serge",Physiol Plant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193679/,56

Its main clinical characteristics is abrupt onset of the disease and the initial symptom is fever accompanied with systematic symptoms of headache, soreness and fatigue, and respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, chest dullness, and dyspnea. A few cases may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Due to its self-limiting feature, the prognosis is predominantly good but may be poor in severe cases, with mortality about 9.3 %. Some patients may develop such complications such as lung fibrosis and necrosis of the head of femur. On April 8, 2003, SARS was defined as a legal infectious disease by the Ministry of Heath of China.","Zhou, Bo-Ping; Lu, Pu-Xuan; Chen, Qiu; Xiao-Ping, Tang; Yu-Juan, Guan; Jin-Xin, Liu; Xing, Lu; Zhen-Wei, Lang; Xin-Chun, Chen",Diagnostic Imaging of Emerging Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122356/,56

51018,Whole Blood Based Resuscitation in Trauma is Associated with a Decreased Incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND: Given the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel restrictions have been in effect since March 2020 in Canada. As a result, some patients requiring international travel for medical care have experienced delays. Therefore, innovative techniques were required to provide care that would not routinely be performed in Canada, as in the case of Orbera® gastric balloon retrieval. AIMS: To describe an approach to gastric balloon retrieval amidst COVID-19 related travel restrictions METHODS: Case review of three cases of gastric balloon retrieval was performed RESULTS: 1: A 41-year-old (yo) woman had an Orbera® gastric balloon placement in Washington state in September 2019. She lost 42lbs. Retrieval was scheduled for March 2020, but was delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions. In May 2020, she developed symptoms of balloon dysfunction. The patient was referred to a Canadian tertiary care centre. Gastroscopy was performed under conscious sedation. The Orbera® balloon was in the distal gastric body. The balloon was punctured with a 19G EUS FNA needle; 600cc of blue tinted liquid was aspirated. The emptied balloon was retrieved successfully using rat tooth forceps. 2: A 35-yo woman had an Orbera® gastric balloon placed in October 2019 in Toronto at a private health facility. She lost 20lbs. Retrieval of the balloon was scheduled for March 2020, but due to COVID-19 restrictions, it was not possible at the original facility. She did not have symptoms related to the balloon. Gastroscopy was performed under general anesthesia (GA) on October 8, 2020. The balloon was intact in the distal gastric body. The balloon was punctured with a 19G Cook Echotip Needle and vacuum suction applied; 400cc of blue tinted fluid was removed. Alligator forceps were used to create holes in the underside of the balloon, allowing excess fluid to be expelled as the balloon was pulled up against the GEJ. Once the balloon was deflated, it was removed successfully through the mouth. 3: A 38-yo man had an Orbera® gastric balloon placed in his native Columbia in March 2020. He did not achieve weight loss. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, he was unable to return for planned removal. He did not have symptoms related to the balloon. Gastroscopy was performed under GA on October 8, 2020. The balloon was intact in the distal gastric body. The balloon was punctured with a 19G Cook Echotip Needle and vacuum suction applied; 600cc of blue tinted fluid was removed. Alligator forceps were used in retroflexion to tear the underside of the flattened balloon to ensure all liquid and air had escaped from the balloon. Once the balloon was deflated, it was removed successfully through the mouth. CONCLUSIONS: Although Orbera® gastric balloon retrieval is not routinely performed in Canada, we demonstrate that gastroscopy with balloon puncture and forceps-retrieval is a safe option.

54543,Indicative Factors for 48 or More Hours of Mechanical Ventilation to Optimize the Use of Orotracheal Tubes with Supra-cuff Suction Devices: a Retrospective Study,2021-06-16,"To sustain competitiveness in contemporary, fast-paced markets, organizations increasingly focus on innovating their business models to enhance current value propositions or to explore novel sources of value creation. However, business model innovation is a complex task, characterized by shifting characteristics in terms of uncertainty, data availability and its impact on decision making. To cope with such challenges, business model evaluation is advocated to make sense of novel business models and to support decision making. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are frequently used in business model evaluation to structure the performance assessment of these models and to evaluate their strategic implications, in turn aiding business model decision making. However, given the shifting characteristics of the innovation process, the application and effectiveness of KPIs depend significantly on how such KPIs are defined. The techniques proposed in the existing literature typically generate or use quantitatively oriented KPIs, which are not well-suited for the early phases of the business model innovation process. Therefore, following a design science research methodology, we have developed a novel method for defining business model KPIs, taking into account the characteristics of the innovation process, offering holistic support toward decision making. Building on theory on linguistic summarization, we use a set of structured templates to define qualitative KPIs that are suitable to support early-phase decision making. In addition, we show how these KPIs can be gradually quantified to support later phases of the innovation process. We have evaluated our method by applying it in two real-life business cases, interviewing 13 industry experts to assess its utility.","Gilsing, Rick; Wilbik, Anna; Grefen, Paul; Turetken, Oktay; Ozkan, Baris; Adali, Onat Ege; Berkers, Frank",Softw Syst Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204076/,56

66840,Asymptomatic coronavirus infection among pregnant women: a necessity for universal screening of COVID-19 in pregnant women admitted to labor.,2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND Approximately 70% of hospitals today are part of larger health systems. Proponents of hospital consolidation tout its potential to reduce health spending and improve outcomes, but to the authors' knowledge the available evidence has suggested that this promise is unrealized. Variations in costs and outcomes within systems may highlight opportunities for collaborative quality improvement and practice standardization. To assess this potential, the authors sought to measure variations in episode spending within and across hospital systems among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing complex cancer surgery. METHODS Using 100% Medicare claims data, the authors identified fee-for-service Medicare patients who were undergoing elective pancreatectomy, lung resection, or colectomy for cancer from 2014 through 2016. Risk-adjusted, price-standardized payments for the surgical episode from admission through 30 days after discharge were calculated. The authors then assessed the reliability-adjusted variations at the hospital and system levels. RESULTS Average episode payments varied nearly as much within hospital systems for pancreatectomy ($1946 between the lowest and highest spending systems; 95% CI, $1910-$1972), lung resection ($625 between the lowest and highest spending systems; 95% CI, $621-$630), and colectomy ($813 between the lowest and highest spending systems; 95% CI, $809-$817) as they did between the lowest and highest spending hospitals (pancreatectomy: $2034; lung resection: $1789; and colectomy: $770). For pancreatectomy, this variation was driven by index hospitalization spending whereas both index hospitalization and postacute care use drove variations for lung resection and colectomy. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis of Medicare patients undergoing complex cancer surgery, wide variations in surgical episode spending were noted both within and across hospital systems. System leaders may seek to better understand variations in practices among their hospitals to standardize care and reduce variations in outcomes, use, and costs.","Diaz, Adrian; Chhabra, Karan R; Dimick, Justin B; Nathan, Hari",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141926/,56

Given the potential for subsequent deterioration and growing appreciation of complications relating to COVID-19 infection, this follow up study was instigated to provide clinical reassurance that discharged patients had followed a safe clinical course. 199 patients discharged from the ED of our central London hospital were identified over a 20-day period at the height of the pandemic in April 2020. 44 had already reattended ED and 12 had been admitted. At 2-week telephone follow-up, 14 patients were identified who required urgent recall for assessment. At 4-week telephone follow-up, 87 patients were identified with persistent symptoms requiring face to face review. A COVID-19 follow-up clinic was therefore established to provide multi-professional review and diagnostics. 65 patients attended for this assessment. This is the first report on outcomes in COVID-19 infected patients discharged from an ED. It highlights the importance of safety-netting after discharge, the difficulty in predicting which patients might deteriorate and the need for appropriate follow up services.","Lanham, David; Roe, Jennifer; Chauhan, Alisha; Evans, Rebecca; Hillman, Toby; Logan, Sarah; Heightman, Melissa",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419864/,56

RESEARCH QUESTION This study aimed to investigate the differences in whole leg and lower limb joint stiffness at different walking speeds and the interactions between leg and lower limb joint stiffness. METHODS Twenty-seven healthy adults, seventeen males (age: 19.6 ± 2.2 years, height: 176.0 ± 6.0 cm, mass: 69.7 ± 8.9 kg), and ten females (age: 19.1 ± 1.9 years, height: 164.0 ± 3.0 cm, mass: 59.6 ± 3.8 kg), were recruited. Dynamic leg and joint stiffness were calculated during eccentric loading from data recorded using 3D infrared motion analysis and force plates at slow, normal, and fast walking speeds. Differences in dynamic stiffness, joint angles and moments were explored between the walking speeds using Repeated Measures ANOVA with Sidak post-hoc tests. Correlations between leg, joint stiffness, and walking speed were also explored. RESULTS The results indicated that the leg dynamic stiffness is decreased by walking speed, however, hip and ankle joint stiffness were increased (p < 0.001) and knee stiffness was unaffected. Leg stiffness showed no correlation with hip, knee, or ankle stiffness. A positive significant correlation was seen between hip and ankle stiffness (p < 0.01) and between knee and ankle stiffness (p < 0.001), however, no correlation was seen between hip and knee stiffness. SIGNIFICANCE These results suggest leg stiffness is not associated with lower limb joint stiffness during eccentric loading. This provides new information on the responses of ankle, knee and hip joint stiffness to walking speed.","Akl, Abdel-Rahman; Baca, Arnold; Richards, Jim; Conceição, Filipe",Gait & posture,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.09.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007686/,56
84629,[Prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19].,2020-06-24,"Objectives The aims of this study were to assess the feasibility of single-port laparoscopic surgical staging (SPLS) in early ovarian cancer and to compare the surgical outcomes of SPLS with those of staging laparotomy. Methods Between January 2014 and December 2018, 40 patients underwent SPLS and 41 patients underwent staging laparotomy at Yonsei Cancer Center. The patients were diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I ovarian cancer. Variables such as patient age, body mass index (BMI), tumor size, FIGO stage, and perioperative surgical outcomes and survival outcomes of SPLS and laparotomy were compared. Results The total operation time was similar between the 2 groups (SPLS: 201.4 vs. laparotomy: 203.0 minutes, P=0.806). The median tumor diameters in the SPLS and laparotomy groups were 11.0 (2.5-28 cm) and 15.4 (6-40 cm), respectively (P=0.001). The SPLS group had lower tumor spillage rate (5.0% vs. 19.5%, P=0.047), less intraoperative blood loss (102.0 vs. 371.5 mL, P<0.001), less postoperative pain, and shorter postoperative hospital stay (5 vs. 9.5 days, P<0.001). The intraoperative major complication rate was similar between groups (2.5% vs. 4.9%, P=0.571). There was no significant difference in progression-free survival between the 2 groups (P=0.945). There were no deaths in either group. Conclusion SPLS is feasible in early ovarian cancer and has better perioperative surgical outcomes, in some aspects, than staging laparotomy without compromising survival outcomes. SPLS could be performed in patients suspected to have early ovarian cancer.","Cho, Kyu Hee; Lee, Yeon Ju; Eoh, Kyung Jin; Lee, Yong Jae; Lee, Jung-Yun; Nam, Eun Ji; Kim, Sunghoon; Kim, Young Tae; Kim, Sang Wun",Obstetrics & gynecology science,https://doi.org/10.5468/ogs.20216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33285046/,56
91838,[Therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome is different from traditional acute respiratory distress syndrome].,2020-05-20,"The Glissonian approach, due to its simplicity of procedure, is a technical procedure widely used in open hepatectomy. However, it is not easily applicable in the setting of the total laparoscopic approach because of movement restriction. We herein propose a new and simple method of performing hemihepatectomy by Glissonian approach called temporary inflow control of the Glissonian pedicle (TICGL) technique. Dissection of the Glisson pedicle from the liver parenchyma is done until the posterior margin of the pedicle is visualized, and is clamped with bulldog clamps. Encircling the pedicle is not necessary. Resection of the liver parenchyma is performed under inflow control of the resected side liver providing less bleeding. After sufficient resection is done so that the whole Glissonian pedicle structures are visualized, the pedicle is encircled, often very easily without the fear of bleeding from the posterior side of the pedicle, which is a common problem when encircling is done before parenchymal resection. The staplers may then be applied safely without injuring the major hepatic veins since they have been already exposed. Stapling is done while the tape is retracted toward the contralateral side. This retraction prevents injury or stricture of the contralateral Glissonian pedicle branch. The remnant liver parenchyma is resected and hepatectomy finalized. The TICGL technique provides a safe and easy way of performing major hemihepatectomies, not only by expert laparoscopic surgeons but by less experienced surgeons. It can therefore become a standard method of performing hemihepatectomy by Glissonian approach.","Lee, Nuri; Cho, Chan Woo; Kim, Jong Man; Choi, Gyu-Seong; Kwon, Choon Hyuck David; Joh, Jae-Won",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2017.92.5.383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28480187/,56

OBJECTIVE To determine whether ultra-early ruptured aneurysm treatment leads to not only improved outcomes but also reduced hospitalization cost. METHODS Using 2008-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, we analyzed demographic, clinical, and hospital factors for nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients who were ""directly"" admitted to the treating hospital where they underwent intervention (clipping/coiling). Patients treated on the day of admission (day 0) formed the ultra-early cohort; others formed the deferred treatment cohort. All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups were also included in regression analyses. RESULTS A total of 17 412 patients were directly admitted to a hospital following nontraumatic SAH where they underwent intervention (clipping/coiling). Mean patient age was 53.87 yr (median 53.00, standard deviation 14.247); 68.3% were women (n = 11 893). A total of 6338 (36.4%) patients underwent treatment on the day of admission (ultra-early). Patients who underwent treatment on day 0 had significantly more routine discharge dispositions than those treated >admission day 0 (P < .0001). In regression analysis, treatment on day 0 was protective against other than routine discharge disposition outcome (P < .0001; odds ratio 0.657; 95% confidence interval 0.614-0.838). Total cost incurred by hospitals was $4.36 billion. Mean cost of hospital charges in the ultra-early cohort was $239 126.05, which was significantly lower than that for the cohort treated >day 0 ($272 989.56, P < .001), Mann-Whitney U-test). Performance of an intervention on admission day 0 was protective against higher hospitalization cost (P < .0001; odds ratio 0.811; 95% confidence interval 0.732-0.899). CONCLUSION Ultra-early treatment of ruptured aneurysms is significantly associated with better discharge disposition and decreased hospitalization cost.","Sonig, Ashish; Shallwani, Hussain; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Shakir, Hakeem J; Hopkins, L Nelson; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28541411/,56

We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the HCWs at Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCWs using questionnaires in February and March 2020 in Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran. We evaluated depression, stress, and anxiety levels using the DASS-21 questionnaire. Participants were selected by using census sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. RESULTS The study population included 217 HCWs (111 male, 116 female) and the mean age of the study group was 39.6 years old. Approximately two-thirds of the HCWs stayed in the hospital for 2-3 weeks. The mean scores of depression and stress were at a ""severe"" level, while anxiety scores were at an ""extremely severe"" level. The prevalence of severe scores was 38.71%, 2.30%, and 48.97% for depression, anxiety, and stress, and the prevalence of extremely severe scores was 46.54%, 97.24%, and 4.98% depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. In stress subscale, moderate stress was 47.46%. Female HCWs reported higher levels of depression compared with males. CONCLUSION In this study, HCWs reported experiencing severe and extremely severe psychological burdens. Timely interventions to promote mental health in HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, with female nurses requiring particular attention. This process could be facilitated via tests for molecular biomarkers in accessible body fluids, such as saliva, plasma, and serum.","Moayed, Malihe Sadat; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Mirmomeni, Golshan; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Goharimoghadam, Keivan; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Abbasi-Farajzadeh, Mohsen; Hekmat, Mostafa; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Guest, Paul C; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59261-5_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656728/,56

This dissemination can be decelerated by diagnosing and quarantining patients with COVID-19 at early stages, thereby saving numerous lives. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is known as one of the primary diagnostic tools. However, RT-PCR tests are costly and time-consuming; it also requires specific materials, equipment, and instruments. Moreover, most countries are suffering from a lack of testing kits because of limitations on budget and techniques. Thus, this standard method is not suitable to meet the requirements of fast detection and tracking during the COVID-19 pandemic, which motived to employ deep learning (DL)/convolutional neural networks (CNNs) technology with X-ray and CT scans for efficient analysis and diagnostic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective consecutive series of patients with facial AVMs isolated to the mandible and immediate perimandibular tissue was identified at 2 institutions. The primary treatment modality of transarterial embolization using ONYX was performed by way of the external carotid artery branches. Staged procedures were accomplished until no arteriovenous shunt remained. A 1-year follow-up angiogram was obtained for each patient. RESULTS Three patients, aged 8 (patient 1), 16 (patient 2), and 17 (patient 3) years presented with bleeding from facial AVMs isolated to the mandible. Patient 1 was female and patients 2 and 3 were male. The 2 older patients had loose molar or canine dentition. Transarterial embolization with ONYX achieved complete angiographic closure of the arteriovenous shunt in each patient. A total of 1, 6, and 3 staged embolization procedures were performed in the 3 patients. Patient 2 had mild transient facial numbness after embolization that completely resolved. Patient 3 had loose molars associated with the AVM that were extracted for treatment of intraprocedural bleeding. The 1-year angiographic follow-up data demonstrated durable closure of all 3 lesions. CONCLUSIONS Transarterial embolization of high-flow intraosseus mandibular AVMs was safely accomplished with ONYX in our small retrospective cohort. Complete, durable occlusion was found on the angiogram at 1 year, with clinical stability extending to an average of 3 years. Surgical resection of the AVM was avoided in all 3 patients.","Chandra, Ronil V; Leslie-Mazwi, Thabele M; Orbach, Darren B; Kaban, Leonard B; Rabinov, James D",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2014.02.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704035/,56
129390,Prone Positioning for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).,2020-08-21,"BACKGROUND The tackle is the most common in-play event in rugby union and rugby league (the rugby codes). It is also associated with the greatest propensity for injury and thus accounts for the most injuries in the sport. It is therefore of critical importance to accurately quantify how tackle technique alters injury risk using gold-standard methodology of three-dimensional motion (3D) capture. OBJECTIVE To examine the 3D motion capture methodology of rugby-style tackle techniques to provide recommendations to inform practice for future rugby code research and advance the knowledge of this field. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS Articles published in English language, up to May 2020, were retrieved via nine online databases. All cross-sectional, correlational, observational, and cohort study designs using 3D motion capture of tackle techniques in rugby code players met inclusion criteria for this review. A qualitative synthesis using thematic analysis was pre-specified to identify five key themes. RESULTS Seven articles met eligibility criteria. Participant demographic information (theme one) involved a total of 92 rugby union players, ranging in skill level and playing experience. Experimental task design information (theme two) included one-on-one, front-on (n=5) or side-on (n=1) contact between a tackler and a ball carrier, or a tackler impacting a tackle bag or bump pad (n=3). 3D data collection (theme three) reported differing sampling frequencies and marker sets. 3D data reduction and analysis (theme four) procedures could be mostly replicated, but the definitions of temporal events, joint modelling and filtering varied between studies. Findings of the studies (theme five) showed that the one-on-one tackle technique can be altered (n=5) when tackle height, leg drive and/or tackle speed is modified. A study reported tackle coaching intervention. CONCLUSIONS This is the first review to evaluate 3D motion capture of rugby-style tackle technique research. A research framework was identified: (i) participant demographic information, (ii) experimental task design information, (iii) 3D motion capture data specifications, and (iv) 3D data reduction and analysis. Adherence of future 3D tackling research to these framework principles will provide critical scientific evidence to better inform injury reduction and performance practices in the rugby codes.

131744,Coronavirus disease and vaccination during pregnancy and childbirth: a review of the Israeli perspective and experience.,2021-06-15,"The public health consequences of the conflict in Iraq will likely continue after the violence has subsided. Reestablishing public health security will require large investments in infrastructure and the creation of effective systems of governance. On the question of governance, the allocation of powers in the new constitution of Iraq is critical. Given the ease with which public health threats cross borders, the constitution needs to grant to the federal government the legal authority to manage such threats and simultaneously meet international requirements. Unfortunately, the draft constitution does not accomplish this objective. If politically possible, the constitution should be amended to provide the federal government with this authority. If not possible, the Iraqi federal government would have two options. It could attempt to use alternative constitutional powers, such as national security powers. This option would be contentious and the results uncertain. Alternatively, the federal government could attempt to establish collaborative relationships with regional governments. Residual sectarian tensions create potential problems for this option, however. Reflecting on the Iraqi situation, we conclude that other federalizing countries emerging from conflict should ensure that their constitutions provide the federal government with the necessary authority to manage threats to public health security effectively.","Wilson, Kumanan; Fidler, David P; McDougall, Christopher W; Lazar, Harvey","Journal of health politics, policy and law",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-2009-004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19451409/,56

METHODS Effects of RH and 5% w/w HPMC on MacroceLac(®) 100 Compressibility Index (CI) and tablet mechanical strength (TMS) were evaluated by 'DM(3)'. The 'DM(3)' approach evaluates material properties by combining 'design of experiments', material's 'macroscopic' properties, 'molecular' properties, and 'multivariate analysis' tools. A 4X4 full-factorial experimental design was used to study the relationship of MacroceLac(®) 100 molecular properties (moisture content, dehydration, crystallization, fusion enthalpy, and moisture uptake) and macroscopic particle size and shape on CI and TMS. A physical binary mixture (PBM) of similar composition to MacroceLac(®) 100 was also evaluated. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), principle component analysis, and partial least squares (PLS) were used to analyze the data. RESULTS MANOVA CI ranking was: PBM-HPMC > PBM > MicroceLac(®)100 > MicroceLac(®)100-HPMC (p < 0.0001). MANOVA showed PBM's and PBM-HPMC's TMS values were lower than MicroceLac(®)100 and MicroceLac(®)100-HPMC (p < 0.0001). PLS showed that % RH, HPMC, and several molecular properties significantly affected CI and TMS. CONCLUSIONS Significant MicroceLac(®)100 changes occurred with % RH exposure affecting performance attributes. HPMC physical addition did not prevent molecular or macroscopic matrix changes.","Haware, Rahul V; Kancharla, Joseph P; Udupa, Aishwarya K; Staton, Scott; Gupta, Mali R; Al-Achi, Antoine; Stagner, William C",Pharmaceutical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-015-1721-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26055403/,56

METHODS This was a retrospective study at 2 affiliated New York City hospitals located in the Upper East Side and Lower Manhattan neighborhoods. We performed case reviews using the Hospital Medicine Reengineering Network framework to determine potentially preventable readmissions among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 3, 2020 (date of first case) and April 27, 2020, and readmitted to either of the 2 hospitals within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS Among 53 readmissions after hospitalization for COVID-19, 44 (83%) were deemed not preventable and 9 (17%) were potentially preventable. Nonpreventable readmissions were mostly due to disease progression or complications of COVID-19 (37/44, 84%). Main factors contributing to potentially preventable readmissions were issues with initial disposition (5/9, 56%), premature discharge (3/9, 33%), and inappropriate readmission (1/9, 11%) for someone who likely did not require rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Most readmissions after a COVID-19 hospitalization were not preventable and a consequence of the natural progression of the disease, specifically worsening dyspnea or hypoxemia. Some readmissions were potentially preventable, mostly because of issues with disposition that were directly related to challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians should be aware of challenges with disposition related to circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Choi, Justin J; Contractor, Jigar H; Shaw, Amy L; Abdelghany, Youmna; Frye, Jesse; Renzetti, Madelyn; Smith, Emily; Soiefer, Leland R; Lu, Shuting; Kingery, Justin R; Krishnan, Jamuna K; Levine, William J; Safford, Monika M; Shapiro, Martin F",Journal of patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0000000000000870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852540/,56

A total number of 388 respondents filled in the online survey assessing their knowledge, attitude, and opinion about right to privacy and confidentiality being practiced during the professional contact between the patients and their health care providers. RESULTS Among the respondents, 44 (11.3%) participants were health care professionals, and 344 (88.6%) participants were from the general public. Most of the respondents were females (69.6%) and the mean age was about 27 years. The main sources of knowledge about patients' right to privacy and confidentiality regulations were from school and media platforms. Only 18.1% of the GP respondents reported that they have been introduced to patients' right to privacy and confidentiality regulations by medical staff during professional contact. 97.4% of GP respondents and 93.2% of HS professionals valued patients' right to assure the level of their data privacy prior to receiving medical care. Significantly (p=0.012) higher percentage (93%) of GP respondents believed that there should be no prioritization of privacy based on the gender of the patient. Most of GP respondents had concerns about electronic medical records being violated and their data being reached by unauthorized parties. CONCLUSION The general public and health system professionals in Jordan are familiar with the patients' right to privacy and confidentiality regulations. More efforts must be put in place to inform patients about their rights to privacy and confidentiality practices when they are in professional contact with their healthcare providers. In addition, rules, laws, and legal agreements must be effectively established and monitored to prevent privacy violations.","Bardaweel, Sanaa K; AlMuhaissen, Suha A; Alkurdi, Nujood H; Tayyem, Humzeh H",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33638274/,56

Objective To describe the epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory features of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at a children's hospital and to compare these parameters between patients hospitalized with and without severe disease. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective review of electronic medical records from a tertiary care academically affiliated children's hospital in New York City, New York, included hospitalized children and adolescents (≤21 years) who were tested based on suspicion for COVID-19 between March 1 to April 15, 2020, and had positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Exposures Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Main Outcomes and Measures Severe disease as defined by the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results Among 50 patients, 27 (54%) were boys and 25 (50%) were Hispanic. The median days from onset of symptoms to admission was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-5 days). Most patients (40 [80%]) had fever or respiratory symptoms (32 [64%]), but 3 patients (6%) with only gastrointestinal tract presentations were identified. Obesity (11 [22%]) was the most prevalent comorbidity. Respiratory support was required for 16 patients (32%), including 9 patients (18%) who required mechanical ventilation. One patient (2%) died. None of 14 infants and 1 of 8 immunocompromised patients had severe disease. Obesity was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation in children 2 years or older (6 of 9 [67%] vs 5 of 25 [20%]; P = .03). Lymphopenia was commonly observed at admission (36 [72%]) but did not differ significantly between those with and without severe disease. Those with severe disease had significantly higher C-reactive protein (median, 8.978 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10] vs 0.64 mg/dL) and procalcitonin levels (median, 0.31 ng/mL vs 0.17 ng/mL) at admission (P < .001), as well as elevated peak interleukin 6, ferritin, and D-dimer levels during hospitalization. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 15 patients (30%) but could not be completed for 3. Prolonged test positivity (maximum of 27 days) was observed in 4 patients (8%). Conclusions and Relevance In this case series study of children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease had diverse manifestations. Infants and immunocompromised patients were not at increased risk of severe disease. Obesity was significantly associated with disease severity.

We present the case of a dural CCF in which access to the venous side of the fistula was achieved via the neuromeningeal trunk and allowed for curative transarterial intravenous coil/liquid embolic embolization of the lesion. The utility of a transarterial intravenous approach in the face of venous sinus occlusion is highlighted. The neuromeningeal trunk should not be overlooked as a potential access route for transarterial intravenous CCF embolization in cases where traditional endovascular access is limited; this approach does not carry the same risks that are generally associated with pure transarterial embolization along this pathway.","Ashour, Ramsey; Chavali, Ram","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019915581968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25943849/,56

Other studies suggest that postoperative hypoxia might initiate infiltrative tumor growth. Therefore, aim of this study was to analyze the impact of infarct volume on overall survival and progression free survival (PFS) of glioblastoma patients.251 patients with surgery for a newly diagnosed glioblastoma (WHO IV) were retrospectively assessed. Pre- and postoperative KPS, date of death/last follow-up and histopathological markers were recorded. Pre- and postoperative tumor volume and the volume of postoperative infarction were manually segmented.A significant correlation of infarct volume with postoperative KPS decrease (P = 0.001) was observed. Infarct volume showed a significant impact on overall survival (P = 0.014), but not on PFS (P = 0.112) in univariate analysis. This effect increased in the subgroup of patients with near-total tumor resection (> 90%) (overall survival: P = 0.006, PFS: P = 0.066). Infarct volume remained as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in multivariate analysis (HR 1.013 [1.000-1.026], P = 0.042) including other prognostic factors (age, extent of resection, postoperative KPS).Postoperative infarct volume significantly correlates as an independent factor with overall survival after glioblastoma surgery. Besides the influence of perioperative infarction on postoperative KPS, postoperative hypoxia might also have an effect on tumor biology initiating infiltrative growth and therefore impaired survival.","Bette, Stefanie; Wiestler, Benedikt; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Huber, Thomas; Gerhardt, Julia; Barz, Melanie; Delbridge, Claire; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Ringel, Florian; Zimmer, Claus; Meyer, Bernhard; Boeckh-Behrens, Tobias; Kirschke, Jan S; Gempt, Jens",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.11482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27566556/,56

However, when we analyse the microbial exposures of modern humans in the context of human evolution and history, it becomes evident that, whilst children need exposure to the microbiotas of mothers, other family members and the natural environment, exposure to the unnatural microbiota of the modern home is less relevant. In addition, any benefits of exposure to the infections of childhood within their household setting are at least partly replaced by the recently revealed non-specific effects of vaccines. This paper shows how targeting hygiene practices at key risk moments and sites can maximize protection against infection whilst minimizing any impact on essential microbial exposures. Moreover this targeting must aim to reduce direct exposure of children to cleaning agents since these probably exert Th2 adjuvant effects which trigger allergic responses to normally innocuous antigens. Finally, we need to halt the flow of publications in the scientific literature and the media that blame hygiene for the increases in immunoregulatory disorders. Appropriately targeted hygiene behaviour is compatible with a healthy lifestyle that promotes exposure to essential microorganisms.","Rook, Graham A W; Bloomfield, Sally F",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033844/,56

159489,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.,2018,"Bone tissue engineering is based on bone grafting to repair bone defects. Bone graft substitutes can contribute to the addition of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in order to enhance the rate and the quality of defect regeneration. The stem cell secretome contains many growth factors and chemokines, which could affect cellular characteristics and behavior. Conditioned medium (CM) could be used in tissue regeneration avoiding several problems linked to the direct use of MSCs. In this study, we investigated the effect of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) and their CM on bone regeneration using a commercially available membrane scaffold Evolution (EVO) implanted in rat calvarias. EVO alone or EVO + hPDLSCs with or without CM were implanted in Wistar male rats subjected to calvarial defects. The in vivo results revealed that EVO membrane enriched with hPDLSCs and CM showed a better osteogenic ability to repair the calvarial defect. These results were confirmed by acquired micro-computed tomography (CT) images and the increased osteopontin levels. Moreover, RT-PCR in vitro revealed the upregulation of three genes (Collagen (COL)5A1, COL16A1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)β1) and the down regulation of 26 genes involved in bone regeneration. These results suggest a promising potential application of CM from hPDLSCs and scaffolds for bone defect restoration and in particular for calvarial repair in case of trauma.","Diomede, Francesca; D'Aurora, Marco; Gugliandolo, Agnese; Merciaro, Ilaria; Orsini, Tiziana; Gatta, Valentina; Piattelli, Adriano; Trubiani, Oriana; Mazzon, Emanuela",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19041022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29596323/,56

Given the concern for COVID-19 acquisition in health care settings, pregnant persons with high-risk pregnancies-such as persons living with HIV (PLHIV)-are increasingly investigating the option of a home birth. Although we strongly recommend hospital birth for PLHIV, we discuss our experience and recommendations for counseling and preparation of pregnant PLHIV who may be considering home birth or at risk for unintentional home birth due to the pandemic. We also discuss issues associated with implementing a risk mitigation strategy involving high-risk births occurring at home during a pandemic.

To investigate the immune responses after infection of SARS-CoV-2 in non-critical patients may help to better understand the disease progression. We collected 334 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 212 still in hospital with nucleic acid test positive on halfway for SARS-CoV-2 and 122 discharged from hospital, compared specific antibodies, immune cells, and cytokine changes between the hospitalized and discharged patients. The hospitalized patients had a longer illness time compared with discharged patients. Analysis of viral loads explained long-term or persistent infection of SARS-CoV-2, which existed with the median time of 18.5 days of the positive nucleic acid test. Serum analysis showed that the specific anti-N IgG antibody was positive in all detected patients after infection of two weeks. Neutrophils, Monocytes, NK cells, and CD4+ T cells significantly increased, while total lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells decreased from non-critical hospitalized patients after longer-term infection. Further analysis of the cytokines showed that IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 from the hospitalized patients were significantly higher, indicating a potential of the increased CD4+ T cell differentiation.","Lin, Lan; Luo, Shanshan; Qin, Renjie; Yang, Mengling; Wang, Xiaobei; Yang, Qianqian; Zhang, Yang; Wang, Quansheng; Zhu, Rui; Fan, Heng; Wang, Haijun; Hu, Yu; Wang, Lin; Hu, Desheng",Clin Immunol,,56
209363,COVID-19 and Hematology-What Do We Know So Far?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Passive data from smartphone sensors may be useful for health-care research. Our aim was to use the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a positive control to assess the ability to quantify behavioral changes in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from smartphone data. METHODS: Eight participants used the Beiwe smartphone application, which passively measured their location during the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an interrupted time series to quantify the effect of the US state of emergency declaration on daily home time and daily distance traveled. RESULTS: After the state of emergency declaration, median daily home time increased from 19.4 (interquartile range [IQR], 15.4-22.0) hours to 23.7 (IQR, 22.2-24.0) hours and median distance traveled decreased from 42 (IQR, 13-83) km to 3.7 (IQR, 1.5-10.3) km. The participant with the lowest functional ability changed behavior earlier. This participant stayed at home more and traveled less than the participant with highest functional ability, both before and after the state of emergency. DISCUSSION: We provide evidence that smartphone-based digital phenotyping can quantify the behavior of people with ALS. Although participants spent large amounts of time at home at baseline, the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration reduced their mobility further. Given participants' high level of daily home time, it is possible that their exposure to COVID-19 could be less than that of the general population.","Beukenhorst, Anna L; Collins, Ella; Burke, Katherine M; Rahman, Syed Minhajur; Clapp, Margaret; Konanki, Sai Charan; Paganoni, Sabrina; Miller, Timothy M; Chan, James; Onnela, Jukka-Pekka; Berry, James D",Muscle nerve,,56
211498,The Complexity of Co-Infections in the Era of COVID-19,2021,"ABSTRACT Objective Since the rising of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is uncertainty regarding the impact of transmission to cancer patients. Evidence on increased severity for patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment is posed against deferring oncologic treatment. We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patient volumes in a cancer center in an epicenter of the pandemic. Methods Outpatient and inpatient volumes were extracted from electronic health record database. Two intervals were compared: pre-COVID-19 (March to May 2019) and COVID-19 pandemic (March to May 2020) periods. Results The total number of medical appointments declined by 45% in the COVID-19 period, including a 56.2% decrease in new visits. There was a 27.5% reduction in the number of patients undergoing intravenous systemic treatment and a 57.4% decline in initiation of new treatments. Conversely, there was an increase by 309% in new patients undergoing oral chemotherapy regimens and a 5.9% rise in new patients submitted to radiation therapy in the COVID-19 period. There was a 51.2% decline in length of stay and a 60% reduction in the volume of surgical cases during COVID-19. In the stem cell transplant unit, we observed a reduction by 36.5% in length of stay and a 62.5% drop in stem cell transplants. Conclusion A significant decrease in the number of patients undergoing cancer treatment was observed after COVID-19 pandemic. Although this may be partially overcome by alternative therapeutic options, avoiding timely health care due to fear of getting COVID-19 infection might impact on clinical outcomes. Our findings may help support immediate actions to mitigate this hypothesis.","Araujo, Sérgio Eduardo Alonso; Leal, Alessandro; Centrone, Ana Fernanda Yamazaki; Teich, Vanessa Damazio; Malheiro, Daniel Tavares; Cypriano, Adriana Serra; Cendoroglo Neto, Miguel; Klajner, Sidney",Einstein (Säo Paulo),,56

225052,Elevated secondary infection rates in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,2021,"BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension is an important risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases and a major cause of premature death in industrialized societies. A predisposing factor for essential hypertension is prehypertension: blood pressure (BP) values at rest that are at the higher end of the normal range. Abnormally enhanced cardiovascular responses to motor and emotional tasks have been found as predictors of essential hypertension. Yet, knowledge regarding the BP reaction to aversive stimuli and motor reaction in prehypertension is limited. METHODS: We compared the reaction to aversive and neutral stimuli inducing an emotional response (experiment 1) and to the isometric handgrip exercise (IHE) inducing a motor response (experiment 2), between prehypertensive and normotensive controls. BP reactions were measured and analyzed in a continuous fashion, in contrast to previous studies that averaged BP responses across blocks. We applied a multilevel B-spline model, a continuous analysis that enabled a better understanding of the BP time course and the detection of subtle differences between groups. RESULTS: In both tasks, we found that prehypertensive individuals showed enhanced DBP reactions compared with normotensive controls; prehypertensive individuals exhibited lower BP responses to aversive pictures and higher BP responses to the IHE. These results are in line with previous studies with healthy or hypertensive participants and suggest abnormalities already in the prehypertensive stage. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency and health risks related to prehypertension, understanding the autonomic reactions to emotional and motor stimuli in this population is of clinical and theoretical importance and could serve as a behavioural marker to identify at-risk groups.","Wiener, Avigail; Goldstein, Pavel; Doenyas, Keren; Okon-Singer, Hadas",J. hypertens,,56
232246,Relationship Between the Number of Patients Visiting Emergency Department and Tokyo Health System's Capacity During Early Stages of the First Wave of COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: To investigate the early CT findings in COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to influenza A virus H1N1 (AH1N1), with focus on vascular enlargement within consolidation or ground glass opacity (GGO) areas. Methods: 50 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively compared to 50 patients with AH1N1 pneumonia diagnosed during the 2009 pandemic. Two radiologists reviewed chest CT scans independently and blindly, with discordance resolved by consensus. Dilated or tortuous vessels within hyperdense lesions were recorded. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia presented with bilateral (96%), peripheral areas of GGO (22%), consolidation (4%) or combined GGO-consolidation (74%). The vascular enlargement sign in COVID-19 pneumonia was much more commonly present in COVID-19 (45/50, 90%) versus AH1N1 pneumonia (12/50, 24%) (p<0.001). Vascular enlargement was more often present in lower lobes with a peripheral distribution. Conclusions: Vascular enlargement in consolidative / GGO areas may represent a reasonably common early CT marker in COVID-19 patients and is of uncertain etiology. Although speculative, theoretical mechanisms could potentially reflect acute inflammatory changes, pulmonary endothelial activation, or acute stasis. Further studies are necessary to verify specificity and to study if prognostic for clinical outcomes.","Bianco, Andrea; Valente, Tullio; Perrotta, Fabio; Stellato, Elvira; Brunese, Luca; Wood, Brad J; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Parrella, Roberto",Heliyon,,56

265542,"""Post Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Reactivation of a Quiescent Unilateral Anterior Uveitis""",2021,"We present the spectroscopic and photometric study of five intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs), namely AT 2010dn, AT 2012jc, AT 2013la, AT 2013lb, and AT 2018aes. They share common observational properties and belong to a family of objects similar to the prototypical ILRT SN~2008S. These events have a rise time that is less than 15 days and absolute peak magnitudes of between $-11.5$ and $-14.5$ mag. Their pseudo-bolometric light curves peak in the range $0.5$ - $9.0 \times10^{40}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$ and their total radiated energies are on the order of (0.3 - 3) $\times$~10$^{47}$~erg. After maximum brightness, the light curves show a monotonic decline or a plateau, resembling those of faint supernovae IIL or IIP, respectively. At late phases, the light curves flatten, roughly following the slope of the $^{56}$Co decay. If the late-time power source is indeed radioactive decay, these transients produce $^{56}$Ni masses on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$~\msun. The spectral energy distribution of our ILRT sample, extending from the optical to the mid-infrared (MIR) domain, reveals a clear IR excess soon after explosion and non-negligible MIR emission at very late phases. The spectra show prominent H lines in emission with a typical velocity of a few hundred km~s$^{-1}$, along with Ca~II features. In particular, the [Ca~II] $\lambda$7291,7324 doublet is visible at all times, which is a characteristic feature for this family of transients. The identified progenitor of SN~2008S, which is luminous in archival Spitzer MIR images, suggests an intermediate-mass precursor star embedded in a dusty cocoon. We propose the explosion of a super-asymptotic giant branch star forming an electron-capture supernova as a plausible explanation for these events.","Cai, Y.-Z.; Pastorello, A.; Fraser, M.; Botticella, M.

They argue radically enhanced beings will be entitled to greater and more beneficial treatment through an enhanced moral status, or a stronger claim to basic rights. I challenge these claims by first arguing that emerging technologies will likely give the enhanced direct control over their mental states. The lack of control we currently exhibit over our mental lives greatly contributes to our sense of vulnerability. I then argue moral status should be viewed in terms of vulnerability. The enhanced will slowly gain the ability to command their mental states, reducing their vulnerability. These radically enhanced beings will have greater capacities, and possibly an inner life more valuable than our own. They will also be less vulnerable, and as a result, their moral status will be subordinate to our own.","Gray, Jesse",,,56

305631,"Intravenous sulforhodamine B reduces alveolar surface tension, improves oxygenation and reduces ventilation injury in a respiratory distress model",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The Covid-19 pandemic affects maternal health both directly and indirectly, and direct and indirect effects are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence. RESULTS: The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles. Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies. The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.","Kotlar, Bethany; Gerson, Emily; Petrillo, Sophia; Langer, Ana; Tiemeier, Henning",Reprod Health,,56
308619,[Therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome is different from traditional acute respiratory distress syndrome],2020,"BACKGROUND: Health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced to adhere to current COVID-19 prevention recommendations. Recommendations for surgical emergency trauma care measures need to be adequately informed by available evidence and adapt to particular settings. To inform future recommendations, we set to summarize the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) on the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for trauma surgery patients. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review using Living Overview of Evidence platform for COVID-19, which performs regular automated searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and more than 30 other sources. Systematic reviews of experimental and observational studies assessing the efficacy of PPE were included. Indirect evidence from other health care settings was also considered. Risk of bias was assessed with the AMSTAR II tool (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews, Ottawa, ON, Canada), and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42020198267). RESULTS: Eighteen studies that fulfilled the selection criteria were included. There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks is associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 when compared with no mask use. In moderate- to high-risk environments, N95 respirators are associated with a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion in this setting. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit. CONCLUSION: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in health care workers. N95 and equivalent respirators provide more protection than surgical masks.

308620,[Therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome is different from traditional acute respiratory distress syndrome],2020,"BACKGROUND: Health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced to adhere to current COVID-19 prevention recommendations. Recommendations for surgical emergency trauma care measures need to be adequately informed by available evidence and adapt to particular settings. To inform future recommendations, we set to summarize the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) on the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for trauma surgery patients. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review using Living Overview of Evidence platform for COVID-19, which performs regular automated searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and more than 30 other sources. Systematic reviews of experimental and observational studies assessing the efficacy of PPE were included. Indirect evidence from other health care settings was also considered. Risk of bias was assessed with the AMSTAR II tool (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews, Ottawa, ON, Canada), and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42020198267). RESULTS: Eighteen studies that fulfilled the selection criteria were included. There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks is associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 when compared with no mask use. In moderate- to high-risk environments, N95 respirators are associated with a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion in this setting.

318322,[Impact of complicated myocardial injury on the clinical outcome of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients],2020,"COVID-19 is devastating health systems globally and causing severe ventilator shortages. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the provision and use of ventilators has been a key focus of public discourse. Scientists and engineers from leading universities and companies have rushed to develop low-cost ventilators in hopes of supporting critically ill patients in developing countries. Philanthropists have invested millions in shipping ventilators to low-resource settings, and agencies such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank are prioritizing the purchase of ventilators. While we recognize the humanitarian nature of these efforts, merely shipping ventilators to low-resource environments may not improve outcomes of patients and could potentially cause harm. An ecosystem of considerable technological and human resources is required to support the usage of ventilators within intensive care settings. Medical-grade oxygen supplies, reliable electricity, bioengineering support, and consumables are all needed for ventilators to save lives. However, most ICUs in resource-poor settings do not have access to these resources. Patients on ventilators require continuous monitoring from physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists skilled in critical care. Health care workers in many low-resource settings are already exceedingly overburdened, and pulling these essential human resources away from other critical patient needs could reduce the overall quality of patient care. When deploying medical devices, it is vital to align the technological intervention with the clinical reality. Low-income settings often will not benefit from resource-intensive equipment, but rather from contextually appropriate devices that meet the unique needs of their health systems.","Mantena, Sreekar; Rogo, Khama; Burke, Thomas F",Respir Care,,56
319067,How to understand the histopathology of SARS and COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome,2020,"The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly based on a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. PCR samples are obtained from upper or lower respiratory tract specimens. However, the sensitivity of PCR is known to have some limitations. We report on a patient who was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea, fever, cough, and history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected relative. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) showed only minimal changes and SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample was negative. PCR results obtained from further nasopharyngeal swabs, qualified sputum samples, and from a lower respiratory tract specimen also remained negative. At day 13 after admission, a second chest CT showed radiological findings suspicious for viral pneumonia. Finally, serologic results showed high levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Schiller, Martin; Wydra, Stephan; Kerl, Hans Ulrich; Kick, Wolfgang",J. med. virol,,56
322793,Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic and Health Workers of an Ethnic Group-A Slant on a Shocking Report,2020,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Wuhan, China, in January 2020 just before the Spring Festival and subsequent country-wide measures to contain the virus, effectively resulted in the lock-down of the country. Most industries and businesses were closed, traffic was largely reduced, and people were restrained to their homes. This resulted in the reduction of emissions of trace gases and aerosols, the concentrations of which were strongly reduced in many cities around the country. Satellite imagery from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) showed an enormous reduction of tropospheric NO2 concentrations, but aerosol optical depth (AOD), as a measure of the amount of aerosols, was less affected, likely due to the different formation mechanisms and the influence of meteorological factors. In this study, satellite data and ground-based observations were used together to estimate the separate effects of the Spring Festival and the COVID-19 containment measures on atmospheric composition in the winter of 2020. To achieve this, data were analyzed for a period from 30 days before to 60 days after the Spring Festivals in 2017–2020. This extended period of time, including similar periods in previous years, were selected to account for both the decreasing concentrations in response to air pollution control measures, and meteorological effects on concentrations of trace gases and aerosols. Satellite data from TROPOMI provided the spatial distributions over mainland China of the tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) of NO2, and VCD of SO2 and CO. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provided the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The comparison of the satellite data for different periods showed a large reduction of, e.g., NO2 tropospheric VCDs due to the Spring Festival of up to 80% in some regions, and an additional reduction due to the COVID-19 containment measures of up to 70% in highly populated areas with intensive anthropogenic activities. In other areas, both effects are very small. Ground-based in situ observations from 26 provincial capitals provided concentrations of NO2, SO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10. The analysis of these data was focused on the situation in Wuhan, based on daily averaged concentrations. The NO2 concentrations started to decrease a few days before the Spring Festival and increased after about two weeks, except in 2020 when they continued to be low. SO2 concentrations behaved in a similar way, whereas CO, PM2.5, and PM10 also decreased during the Spring Festival but did not trace NO2 concentrations as SO2 did. As could be expected from atmospheric chemistry considerations, O3 concentrations increased. The analysis of the effects of the Spring Festival and the COVID-19 containment measures was complicated due to meteorological influences. Uncertainties contributing to the estimates of the different effects on the trace gas concentrations are discussed. The situation in Wuhan is compared with that in 26 provincial capitals based on 30-day averages for four years, showing different effects across China.","Cheng, Fan Li Ying Jie Guang Li Zhengqiang Abdelrazek Elnashar Allam Mona de Leeuw Gerrit",Remote Sensing,,56

Desde entonces su distribución se ha ampliado mundialmente causando una emergencia en los sistemas de salud. MÉTODO: Corresponde al reporte de caso clínico. Este estudio es descriptivo y se basa en el manejo realizado a paciente embarazada con COVID-19 confirmado. Esta publicación cuenta con la autorización del comité de ética local para la revisión de ficha clínica. CASO: Mujer de 40 años con un embarazo de 31 semanas, se le diagnostica COVID-19 tras contacto estrecho con caso confirmado. Evoluciona con disnea y por posibilidad de interrupción del embarazo se traslada a centro de mayor complejidad. Allí se pesquisa compromiso de función pulmonar, uso de musculatura accesoria y alteración sensorial, requiriendo oxigenoterapia. Se evalúa interdisciplinariamente decidiendo intubar y realizando manejo en unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI). Se realiza cesárea de urgencia a las 31+4 semanas debiendo realizarse histerectomía total por inercia uterina. Tras el procedimiento evoluciona tórpidamente con deterioro de función pulmonar, describiéndose un pronóstico catastrófico con probabilidad de fallecer por insuficiencia respiratoria. Un mes después despierta con una mejoría en su función pulmonar, sin otra falla orgánica. Actualmente se encuentra en buenas condiciones y es tratada multidisciplinariamente para lograr una rehabilitación integral. DISCUSIÓN: En epidemias pasadas, las embarazadas mostraron altas tasas de letalidad y riesgo de ingreso a UCI. Basados en una revisión de reportes de casos, parece ser que COVID-19 durante el embarazo se asocia a morbilidad materna severa, riesgo que aumenta en mujeres con comorbilidades, lo cual hace cuestionarnos si la infección por COVID-19 intensifica el riesgo materno o estos casos ya eran embarazos de riesgo.

The objective of this systematic review was to assess currently published literature relating to the management, clinical course, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver, kidney, and heart solid organ transplant recipients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to assess currently published literature relating to the management, clinical course, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver, kidney, and heart solid organ transplant recipients. Articles published through June 2020 were searched in the MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PubMed databases. We identified 49 eligible studies comprising a total of 403 solid organ transplant recipients. RESULTS: Older age, male sex, and preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension and/or diabetes, were the most common prevailing characteristics among the solid organ transplant recipients. Clinical presentation ranged from mild to severe disease, including multiorgan failure and death. We found an overall mortality rate of 21%. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests no increase in overall mortality or worse outcome in solid organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy compared with mortality in the general surgical population with SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that transplant surgery and its immunosuppressive effects should not be a deterrent to proper surgical care for patients in the SARS-CoV-2 era.","Aziz, Hassan; Lashkari, Nassim; Yoon, Young Chul; Kim, Jim; Sher, Linda S; Genyk, Yuri; Kwon, Yong K",Transplant. proc,,56

We forecast the possible COVID-19 outbreak in one US state (Utah) by applying empirical data from South Korea and Italy, two countries that implemented disparate public health actions. Forecasts were created by aligning the start of the pandemic in Utah with that in South Korea and Italy, getting a short-run forecast based on actual daily rates of spread, and long-run forecast by employing a log-logistic model with four parameters. Applying the South Korea model, the epidemic peak in Utah is 169 cases/day, with epidemic resolution by the end of May. Applying the Italy model, new cases are forecast to exceed 200/day by mid-April, with the potential for 250 new cases a day at the epidemic peak, with the epidemic continuing through the end of August. We identify a 3-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections at outbreak peak, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context.","Qeadan, F.; Honda, T.; Gren, L.

We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of peer-reviewed publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to 15th August 2020. Preprints and reports were also included if they met the inclusion criteria. Study eligibility criteria were full-text prospective, retrospective or registry-based publications describing outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19, using a validated test. Participants were critically ill patients admitted in the ICU with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: From 32 articles included, a total of 69 093 patients were admitted to the ICU and were evaluated. Most patients included in the studies were male (76 165/128 168, 59%, 26 studies) and the mean patient age was 56 (95%CI 48.5-59.8) years. Studies described high ICU mortality (21 145/65 383, 32.3%, 15 studies). The median length of ICU stay was 9.0 (95%CI 6.5-11.2) days, described in five studies. More than half the patients admitted to the ICU required mechanical ventilation (31 213/53 465, 58%, 23 studies) and among them mortality was very high (27 972/47 632, 59%, six studies). The duration of mechanical ventilation was 8.4 (95%CI 1.6-13.7) days. The main interventions described were the use of non-invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy and vasopressors. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review, including approximately 69 000 ICU patients, demonstrates that COVID-19 infection in critically ill patients is associated with great need for life-sustaining interventions, high mortality, and prolonged length of ICU stay.","Serafim, Rodrigo B; Póvoa, Pedro; Souza-Dantas, Vicente; Kalil, André C; Salluh, Jorge I F",Clin Microbiol Infect,,56

The standard""compartment""models of the spread of disease through a population follow the law of mass action; that is, the rate of conversion of individuals from one compartment to another is directly proportional to the number of individuals in the former. The basic S-I-R model, which tracks susceptible, infectious, and recovered people, is functionally identical to autocatalytic reactions studied in chemical kinetics. However, if we account for heterogeneity in individuals' susceptibility to catch the disease, then the most susceptible individuals are likely to be removed from the pool early; this is analogous to evaporative cooling in chemical kinetics. Here, we use standard tools from statistical physics to account for this effect, which suggest that the rate of appearance of new cases should be proportional to the \emph{square} of the number of susceptible people in the population, not the first power. We validate this finding with both Monte Carlo (stochastic) and many-compartment differential equation (deterministic) simulations. This leads to quite different predictions of the peak infection rate and final outbreak size, with the second-order model giving milder predictions of each. This has dramatic effects on the extrapolation of a disease's progression when the data collected comes from the early, exponential-like region, and may remove a systematic bias from such models.","Peterson, Andrew A.; Goldsmith, C.

Less is known about youths. METHODS: We surveyed a sample of Italian adolescents during the strictest quarantine period and assessed the effects of socio-demographic and psychological factors on current emotional symptoms. A convenient sample of 326 adolescents (age range 14-19 years) participated in a web-based survey. We collected data on several socio-demographic and psychological variables (summarized into three indexes: environmental context, changes in lifestyle, and worries about infection) and psychopathological symptoms (previous psychopathological status, current anxiety and depressive symptoms). RESULTS: Descriptive analysis showed that adolescents have experienced quarantine under very different conditions; they reported 47.5 and 14.1% of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Regression analyses indicated that previous psychopathological status and worries about infection are linked to anxiety and that female gender, previous psychopathological status (moderated by change in lifestyle), worse environmental context are linked to depression. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that, facing the COVID-19 pandemic and its related safety measures, adolescents show relevant emotional symptoms and therefore should be monitored, assessed and supported.","Pisano, Simone; Catone, Gennaro; Gritti, Antonella; Almerico, Luisa; Pezzella, Anna; Santangelo, Pia; Bravaccio, Carmela; Iuliano, Raffaella; Senese, Vincenzo Paolo",Ital J Pediatr,,56

Hereby, authors report a case of critically ill COVID-19 patient who developed cytokine storm. She had a remarkable increase in inflammatory markers and went into multiorgan failure and death in less than 48 hours. Among inflammatory markers, ferritin has a high sensitivity for CRS. This case report sheds light on the importance of following the level of inflammatory markers (especially ferritin) closely in COVID-19 patients. The goal is to diagnose CRS before the patient goes into a full cytokine storm and multiorgan failure, as it may be too late to react then. Even when the patient is clinically stable, a high ferritin level could be the calm before the storm.","Saki, Safa; Mawih, Mustafa Salam",J. Clin. Diagn. Res.,,56

An attractive target for antiviral inhibitors is the main protease 3CL Mpro due to its essential role in processing the polyproteins translated from viral RNA. Here we report the room temperature X-ray structure of unliganded SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro, revealing the ligand-free structure of the active site and the conformation of the catalytic site cavity at near-physiological temperature. Comparison with previously reported low-temperature ligand-free and inhibitor-bound structures suggest that the room temperature structure may provide more relevant information at physiological temperatures for aiding in molecular docking studies.","Kneller, Daniel W; Phillips, Gwyndalyn; O039,; Neill, Hugh M; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Stols, Lucy; Langan, Paul; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Coates, Leighton; Kovalevsky, Andrey",Nat Commun,,56

379580,Let Us Not Forget Cardiovascular Diseases During COVID-19 Pandemic: the Role of Cardiac Prevention and Rehabilitation,2020,"The presence of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in croplands has become an international concern. The environmental behavior and fate of SMX in agricultural soils are not well understood, especially when the adsorption behavior is disturbed by the dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by crop straw. As canola straw is one of the biomasses widely returned to farmlands, we characterized DOM derived from pristine and decomposed canola straw, and explored the effects and mechanisms of the DOMs on regulating SMX adsorption to purple paddy soils. The spectral analysis showed that the molecular weight, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity of canola straw-derived DOM increased as decomposition proceeded. These physicochemical properties collectively determined the effects of the DOM on SMX adsorption. The DOM derived from pristine canola straw increased SMX maximum adsorption capacity of the soils by approximately 2.6 times, but this positive effect gradually decreased to a steady state by day 90 in the straw decomposition period. Nevertheless, the SMX adsorption behavior in the soils was invariably determined by the DOM extracts. These adsorption processes of SMX were well fitted by the double-chamber kinetics model and the Langmuir and Freundlich thermodynamic models. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that SMX adsorption onto the soils was spontaneous and endothermic, and this adsorption characteristics was not significantly (p > 0.05) changed by the DOM extracts. However, the adsorption kinetics were altered by those DOMs, i.e., the fast and slow adsorption processes were both diminished. Correspondingly, co-adsorption and cumulative adsorption were identified as the main mechanisms determining SMX adsorption to the purple paddy soils in the presence of the straw-derived DOMs. These results collectively indicated that the DOMs released by straw in croplands may decrease the ecological risks of organic pollutants by inhibiting their migration processes.","Wang, Bin; Li, Ming; Zhang, Haiyang; Zhu, Jingping; Chen, Shu; Ren, Dong",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,56

The purpose of the study was to extensively describe the clinical features and outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. METHOD: This was a multicenter, non-interventional cohort study for all critically ill patients aged 18 years or older, admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between March 1 to August 31, 2020, with an objectively confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal and/or throat swabs. Multivariate logistic regression and generalized linear regression were used. We considered a P value of <0.05 statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 560 patients met the inclusion criteria. An extensive list of clinical features was associated with higher 30-day ICU mortality rates, such as requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) or developing acute kidney injury within 24 hours of ICU admission, higher body temperature, white blood cells, blood glucose level, serum creatinine, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, creatine phosphokinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total iron-binding capacity. During ICU stay, the most common complication was respiratory failure that required MV (71.4%), followed by acute kidney injury (AKI) and thrombosis with a proportion of 46.8% and 11.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU, several variables were associated with an increased risk of ICU mortality at 30 days. Respiratory failure that required MV, AKI, and thrombosis were the most common complications during ICU stay.","Al Sulaiman, Khalid A; Aljuhani, Ohoud; Eljaaly, Khalid; Alharbi, Aisha A; Al Shabasy, Adel M; Alsaeedi, Alawi S; Al Mutairi, Mashael; Badreldin, Hisham A; Al Harbi, Shmeylan A; Al Haji, Hussain A; Al Zumai, Omar I; Vishwakarma, Ramesh K; Alkatheri, Abdulmalik",Int J Infect Dis,,56

This study investigates the effects of such delays in the delivery of cross-linking services in patients with keratoconus progression. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 46 patients with keratoconus progression, whose cross-linking was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic and clinical details were obtained from assessments on the day of listing, and subsequent review on the day of the procedure. Topographic indices included keratometry of the posterior and anterior corneal surface, maximum keratometry (Kmax), thinnest corneal thickness, ABCD progression and progression based on standard criteria recommendations (1.5 D Kmax & 20 microns thinning). RESULTS: A total of 46 eyes were analysed with an average time between being listed for CXL and having the procedure done was 182 ± 65 days. The delay due to COVID-19 was of 3 months. In this time period they had a significant worsening of all keratometric indices and lost almost one line of visual acuity (0.19 ± 0.19 to 0.26 ± 0.18 LogMAR, p: 0.03). Thirty two eyes (70%) demonstrated progression in accordance with the ABCD progression criteria, while 18 eyes (39%) showed either an increase in Kmax of more than 1.5D or a thinning in corneal thickness of at least 20 µm. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment delay for the keratoconus patients caused further progression and vision worsening. We recommend that corneal collagen crosslinking needs to be considered as a high priority intervention.","Shah, Haider; Pagano, Luca; Vakharia, Anuj; Coco, Giulia; Gadhvi, Kunal A; Kaye, Stephen B; Romano, Vito",Eur J Ophthalmol,,56

This is especially true for those who attended and were followed up at primary care settings. OBJECTIVES: We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of possible cases and among probable cases followed in primary care. METHODS: We selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups from a total population of 19 899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona. We also invited all the patients that had been followed by General Practitioners (GPs). For both populations, we used COVID-19 rapid lateral flow immunoassays, which qualitatively assess the presence of patient-generated Immunoglobulins G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM). RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample participated in the study. The mean age was 43.7 years [standard deviation (SD) = 21.79] and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.47% (95% confidence interval = 3.44-8.58). Six hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed up by GPs. The mean age was 46.97 years (SD = 20.05) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19.

Objective To detect SARS-CoV-2 in expressed breast milk (EBM) of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 and clinical outcome of neonates delivered and breast fed by them. Design A single-centre, prospective observational study involving 50 SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers and their 51 neonates. Setting A tertiary care hospital in Eastern India. Participants SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers and neonates delivered by them. Main outcome measures We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the breast milk of mothers, who tested positive for this virus in their nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). Clinical outcome was assessed in neonates breast fed by these mothers after 1 month of the postnatal period. Results 50 SARS-CoV-2-positive expectant mothers were enrolled for the study. One out of 51 neonates, who delivered through lower segment caesarean section at term gestation and tested SARS-CoV-2 negative, died due to severe birth asphyxia. One sample of EBM was collected from each of the 49 mothers within 4 days of delivery. All EBM samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 through real-Time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). All the newborns were screened twice for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their NPS, by RT-PCR. 2 of 51 neonates had COVID-19 infection after 24 hours of life. Caregivers of 37 of 50 alive neonates responded to follow-up via telephone. Except for minor feed intolerance in one (1 of 37) neonate, all neonates were reported well after 1 month of their age. Conclusion All the samples of breast milk were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Most of the neonates remained asymptomatic on breast feeding, whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infection before delivery.","Prasad, A.; Yankappa, N.; Kumar, P.; Chaudhary, B. K.; Pati, B.

During the initial phases of this closure, most institutions were at a loss on how to proceed with learning as universities in Nigeria use mainly the didactic lecturing model. As the lockdown progressed it became imperative to the institutions to set up e-learning media for continued instruction of students. It was found that in the institutions with e-learning facilities, the preclinical years remained mostly unaffected by the closure of medical schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while all institutions came to a standstill as regards providing a suitable alternative for clinical exposure. This therein has caused loss of valuable time and a change in the calendar of the school year, making it uncertain as to when the next set of qualified medical professionals will emerge in Nigeria. In this essay, we take a look at medical education in Nigeria, its challenges and progression in the COVID-19 era.

This has even affected regions that had dismantled bordering practices decades ago, e.g., EU areas that lifted internal borders in 1993. In some national cases, these new arrangements had unexpected consequences in the field of immigration enforcement. A number of European jurisdictions released significant percentages of their immigration detention populations in spring 2020. The Spanish administration even decreed a moratorium on immigration detention and closed down all detention facilities from mid-spring to late summer 2020. The paper scrutinises these unprecedented changes by examining the variety of migration enforcement agendas adopted by European countries and the specific forces contributing to the prominent detention decline witnessed in the first months of the pandemic. Drawing on the Spanish case, the paper reflects on the potential impact of this promising precedent on the gradual consolidation of social and racial justice-based migration policies.","Brandariz, José A.; Fernández-Bessa, Cristina",Social Sciences,,56

To facilitate research of these complex error types, we introduce a new structured, crowdsourced error annotation schema called Scarecrow. The error categories used in Scarecrow -- such as redundancy, commonsense errors, and incoherence -- were identified by combining expert analysis with several pilot rounds of ontology-free crowd annotation to arrive at a schema which covers the error phenomena found in real machine generated text. We use Scarecrow to collect 13k annotations of 1.3k human and machine generate paragraphs of English language news text, amounting to over 41k spans each labeled with its error category, severity, a natural language explanation, and antecedent span (where relevant). We collect annotations for text generated by state-of-the-art systems with varying known performance levels, from GPT-2 Small through the largest GPT-3. We isolate several factors for detailed analysis, including parameter count, training data, and decoding technique. Our results show both expected and surprising differences across these settings.

Understanding whether patient demand will last after the pandemic helps providers and payers make informed decisions about whether to continue adopting telemedicine. Objective: We examine user experience as well as process and patient outcomes of using telemedicine for acute conditions during COVID-19 and assess how patient outcomes are affected by waiting times and demographics. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk during June 17-29, 2020. Inclusion criteria were: (1) &#8805;18 years old, (2) residing in the United States, (3) used telemedicine for acute conditions after January, and 4) a human intelligence task approval rate of >95%. Process outcomes included patient waiting time with patient outcomes being satisfaction and future use intention. Bivariate analysis and regressions of the data were performed. Results: On average, respondents reported appointment wait time of 2.76 days and virtual office wait time of 19.44 min. Overall, respondents reported moderate satisfaction (mean 5.08-5.35 of 7) and future use intention (mean 5.10-5.32 of 7). Over 72% of the respondents were satisfied and had future use intention. Females, heavier internet users, and those on the higher/lower ends of the education spectrum reported better patient outcomes. Patients ""visiting"" a doctor experiencing eye problems, vis-à-vis other ailments, reported lower satisfaction and intention. Waiting time negatively associates with satisfaction. Conclusions: Given the satisfactory outcomes, the high demand for telemedicine may continue after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, whether providers will continue to offer telemedicine visits may require more evidence.","Kato-Lin, Yi-Chin; Thelen, Shawn T",Telemed. j. e. health,,56

Respiratory disease can be affected by this virus such as flu with several symptoms, for example, fever, headache, cough, and pneumonia. COVID-19 presence in humans can be tested through blood samples or sputum while the result can be obtained in days. Further, biomedical image analysis assists in showing signs of pneumonia in a patient. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a fully automatic COVID-19 identification system by proposing a new fusion scheme of texture features for CT scan images. This paper presents a fusion scheme based on a machine learning system using three significant texture features, namely, Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Fractal Dimension (FD), and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM). In experimental results, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme we have collected 300 CT scan images from a publicly available database. The experimental result shows the performance of LBP, FD, and GLCM obtained an accuracy of 89.87%, 87.84%, and 90.98%, respectively while the proposed scheme yields better results by achieving 96.91% accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.","Zebari, D.

477151,Guide to the Forensic Pathology Practice on Death Cases Related to Corona Virus Disease 2019 （COVID-19） （Trial Draft）,2020,"BACKGROUND: The effects of cardiometabolic drugs on the prognosis of diabetic patients with COVID-19, especially very old patients, are not well-known. This work aims to analyze the association between preadmission cardiometabolic therapy (antidiabetic, antiaggregant, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering drugs) and in-hospital mortality among patients &#8805;80 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, multicenter, observational study in patients &#8805;80 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1 and May 29, 2020. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to assess the association between preadmission cardiometabolic therapy and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 2,763 patients &#8805;80 years old hospitalized due to COVID-19, 790 (28.6%) had T2DM. Of these patients, 385 (48.7%) died during admission. On the multivariate analysis, the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (AOR 0.502, 95%CI 0.309-0.815, p=0.005) and angiotensin receptor blockers (AOR 0.454, 95%CI 0.274-0.759, p=0.003) were independent protectors against in-hospital mortality whereas the use of acetylsalicylic acid was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (AOR 1.761, 95%CI 1.092-2.842, p=0.020). Other antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins showed neutral association with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We found important differences between cardiometabolic drugs and in-hospital mortality in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19. Preadmission treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could reduce in-hospital mortality; other antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins seem to have a neutral effect; and acetylsalicylic acid could be associated with excess mortality.","Ramos-Rincón, Jose Manuel; Pérez-Belmonte, Luis M; Carrasco-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Jansen-Chaparro, Sergio; De-Sousa-Baena, Mercedes; Bueno-Fonseca, José; Pérez-Aguilar, Maria; Arévalo-Cañas, Coral; Bacete Cebrian, Marta; Méndez-Bailón, Manuel; Fiteni Mera, Isabel; González García, Andrés; Navarro Romero, Francisco; Tuñón de Almeida, Carlota; Muñiz Nicolás, Gemma; González Noya, Amara; Hernández Milian, Almudena; García García, Gema María; Alcalá Pedrajas, José Nicolás; Herrero García, Virginia; Corral-Gudino, Luis; Comas Casanova, Pere; Meijide Míguez, Héctor; Casas-Rojo, José Manuel; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo","J. gerontol.

METHODS: Eligible publications were identified from more than 500 databases on 1 November 2020. One reviewer extracted data with 20% of the records independently extracted/evaluated by a second reviewer. RESULTS: Of 52 735 screened records, 429 and 390 studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses, respectively. The most-reported drugs were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACEI/ARB exposure having borderline association with confirmed COVID-19 infection (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.31). Among COVID-19 patients, unadjusted estimates showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with hospitalization (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.34-2.32), disease severity (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.26-1.55) and all-cause mortality (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12-1.33) but not hospitalization length (mean difference -0.27, 95% CI -1.36-0.82 days). After adjustment, ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with confirmed COVID-19 infection (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.19), hospitalization (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70-1.24), disease severity (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81-1.38) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.00). Similarly, subgroup analyses involving only hypertensive patients revealed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with confirmed COVID-19 infection (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79-1.09), hospitalization (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58-1.22), hospitalization length (mean difference -0.14, 95% CI -1.65-1.36 days), disease severity (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76-1.11) while it decreased the odds of dying (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.88). A similar trend was observed for other cardiovascular drugs. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high level of heterogeneity and serious risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular drugs are not associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes in adjusted analyses. Patients should continue taking these drugs as prescribed.","Asiimwe, Innocent G; Pushpakom, Sudeep; Turner, Richard M; Kolamunnage-Dona, Ruwanthi; Jorgensen, Andrea L; Pirmohamed, Munir",,,56
507705,Description of Covid-19 Cases in Brazil and Italy,2020,"Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels. With its increasing prevalence leading to a global burden, the search for new sources of antidiabetic agents are needed. Plant extracts and their fractions are essential in the management of diabetes due to numerous scientific evidences of their antidiabetic activity through various mechanisms. In this study, fractions from Alternanthera sessilis (Philippine variety) was investigated for their ability to inhibit key carbohydrate-degrading enzymes related to type-2 diabetes, specifically, α-amylase and α-glucosidase. The crude methanol extract of A. sessilis leaf was fractionated with three solvents of different polarities: water, ethyl acetate and hexane. These fractions were screened for mammalian α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities in vitro, and for the presence or absence of phytochemicals. All fractions displayed inhibitory activities in porcine α-amylase and intestinal rat α-glucosidase, with the highest activity observed in the ethyl acetate fraction (IC50 amylase = 0.52 ± 0.072 mg/mL; IC50 glucosidase = 2.82 ± 0.21 mg/mL). This fraction also demonstrated no significant difference but lower inhibitory activity relative to acarbose (IC50 amylase = 0.0025 ± 0.00045 mg/mL, p=0.72, α=0.05; IC50 glucosidase = 0.36 ± 0.063 mg/mL, p=0.26, α=0.05). Phytochemical screening of this fraction showed the presence of carbohydrates, lipids, tannins, triterpenoids, flavonoids, and glycosides, as well as berberine and quercetin, which may have accounted for the observed enzyme inhibitory activity. In summary, A. sessilis fractions may be used as potential sources of α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitors, with the ethyl acetate fraction as the most potent.","Manalo, Richelle Ann M.; Arollado, Erna C.; Heralde, Francisco M.",Pharma.

507763,Independent outpatient unit mode and its role in the department of respiratory and critical care medicine during the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable virus that continues to disrupt livelihoods, particularly those of low-income segments of society, around the world. In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practice and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. METHODS: A cross-sectional in person survey (n = 6007) was conducted from 14-30 April, 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowded areas. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practice) were measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. RESULTS: About half (48%, 95% CI: 46-49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58-61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48-50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanisms. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority and high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve prevention practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.","Defar, Atkure; Molla, Gebeyaw; Abdella, Saro; Tessema, Masresha; Ahmed, Muhammed; Tadele, Ashenif; Getachew, Fikresilassie; Hailegiorgis, Bezawit; Tigabu, Eyasu; Ababor, Sabit; Bizuwork, Ketema; Deressa, Asefa; Tasaw, Geremew; Kebede, Adisu; Melese, Daniel; Gashu, Andargachew; Eshetu, Kirubel; Tayachew, Adamu; Wossen, Mesfin; Hassen, Abduilhafiz; Habebe, Shambel; Assefa, Zewdu; Abayneh, Aschalew; Abate, Ebba; Tollera, Getachew",PLoS One,,56

However, the rapidly evolving pandemic raises new concerns. One pertains efficacy of adenoviral vector-based vaccines, particularly the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S, relative to mRNA vaccines. We investigated the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA vaccines in 33 subjects vaccinated with either vaccine class five months earlier on average. After controlling for time since vaccination, Spike-binding antibody and neutralizing antibody levels were higher in the mRNA-vaccinated subjects, while no significant differences in antigen-specific B cell and T cell responses were observed between the two groups. Thus, a dichotomy exists between humoral and cellular responses elicited by the two vaccine classes. Our results have implications for the need of booster doses in vaccinated subjects and might explain the dichotomy reported between the waning protection from symptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and its persisting efficacy in preventing hospitalization and death.","Ukey, Rahul; Bruiners, Natalie; Mishra, Hridesh; Mishra, Pankaj K.; McCloskey, Deborah; Onyuka, Alberta; Chen, Fei; Pinter, Abraham; Weiskopf, Daniela; Sette, Alessandro; Roy, Jason; Gaur, Sunanda; Gennaro, Maria Laura",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580675/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.17.21263528v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.17.21263528,56

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three urban and two rural communities in Korea. Interviews were conducted with 3462 individuals (1608 men and 1854 women) aged ≥ 19 years during February–March 2010. Influenza-related information including anxiety, preventive behaviors and their perceived effectiveness, vaccination status, past influenza-like illness symptoms, and sources of and trust in information was obtained. RESULTS: Among 3462 participants, 173 reported experiencing influenza-like illness symptoms within the past 12 months. The mean H1N1 preventive behavior score was 25.5 ± 5.5 (out of a possible 40). The percent of participants reporting high perceived effectiveness and high anxiety was 46.2% and 21.4%, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, H1N1 preventive behavior scores were predicted by a high (β = 3.577, p < 0.001) or moderate (β = 2.529, p < 0.001) perception of their effectiveness. Similarly, moderate (β = 1.516, p < 0.001) and high (β = 4.103, p < 0.001) anxiety scores predicted high preventive behavior scores.

The most common approach to tracking COVID-19 cases over time and space is to examine a series of maps that provide snapshots of the pandemic. A series of snapshots can convey the spatial nature of cases but often rely on subjective interpretation to assess how the pandemic is shifting in severity through time and space. We present a novel application of network optimization to a standard series of snapshots to better reveal how the spatial centres of the pandemic shifted spatially over time in the mainland United States under a mix of interventions. We find a global spatial shifting pattern with stable pandemic centres and both local and long-range interactions. Metrics derived from the daily nature of spatial shifts are introduced to help evaluate the pandemic situation at regional scales. We also highlight the value of reviewing pandemics through local spatial shifts to uncover dynamic relationships among and within regions, such as spillover and concentration among states. This new way of examining the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of network-based spatial shifts offers new story lines in understanding how the pandemic spread in geography.","Zhu, Di; Ye, Xinyue; Manson, Steven",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875751/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87902-8,56

Plant cells have been used to produce monoclonal antibodies or antimicrobial peptides for topical applications to decrease colonization of pathogenic microbes on dental surface. Therefore, we investigated an affordable method for dental biofilm disruption by expressing lipase, dextranase or mutanase in plant cells via the chloroplast genome. Antibiotic resistance gene used to engineer foreign genes into the chloroplast genome were subsequently removed using direct repeats flanking the aadA gene and enzymes were successfully expressed in marker‐free lettuce transplastomic lines. Equivalent enzyme units of plant‐derived lipase performed better than purified commercial enzymes against biofilms, specifically targeting fungal hyphae formation. Combination of lipase with dextranase and mutanase suppressed biofilm development by degrading the biofilm matrix, with concomitant reduction of bacterial and fungal accumulation. In chewing gum tablets formulated with freeze‐dried plant cells, expressed protein was stable up to 3 years at ambient temperature and was efficiently released in a time‐dependent manner using a mechanical chewing simulator device. Development of edible plant cells expressing enzymes eliminates the need for purification and cold‐chain transportation, providing a potential translatable therapeutic approach. Biofilm disruption through plant enzymes and chewing gum‐based delivery offers an effective and affordable dental biofilm control at home particularly for populations with minimal oral care access.","Singh, Rahul; Ren, Zhi; Shi, Yao; Lin, Shina; Kwon, Kwang‐Chul; Balamurugan, Shanmugaraj; Rai, Vineeta; Mante, Francis; Koo, Hyun; Daniell, Henry",Plant Biotechnol J,https://doi.org/10.1111/pbi.13643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076337/,56

Since bronchoalveolar lavage liquid (BAL) collected during fibrobronchoscopy may increase test sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, it was performed during the 2020 pandemic in clinically or radiologically suspected cases. Our aim was to determine whether clinical features, chest computed tomography (CT) findings or laboratory tests may predict patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after a negative nasopharyngeal swab. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study with multivariable analysis of suspected patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after at least one negative nasopharyngeal swab. Univariable logistic regression for odds ratio and multivariate models was calculated to determine clinical, radiological and laboratory predictors. 32/198 (16%) patients had BAL positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 65/198 tested positive for other pathogens at BAL. Of the 32 patients positive for COVID, 4 had a coinfection at BAL, being thus positive both for COVID as well as for another pathogen while the remaining 105 patients were negative for COVID and other pathogens at BAL. COVID-19 patients had more often highly suggestive CT findings, higher number of involved lobes, more often ground glass opacity of more than 50% of lung parenchyma, and less frequently other radiologically suspected infections. At multivariate model, temperature also predicted BAL positivity. The procedure was well tolerated—with only one desaturation episode—while no healthcare worker was infected. In conclusion, when nasopharyngeal swabs are negative but there is clinical or imaging suspicion of COVID-19, BAL represents a complementary diagnostic tool, particularly in conjunction with suggestive/more extensive lung involvement at CT scan. The procedure did not carry increased risks for patients nor for operators, while allowing to free hospital resources, avoiding unnecessary isolations.

METHODS: To help inform consensus standards with data gathered from real-world settings and, in turn, to improve patient care, here we describe the general methodology used in 2018 by OpenBiome, a large stool bank, and its outputs in that year. RESULTS: In 2018, the stool bank received 7,536 stool donations from 210 donors, a daily average of 20.6 donations, and processed 4,271 of those donations into FMT preparations. The median time a screened and enrolled stool donor actively donated stool was 5.8 months. The median time between the manufacture of an FMT preparation and its shipment to a hospital or physician was 8.9 months. Half of the stool bank’s partner hospitals and physicians ordered an average of 0.75 or fewer FMT preparations per month. CONCLUSIONS: Further knowledge sharing should help inform refinements of stool banking guidelines and best practices.","Chen, Justin; Zaman, Amanda; Ramakrishna, Bharat; Olesen, Scott W.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937092/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.622949,56
623029,Novel Coronavirus (nCoV): a Bitter Old Enemy in a New Avatar,2020-06-27,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. The spike protein of the various proteins encoded in SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2, fuses, and enters human cells in the respiratory system. Spike protein, however, is highly variable, and many variants were identified continuously. In this study, Korean mutants for spike protein (D614G and D614A-C terminal domain, L455F and F456L-RBD, and Q787H-S2 domain) were investigated in patients. Because RBD in spike protein is related to direct interaction with ACE2, almost all researches were focused on the RBD region or ACE2-free whole domain region. The 3D structure for spike protein complexed with ACE2 was recently released. The stability analysis through RBD distance among each spike protein chain and the binding free energy calculation between spike protein and ACE2 were performed using MD simulation depending on mutant types in 1-, 2-, and 3-open-complex forms. D614G mutant of CT2 domain, showing to be the most prevalent in the global pandemic, showed higher stability in all open-complex forms than the wild type and other mutants. We hope this study will provide an insight into the importance of conformational fluctuation in the whole domain, although RBD is involved in the direct interaction with ACE2.","Choi, Kwang-Eun; Kim, Jeong-Min; Rhee, JeeEun; Park, Ae Kyung; Kim, Eun-Jin; Kang, Nam Sook",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445414/,56

624208,Coinfection of Tuberculosis Pneumonia and COVID-19 in a Patient Vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG): Case Report,2020-10-17,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerging human pathogen that was first isolated in 2012. MERS-CoV replication depends in part on a virus-encoded papain-like protease (PL(pro)) that cleaves the viral replicase polyproteins at three sites releasing non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), nsp2, and nsp3. In addition to this replicative function, MERS-CoV PL(pro) was recently shown to be a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and to possess deISGylating activity, as previously reported for other coronaviral PL(pro) domains, including that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. These activities have been suggested to suppress host antiviral responses during infection. To understand the molecular basis for ubiquitin (Ub) recognition and deconjugation by MERS-CoV PL(pro), we determined its crystal structure in complex with Ub. Guided by this structure, mutations were introduced into PL(pro) to specifically disrupt Ub binding without affecting viral polyprotein cleavage, as determined using an in trans nsp3↓4 cleavage assay. Having developed a strategy to selectively disable PL(pro) DUB activity, we were able to specifically examine the effects of this activity on the innate immune response. Whereas the wild-type PL(pro) domain was found to suppress IFN-β promoter activation, PL(pro) variants specifically lacking DUB activity were no longer able to do so. These findings directly implicate the DUB function of PL(pro), and not its proteolytic activity per se, in the inhibition of IFN-β promoter activity. The ability to decouple the DUB activity of PL(pro) from its role in viral polyprotein processing now provides an approach to further dissect the role(s) of PL(pro) as a viral DUB during MERS-CoV infection.","Bailey-Elkin, Ben A.; Knaap, Robert C.

We sought to capture the patient perceptions of the COVID‐19 implications and the worldwide imposed treatment modifications. METHODS: A patient survey was conducted in 16 European countries, using a new COVID‐19‐related questionnaire, developed by ENGAGe and the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale questionnaire (HADS). The survey was promoted by national patient advocacy groups and charitable organisations. FINDINGS: We collected 1388 forms; 592 online and 796 hard‐copy (May, 2020). We excluded 137 due to missing data. Median patients’ age was 55 years (range: 18–89), 54.7% had ovarian cancer and 15.5% were preoperative. Even though 73.2% of patients named cancer as a risk factor for COVID‐19, only 17.5% were more afraid of COVID‐19 than their cancer condition, with advanced age (>70 years) as the only significant risk factor for that. Overall, 71% were concerned about cancer progression if their treatment/follow‐up was cancelled/postponed. Most patients (64%) had their care continued as planned, but 72.3% (n = 892) said that they received no information around overall COVID‐19 infection rates of patients and staff, testing or measures taken in their treating hospital. Mean HADS Anxiety and Depression Scores were 8.8 (range: 5.3–12) and 8.1 (range: 3.8–13.4), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified high HADS‐depression scores, having experienced modifications of care due to the pandemic and concern about not being able to visit their doctor as independent predictors of patients’ anxiety. INTERPRETATION: Gynaecological cancer patients expressed significant anxiety about progression of their disease due to modifications of care related to the COVID‐19 pandemic and wished to pursue their treatment as planned despite the associated risks. Healthcare professionals should take this into consideration when making decisions that impact patients care in times of crisis and to develop initiatives to improve patients’ communication and education.","Gultekin, Murat; Ak, Sertac; Ayhan, Ali; Strojna, Aleksandra; Pletnev, Andrei; Fagotti, Anna; Perrone, Anna Myriam; Erzeneoglu, B.

Beyond the efficacy against severe disease and symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, understanding vaccine efficacy against transmission will help model epidemic trajectory and determine appropriate control measures. Recent studies have proposed using random virologic testing in individual randomized controlled trials to improve estimation of vaccine efficacy against infection. We propose to further use the viral load measures from these tests to estimate efficacy against transmission. This estimation requires a model of the relationship between viral load and transmissibility and assumptions about the vaccine effect on transmission and the progress of the epidemic. We describe these key assumptions, potential violations of them, and solutions that can be implemented to mitigate these violations. Assessing these assumptions and implementing this random sampling, with viral load measures, will enable better estimation of the crucial measure of vaccine efficacy against transmission.","Kennedy-Shaffer, L.; Kahn, R.; Lipsitch, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.03.21256556; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.03.21256556v1?rss=1,56
640982,COVID-19 and Multiple Sclerosis: Predisposition and Precautions in Treatment,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND: A healthy healthcare system requires healthy healthcare workers. Protecting healthcare workers including nurses against COVID-19 is crucial, and vaccination could be a viable future option. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a global challenge. Nurses, as a trustworthy and creditable source of vaccine-related information, may build public confidence in vaccination. Hence, research on vaccine hesitancy among nurses is warranted. OBJECTIVES: This study estimated nurses’ influenza vaccination behaviors and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined their corresponding 5C psychological antecedents (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility). To investigate the impact of COVID-19-related work demands, the mediation effects of work stress on the association between work demands and COVID-19 vaccination intention were also examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey SETTINGS: Nurses were invited to participate via the promotion of a professional nursing organization and by personal referrals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 1,205 eligible nurses (mean age = 40.79, SD = 10.47; 90% being female) were included in the analyses. METHODS: Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components, work stress and COVID-19-related work demands (insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported in the survey. RESULTS: The influenza vaccine uptake rate and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively. Influenza vaccination was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs (more confidence, more collective responsibility and less complacency, constraints, and calculation), whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: The potential uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccine among nurses was suboptimal to achieve herd immunity. The 5C constructs were useful in predicting influenza vaccination and, to a lesser extent, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine. The uncertain attributes such as effectiveness, side effects, and effective duration of the COVID-19 vaccine may contribute to this discrepancy. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, the nursing profession may not be ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake rate. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Less than two-third of nurses intended to take COVID-19 vaccine when available. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, nursing profession is not ready to accept it.","Kwok, Kin On; Li, Kin-Kit; WEI, Wan In; Tang, Arthur; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Lee, Shui Shan",Int J Nurs Stud,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002074892030345X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002074892030345X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326864/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103854,56

We aimed to illustrate how the stroke services were interrupted during the pandemic in China. METHODS: A 61-item questionnaire designed on Wenjuanxing Form was completed by doctors or nurses who were involved in treating patients with stroke from 1 February to 31 March 2020. RESULTS: A total of 415 respondents completed the online survey after informed consent was obtained. Of the respondents, 37.8%, 35.2% and 27.0% were from mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively. Overall, the proportion of severe impact (reduction >50%) on the admission of transient ischaemic stroke, acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) was 45.0%, 32.0% and 27.5%, respectively. Those numbers were 36.9%, 27.9% and 22.3%; 36.5%, 22.1% and 22.6%; and 66.4%, 47.5% and 41.1% in mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively (all p<0.0001). For AIS, thrombolysis was moderate (20%–50% reduction) or severely impacted (>50%), as reported by 54.4% of the respondents, while thrombectomy was 39.3%. These were 44.4%, 26.3%; 44.2%, 39.4%; and 78.2%, 56.5%, in mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively (all p<0.0001). For patients with acute ICH, 39.8% reported the impact was severe or moderate for those eligible for surgery who had surgery. Those numbers were 27.4%, 39.0% and 58.1% in mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively. For staff resources, about 20% (overall) to 55% (severe epidemic) of the respondents reported moderate or severe impact on the on-duty doctors and nurses. CONCLUSION: We found a significant reduction of admission for all types of patients with stroke during the pandemic. Patients were less likely to receive appropriate care, for example, thrombolysis/thrombectomy, after being admitted to the hospital. Stroke service in severe COVID-19 epidemic areas, for example, Wuhan, was much more severely impacted compared with other regions in China.","Wang, Xia; Ouyang, Menglu; Carcel, Cheryl; Chen, Chen; Sun, Lingli; Yang, Jie; Zhang, Yao; Chen, Guofang; You, Shoujiang; Cao, Yongjun; Ma, Lu; Hu, Xin; Sui, Yi; Anderson, Craig; Song, Lili; Wang, Yongjun; Wang, David",Stroke Vasc Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2020-000514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989012/,56

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at examining the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic-associated regulations initiated by the German government on pain intensity and characteristics, emotional well-being, and everyday life of patients with painful polyneuropathy. METHODS: Forty-three patients (well assessed with questionnaires before the pandemic and without change of their health status between baseline and current assessment) were investigated with validated, self-reported questionnaires and COVID-19-specific items 2 weeks after the regulations came into effect. RESULTS: Pain intensity remained stable or even improved like the neuropathic pain symptom inventory total score (t0: 33.54 ± 20.48 vs t1: 27.38 ± 16.16, P = 0.008). Only 11.6% reported a pandemic-associated pain worsening. Rumination scores of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale were lower during t1 compared to before the pandemic regulations (t0: 7.81 ± 4.70, t1: 6.49 ± 4.39; P = 0.030). Interestingly, pain ratings for the last 7 days were higher in patients with a changed social life compared to those without (−1.63 ± 1.60 vs 0.31 ± 1.83; P = 0.01). Quality of life was decreased and helplessness increased in those with higher pain ratings. CONCLUSION: Results suggest a shift of attention from the chronic pain condition towards the imminent threat of a global pandemic. As the impacts of the pandemic are persistent and evolving, the development of the measured parameters in the forthcoming weeks will be of great interest.","Kersebaum, Dilara; Fabig, Sophie-Charlotte; Sendel, Manon; Sachau, Juliane; Lassen, Josephine; Rehm, Stefanie; Hüllemann, Philipp; Baron, Ralf; Gierthmühlen, Janne",Pain Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134753/; https://doi.org/10.1097/pr9.0000000000000858,56

Effective use of these data requires the integration of disconnected datasets, but the scientific impacts of consolidated biodiversity data networks have not yet been quantified. To determine whether data integration enables novel research, we carried out a quantitative text analysis and bibliographic synthesis of >4,000 studies published from 2003 to 2019 that use data mediated by the world’s largest biodiversity data network, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Data available through GBIF increased 12-fold since 2007, a trend matched by global data use with roughly two publications using GBIF-mediated data per day in 2019. Data-use patterns were diverse by authorship, geographic extent, taxonomic group, and dataset type. Despite facilitating global authorship, legacies of colonial science remain. Studies involving species distribution modeling were most prevalent (31% of literature surveyed) but recently shifted in focus from theory to application. Topic prevalence was stable across the 17-y period for some research areas (e.g., macroecology), yet other topics proportionately declined (e.g., taxonomy) or increased (e.g., species interactions, disease). Although centered on biological subfields, GBIF-enabled research extends surprisingly across all major scientific disciplines.

648267,COVID-19 and Gynecological Cancers: A Summary of International Recommendations,2020-08-31,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a new, highly pathogenic virus that has recently elicited a global pandemic called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 is characterized by significant immune dysfunction, which is caused by strong but unregulated innate immunity with depressed adaptive immunity. Reduced and delayed responses to interferons (IFN-I/IFN-III) can increase the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and extensive immune cell infiltration into the airways, leading to pulmonary disease. The development of effective treatments for severe COVID-19 patients relies on our knowledge of the pathophysiological components of this imbalanced innate immune response. Strategies to address innate response factors will be essential. Significant efforts are currently underway to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccines, such as inactivated DNA, mRNA, and protein subunit vaccines, have already been applied in clinical use. Various vaccines display different levels of effectiveness, and it is important to continue to optimize and update their composition in order to increase their effectiveness. However, due to the continuous emergence of variant viruses, improving the immunity of the general public may also increase the effectiveness of the vaccines. Many observational studies have demonstrated that serum levels of vitamin D are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. Extensive evidence has shown that vitamin D supplementation could be vital in mitigating the progression of COVID-19 to reduce its severity. Vitamin D defends against SARS-CoV-2 through a complex mechanism through interactions between the modulation of innate and adaptive immune reactions, ACE2 expression, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). However, it remains unclear whether Vit-D also plays an important role in the effectiveness of different COVID-19 vaccines. Based on analysis of the molecular mechanism involved, we speculated that vit-D, via various immune signaling pathways, plays a complementary role in the development of vaccine efficacy.","Chiu, Sheng-Kang; Tsai, Kuo-Wang; Wu, Chia-Chao; Zheng, Cai-Mei; Yang, Chung-Hsiang; Hu, Wan-Chung; Hou, Yi-Chou; Lu, Kuo-Cheng; Chao, You-Chen",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445700/,56

This study aimed to assess cognitive function in women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to women who delivered before the COVID-19 pandemic. A cohort study was performed during the immediate postpartum period of women delivering singletons at term. Cognitive function was assessed using an objective neurocognitive test (Symbol Digit Modalities Test SDMT90, SDMT4) and a subjective self-estimation questionnaire (Attention Function Index AFI). The exposed group was recruited during the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel (May 2020), whereas the comparison group consisted of women delivering at the same medical center before the COVID-19 pandemic (2016–2017). Multivariable regression models were constructed to control potential confounders. There were 79 parturients recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared with 123 women who delivered before the COVID-19 pandemic. Women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic scored lower in the subjective AFI test compared to the unexposed group (70.0 ± 15.4 vs. 75.1 ± 14.7, p = 0.018). However, no significant difference was found in the objective SDMT tests scores. These results remained similar in the multivariable regression models when controlling for maternal age, ethnicity and time from admission to assessment, for AFI, SDMT90 and SDMT4 scores (p = 0.014; p = 0.734; p = 0.786; respectively). While no significant difference was found in objective tests, our findings propose that the exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic is independently associated with a significant decrease in subjective maternal cognitive function during the immediate postpartum period.","Hamami, Hagai; Sheiner, Eyal; Wainstock, Tamar; Mazor, Elad; Lanxner Battat, Talya; Walfisch, Asnat; Kosef, Tamar; Pariente, Gali",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33233589/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113727,56

The centers and institutions that deal with the diagnosis and intervention of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require rapid functional adaptation to respond to patients’ needs. The possibility of using technology to activate and manage diagnostic (preliminary diagnosis) and intervention processes should be explored. Two developed telemedicine working models for diagnosis and intervention, including synchronous and asynchronous transmissions, are presented. They are proposals not yet supported by the data. The diagnosis step is composed by two different and consecutives phases: (A) pre-specialistic consultation (PSC) and (B) specialistic assessment.

The described working models have the purpose of carrying out preliminary specialistic answers to the families without aiming to replace preferable in-person assessment. Based on previous research findings, the telemedicine approach is accepted by parents, increases their sense of competence, increases the parent intervention adhesion, and improves the social communication competencies for children with ASD. In conclusion, the presented working models must be considered partial responses to the current emergency status and at the same time as possible integrations into traditional approaches.","Narzisi, Antonio",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32545809/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9061850,56

The U.K's food system has struggled and lockdown shortages are part of an ongoing trend of anxiety around the food system. Analysis of 19 interviews with people responsible for food procurement within households reveals that while shortages were often experienced for a number of weeks, stockpiling did not take the form of buying large quantities. Instead, modest extra procurement is a more appropriate description of food procurement during lockdown. This article maps six resilience strategies utilised by households in the U.K. during lockdown, of which extra procurement was just one.","Benker, Beth",Appetite,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038478/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195666320316032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666320316032; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.104981,56

660802,Let Us Not Forget Cardiovascular Diseases During COVID-19 Pandemic: the Role of Cardiac Prevention and Rehabilitation,2020-07-10,"Background Vulnerability to COVID-19 hospitalization has been linked to behavioral risk factors, including combustible psychoactive substance use (e.g., tobacco smoking). Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis have been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. We examined the genetic relationship between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods We estimated the genetic correlation between CUD (n case=14,080, n control=343,726) and COVID-19 hospitalization (n case=9,373, n control=1,197,256) using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Using independent GWASs conducted prior to the pandemic, we controlled for several covariates (i.e., tobacco use phenotypes, problematic alcohol use, BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, risk-taking, ADHD, and Townsend Deprivation Index; as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes) using genomic structural equation modeling. Genetic causality between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated using latent causal variable models. Results Genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 was correlated with genetic liability to CUD (rG=0.423(.0965), p=1.33e-6); this association remained when accounting for genetic liability to related risk factors and covariates (b = 0.381 - 0.539, p=0.012 - 0.049). Latent causal variable analysis revealed causal effect estimates that were not statistically significant. Conclusions Problematic cannabis use and vulnerability to serious COVID-19 complications share genetic underpinnings that are unique from common correlates. While CUD may plausibly contribute to severe COVID-19 presentations, causal inference models yielded no evidence of putative causation. Curbing excessive cannabis use may mitigate COVID-19’s impact.","Hatoum, Alexander S.; Morrison, Claire L.; Colbert, Sarah M.C.; Winiger, Evan A.; Johnson, Emma C.; Agrawal, Arpana; Bogdan, Ryan",Biological psychiatry global open science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667174321000513?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667174321000513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235496/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.06.005,56

We investigated GC experiences with telehealth including perceived advantages, disadvantages, and barriers using a one‐time online survey of GCs who provided direct patient care in recent years. The survey examined experiences with telehealth before and after the onset of COVID‐19. We made broad comparisons to findings from a similar study our research team conducted five years ago. GCs reported an increase in the utilization of telehealth over time, with significant increases from pre‐2017 (44%) to pre‐COVID‐19 (70%) and then to present (87%) (p<.001 and .02, respectively). There was no significant change in the total number of hours worked from pre‐COVID‐19 to the time of survey completion, nor were there significant changes in the amount of time spent on clinical responsibilities or interfacing with patients. However, the total number of hours worked in telehealth significantly increased (z = 5.05, p<.001) as did the percent of time spent interacting with patients via telehealth [t(72)=3.74, p<.001, d = 0.44]. Participants overwhelmingly preferred video (84%) over telephone; this differs from our previous survey where video was the preferred modality for 59% (p<.001). We utilized open‐ended questions to elicit reasons for modality preference. The most‐cited barrier to telehealth utilization was billing/reimbursement issues, with 39% noting this obstacle. This is consistent with our previous study where 30% cited billing/reimbursement as the primary barrier. These findings indicate a need for continued efforts to improve billing and reimbursement for genetic counseling offered via telehealth. They also present an opportunity for additional exploration regarding patient preferences for telehealth modality.","Mills, Rachel; MacFarlane, Ian M; Caleshu, Colleen; Ringler, Margaret A; Zierhut, Heather A",J Genet Couns,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231953/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.1465,56

669802,COVID-19 Outbreak: an Update on Therapeutic Options,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Family history information, including information on family members, side of the family of family members, living status of family members, and observations of family members, plays an important role in disease diagnosis and treatment. Family member information extraction aims to extract family history information from semistructured/unstructured text in electronic health records (EHRs), which is a challenging task regarding named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE), where named entities refer to family members, living status, and observations, and relations refer to relations between family members and living status, and relations between family members and observations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to introduce the system we developed for the 2019 n2c2/OHNLP track on family history extraction, which can jointly extract entities and relations about family history information from clinical text. METHODS: We proposed a novel graph-based model with biaffine attention for family history extraction from clinical text. In this model, we first designed a graph to represent family history information, that is, representing NER and RE regarding family history in a unified way, and then introduced a biaffine attention mechanism to extract family history information in clinical text. Convolution neural network (CNN)-Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory network (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) were used to encode the input sentence, and a biaffine classifier was used to extract family history information. In addition, we developed a postprocessing module to adjust the results. A system based on the proposed method was developed for the 2019 n2c2/OHNLP shared task track on family history information extraction. RESULTS: Our system ranked first in the challenge, and the F1 scores of the best system on the NER subtask and RE subtask were 0.8745 and 0.6810, respectively. After the challenge, we further fine tuned the parameters and improved the F1 scores of the two subtasks to 0.8823 and 0.7048, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results showed that the system based on the proposed method can extract family history information from clinical text effectively.","Zhan, Kecheng; Peng, Weihua; Xiong, Ying; Fu, Huhao; Chen, Qingcai; Wang, Xiaolong; Tang, Buzhou",JMIR Med Inform,https://doi.org/10.2196/23587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881405/,56

678975,An Unusual Presentation of Pyelonephritis: Is It COVID-19 Related?,2021-04-24,"Importance: As part of postauthorization safety surveillance, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified a potential safety concern for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) following receipt of the Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine. Objective: To assess reports of GBS received in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: Reports of presumptive GBS were identified in a US passive reporting system (VAERS) February-July 2021 and characterized, including demographics, clinical characteristics, and relevant medical history. Exposures: Receipt of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine; the comparator was the background rate of GBS in the general (unvaccinated) population that had been estimated and published based on a standardized case definition. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presumptive GBS; the reporting rate was analyzed, including calculation of the observed to expected ratio based on background rates and vaccine administration data. Because of limited availability of medical records, cases were not assessed according to the Brighton Collaboration criteria for GBS. Results: As of July 24, 2021, 130 reports of presumptive GBS were identified in VAERS following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination (median age, 56 years; IQR, 45-62 years; 111 individuals [86.0%] were < 65 years; 77 men [59.7%]). The median time to onset of GBS following vaccination was 13 days (IQR, 10-18 days), with 105 cases (81.4%) beginning within 21 days and 123 (95.3%) within 42 days. One hundred twenty-one reports (93.1%) were serious, including 1 death. With approximately 13â¯209â¯858 doses of vaccine administered to adults in the US, the estimated crude reporting rate was 1 case of GBS per 100â¯000 doses administered. The overall estimated observed to expected rate ratio was 4.18 (95% CI, 3.47-4.98) for the 42-day window, and in the worst-case scenario analysis for adults 18 years or older, corresponded to an estimated absolute rate increase of 6.36 per 100â¯000 person-years (based on a rate of approximately 8.36 cases per 100â¯000 person-years [123 cases per 1â¯472â¯162 person-years] compared with a background rate of approximately 2 cases per 100â¯000 person-years). For both risk windows, the observed to expected rate ratio was elevated in all age groups except individuals aged 18 through 29 years. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest a potential small but statistically significant safety concern for Guillain-Barré syndrome following receipt of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. However, the findings are subject to the limitations of passive reporting systems and presumptive case definition, and they must be considered preliminary pending analysis of medical records to establish a definitive diagnosis.","Woo, Emily Jane; Mba-Jonas, Adamma; Dimova, Rositsa B; Alimchandani, Meghna; Zinderman, Craig E; Nair, Narayan",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34617967/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.16496,56
683405,Impact of COVID-19 on Heart Failure Hospitalizations,2021-06-25,"Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and the leading cause of disability among adolescents, with sleep duration as its vital influential factor. Adolescents might be mentally sensitive to the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the alteration of adolescents' sleep duration, depression, and their associations within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been well documented. We conducted a longitudinal study, recruiting 2496 adolescents from 3 junior high schools to examine the alteration of their sleep duration and depressive symptoms before and during the pandemic, and to explore their potential association(s). Data were collected before (December 2019) and during the pandemic (July 2020). Paired samples t-test revealed a significant decrease in sleep duration and a significant increase in depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher grades, COVID-19 infection history, higher CES-DC score, and the COVID-19 pandemic itself might contribute to decreased sleep duration, while longer exercise duration during the pandemic might be a protective factor. According to the cross-lagged analysis, the existence of depressive symptoms before the pandemic was significantly associated with a shorter sleep duration during the pandemic (β = -0.106, p < 0.001). Previously shortened sleep duration was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (β = -0.082, p < 0.001). Our findings revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative influence on adolescents' mental health and sleep. Mental preparedness should be highlighted to mitigate the psychosocial influences of any possible public emergencies in the future. Sleep duration represents a viable home-based intervention for depressive symptoms.","Liao, Shujuan; Luo, Biru; Liu, Hanmin; Zhao, Li; Shi, Wei; Lei, Yalin; Jia, Peng",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214961/,56
685244,CPAP Added to Oxygen Administration Avoid Intubation in Acute Respiratory Distress in COVID-19 Pneumonia. Case Report,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a serious viral disease of swine. At present, there are vaccines for the control of PRRSV infection, but the effect is not satisfactory. The recombination of attenuated vaccines causes significant difficulties with the prevention and control of PRRSV. Type III interferons (IFNs), also called IFN-λs, were newly identified and showed potent antiviral activity within the mucosal surface and immune organs. RESULTS: Therefore, primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were used for this investigation. To this end, we found that the replication of PRRSV in PAMs was significantly reduced after pre-treatment with IFN-λ3, and such inhibition was dose- and time-dependent. The plaque formation of PRRSV abrogated entirely, and virus yields were reduced by four orders of magnitude when the primary PAMs were treated with IFN-λ3 at 1000 ng/ml. In addition, IFN-λ3 in our study was able to induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes 15 (ISG15), 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), IFN-inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3), and myxoma resistance protein 1(Mx1) in primary PAMs. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-λ3 had antiviral activity against PRRSV and can stimulate the expression of pivotal interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), i.e., ISG15, Mx1, OAS1, and IFITM3. So, IFN-λ3 may serve as a useful antiviral agent.

688914,Pandemics and Mental Health: an Unfortunate Alliance,2020-09-11,"INTRODUCTION: Awake prone positioning (APP) might benefit patients with COVID-19 by improving oxygenation, but it is unknown whether this improvement can be sustained with serial proning episodes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of adults with COVID-19 admitted to one intensive care unit, in those who underwent APP and controls. Patients in both groups had type 1 respiratory failure requiring oxygen (but not initially intubated), confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR by nasopharyngeal swab and findings of multifocal ground-glass opacities on imaging. For the APP group, serial SpO(2)/FiO(2) measurements were recorded after each proning episode. RESULTS: Of 77 patients admitted, 50 (65%) were excluded because they had already been intubated. Another 7 (9%) had undergone APP prior to admission. Of the remaining 20, 10 underwent APP and 10 were controls. Patients in both groups had similar demographics, subsequent intubation and survival. Of those who underwent APP, SpO(2)/FiO(2) was most likely to increase after the first episode (before median: 152, IQR 135–185; after: median 192, IQR 156–234, p=0.04). Half of participants (5) in the APP group were unable to tolerate more than two APP episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care are not suitable for APP. Of those who are, many cannot tolerate more than two episodes. Improvements in SpO(2)/FiO(2) secondary to APP are transient and most likely in the first episode. Our findings may explain why other studies have failed to show improvements in mortality from APP despite improvements in oxygenation.","Barker, Joseph; Pan, Daniel; Koeckerling, David; Baldwin, Alexander James; West, Raha",Postgrad Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931557/; https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139631,56

689579,Anaesthetic Considerations for Rationalizing Drug Use in the Operating Theatre: Strategies in a Singapore Hospital During COVID-19,2020-06-12,"Following a nationwide trend, the University of Michigan Medical School has restructured its curriculum to facilitate integration of basic science curricula and early inclusion of clinical experiences, resulting in a truncation of a 19-month didactic-based preclinical curriculum to 13 months. Because preclinical didactic and lab sessions formed the bulk of pathology contact hours, the curriculum overhaul significantly reduced student exposure to pathologists. This reduction in exposure may decrease student understanding of how pathology integrates into the larger picture of healthcare delivery and could also decrease the pipeline of students interested in pursuing pathology as a career choice. To ameliorate these concerns, a mandatory 1-week rotation through the Pathology Department was integrated into the surgery clerkship. This brief report outlines the process of creating a new, unique pathology rotation for surgery clerkship students that includes observation in autopsy and surgical pathology sign-out, small group sessions focused on foundational concepts in microbiology, chemistry, and transfusion medicine, and access to online case-based modules. Available qualitative student feedback indicates that students appreciate how this rotation granted them a “behind the scenes” look at pathology but also noted that the fast pace of clinical sign-out sessions and length of small group sessions were suboptimal for student learning. This feedback and future survey data will serve as a platform on which curricular improvements can be made to enhance the learning environment for both learners and educators.","Lew, Madelyn",Acad Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027058/; https://doi.org/10.1177/23742895211015344,56
