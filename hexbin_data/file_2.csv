2,2,2,Surfactant protein-D and pulmonary host defense,13.42437,7.946782,2000-08-25,"Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens, and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.","Crouch, Erika C",Respir Res,2,1
41,41,41,Relevance of human metapneumovirus in exacerbations of COPD,13.515861,7.82306,2005-12-21,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma. Since respiratory viruses are frequently detected in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) it was our aim to investigate the frequency of hMPV detection in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD compared to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We analysed nasal lavage and induced sputum of 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. HMPV was detected in 3/130 (2.3%) AE-COPD patients with a mean of 6.5 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in induced sputum. It was not found in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. CONCLUSION: HMPV is only found in a very small number of patients with AE-COPD. However it should be considered as a further possible viral trigger of AE-COPD because asymptomatic carriage is unlikely.","Rohde, G; Borg, I; Arinir, U; Kronsbein, J; Rausse, R; Bauer, TT; Bufe, A; Schultze-Werninghaus, G",Respir Res,2,11
85,85,85,The immunoregulatory and allergy-associated cytokines in the aetiology of the otitis media with effusion.,13.458872,8.197444,2004-04-11,"Inflammation in the middle ear mucosa, which can be provoked by different primary factors such as bacterial and viral infection, local allergic reactions and reflux, is the crucial event in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME). Unresolved acute inflammatory responses or defective immunoregulation of middle inflammation can promote chronic inflammatory processes and stimulate the chronic condition of OME. Cytokines are the central molecular regulators of middle ear inflammation and can switch the acute phase of inflammation in the chronic stage and induce molecular-pathological processes leading to the histopathological changes accompanying OME. In this review we present cytokines identified in otitis media, immunoregulatory [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta]) and allergy associated (IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), as crucial molecular regulators, responsible for chronic inflammation in the middle ear and the chronic condition of OME.","Smirnova, Marina G; Birchall, John P; Pearson, Jeffrey P",Mediators Inflamm,2,1
185,185,185,HIV-Specific T-Cells Accumulate in the Liver in HCV/HIV Co-Infection,13.204895,8.206255,2008-10-20,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-related liver disease progresses more rapidly in individuals co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV), although the underlying immunologic mechanisms are unknown. We examined whether HIV-specific T-cells are identified in the liver of HCV/HIV co-infected individuals and promote liver inflammation through bystander immune responses. METHODS: Ex-vivo intra-hepatic lymphocytes from HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected individuals were assessed for immune responses to HIV and HCV antigens by polychromatic flow cytometry. RESULTS: HCV/HIV liver biopsies had similar frequencies of lymphocytes but lower percentages of CD4(+) T-cells compared to HCV biopsies. In co-infection, intra-hepatic HIV-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells producing IFN-γ and TNF-α were detected and were comparable in frequency to those that were HCV-specific. In co-infected individuals, viral-specific CD8(+) T-cells produced more of the fibrogenic cytokine, TNF-α. In both mono- and co-infected individuals, intra-hepatic HCV-specific T-cells were poorly functional compared to HIV-specific T-cells. In co-infection, HAART was not associated with a reconstitution of intra-hepatic CD4(+) T-cells and was associated with reduction in both HIV and HCV-specific intra-hepatic cytokine responses. CONCLUSION: The accumulation of functional HIV-specific T-cells in the liver during HCV/HIV co-infection may represent a bystander role for HIV in inducing faster progression of liver disease.","Vali, Bahareh; Yue, Feng Yun; Jones, R.

473,473,473,Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung,13.31542,8.104653,2010-11-23,"To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.","Tomankova, Tereza; Petrek, Martin; Kriegova, Eva",Respir Res,2,1
578,578,578,Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of the 2009 A/H1N1 Influenza Pandemic in Peru,13.373911,8.181108,2011-06-21,"BACKGROUND: Highly refined surveillance data on the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic are crucial to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of the pandemic. There is little information about the spatial-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza in South America. Here we provide a quantitative description of the age-specific morbidity pandemic patterns across administrative areas of Peru. METHODS: We used daily cases of influenza-like-illness, tests for A/H1N1 influenza virus infections, and laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases reported to the epidemiological surveillance system of Peru's Ministry of Health from May 1 to December 31, 2009. We analyzed the geographic spread of the pandemic waves and their association with the winter school vacation period, demographic factors, and absolute humidity. We also estimated the reproduction number and quantified the association between the winter school vacation period and the age distribution of cases. RESULTS: The national pandemic curve revealed a bimodal winter pandemic wave, with the first peak limited to school age children in the Lima metropolitan area, and the second peak more geographically widespread. The reproduction number was estimated at 1.6–2.2 for the Lima metropolitan area and 1.3–1.5 in the rest of Peru. We found a significant association between the timing of the school vacation period and changes in the age distribution of cases, while earlier pandemic onset was correlated with large population size. By contrast there was no association between pandemic dynamics and absolute humidity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate substantial spatial variation in pandemic patterns across Peru, with two pandemic waves of varying timing and impact by age and region. Moreover, the Peru data suggest a hierarchical transmission pattern of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 driven by large population centers. The higher reproduction number of the first pandemic wave could be explained by high contact rates among school-age children, the age group most affected during this early wave.","Chowell, Gerardo; Viboud, Cécile; Munayco, Cesar V.; Gómez, Jorge; Simonsen, Lone; Miller, Mark A.; Tamerius, James; Fiestas, Victor; Halsey, Eric S.; Laguna-Torres, Victor A.",PLoS One,2,22
698,698,698,Current Status of the Immunomodulation and Immunomediated Therapeutic Strategies for Multiple Sclerosis,13.202408,7.942785,2011-12-06,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, and CD4(+) T cells form the core immunopathogenic cascade leading to chronic inflammation. Traditionally, Th1 cells (interferon-γ-producing CD4(+) T cells) driven by interleukin 12 (IL12) were considered to be the encephalitogenic T cells in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Currently, Th17 cells (Il17-producing CD4(+) T cells) are considered to play a fundamental role in the immunopathogenesis of EAE. This paper highlights the growing evidence that Th17 cells play the core role in the complex adaptive immunity of EAE/MS and discusses the roles of the associated immune cells and cytokines. These constitute the modern immunological basis for the development of novel clinical and preclinical immunomodulatory therapies for MS discussed in this paper.","Chen, Shyi-Jou; Wang, Yen-Ling; Fan, Hueng-Chuen; Lo, Wen-Tsung; Wang, Chih-Chien; Sytwu, Huey-Kang",Clin Dev Immunol,2,17
729,729,729,Comparison of percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation and surgical resection for small hepatocellular carcinoma,13.443889,8.025943,2011-12-28,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this investigation was to compare the outcome of percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation therapy (PRFA) with surgical resection (SR) in the treatment of single and small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 231 treatment naive patients with a single HCC ≤ 3 cm who had received either curative PRFA (162 patients) or curative SR (69 patients). All patients were regularly followed up after treatment at our department with blood and radiologic tests. RESULTS: The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates after PRFA and SR were 95.4%, 79.6% and 63.1%, respectively in the PRFA group and 100%, 81.4% and 74.6%, respectively in the SR group. The corresponding recurrence free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years after PRFA and SR were 82.0%, 38.3% and 18.0%, respectively in the PRFA group and 86.0%, 47.2% and 26.0%, respectively in the SR group. In terms of overall survival and recurrence free survival, there were no significant differences between these two groups. In comparison of PRFA group patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) (n = 127) and SR group patients with LC (n = 50) and in comparison of PRFA group patients without LC (n = 35) and SR group patients without LC (n = 19), there were also no significant differences between two groups in terms of overall survival and recurrence free survival. In the multivariate analysis of the risk factors contributing to overall survival, serum albumin level was the sole significant factor. In the multivariate analysis of the risk factors contributing to recurrence free survival, presence of LC was the sole significant factor. The rate of serious adverse events in the SR group was significantly higher than that in the PRFA group (P = 0.023). Hospitalization length in the SR group was significantly longer than in the PRFA group (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: PRFA is as effective as SR in the treatment of single and small HCC, and is less invasive than SR. Therefore, PRFA could be a first choice for the treatment of single and small HCC.","Nishikawa, Hiroki; Inuzuka, Tadashi; Takeda, Haruhiko; Nakajima, Jun; Matsuda, Fumihiro; Sakamoto, Azusa; Henmi, Shinichiro; Hatamaru, Keiichi; Ishikawa, Tetsuro; Saito, Sumio; Nasu, Akihiro; Kita, Ryuichi; Kimura, Toru; Arimoto, Akira; Osaki, Yukio",BMC Gastroenterol,2,1

Recent studies have demonstrated that CTCL cells overexpress the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a xenograft model of CTCL was established and a recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 8 (AAV8) vector expressing a humanized single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-Fc fusion (scFvFc or “minibody”) of anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) h1567 was evaluated for curative treatment. Human CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions encoding the h1567 (AAV8-h1567) minibody showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival. The AAV8-h1567 minibody notably increased the number of tumor-infiltrating Ly-6G(+) FcγRIIIa(CD16A)(+) murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV8-control minibody treated mice. Furthermore, in CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mice co-treated with AAV8-h1567 minibody and infused with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), marked tumor infiltration of human CD16A(+) CD56(+) NK cells was observed. The h1567 minibody also induced in vitro ADCC activity through both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our data demonstrate that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of h1567 minibody is mediated, at least in part, through CD16A(+) immune effector cell ADCC mechanisms. These data further demonstrate the utility of the AAV-minibody gene transfer system in the rapid evaluation of candidate anti-tumor mAbs and the potency of h1567 as a potential novel therapy for CTCL.","Han, Thomas; Abdel-Motal, Ussama M.; Chang, De-Kuan; Sui, Jianhua; Muvaffak, Asli; Campbell, James; Zhu, Quan; Kupper, Thomas S.; Marasco, Wayne A.",PLoS One,2,8

METHODS: Patients with unresectable advanced HCC received cryoablation and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in 4-week cycles on the same day of the cryoablation. Tumor response, median overall survival and the median time to radiological progression were calculated and the toxicity was evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with unresectable HCC were involved in this study. The median age was 52 years (range, 22-81 years). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scores were 0 (39.7%), 1 (55.1%), and 2 (5.1%). Nine (11.5%) patients were at Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage A, twenty-four (30.8%) patients were at stage B and 45 (57.7%) patients were at stage C. Five (6.4%) achieved partial responses, and 34 (43.6%) achieved stable disease. The median time to progression (TTP) for all enrolled patients was 6.6 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 12.2 months. CONCLUSION: Cryoablation combined with sorafenib demonstrates good efficacy and acceptable tolerability in treating unresectable advanced HCC patients.","Ni, Hong; Yang, Mao; Guo, Zhi; Zhang, Ti",Chin J Cancer Res,2,1

Much is known about genetic susceptibility, uptake and dissemination of PrP(Sc) in the body, but many aspects of prion diseases are still unknown. Different proteomic techniques have been used during the last decade to investigate differences in protein profiles between affected animals and healthy controls. We have investigated the protein profiles in serum of sheep with scrapie and healthy controls by SELDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS. Latent Variable methods such as Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis and Target Projection methods were used to describe the MS data. RESULTS: The serum proteomic profiles showed variable differences between the groups both throughout the incubation period and at the clinical end stage of scrapie. At the end stage, the target projection model separated the two groups with a sensitivity of 97.8%, and serum amyloid A was identified as one of the protein peaks that differed significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: At the clinical end stage of classical scrapie, ten SELDI peaks significantly discriminated the scrapie group from the healthy controls. During the non-clinical incubation period, individual SELDI peaks were differently expressed between the groups at different time points. Investigations of differences in -omic profiles can contribute to new insights into the underlying disease processes and pathways, and advance our understanding of prion diseases, but comparison and validation across laboratories is difficult and challenging.","Meling, Siv; Kvalheim, Olav M; Arneberg, Reidar; Bårdsen, Kjetil; Hjelle, Anne; Ulvund, Martha J",BMC Res Notes,2,1

The results of molecular biological investigations propose that BEN is a multifactorial disease with genetic predisposition to environmental risk agents. Exome sequencing of 22 000 genes with Illumina Nextera Exome Enrichment Kit was performed on 22 DNA samples (11 Bulgarian patients and 11 Serbian patients). Software analysis was performed via NextGene, Provean, and PolyPhen. The frequency of all annotated genetic variants with deleterious/damaging effect was compared with those of European populations. Then we focused on nonannotated variants (with no data available about them and not found in healthy Bulgarian controls). There is no statistically significant difference between annotated variants in BEN patients and European populations. From nonannotated variants with more than 40% frequency in both patients' groups, we nominated 3 genes with possible deleterious/damaging variants—CELA1, HSPG2, and KCNK5. Mutant genes (CELA1, HSPG2, and KCNK5) in BEN patients encode proteins involved in basement membrane/extracellular matrix and vascular tone, tightly connected to process of angiogenesis. We suggest that an abnormal process of angiogenesis plays a key role in the molecular pathogenesis of BEN.","Toncheva, D.; Mihailova-Hristova, M.; Vazharova, R.; Staneva, R.; Karachanak, S.; Dimitrov, P.; Simeonov, V.; Ivanov, S.; Balabanski, L.; Serbezov, D.; Malinov, M.; Stefanovic, V.; Čukuranović, R.; Polenakovic, M.; Jankovic-Velickovic, L.; Djordjevic, V.; Jevtovic-Stoimenov, T.; Plaseska-Karanfilska, D.; Galabov, A.; Djonov, V.; Dimova, I.",Biomed Res Int,2,1

METHODS: In 2007, the Kenyan Ministry of Health with technical support from the CDC-Kenya established a national sentinel surveillance system for influenza. At 11 hospitals, for every hospitalized patient with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), and for the first three outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) per day, we collected both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Beginning in 2008, we conducted in-hospital follow-up for SARI patients to determine outcome. Specimens were tested by real time RT-PCR for influenza A and B. Influenza A-positive specimens were subtyped for H1, H3, H5, and (beginning in May 2009) A(H1N1)pdm09. RESULTS: From July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2013, we collected specimens from 24,762 SARI and 14,013 ILI patients. For SARI and ILI case-patients, the median ages were 12 months and 16 months, respectively, and 44% and 47% were female. In all, 2,378 (9.6%) SARI cases and 2,041 (14.6%) ILI cases were positive for influenza viruses. Most influenza-associated SARI cases (58.6%) were in children <2 years old. Of all influenza-positive specimens, 78% were influenza A, 21% were influenza B, and 1% were influenza A/B coinfections. Influenza circulated in every month. In four of the six years influenza activity peaked during July–November. Of 9,419 SARI patients, 2.7% died; the median length of hospitalization was 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: During six years of surveillance in Kenya, influenza was associated with nearly 10 percent of hospitalized SARI cases and one-sixth of outpatient ILI cases. Most influenza-associated SARI and ILI cases were in children <2 years old; interventions to reduce the burden of influenza, such as vaccine, could consider young children as a priority group.","Katz, Mark A.; Muthoka, Philip; Emukule, Gideon O.; Kalani, Rosalia; Njuguna, Henry; Waiboci, Lilian W.; Ahmed, Jamal A.; Bigogo, Godfrey; Feikin, Daniel R.; Njenga, Moses K.; Breiman, Robert F.; Mott, Joshua A.",PLoS One,2,1

The objective of this work was to screen human suspension cell lines for the capacity to support viral replication. As the first step, it was investigated whether poliovirus can replicate in such cell lines. Sabin poliovirus type 1 was serially passaged on five human cell lines, HL60, K562, KG1, THP-1, and U937. Sabin type 1 was capable of efficiently replicating in three cell lines (K562, KG1, and U937), yielding high viral titers after replication. Expression of CD155, the poliovirus receptor, did not explain susceptibility to replication, since all cell lines expressed CD155. Furthermore, we showed that passaged virus replicated more efficiently than parental virus in KG1 cells, yielding higher virus titers in the supernatant early after infection. Infection of cell lines at an MOI of 0.01 resulted in high viral titers in the supernatant at day 4. Infection of K562 with passaged Sabin type 1 in a bioreactor system yielded high viral titers in the supernatant. Altogether, these data suggest that K562, KG1, and U937 cell lines are useful for propagation of poliovirus.","Oosterhoff, Dinja; van de Weerd, Gerard; van Eikenhorst, Gerco; de Gruijl, Tanja D.; van der Pol, Leo A.; Bakker, Wilfried A.

In this study, we determined the ability of AcNPV-LC3 to protect against ALA by the intramuscular route as well as the liver immune response associated with protection. Results showed that 55% of hamsters IM immunized with AcNPV-LC3 showed sterile protection against ALA, whereas other 20% showed reduction in the size and extent of abscesses, resulting in some protection in 75% of animals compared to the sham control group. Levels of protection showed a linear correlation with the development and intensity of specific antiamoeba cellular and humoral responses, evaluated in serum and spleen of hamsters, respectively. Evaluation of the Th1/Th2 cytokine patterns expressed in the liver of hamsters showed that sterile protection was associated with the production of high levels of IFNγ and IL-4. These results suggest that the baculovirus system is equally efficient by the intramuscular as well as the oral routes for ALA protection and that the Gal-lectin LC3 fragment is a highly protective antigen against hepatic amoebiasis through the local induction of IFNγ and IL-4.","Meneses-Ruiz, Dulce María; Aguilar-Diaz, Hugo; Bobes, Raúl José; Sampieri, Alicia; Vaca, Luis; Laclette, Juan Pedro; Carrero, Julio César",Biomed Res Int,2,1

Inhalation of cigarette smoke and industrial fumes containing cadmium are sources of cadmium exposure. It is responsible for the malfunction of various organs, leading to disease particularly in the lungs, liver and kidneys. In the present study, the effect of cadmium chloride (CdCl(2)) on cell viability, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-10 cytokines at various concentrations and incubation durations were assessed in MRC-9 human normal lung and A549 human lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. Cell viability was measured using a crystal violet dye binding assay. The expression levels of the cytokines were measured by cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl(2) compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl(2) concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl(2) concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium. The results indicated that CdCl(2) affected the expression levels of the cytokines and led to cytotoxicity in human lung cells, and suggested that compounds which reduce inflammation may prevent cadmium toxicity.","ODEWUMI, CAROLINE; LATINWO, LEKAN M.; SINCLAIR, ANDRE; BADISA, VEERA L.D.; ABDULLAH, AHKINYALA; BADISA, RAMESH B.",Mol Med Rep,2,11
2123,2123,2123,Composition and dynamics of the respiratory tract microbiome in intubated patients,13.281948,8.150753,2016-02-11,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major contributor to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. LRTI also occurs during mechanical ventilation, increasing the morbidity and mortality of intubated patients. We sought to understand the dynamics of respiratory tract microbiota following intubation and the relationship between microbial community structure and infection. RESULTS: We enrolled a cohort of 15 subjects with respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation from the medical intensive care unit at an academic medical center. Oropharyngeal (OP) and deep endotracheal (ET) secretions were sampled within 24 h of intubation and every 48–72 h thereafter. Bacterial community profiling was carried out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic community analysis. We compared enrolled subjects to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower respiratory tract sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by chart review correlated with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon. Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma parvum and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analysis of respiratory tract microbiota in critically ill patients provides insight into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of LRTI. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of endotracheal aspirate samples holds promise for expanded pathogen identification.

2467,2467,2467,Treatment of allergic rhinitis with acupoint herbal plaster: an oligonucleotide chip analysis,13.546547,7.9074755,2016-11-04,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis is regarded as an imbalanced Th1/Th2 cell-mediated response. The present study used microarray analysis to compare gene expression levels between allergic rhinitis patients before and after a series of acupoint herbal plaster applications. METHODS: In this experimental pilot study, volunteers experiencing sneezing, runny nose, and congestion for more than 9 months in the year following initial diagnoses were included after diagnostic confirmation by otolaryngologists to exclude patients with sinusitis and nasal polyps. Patients with persistent allergic rhinitis each received four acupoint herbal plaster treatments applied using the moxibustion technique. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using an ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test, and patients were classified as phadiatop (Ph)-positive or -negative. Microarray results were analyzed for genes that were differentially expressed between (1) Ph-positive and -negative patients treated with herbal plaster; and (2) before and after herbal plaster treatment in the Ph-positive patient group. Unsupervised and supervised methods were used for gene-expression data analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen Ph-positive and four Ph-negative participants with persistent allergic rhinitis were included in the study. RQLQ results indicated that the 19 Ph-positive volunteers experienced improvement in six of seven categories following acupoint herbal plaster treatments, whereas the four Ph-negative participants reported improvement in only two categories. Hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis of the gene expression profiles of Ph-positive and –negative participants indicated the groups exhibited distinct physiological responses to acupoint herbal treatment. Evaluation of gene networks using MetaCore identified that the “Immune response_IL-13 signaling via JAK-STAT” and the “Inflammation_Interferon signaling” were down- and up-regulated, respectively, among Ph-positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, we find that the IL-13 immune response via JAK-STAT signaling and interferon inflammation signaling were down- and upregulated, respectively, in the Ph-positive group. Further studies are required to verify these pathways in Ph-positive patients, and to determine the mechanism of such pathway dysregulation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02486159.

Bacterial genomes and proteins are detected in brains from humans, nonhuman primates, rodents and other species in the absence of neurological disease. We investigated the composition and abundance of microbiota in frozen and fixed autopsied brain samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and age- and sex-matched nonMS patients as controls, using neuropathological, molecular and bioinformatics tools. 16s rRNA sequencing revealed Proteobacteria to be the dominant phylum with restricted diversity in cerebral white matter (WM) from MS compared to nonMS patients. Both clinical groups displayed 1,200–1,400 bacterial genomes/cm(3) and low bacterial rRNA:rDNA ratios in WM. RNAseq analyses showed a predominance of Proteobacteria in progressive MS patients’ WM, associated with increased inflammatory gene expression, relative to a broader range of bacterial phyla in relapsing-remitting MS patients’ WM. Although bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and RNA polymerase beta subunit immunoreactivities were observed in all patients, PGN immunodetection was correlated with demyelination and neuroinflammation in MS brains. Principal component analysis revealed that demyelination, PGN and inflammatory gene expression accounted for 86% of the observed variance. Thus, inflammatory demyelination is linked to an organ-specific dysbiosis in MS that could contribute to underlying disease mechanisms.","Branton, W. G.; Lu, J. Q.; Surette, M. G.; Holt, R.

Mitophagy is an essential component to normal pancreatic β-cell function and has been associated with β-cell failure in Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our previous studies have indicated that mitochondrial Rho (Miro) GTPase-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction under high nutrient stress leads to NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3)-dependent proinflammatory responses and subsequent insulin resistance. However, the in vivo mechanism by which Miro1 underlies mitophagy has not been identified. Here we show firstly that the expression of Miro is reduced in human T2D and mouse db/db islets and in INS-1 cell line exposed to high glucose and palmitate. β-cell specific ablation of Miro1 (Miro1f/f: Rip-cre mice, or (IKO) under high nutrient stress promotes the development of hyperglycemia. β-cells from IKO mice display an inhibition of mitophagy under oxidative stress and induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Dysfunctional mitophagy in IKO mice is represented by damaged islet beta cell mitochondrial and secretory capacity, unbalanced downstream MKK-JNK signalling without affecting the levels of MEK, ERK or p38 activation and subsequently, impaired insulin secretion signaling via inhibition IRS-AKT-Foxo1 pathway, leading to worsening glucose tolerance in these mice. Thus, these data suggest that Miro1 may be responsible for mitophagy deficiency and β-cell dysfunction in T2D and that strategies target Miro1 in vivo may provide a therapeutic target to enhance β-cell mitochondrial quality and insulin secretion to ameliorate complications associated with T2D.","Chen, Lingling; Liu, Chunyan; Gao, Jianfeng; Xie, Zhiwen; Chan, Lawrence W.C.; Keating, Damien J.; Yang, Yibin; Sun, Jiazhong; Zhou, Fuling; Wei, Yongchang; Men, Xiuli; Yang, Sijun",Oncotarget,2,8

B cells have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of NSIP. However, the relationship between B-lymphocyte and the clinical outcomes of NSIP was unclear. In this study, 50 patients with histopathologically confirmed NSIP from Peking Union Medical College Hospital between April 2003 to December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Using immunohistochemical analyses, CD20+ B cells were counted in the lymphoid follicles, perivascular, interstitial, and peribronchiolar regions of lung tissure. The CD20+ lymphocytes were mainly present in the lymphoid follicles. The number of follicular CD20+ lymphocytes was higher in the fibrosing than cellular NSIP pattern [255.08 (132.92–449.71) vs. 121.33 (63.54–282.88)/0.1 mm(2), p = 0.017]. After 1 year of therapy, the follicular CD20+ lymphocytes were significantly higher in patients whose forced vital capacity (FVC) worsened as compared to those who improved (p = 0.014). Additionally, follicular CD20+ lymphocytes were negatively correlated with the post-treatment percentage change in FVC (rho = −0.397, p = 0.004). However, follicular CD20+ lymphocytes were not correlated with survival. These results suggested that pulmonary follicular CD20+ lymphocytes were correlated with the fibrosing pattern of NSIP and predicted less clinical improvement after treatment.","Peng, Min; Wang, Wenze; Qin, Ling; Liu, Hongrui; Qin, Mingwei; Zheng, Wenjie; Shi, JuHong; Xu, Wenbing; Zhu, Yuanjue",Sci Rep,2,1

RESULT: Out of 74 calves selected for this study, 6 (8.11%) were positive for septicemic E. coli. Higher prevalence of 5 (8.93%) was recorded in Holstein Friesian breed than Boran breed 1 (5.56%). However, breed showed no significant difference on E. coli infections (P > 0.05). Higher prevalence of E. coli revealed below age of 30 days (17.39%) than calves aged between 30 and 90 days (8.33%) and above 90 days (0.00%). However, statistical association showed no difference (P > 0.05). Parity showed a significant difference in prevalence of E. coli (P < 0.05) in which infection increased with number of parity.

3051,3051,3051,Surfactant Protein D in Respiratory and Non-Respiratory Diseases,13.6790495,8.099677,2018-02-08,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a multimeric collectin that is involved in innate immune defense and expressed in pulmonary, as well as non-pulmonary, epithelia. SP-D exerts antimicrobial effects and dampens inflammation through direct microbial interactions and modulation of host cell responses via a series of cellular receptors. However, low protein concentrations, genetic variation, biochemical modification, and proteolytic breakdown can induce decomposition of multimeric SP-D into low-molecular weight forms, which may induce pro-inflammatory SP-D signaling. Multimeric SP-D can decompose into trimeric SP-D, and this process, and total SP-D levels, are partly determined by variation within the SP-D gene, SFTPD. SP-D has been implicated in the development of respiratory diseases including respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, allergic asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disease-induced breakdown or modifications of SP-D facilitate its systemic leakage from the lung, and circulatory SP-D is a promising biomarker for lung injury. Moreover, studies in preclinical animal models have demonstrated that local pulmonary treatment with recombinant SP-D is beneficial in these diseases. In recent years, SP-D has been shown to exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects in various non-pulmonary organs and to have effects on lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory effects in vessel walls, which enhance the risk of atherosclerosis. A common SFTPD polymorphism is associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes, and SP-D has been associated with metabolic disorders because of its effects in the endothelium and adipocytes and its obesity-dampening properties. This review summarizes and discusses the reported genetic associations of SP-D with disease and the clinical utility of circulating SP-D for respiratory disease prognosis. Moreover, basic research on the mechanistic links between SP-D and respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases is summarized. Perspectives on the development of SP-D therapy are addressed.","Sorensen, Grith L.",Front Med (Lausanne),2,22

There have been numerous studies that have reported that T cells serve major roles in tumor progression. However, the function of CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) in prostate cancer remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of CXCL9 in prostate cancer. A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL-6 and B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2′-dimethyl 4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57+DMAB or CXCL9+DMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57+DMAB and CXCL9+DMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9+DMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57+DMAB mice. Compared with C57+DMAB mice, the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL-6 and TGF-β was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9+DMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57+DMAB mice. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that CXCL9 mRNA expression in clinical samples was positively associated with clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer. In conclusion, CXCL9 may promote prostate cancer progression via inhibition of cytokines from T cells.","Tan, Shanfeng; Wang, Kai; Sun, Fuguang; Li, Yang; Gao, Yisheng",Mol Med Rep,2,22

Using appropriate reference gene is critical in RT-qPCR data normalization. A comprehensive study on the reference genes in M. separata is lacking. In this paper, expression stabilities of ten candidate reference genes were evaluated in M. separata under various biotic and abiotic conditions by employing four different software geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔCT method. The comprehensive stabilities ranking of these genes were suggested by RefFinder. PKG as a target gene was employed to justify the number of reference genes in four larval tissues and two photoperiod treatments. Results demonstrate that the first three most stable genes were as follows: EF, CypA, and β-TUB for developmental stages; EF, CypA, and RPL12 for larval tissues; EF, TBP, and β-TUB for adult tissues. RPL12, β-TUB, and EF for densities; EF, RPL12, and GAPDH for photoperiod treatments; β-TUB, EF, and ATPase for temperature treatments. Stable reference gene combinations may reduce bias in normalization.

Infants with CFTR mutations show a peribronchial neutrophil infiltration prior to the establishment of infection in their lung. The inflammatory response progressively increases in children that include both upper and lower airways. Infectious and inflammatory response leads to an increase in mucus viscosity and mucus plugging of small and medium-size bronchioles. Eventually, neutrophils chronically infiltrate the airways with biofilm or chronic bacterial infection. Perpetual infection and airway inflammation destroy the lungs, which leads to increased morbidity and eventual mortality in most of the patients with CF. Studies have now established that neutrophil cytotoxins, extracellular DNA, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are associated with increased mucus clogging and lung injury in CF. In addition to opportunistic pathogens, various aspects of the CF airway milieux (e.g., airway pH, salt concentration, and neutrophil phenotypes) influence the NETotic capacity of neutrophils. CF airway milieu may promote the survival of neutrophils and eventual pro-inflammatory aberrant NETosis, rather than the anti-inflammatory apoptotic death in these cells. Degrading NETs helps to manage CF airway disease; since DNAse treatment release cytotoxins from the NETs, further improvements are needed to degrade NETs with maximal positive effects. Neutrophil-T cell interactions may be important in regulating viral infection-mediated pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bacterial infections. Therefore, clarifying the role of neutrophils and NETs in CF lung disease and identifying therapies that preserve the positive effects of neutrophils, while reducing the detrimental effects of NETs and cytotoxic components, are essential in achieving innovative therapeutic advances.","Khan, Meraj A.; Ali, Zubair Sabz; Sweezey, Neil; Grasemann, Hartmut; Palaniyar, Nades",Genes (Basel),2,17

Based on results showing that the intermediate compartment (IC) at the ER-Golgi boundary constitutes a stable tubular network that maintains its dynamics in the presence of BFA, we propose that two bidirectional Golgi-bypass pathways to the PM exist, a direct route from early IC elements, and another, reminescent of the yeast secretory pathway, from late IC elements via the endosomal system.

Currently, there are limited data from middle-income countries analysing the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in this population. We explored the clinical effects and economic benefits of expanding the current national influenza vaccination schedule in Mexico to include the school-aged population. METHODS: A static 1-year model incorporating herd effect was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of expanding the current national influenza vaccination schedule of Mexico to include the school-aged population. We performed a cross-sectional epidemiological study using influenza records (2009–2018), death records (2010–2015), and discharge and hospitalisation records (2010–2016), from the databases of Mexico’s Influenza Surveillance System (SISVEFLU), the National Mortality Epidemiological and Statistical System (SEED), and the Automated Hospital Discharge System (SAEH), respectively. Cost estimates for influenza cases were based on 7 scenarios using data analysed from SISVEFLU; assumptions for clinical management of cases were defined according to Mexico’s national clinical guidelines. The primary health outcome for this study was the number of influenza cases avoided. A sensitivity analysis was performed using conservative and optimistic parameters (vaccination coverage: 30% / 70%, Vaccine effectiveness: 19% / 68%). RESULTS: It was estimated that expanding the influenza immunisation programme to cover school-aged population in Mexico over the 2018–2019 influenza season would result in 671,461 cases of influenza avoided (50% coverage and 50% effectiveness assumed). Associated with this were 262,800 fewer outpatient consultations; 154,100 fewer emergency room consultations; 97,600 fewer hospitalisations, and 15 fewer deaths. Analysis of cases avoided by age-group showed that 55.4% of them were in the school-aged population, and the decrease in outpatient consultations was largest in this population. There was an overall decrease in the economic burden for the Mexican health care system of 111.9 million US dollars; the immunization programme was determined to be cost-saving in the base, conservative and optimistic scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating school-aged population in Mexico would be cost-effective; expansion of the current national vaccination schedule to this age group is supported.","Falcón-Lezama, Jorge Abelardo; Saucedo-Martínez, Rodrigo; Betancourt-Cravioto, Miguel; Alfaro-Cortes, Myrna María; Bahena-González, Roberto Isaac; Tapia-Conyer, Roberto",BMC Infect Dis,2,1

In the current study, we investigated the presence and cellular distribution of Ang-(1–7) and the Mas receptor, the expression of Mas and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) messenger RNA (mRNA), and the enzymatic activity in the rat ovary following gonadotropin stimulation in vivo. Immature female Wistar rats (25 days old) were injected subcutaneously (SC) with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, 20 IU in 0.2 mL) or vehicle 48 hours before euthanasia. Tissue distributions of Ang-(1–7), Mas receptor, and ACE2 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, along with angiotensin II (Ang II) localization, while the mRNA expression levels of Mas receptor and ACE2 were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, we determined the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), and ACE by fluorometric assays. After eCG treatment, we found strong immunoreactivity for Ang-(1–7) and Mas primarily in the theca-interstitial cells, while Ang II appeared in the granulosa but not in the thecal layer. Equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment increased Mas and ACE2 mRNA expression compared with control animals (3.3- and 2.1-fold increase, respectively; P < .05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme and NEP activities were lower, while PEP activity was higher in the eCG-treated rats (P < .05).

These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) branch formed by ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas, fully expressed in the rat ovary and regulated by gonadotropic hormones, could play a role in the ovarian physiology.","Pereira, Virgínia M.; Reis, Fernando M.; Santos, Robson A.

6777,6777,6777,Paradoxical worsening in tuberculosis during therapy in an HIV-infected patient,13.685202,8.186657,1996,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in oxidative stress and antioxidants in lung tissue under different tidal volume ventilation conditions. METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar rats were randomized into four groups, namely, group C, the control group, which was not ventilated, and groups C1, C2 and C3, the treatment groups, which were ventilated for 2 h with tidal volumes of 8, 30 and 42 ml/kg, respectively. The right middle lobe was assayed for malondialdehyde (MDA), the right posterior lobe was assayed using Western blotting for Nrf2, GCLm and SrX1 and the left lobe was assayed for Nrf2, GCLm and SrX1 mRNA. RESULTS: The MDA levels were increased in the three treatment groups, with MDA levels highest in group C3 and lowest in group C1 (C3 > C2 > C1) (all P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of Nrf2, GCLm and SrX1 was highest in group C3 and lowest in group 1 (C3 > C2 > C1) (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between group C1 and group C (P > 0.05). A Western blot analysis showed that Nrf2, GCLm and SrX1 expression was highest in group C3 and lowest in group C1 (C3 > C2 > C1) (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between group C1 and group C (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme levels in the lungs of rats were positively associated with the tidal volumes of mechanical ventilation, suggesting that higher tidal volumes cause more severe oxidative stress and increased antioxidant responses.","Sun, Zhen-Tao; Yang, Chun-Yao; Miao, Li-Jun; Zhang, Shan-Feng; Han, Xue-Ping; Ren, Su-En; Sun, Xue-Qing; Cao, Ya-Nan",J Anesth,2,1

A critical update,13.485853,7.899308,2012-12-07,"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is seen in people with a defect in cell-mediated immunity. Today the most common cause for this is the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). There have been some remarkable advances recently in the development of new drug regimens to combat this otherwise fatal infection. Although cotripoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is still the drug of first choice it cannot be tolerated by a significant proportion of patients, and therapies such as pentamidine (pentamidine-isethionate) [intravenous or nebulised], dapsone-trimethoprim, eflornithine (DFMO; difluoromethylornithine), trimetrexate, and clindamycin-primaquine are finding therapeutic niches. The major advantage in these other agents is not improved efficacy but different toxicity profiles, enabling therapy to be most appropriately tailored to individual patients’ conditions. Although the majority of patients should now survive an attack of PCP, relapses will occur if prophylaxis is not used: There is also the capacity to predict accurately which patients are at risk for this pneumonia and prevent it through the use of chemoprophylaxis. These advances in the treatment and prevention of PCP, together with anti-retro viral therapy, mean that this is an area of AIDS management that has resulted in improved long term survival.","Smith, Don; Gazzard, Brian G.",Drugs,2,1

We hypothesise that elevated exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels early after HSCT in children are predictive for pulmonary complications. The present prospective study included 30 children (age, 4–18 years) before HSCT. FeNO levels were evaluated 10 days before transplant, at day 0, day +28 and day +60 after HSCT. During the follow-up period until day +100, pulmonary complications and lung function were assessed. Before HSCT, the mean FeNO levels were comparable in children with or without post-transplant pulmonary complications. However, they differed at day 0 and day +28 with a mean of 7 (±1.95) and 13 (±3.44) ppb at day 0 and a mean of 13 (±3.44) and 14 (±3.57) ppb at day +28, respectively. Conclusion: Children with pulmonary complications after day +28 have higher mean FeNO levels 28 days after HSCT than children without later pulmonary complications. Therefore, FeNO could be an important diagnostic tool for hyperinflammatory response in bronchial epithelium after paediatric HSCT.","Fazekas, T.; Eickhoff, P.; Lawitschka, A.; Knotek, B.; Pötschger, U.; Peters, C.",Eur J Pediatr,2,1

There is increasing evidence that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) has a complex role in many diseases, particularly in infectious diseases. However, the relationship between MBL deficiency and cryptococcal meningitis has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between MBL polymorphism and non-HIV cryptococcal meningitis. Methods. A case-controlled genetic association study was conducted. Patients with cryptococcal meningitis and control subjects were genotyped for 6 alleles of MBL2 gene (H/L, Y/X, P/Q, A/D, A/B, and A/C). The distributions in allele frequency, genotypes, haplotypes, and genotype groups were compared between patients and control subjects. Results. Study participants included 103 HIV-uninfected patients with cryptococcal meningitis and 208 healthy control subjects, all of Chinese Han ethnicity. The homozygous mutative genotypes (O/O) of the coding region were associated with cryptococcal meningitis (P = .023; odds ratio [OR], 4.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11–19.88), the correlation more overt in immunocompetent patients (P = .005; OR, 6.65; 95% CI, 1.49–33.05). MBL-deficient participant group was associated with cryptococcal meningitis (P = .039; OR, 2.09; 95% CI, .96–4.51), particularly in immunocompetent patients (P = .028; OR, 2.51; 95% CI, .96–6.22). Conclusions. This is the first to show genotypes coding for MBL deficiency are associated with cryptococcal meningitis in nonimmunocompromised hosts.","Ou, Xue-Ting; Wu, Ji-Qin; Zhu, Li-Ping; Guan, Ming; Xu, Bin; Hu, Xiu-Ping; Wang, Xuan; Weng, Xin-Hua",J Infect Dis,2,1

Treatment with12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused cultured astrocytes to proliferate. This effect of TPA was blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in astrocyte proliferation. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E(2) blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E(2)-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E(2) was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E(2) polyclonal antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E(2) in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E(2) may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia.","Sawada, Makoto; Suzumura, Akio; Ohno, Kazushige; Marunouchi, Tohru",Brain Res,2,1

When exposed to inactivated pseudorabiesvirus (iPRV), plasmacytoid but not myeloid DCs released IFN-α and IL-12. Remarkably, both iPRV-pulsed DC types were able to induce primary IFN-γ producing T cells and IgG isotype switching in vivo. In contrast, tetanus toxoid pulsed DCs did not induce detectable primary immune responses. The efficacy of antiviral T and B cell priming proved dependent on the recipient's genotype.

Cell surface proteins are known to transmit signals that either accentuate or limit T-cell death after activation. This chapter will focus on the TNF-receptor family member OX40, which is expressed on effector T cells and when engaged greatly enhances survival of T cells leading to increased memory T-cell generation. Targeting OX40 in vivo can alter the fate of T-cell survival. Enhancing OX40 signaling during Ag priming through agonists increases memory T-cell development, while blocking OX40 signaling decreases the memory T-cell pool. These two opposing outcomes provide therapeutic tools for blocking inflammation in autoimmune conditions and enhancing immunity in hosts harboring cancer or chronic pathogens. OX40 agonists and antagonists are in the first stages of human clinical trials and their therapeutic potential will soon be realized.","Weinberg, Andrew D.",Memory T Cells,2,1

In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible λ pl promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series of targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction assay.","Trirawatanapong, Thaweesak; Chandran, Bala; Putnak, Robert; Padmanabhan, R.",Gene,2,1

Female dairy calves (n = 410) born from January to December 1990 in 18 commercial herds in New York state were used. Average daily gains during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd mo were 374, 596, and 719 g, respectively; average gain was 565 g during the 3-mo period. Average monthly height gains during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd mo were 4.4, 5.6, and 5.7 cm, respectively. Use of multiple linear regression, with farms treated as random effects, indicated that treated, verified pneumonia was associated with a reduction in average daily gain of 66 g and that failure of passive transfer reduced average daily gain by 48 g during the 1st mo. During the 2nd mo, neither disease nor failure of passive transfer affected average daily gain. During the 3rd mo, each additional week of pneumonia reduced average daily gain by 14 g, and umbilical infection reduced average daily gain by 96 g. Each additional week of diagnosed pneumonia reduced total BW gain during the first 3 mo by 0.8 kg. Similarly, each week of pneumonia reduced total height gain by 0.2 cm and failure of passive transfer by 0.9 cm. Prevention of chronic pneumonia and umbilical infection may improve average daily gain of calves.","Virtala, A.-M.K.; Mechor, G.D.; Gröhn, Y.T.; Erb, H.N.",J Dairy Sci,2,1

High genetic diversity among PRRSV strains is problematic for successful disease control by vaccination. Mosaic DNA and vaccinia (VACV) vaccines were developed in order to improve protection against heterologous PRRSV strains. Methods: Piglets were primed and boosted with GP5-Mosaic DNA vaccine and recombinant GP5-Mosaic VACV (rGP5-Mosaic VACV), respectively. Pigs vaccinated with rGP5-WT (VR2332) DNA and rGP5-WT VACV, or empty vector DNA and empty VACV respectively, served as controls. Virus challenge was given to separate groups of vaccinated pigs with VR2332 or MN184C. Necropsies were performed 14 days after challenge. Results: Vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic-based vaccines resulted in cellular reactivity and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies to both VR2332 and MN184C PRRSV strains. In contrast, vaccination of animals with the GP5-WT vaccines induced responses only to VR2332. Furthermore, vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic based vaccines resulted in protection against challenge with two heterologous virus strains, as demonstrated by the significantly lower viral loads in serum, tissues, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, and less severe lung lesions after challenge with either MN184C or VR2332, which have only 85% identity. In contrast, significant protection by the GP5-WT based vaccines was only achieved against the VR2332 strain. Conclusions: GP5-Mosaic vaccines, using a DNA-prime/VACV boost regimen, conferred protection in pigs against heterologous viruses.","Cui, Junru; O’Connell, Caitlin M.; Hagen, Connor; Sawicki, Kim; Smyth, Joan A.; Verardi, Paulo H.; Van Kruiningen, Herbert J.; Garmendia, Antonio E.",Vaccines (Basel),2,31

The purified peptides exerted an inhibitory action on mycelial growth in various fungal species. The antifungal activity of Brassica and mung bean nsLTPs were thermostable, pH‐stable, and stable after treatment with pepsin and trypsin. In contrast, the antifungal activity of mung bean chitinase was much less stable to changes in pH and temperature. Brassica LTP inhibited proliferation of hepatoma Hep G2 cells and breast cancer MCF 7 cells with an IC(50) of 5.8 and 1.6 µm, respectively, and the activity of HIV‐1 reverse transcriptase with an IC(50) of 4 µm. However, mung bean LTP and chitinase were devoid of antiproliferative and HIV‐1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities. In contrast to the mung bean LTP, which exhibited antibacterial activity, Brassica LTP was inactive. All three antifungal peptides lacked mitogenic activity toward splenocytes. These results indicate that the two LTPs have more desirable activities than the chitinase and that there is a dissociation between the antifungal and other activities of these antifungal proteins.

We find by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 protein (Lrrk2) specific for C-terminal residues 2511-2527 that an apparent full-length protein and several of its fractions are expressed in soluble extracts of normal human brain. By immunocytochemistry, the antibody recognizes neurons, and more weakly astrocytes and microglia, in normal brain tissue. It intensely labels Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. It also labels a subset of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease and the Parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam (PDCG). It labels thorn-shaped astrocytes and oligodendroglial coiled bodies in PDCG; oligodendroglial inclusions in multiple system atrophy; Pick bodies in Pick disease; nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions in Huntington disease; and intraneuronal and glial inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

We report their application to the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 virus (S-OIV). A database of all influenza A viruses, for which complete genome sequences were available in Genbank by October 2009, was created and dynamic programming was used to compute distances between all corresponding segments. A reassortment network was created to obtain the minimum cost evolutionary paths from all viruses to the exemplar S-OIV A/California/04/2009. This analysis took 35 hours on the Cray Extreme Multithreading (XMT) supercomputer, which has special hardware to permit efficient parallelization. Six specific H1N1/H1N2 bottleneck viruses were identified that almost always lie on minimum cost paths to S-OIV. We conjecture that these viruses are crucial to S-OIV evolution and worthy of careful study from a molecular biology viewpoint. In phylogenetics, ancestors are typically medians that have no functional constraints. In our method, ancestors are not inferred, but rather chosen from previously observed viruses along a path of mutation and reassortment leading to the target virus. This specificity and functional constraint render our results actionable for further experiments in vitro and in vivo.","Bokhari, Shahid H.; Pomeroy, Laura W.; Janies, Daniel A.",IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,2,1

After performing the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition on the PPG signal, a finite number of intrinsic mode functions are obtained. Then, these intrinsic mode functions are divided into two groups to perform the further analysis via both the independent component analysis and the non-negative matrix factorization. The surrogate cardiac signal related to the heart activity and another surrogate respiratory signal related to the respiratory activity are reconstructed to estimate the heart rate and the respiratory rate, respectively. Finally, different records of signals acquired from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database downloaded from the Physionet Automated Teller Machine (ATM) data bank are employed for demonstrating the outperformance of our proposed method. The results show that our proposed method outperforms both the digital filtering approach and the conventional empirical mode decomposition based methods in terms of reconstructing both the surrogate cardiac signal and the respiratory signal from the PPG signal as well as both achieving the higher accuracy and the higher reliability for estimating both the heart rate and the respiratory rate.","Lei, Ruisheng; Ling, Bingo Wing-Kuen; Feng, Peihua; Chen, Jinrong",Sensors (Basel),2,1

Our understanding of the origin and evolution of the pandemic has shifted considerably. We review evidence of the characteristic age-related pattern of death during the 1918 pandemic relative to the “original antigenic sin” hypothesis. We analyze age-stratified mortality data from Copenhagen around 1918 to identify break points associated with unusual death risk. Whereas infants had no meaningful risk elevation, death risk gradually increased, peaking for young adults 20–34 years of age before dropping sharply for adults ages 35–44 years, suggesting break points for birth cohorts around 1908 and 1878. Taken together with data from previous studies, there is strong evidence that those born before 1878 or after 1908 were not at increased risk of dying of 1918 pandemic influenza. Although the peak death risk coincided with the 1889–1892 pandemic, the 1908 and 1878 break points do not correspond with known pandemics. An increasing number of interdisciplinary studies covering fields such as virology, phylogenetics, death, and serology offer exciting insights into patterns and reasons for the unusual extreme 1918 pandemic mortality risk in young adults.","van Wijhe, Maarten; Ingholt, Mathias Mølbak; Andreasen, Viggo; Simonsen, Lone",Am J Epidemiol,2,22

As several pertussis cases seek care earlier, a clinical tool independent of cough duration may support earlier recognition. We developed a data-driven algorithm aimed at predicting a laboratory confirmed pertussis. METHODS: We enrolled children <12 months of age presenting with apnoea, paroxistic cough, whooping, or post-tussive vomiting, irrespective of the duration of cough. Patients underwent a RT-PCR test for pertussis and other viruses. Through a logistic regression model, we identified symptoms associated with laboratory confirmed pertussis. We then developed a predictive decision tree through Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm to predict laboratory confirmed pertussis. RESULTS: We enrolled 543 children, of which 160 had a positive RT-PCR for pertussis. A suspicion of pertussis by a physician (aOR 5.44) or a blood count showing leukocytosis and lymphocytosis (aOR 4.48) were highly predictive of lab confirmed pertussis. An algorithm including a suspicion of pertussis by a physician, whooping, cyanosis and absence of fever was accurate (79.9%) and specific (94.0%) and had high positive and negative predictive values (PPV 76.3% NPV 80.7%). CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm based on clinical symptoms, not including the duration of cough, is accurate and has high predictive values for lab confirmed pertussis. Such a tool may be useful in low resource settings where lab confirmation is unavailable, to guide differential diagnosis and clinical decisions. Algorithms may also be useful to improve surveillance for pertussis and anticipating classification of cases.","Tozzi, Alberto Eugenio; Gesualdo, Francesco; Rizzo, Caterina; Carloni, Emanuela; Russo, Luisa; Campagna, Ilaria; Villani, Alberto; Reale, Antonino; Concato, Carlo; Linardos, Giulia; Pandolfi, Elisabetta",PLoS One,2,1

One strategy to improve diet quality is through front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition labels. Taking advantage of an online grocery store, we allowed consumers to choose the FOP labels they preferred, and combined this information with real-time feedback on the overall nutritional quality of the shopping basket. We hypothesized that these dynamic food labels with real-time feedback (DFLF) would improve nutritional quality of food purchases. This trial followed a two-arm (no-label control and DFLF) crossover design with 125 participants exposed to each condition once in random order via an online grocery store. A first difference regression model allowed for estimating the unbiased effect of the DFLF on diet quality, measured by the weighted average Nutri-Score (ranging 1 to 5) per serving (primary) and changes in select nutrients and calories. The mean weighted Nutri-Score was 0.4 (12.6%) higher in the DFLF arm (CI: [0.2, 0.6]) relative to the control. The DFLF also decreased the amount of sugar per serving by 0.9 g (CI: [−1.7, −0.0]) and total sugar per shop by 169.5 g (CI: [−284.5, −54.5]). The DFLF features significantly improved nutrition quality relative to no labelling, as measured by average Nutri-Score values. These results shed light on the considerable potential of the online shopping environment to improve diet quality through customization and real time feedback.","Shin, Soye; van Dam, Rob M.; Finkelstein, Eric A.",Nutrients,2,1

In this open label randomized pilot study the effects of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on phosphatidylserine (PS) expression as marker of cellular oxidative damage (primary end point), and markers of hemolysis, coagulation and endothelial activation and NAC tolerability (secondary end points) were studied. Eleven consecutive patients (ten homozygous [HbSS] sickle cell patients, one HbSβ(0)-thalassemia patient) were randomly assigned to treatment with either 1,200 or 2,400 mg NAC daily during 6 weeks. The data indicate an increment in whole blood glutathione levels and a decrease in erythrocyte outer membrane phosphatidylserine exposure, plasma levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and cell-free hemoglobin after 6 weeks of NAC treatment in both dose groups. One patient did not tolerate the 2,400 mg dose and continued with the 1,200 mg dose. During the study period, none of the patients experienced painful crises or other significant SCD or NAC related complications.

It is well known that the dopamine (DA) transporter is its major target; but cocaine also acts on other targets including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In this study, we investigated the effects of cocaine on a special subtype of neuronal nAChR, α(3)β(4)-nAChR expressed in native SH-SY5Y cells. α(3)β(4)-nAChR-mediated currents were recorded using whole-cell recordings. Drugs were applied using a computer-controlled U-tube drug perfusion system. We showed that bath application of nicotine induced inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 20 µM. Pre-treatment with cocaine concentration-dependently inhibited nicotine-induced current with an IC(50) of 1.5 μM. Kinetic analysis showed that cocaine accelerated α(3)β(4)-nAChR desensitization, which caused a reduction of the amplitude of nicotine-induced currents. Co-application of nicotine and cocaine (1.5 μM) depressed the maximum response on the nicotine concentration-response curve without changing the EC(50) value, suggesting a non-competitive mechanism. The cocaine-induced inhibition of nicotine response exhibited both voltage- and use-dependence, suggesting an open-channel blocking mechanism. Furthermore, intracellular application of GDP-βS (via recording electrode) did not affect cocaine-induced inhibition, suggesting that cocaine did not alter receptor internalization. Moreover, intracellular application of cocaine (30 µM) failed to alter the nicotine response. Finally, cocaine (1.5 μM) was unable to inhibit the nicotine-induced inward current in heterologous expressed α(6)/α(3)β(2)β(3)-nAChRs and α(4)β(2)-nAChRs expressed in human SH-EP1 cells. Collectively, our results suggest that cocaine is a potent blocker for native α(3)β(4)-nAChRs expressed in SH-SY5Y cells.","Ma, Ze-gang; Jiang, Nan; Huang, Yuan-bing; Ma, Xiao-kuang; Brek Eaton, Jason; Gao, Ming; Chang, Yong-chang; Lukas, Ronald J; Whiteaker, Paul; Neisewander, Janet; Wu, Jie",Acta Pharmacol Sin,2,17

This double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study aimed to test the efficacy of this method for acute management of migraines. Methods: The patients received either active (0.4 mA, 140 Hz) or sham stimulation for 15 min over the visual cortex with the number of terminated attacks two hours post-stimulation as the primary endpoint, as a home therapy option. They were advised to treat a maximum of five migraine attacks over the course of six weeks. Results: From forty patients, twenty-five completed the study, sixteen in the active and nine in the sham group with a total of 102 treated migraine attacks. The percentage of terminated migraine attacks not requiring acute rescue medication was significantly higher in the active (21.5%) than in the sham group (0%), and the perceived pain after active stimulation was significantly less for 2–4 h post-stimulation than after sham stimulation. Conclusion: tACS over the visual cortex has the potential to terminate migraine attacks. Nevertheless, the high drop-out rate due to compliance problems suggests that this method is impeded by its complexity and time-consuming setup.","Antal, Andrea; Bischoff, Rebecca; Stephani, Caspar; Czesnik, Dirk; Klinker, Florian; Timäus, Charles; Chaieb, Leila; Paulus, Walter",Brain Sci,2,1

Delayed and missed diagnoses could potentiate health disparities in these populations. We evaluated whether population-based genomic screening could effectively identify individuals at risk for hATTR and prompt initiation of risk management. We identified participants of the BioMe Biobank in New York City who received TTR V142I results through a pilot genomic screening program. We performed a retrospective medical record review to evaluate for the presence hATTR-related systemic features, uptake of recommended follow-up, and short-term outcomes. Thirty-two AA (N = 17) and HL (N = 15) individuals received a TTR V142I result (median age 57, 81% female). None had a previous diagnosis of hATTR. Eighteen (56%) had hATTR-related systemic features, including 4 (13%) with heart failure, 10 (31%) with carpal tunnel syndrome, and 10 (31%) with spinal stenosis. Eighteen (56%) pursued follow-up with a cardiologist within 8 months. One person received a diagnosis of hATTR. Thus, we found that the majority of V142I-positive individuals had hATTR-related systemic features at the time of result disclosure, including well-described red flags. Genomic screening can help identify hATTR risk and guide management early on, avoiding potential delays in diagnosis and treatment.","Soper, Emily R.; Suckiel, Sabrina A.; Braganza, Giovanna T.; Kontorovich, Amy R.; Kenny, Eimear E.; Abul-Husn, Noura S.",J Pers Med,2,1

However, the mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this study, we identified the PB1 protein of H7N9 virus as a new negative regulator of virus- or poly(I:C)-stimulated IFN induction and specifically interacted with and destabilized MAVS. A subsequent study revealed that PB1 promoted E3 ligase RNF5 to catalyze K27-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS at Lys362 and Lys461. Moreover, we found that PB1 preferentially associated with a selective autophagic receptor neighbor of BRCA1 (NBR1) that recognizes ubiquitinated MAVS and delivers it to autophagosomes for degradation. The degradation cascade mediated by PB1 facilitates H7N9 virus infection by blocking the RIG-I-MAVS-mediated innate signaling pathway. Taken together, these data uncover a negative regulatory mechanism involving the PB1-RNF5-MAVS-NBR1 axis and provide insights into an evasion strategy employed by influenza virus that involves selective autophagy and innate signaling pathways.","Zeng, Yan; Xu, Shuai; Wei, Yanli; Zhang, Xuegang; Wang, Qian; Jia, Yane; Wang, Wanbing; Han, Lu; Chen, Zhaoshan; Wang, Zhengxiang; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Hualan; Lei, Cao-Qi; Zhu, Qiyun",PLoS Pathog,2,1

The development of vaccines against the human papillomavirus (HPV) has dramatically altered the landscape of cervical cancer prevention. As of mid-2020, 56 LMICs (41% of all LMICs) have initiated national HPV vaccination programs. This paper reviews the experience of LMICs that have introduced HPV vaccine into their national programs, key lessons learned, HPV vaccination sustainability and scale-up challenges, and future mitigation measures. As international guidance evolved and countries accumulated experience, strategies for national introduction shifted with regard to target groups, delivery site and timing, preparation and planning, communications and social mobilization, and ultimately monitoring, supervision and evaluation. Despite the successes that LMICs have been able to achieve in reaching large proportions of eligible girls, there are still considerable challenges countries encounter in overcoming rumors, reaching out-of-school girls, completing the vaccine series, estimating target populations, monitoring program performance, and assuring vaccination sustainability. New opportunities, such as the entry of additional vaccine manufacturers and ongoing studies to evaluate one-dose delivery, could help overcome the outstanding barriers to higher coverage and financial sustainability. Effective use of the experience to date and advances on the horizon could enable all LMICs to move towards the coverage levels that are needed to achieve eventual elimination.","Tsu, Vivien D.; LaMontagne, D.

The structure reveals the intimate assembly of THO revolving around its largest subunit Tho2. THO stabilizes a semi-open conformation of the Sub2 ATPase via interactions with Tho2. We show that THO interacts with the serine–arginine (SR)-like protein Gbp2 through both the RS domain and RRM domains of Gbp2. Cross-linking mass spectrometry analysis supports the extensive interactions between THO and Gbp2, further revealing that RRM domains of Gbp2 are in close proximity to the C-terminal domain of Tho2. We propose that THO serves as a landing pad to configure Gbp2 to facilitate its loading onto mRNP.","Xie, Yihu; Clarke, Bradley P; Kim, Yong Joon; Ivey, Austin L; Hill, Pate S; Shi, Yi; Ren, Yi",,2,1

The objective of this study is to investigate the changes of search-engine query patterns to monitor this phenomenon based on the tragic suicide of a young Chinese pop star, Kimi Qiao. Methods: The daily search volume for depression was retrieved from both the Baidu Index (BDI) and the Sina MicroBlog Index (SMI). Besides, the daily BDI for suicide, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, common cold, stomach cancer, and liver cancer were collected for comparison. According to the time of Qiao's suicide, all data were divided into two periods (i.e., Period One from 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016 while Period Two ranged from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017). The paired t-test was used to compare the differences in search volumes between two periods. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to estimate correlations between the BDI and SMI for depression. Results: The average BDI for depression, BDI for suicide, and SMI for depression in Period Two were significantly higher than in Period One (p < 0.05). There was a strong positive correlation between the BDI and SMI for depression (r = 0.97, p < 0.001). And no significant difference in BDI for other diseases between the two periods was found. Conclusions: The changes of search-engine query patterns indicated that the celebrity's suicide might be able to improve the netizens' concern about depression in China. The study suggests publishing more practical knowledge and advice on depression through the Internet and social media, to improve the public's mental health literacy and help people to cope with their depressive symptoms appropriately.","Yu, Hong-Zhang; Fu, Tian; Zhou, Jia-Nan; Ke, Ping; Wang, Yun-Xia",Front Psychiatry,2,22

CIRCI may alter cardiac and vascular functions. Weaning-induced pulmonary oedema (WiPO) is a major mechanism of weaning failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CIRCI in patients with difficult ventilator weaning and its possible relation with WiPO. METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted in the intensive care of a university hospital in France. Patients under MV for more than 24 h, meeting weaning criteria and having failed the first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) underwent a corticotropin stimulation test, with assessment of total blood cortisol levels immediately before (T(0)) 0.25 mg iv of tetracosactrin and 30 and 60 min afterward. Δ(max) was defined as the difference between the maximal value after the test and T(0). CIRCI was defined as T(0) < 10 μg/dL (276 nmol/L) and/or Δ(max) < 9 μg/dL (248 nmol/L) and inadequate adrenal reserve as Δ(max) < 9 μg/dL. Biomarkers (natriuretic peptide and protidemia) sampling and echocardiograms were performed during the second SBT and were used to diagnose WiPO, which was defined according to two definitions (one liberal and one conservative) derived from recent publications on the topic. Successful extubation was defined as patient alive without reintubation 7 days after extubation. A competing risk analysis was used to assess extubation failure and mortality. RESULTS: Seventy-six consecutive patients (63 ± 14 years; 49 men) with difficult weaning were enrolled. CIRCI and inadequate adrenal reserve occurred in 25 (33%) and 17 (22%) patients, respectively. The probability of successful extubation was significantly decreased in patients with CIRCI or inadequate adrenal reserve, as compared to their counterparts, and this association persisted after adjustment on severity (SOFA score at first SBT). WiPO occurred in 44 (58%) and 8 (11%) patients, according to the liberal and conservative definition, respectively. WiPO was not associated with CIRCI nor with inadequate adrenal reserve. CONCLUSION: CIRCI was common during difficult weaning and was associated with its prolongation. We did not find a significant association between CIRCI and WiPO.

The noncoding regulatory microRNAs has recently emerged as a completely novel approach to the study of the RAS. A growing number of microRNAs serve as mediators and/or regulators of RAS-induced cardiac remodelling by directly targeting RAS enzymes, receptors, signalling molecules, or inhibitors of signalling pathways. Specifically, microRNAs that directly modulate pro-hypertrophic, pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory signalling initiated by angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) stimulation are of particular relevance in mediating the cardiovascular effects of the RAS. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge in the field that is still in the early stage of preclinical investigation with occasionally conflicting reports. Understanding the big picture of microRNAs not only aids in the improved understanding of cardiac response to injury but also leads to better therapeutic strategies utilizing microRNAs as biomarkers, therapeutic agents and pharmacological targets","Adamcova, Michaela; Kawano, Ippei; Simko, Fedor",Int J Mol Sci,2,8

Both sufficient sleep quantity and quality are needed for optimal health, particularly among older adults, but access to sleep care can be difficult. This study examined the efficacy of a six-week sleep behavior change program designed for older adults that was delivered virtually by health educators. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This quasi-experimental pilot study (intervention n = 22; control n = 31) explored the effects of the Sleep Education for Elders Program (SLEEP) on sleep outcomes, which included: 1) sleep quality, measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); 2) sleep duration, extracted from the PSQI; 3) insomnia symptoms, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index; 4) sleep hygiene behaviors, obtained from the Sleep Hygiene Index; and 5) excessive daytime sleepiness, measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. RESULTS: After SLEEP, the intervention group experienced significantly improved sleep quality (p < 0.001), a reduction in maladaptive sleep hygiene behaviors (p = 0.007), and reduced daytime sleepiness (p < 0.027) compared to the control group. Effect sizes for all five sleep measures were medium or large. In the intervention group, all changes were judged to be clinically meaningful (≥ 0.5 SD) except for improvements in daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSION: These data support the efficacy of a group-based, virtual behavior change intervention in improving sleep outcomes among older adults.","Tucker, Robin M; Contreras, Dawn A; Carlson, Breanne R; Carter, Anita; Drake, Christopher L",Nat Sci Sleep,2,31

As virtual libraries continue to grow (in excess of 10(8) molecules), so too do the resources necessary to conduct exhaustive virtual screening campaigns on these libraries. However, Bayesian optimization techniques, previously employed in other scientific discovery problems, can aid in their exploration: a surrogate structure–property relationship model trained on the predicted affinities of a subset of the library can be applied to the remaining library members, allowing the least promising compounds to be excluded from evaluation. In this study, we explore the application of these techniques to computational docking datasets and assess the impact of surrogate model architecture, acquisition function, and acquisition batch size on optimization performance. We observe significant reductions in computational costs; for example, using a directed-message passing neural network we can identify 94.8% or 89.3% of the top-50 000 ligands in a 100M member library after testing only 2.4% of candidate ligands using an upper confidence bound or greedy acquisition strategy, respectively. Such model-guided searches mitigate the increasing computational costs of screening increasingly large virtual libraries and can accelerate high-throughput virtual screening campaigns with applications beyond docking.","Graff, David E.; Shakhnovich, Eugene I.; Coley, Connor W.",,2,1

Data are abundant for some aspects of the signaling pathways within cells while other casual mechanisms have not been adequately addressed. From an evolutionary perspective, eukaryotic cells are equipped with a set of interrelated endomembrane systems consisting of intracellular organelles and secretory vesicles. Of these, exosomes are touted as cargo-laden secretory vesicles that originate from the endosomal multivesicular machinery which participate in a mutual cross-talk at different cellular interfaces. It has been documented that cells transfer various biomolecules and genetic elements through exosomes to sites remote from the original cell in a paracrine manner. Findings related to the molecular mechanisms between melatonin and exosomal biogenesis and cargo sorting are the subject of the current review. The clarification of the interplay between melatonin and exosome biogenesis and cargo sorting at the molecular level will help to define a cell’s secretion capacity. This review precisely addresses the role and potential significance of melatonin in determining the efflux capacity of cells via the exosomal pathway. Certain cells, for example, stem cells actively increase exosome efflux in response to melatonin treatment which accelerates tissue regeneration after transplantation into the injured sites.","Amini, Hassan; Rezabakhsh, Aysa; Heidarzadeh, Morteza; Hassanpour, Mehdi; Hashemzadeh, Shahriar; Ghaderi, Shahrouz; Sokullu, Emel; Rahbarghazi, Reza; Reiter, Russel J.",Front Cell Dev Biol,2,1

Our group developed a novel technique to remove the subglottic secretions, the rapid-flow expulsion maneuver (RFEM). The objective of this study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of RFEM compared with SSD. METHODS: This study was a single-center, prospective, randomized and controlled trial, conducted at Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, a university-affiliated tertiary hospital. The primary outcome was the incidence of VAP, assessed for non-inferiority. RESULTS: Patients with an endotracheal tube allowing drainage of subglottic secretions (n = 241) were randomly assigned to either the RFEM group (n = 120) or SSD group (n = 121). Eleven patients (9.17%) in the RFEM group and 13 (10.74%) in the SSD group developed VAP (difference, − 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] [− 9.20 6.03]), as the upper limit of 95% CI was not greater than the pre-defined non-inferiority limit (10%), RFEM was declared non-inferior to SSD. There were no statistically significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU mortality, or ICU length of stay and costs between groups. In terms of safety, no accidental extubation or maneuver-related barotrauma occurred in the RFEM group. The incidence of post-extubation laryngeal edema and reintubation was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: RFEM is effective and safe, with non-inferiority compared to SSD in terms of the incidence of VAP. RFEM could be an alternative method in first-line treatment of respiratory ICU patients.

METHODS: Meteorological data (air temperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, hours of sunlight, wind speed and relative humidity) for Shenmu County and medical data from hospitalized patients aged ≤16 years were collected between January 2009 and December 2012. The association between meteorological factors and rate of hospitalization due to lower respiratory tract infections was investigated; the total hospitalization rate was compared with the rate of lower respiratory tract disease-related hospitalizations. RESULTS: The leading bacterial causes of lower respiratory tract infections were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B; the main viral cause was respiratory syncytial virus. Lower respiratory tract infection hospitalization rate was significantly correlated with air temperature (R = −0.651), atmospheric pressure (R = 0.560), rainfall (R = −0.614) and relative humidity (R = −0.470), but not with hours of sunlight (R = −0.210) or wind speed (R = 0.258). Using multiple linear regression, lower respiratory tract infection hospitalization rate decreased with a gradual increase in air temperature (F = 38.30) and relative humidity (F = 15.58).

The body’s response to different physicochemical factors has also been influenced by the proper assimilation of bioactive compounds contained in the food that is ingested. Oxidative stress is one of the major factors that directly affects the functioning of the human microbiota. The body’s reaction to this imbalance is crucial to the progression of inflammatory processes, which are based on molecular mechanisms. Microbial dysbiosis can result in a possibly permanent alteration in the physiological response. This review aims to highlight recent contributions made to alleviating human dysbiosis in degenerative diseases, especially for neurodegenerative pathologies based on the rising prevalence of obesity. We discuss the significance of both microbiota modulation and possible alleviations of pathologies by a modulatory function. We argue that pre- and probiotics (including phenolic compounds stimulating the favorable strain from the microbiota) are an effective alternative that can support the microbiota pattern’s modulation over time and the attenuation of indirect causes that determine dysbiosis. Molecular aspects are presented in support of the modulating role of the microbiota following the use of probiotics.","Vamanu, Emanuel; Rai, Sachchida Nand",Diseases,2,1

Evidence supports the effectiveness of the resilience-building JoyPop app in improving resilience-related outcomes after use; however, experiential data from users is also needed to provide a more comprehensive account of its utility. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore users’ experiences with the JoyPop app and their perspectives on its utility. METHODS: This qualitative description study involved a combination of group and one-on-one semistructured interviews with a subset of first-year undergraduate students who participated in a larger evaluation of the JoyPop app. Participants used the app for a 4-week period and were subsequently asked about their frequency of app use, most and least used features (and associated reasons), most and least helpful features (and associated reasons), barriers to use, facilitators of use and continuation, and recommendations for improvement. Data were coded and categorized through inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The sample of 30 participants included 24 females and 6 males, with a mean age of 18.77 years (SD 2.30). App use ranged from 1 to 5 times daily (mean 2.11, SD 0.74), with the majority indicating that they used the app at least twice daily. The Rate My Mood, Journal, and SquareMoves features were reported to be used most often, while the Rate My Mood, Journal, and Breathing Exercises features were identified as the most helpful. A number of themes and subthemes pertaining to facilitators of app use (prompts, creating routine, self-monitoring opportunities, expressive opportunities), barriers to app use (editing, lack of variety, student lifestyle), outcomes of app use (increased awareness, checking in with oneself, helpful distraction, emotional control), and recommendations for app improvement (adding more features, enhancing existing features, enhancing tracking abilities, providing personalization) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the aspects of the JoyPop app that motivated and benefitted users, as well as measures that can be taken to improve user experiences and promote longer-term uptake.

To solve above problems, a dynamic gesture recognition model based on CBAM-C3D is proposed. Key frame extraction technology, multimodal joint training, and network optimization with BN layer are used for making the network performance better.

PRRSV infection skews macrophage polarization toward an M2 phenotype, followed by T-cells inactivation. CD163, one of the scavenger receptors of M2 macrophages, has been described as a putative receptor for PRRSV. In this study, we examined two types of PRRSV-2-derived recombinant antigens, A1 (g6Ld10T) and A2 (lipo-M5Nt), for their ability to mediate PAM polarization and T helper (Th1) response. A1 and A2 were composed of different combination of ORF5, ORF6, and ORF7 in full or partial length. To enhance the adaptive immunity, they were conjugated with T cells epitopes or lipidated elements, respectively. Our results showed that CD163(+) expression on PAMs significantly decreased after being challenged with A1 but not A2, followed by a significant increase in pro-inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12). In addition, next generation sequencing (NGS) data show an increase in T-cell receptor signaling in PAMs challenged with A1. Using a co-culture system, PAMs challenged with A1 can induce Th1 activation by boosting IFN-γ and IL-12 secretion and TNF-α expression. In terms of innate and T-cell-mediated immunity, we conclude that A1 is regarded as a potential vaccine for immunization against PRRSV infection due to its ability to reverse the polarization status of PAMs toward pro-inflammatory phenotypes, which in turn reduces CD163 expression for viral entry and increases immunomodulation for Th1-type response.","Wahyuningtyas, Rika; Lai, Yin-Siew; Wu, Mei-Li; Chen, Hsin-Wei; Chung, Wen-Bin; Chaung, Hso-Chi; Chang, Ko-Tung",Vaccines (Basel),2,1

In consideration of the lack of availability and dynamics of classroom teaching data, fuzzy numbers are used to describe the probability of underlying events. In addition, the top event probability of the fuzzy fault tree is calculated by the double-layer Monte Carlo method (MCM), which analyzes the classroom teaching effect based on the fuzzy fault tree reasonable.

The current systematic review synthesized evidence on the characteristics, effectiveness and acceptability of behavioral activation (BA) to examine its role as a potential ‘active ingredient’ for alleviating depression and anxiety among young people aged 14 to 24 years. METHODS: Evidence across the following sources were synthesized: (i) randomized control trials (RCT) evaluating interventions where BA has been used as a standalone intervention or as part of a multicomponent intervention, (ii) qualitative studies examining the acceptability of BA as an intervention or as a coping strategy among young people with lived experiences. Consultations with a youth advisory group (YAG) from India were used to draw inferences from existing evidence and identify future research priorities. RESULTS: As part of the review, 23 RCTs were identified; three studies examined BA as a standalone intervention, and the remaining studies examined multicomponent intervention where BA was a constituent element. The intervention protocols varied in composition, with the number of intervention elements ranging between 5 to 18. There was promising but limited evidence in standalone interventions for thse effectiveness of BA for depression. The impact of BA in multicomponent interventions was difficult to evaluate in the absence of focal assessment of activation outcomes. Evidence from 37 additional qualitative studies of youth lived experience literature, corroborated by the YAG inputs, indicated that young people preferred using behavioral strategies similar to BA to cope with depression in their own life. Themes indicated that the activities that are important to an individual and their socio-contextual factors need to be considered in the planning and implementing BA intervention. Evidence for the use of BA in anxiety was limited across data sources. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was preliminary empirical evidence for the effectiveness and acceptability of BA for youth depression. Further research is needed to examine the components and mechanisms that contribute to its effectiveness as an active intervention ingredient for depression and anxiety.

METHODS: Neonates <31 weeks’ gestation were randomized to either an ECG-displayed or an ECG-blinded HR assessment in the DR. HR, oxygen saturation, resuscitation interventions, and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS: During the study period, 51 neonates were enrolled. The mean gestational age in both groups was 28 ± 2 weeks. The time to stabilization, defined as the time from birth to achieve HR ≥100 b.p.m., as well as oxygen saturation within goal range, was not different between the ECG-displayed and the ECG-blinded groups [360 (269, 435) vs 345 (240, 475) s, p = 1.00]. There was also no difference in the time to HR ≥100 b.p.m. [100 (75, 228) vs 138 (88, 220) s, p = 0.40] or duration of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) [345 (120, 558) vs 196 (150, 273) s, p = 0.36]. Clinical outcomes were also similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although feasible and safe, the use of ECG in the DR during preterm resuscitation did not reduce time to stabilization. IMPACT: Although feasible and apparently safe, routine use of the ECG in the DR did not decrease time to HR >100 b.p.m., time to stabilization, or use of resuscitation interventions such as PPV for preterm infants <31 weeks’ gestational age. This article adds to the limited randomized controlled trial evidence regarding the impact of routine use of ECG during preterm resuscitation on DR clinical outcomes. Such evidence is important when considering recommendations for routine use of the ECG in the DR worldwide as such a recommendation comes with a significant cost burden.","Abbey, Natalia V.; Mashruwala, Vaishali; Weydig, Heather M.; Steven Brown, L.; Ramon, Emma L.; Ibrahim, John; Mir, Imran N.; Wyckoff, Myra H.; Kapadia, Vishal",Pediatr Res,2,27

It is of particular interest, because it was the first synthetic nucleoside to exhibit broad spectrum antiviral activity, and it is one of few antiviral drugs in clinical use effective against agents other than HIV and herpesviruses [43]. It inhibits the replication of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses in vitro, including orthomyxo, paramyxo, arena, bunya, flavi, herpes, adeno, pox, and retroviruses [49]. In current clinical practice, ribavirin is commonly used for certain viral infections (Table 19-1). Most notably, it is used in combination with interferon-α for treatment of HCV infection [66]. Ribavirin aerosol is used for treatment of pediatric infection by respiratory syncytial virus [19]. It is the only antiviral drug that could be also used in viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes. Besides Crimean- Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), it is used in Lassa fever [70]. Viruses in the Bunyaviridae family are generally sensitive to ribavirin [92]. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 242 patients with serologically confirmed Hantaan virus in the People’s Republic of China found a sevenfold decrease in mortality among ribavirin-treated patients [54], other studies did not confirm these benefits. Ribavirin was found to be effective against CCHF virus (CCHFV) in vitro [99, 104].","Ergonul, Onder; Mirazimi, Ali; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.",Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever,2,1

This trend has resulted in an increase in intensive care unit (ICU) utilization across this population [1]. Acute respiratory failure is the most frequent medical complication leading to critical illness in oncologic patients [2–4]. Historically, there had been a reluctance to admit cancer patients to the ICU given their poor outcomes, particularly in the setting of hematologic malignancy and invasive mechanical ventilation [5]. ICU treatment limitations or refusal of admission was advocated [6]. Major advances in oncologic care, critical care and more meticulous attention to where the conditions overlap, have resulted in marked improvement in short-term survival in this population [1, 7, 8]. Despite these major advances, acute respiratory failure in this population remains complex with unique challenges surrounding diagnosis and management compared to the general ICU population. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of acute respiratory failure in the oncologic population and highlights specific considerations for the intensivist. We will focus on the important differences between the immunocompromised oncologic patient and general intensive care population, the spectrum of causes of acute respiratory failure with a specific focus on toxicities related to newer cancer therapies, diagnostic approach, management and an up-to-date overview of prognosis.","Ferreyro, B.

The term sepsis is a poorly defined, but commonly used term in the medical literature, and it is derived from the Greek word “Sépsis” meaning decay. Sepsis is best defined as a life-threatening condition or complex caused by overwhelming inflammatory response to infection associated with dysregulation of the body's immune mechanism. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients in most intensive care units (ICUs). It has been estimated that in the United States sepsis develops in 750,000 people annually, and more then 210,000 of those die(1,2)! Infants and children in >42,000 cases of severe sepsis occur annually in the United States and millions worldwide.(2) The incidence of septicemia and sepsis have been increasing in the past 3 decades in many countries because of several factors, including longer lifespan with a greater population of the elderly; treatment with immunosuppressives with a greater number of subjects with organ transplantations and cancers; use of invasive and novel treatment with prosthesis, long-term or permanent catheters; and the expanding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. In national hospital discharge surveys in the United States, the incidence of septicemia had increased from 73.6 per 100,000 patients in 1979 to 175.9 per 100,000 patients in 1987.(3) Surveys in the United States and Europe have estimated that severe sepsis accounts for 2–11& of all admission to hospital or ICUs.(1) Observational studies indicate that 30–50& of the cases are admitted through the emergency department, rather than developing in hospitals.(4,5) The incidence of sepsis appears to continue to increase by 8.7& annually (with an adjusted rate of increase of nearly 300& from 1979 to 2000),(6) but may be greater in the United States (US) with an incidence of 240–300 per 100,000 populations, compared to some European countries (Austria, Germany) with rates of 54–116 per 100,000 population.(7) Despite progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, the mortality rate is still high (in those with severe sepsis and septic shock). Although the mortality rate overall has fallen in the United States from 27.8& to 17.9& in septic patients over 2 decades, the mortality rate was 30& in those with any organ failure and 70& in those with multiple organ failure.(6) Patients with infections and severe sepsis require prolonged stay in ICU and hospital, resulting in increase health care costs. Estimates of direct costs per sepsis patient in the United States are about $50,000 whereas European costs are lower, $26,450–33,350.(7) Thus a crude estimate of the direct annual cost of severe sepsis in the United States is about $17.0 billion.(1)",,Emerging Issues and Controversies in Infectious Disease,2,11

Consequently, consensus and guidance are used to a great extent. Surgery opens into sterile tissues for hours, where there is massive tissue damage by knife, diathermy, clogging of vessels, pressure against and drying of tissues, decreased blood supply, impaired phagocytosis and impaired infection defence. Microbes deposited in this devitalized tissues may find a good basis for growth and proliferation if there is lack of infection control and sterility.

More recently, the global spread of highly pathogenic bird-adapted strain H5N1 is considered a significant pandemic threat. Since 2003, a total of 379 cases and 239 deaths have been reported. This chapter provides an overview of the genetic characteristics of the virus that elucidate its ability to continuously evade a host’s immune system; it describes some of the approaches used to quantify the burden of influenza and discusses their implications for the prevention and containment of future pandemics. The preliminary findings of the studies discussed here suggest that influenza-related burden is highly underestimated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This implicates that proper assessment of influenza-related morbidity and mortality worldwide is essential in planning and allocating resources to protect against what could be one of mankind’s most devastating challenges. A summary of learned lessons from past influenza pandemics are described and new intervention strategies aim at curtailing a future pandemic are discussed.

First, the common cold is a benign self-limiting condition, making the consumption of ‘harmless’ antivirals a requisite of prime importance for regulators. Second, the common cold is a syndrome caused by a myriad of known and unknown agents, which reduces the effectiveness of compounds that interfere with single specific agents or types of agents. The multifactorial nature of the genesis of colds makes it difficult for compounds showing in vitro efficacy to ‘make the jump’ to field effectiveness. Last, despite the heavy burden that the cold imposes on society, the vagueness and shortness of symptoms make it difficult for sufferers to present in time for physicians to prescribe antivirals, which are only effective if taken within a short time frame.

In a cancer patient, unique etiologies such as myeloproliferative disorders, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or tumor emboli may result in PH. Early recognition and treatment of the causative condition may reverse acute PH or return chronic PH to its baseline status. Progression of the disease or its decompensation due to infection, a thromboembolic event, or other triggers can lead to admission to an intensive care unit.

We introduce a novel mechanism, the Topic-Word Attention (TWA), that generates document representations based on the interplay between word and topic representations. We train these word and topic vectors through our general model, Inductive Document Network Embedding (IDNE), by leveraging the connections in the document network. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various networks and we qualitatively show that our model produces meaningful and interpretable representations of the words, topics and documents.","Brochier, Robin; Guille, Adrien; Velcin, Julien",Advances in Information Retrieval,2,1

Acute gastroenteritis is a very common diagnosis in pediatric practices. It is usually a clinical diagnosis. Its most common symptoms are acute vomiting and diarrhea. The most important acute complication of gastroenteritis is dehydration, which occurs when the child's overall output of fluid exceeds input. Insensible water loss is the volume of fluid that leaves the body as a result of the difference in vapor pressure between the skin and lung surfaces and the surrounding atmosphere. The small intestine is the organ principally affected in most children by gastroenteritis but the stomach and colon may also be involved to a varying extent. Most often acute gastroenteritis is a self-limiting illness and may result in full recovery after 24 hours.","Walker-Smith, John",Diseases of the Small Intestine in Childhood,2,19

This review highlights that intrinsically disordered protein antigens, which lack an ordered three‐dimensional structure, represent excellent starting points for the development of such vaccines. Disordered proteins represent an important class of antigen in a wide range of human pathogens, and, contrary to widespread belief, they are frequently targets of protective antibody responses. Importantly, disordered epitopes appear invariably to be linear epitopes, rendering them ideally suited to incorporation into a peptide vaccine. Nonetheless, the conformational properties of disordered antigens, and hence their recognition by antibodies, frequently depend on the interactions they make and the context in which they are presented to the immune system. These effects must be considered in the design of an effective vaccine. Here we discuss these issues and propose design principles that may facilitate the development of peptide vaccines targeting disordered antigens.","MacRaild, Christopher A.; Seow, Jeffrey; Das, Sreedam C.; Norton, Raymond S.",Pept Sci (Hoboken),2,1

The range of possible manipulating positions of the agents is restricted to some rectangle on the two-dimensional coordinate space, within the feasible area of positions of alternatives and agents. The preferences of agents are assumed to be linear orders, constructed by the proximity of the alternatives to the agents, ordered according to Euclidean distance. The computer calculations, using Monte-Carlo simulations has been performed for 3, 4, and 5 alternatives and for even number of agents from 4 to 20. 100 thousands profiles were generated for each number of alternatives – number of agents case.

We therefore sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a C-reactive protein-based protocol in reducing antibiotic treatment time in critically ill patients. METHODS: A randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial conducted in two intensive care units of a university hospital in Brazil. Critically ill infected adult patients were randomly allocated to (i) intervention to receive antibiotics guided by daily monitoring of CRP levels and (ii) control to receive antibiotics according to the best practices for rational use of antibiotics. RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were included in the CRP (n = 64) and control (n = 66) groups. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median duration of antibiotic therapy for the index infectious episode was 7.0 (5.0–8.8) days in the CRP and 7.0 (7.0–11.3) days in the control (p = 0.011) groups. A significant difference in the treatment time between the two groups was identified in the curve of cumulative suspension of antibiotics, with less exposure in the CRP group only for the index infection episode (p = 0.007). In the per protocol analysis, involving 59 patients in each group, the median duration of antibiotic treatment was 6.0 (5.0–8.0) days for the CRP and 7.0 (7.0–10.0) days for the control (p = 0.011) groups. There was no between-group difference regarding the total days of antibiotic exposure and antibiotic-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Daily monitoring of CRP levels may allow early interruption of antibiotic therapy in a higher proportion of patients, without an effect on total antibiotic consumption.

However, creating this association is a time consuming process and requires substantial instructor effort. In this study, we present the results of crowdsourcing valuable insights into the underlying concepts of problems in mathematics and English writing, as a first step in leveraging the crowd to expedite the task of generating KCs. We presented crowdworkers with two problems in each domain and asked them to provide three explanations about why one problem is more challenging than the other. These explanations were then independently analyzed through (1) a series of qualitative coding methods and (2) several topic modeling techniques, to compare how they might assist in extracting KCs and other insights from the participant contributions. Results of our qualitative coding showed that crowdworkers were able to generate KCs that approximately matched those generated by domain experts. At the same time, the topic models’ outputs were evaluated against both the domain expert generated KCs and the results of the previous coding to determine effectiveness. Ultimately we found that while the topic modeling was not up to parity with the qualitative coding methods, it did assist in identifying useful clusters of explanations. This work demonstrates a method to leverage both the crowd’s knowledge and topic modeling to assist in the process of generating KCs for assessment items.","Moore, Steven; Nguyen, Huy A.; Stamper, John",Artificial Intelligence in Education,2,17

As an application, we consider the problem of computing unique strategy functions from Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs) and Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBFs). Experiments with a prototype implementation demonstrate that functions can be efficiently extracted from formulas in standard benchmark sets, and that many of these definitions remain undetected by syntactic gate detection. We turn this into a preprocessing technique by substituting unique strategy functions for input variables and test solver performance on the resulting instances. Compared to syntactic gate detection, we see a significant increase in the number of solved QBF instances, as well as a modest increase for DQBF instances.","Slivovsky, Friedrich",Computer Aided Verification,2,1

Our objective was to investigate associations between variants in genes of vitamin D pathway with serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), atopy, asthma and asthma severity in teenagers from Northeast Brazil. METHODS: This is a cross sectional study nested in a cohort population of asthma. 25(OH)D was quantified from 968 of 11–17 years old individuals by ELISA. Asthma diagnosis was obtained by using the ISAAC Phase III questionnaire. Specific IgE was determined by ImmunoCAP; genotyping was performed using the 2.5 HumanOmni Biochip from Illumina. Statistical analyses were performed in PLINK 1.07 and SPSS 22.1. RESULTS: After quality control, 104 Single Nucleotides Variants (SNVs) in vitamin D pathway genes, typed in 792 individuals, were included in the analysis. The allele A of rs10875694 on VDR was positively associated with atopy (OR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.01–1.81). The allele C of rs9279 on VDR, was negatively associated with asthma risk (OR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.45–0.97), vitamin D insufficiency (OR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.70–0.96) and higher VDR expression.

As a result, two mediate models were created to explain how parent–child attachment affects self-injury behavior. Negative emotion and emotional coping style play serial mediating roles in mother–child and father–child attachment models, respectively. The results show that negative emotion mediates between self-injury behavior and both father–child and mother–child attachment, while emotional coping style only functions between father–child attachment and self-injury behavior. By means of bootstrap analysis, negative emotion and emotional coping style have serial mediating roles concerning the impact of parent–child attachment on self-injury behavior. By comparison, the father–child and mother–child attachment have different mediating models: the former relies on emotional coping style, while the latter is associated with emotional experiences. This implies that parent–child attachment has different mechanisms in triggering self-injury behavior, which is in line with the hypothesis of attachment specificity.","Tao, Yun; Bi, Xiao-Yan; Deng, Min",Front Psychol,2,1

Here, we report an in silico approach to investigate the binding of pyrazoloquinolinones (PQs) that mediate allosteric effects through the extracellular α+/β- interface of GABA(A) receptors. First, we docked a potent prototype of PQs into the α1+/β3- site of a homology model of the human α1β3γ2 subtype of the GABA(A) receptor. Next, for each docking pose, we computationally derived protein-ligand complexes for 18 PQ analogs with known experimental potency. Subsequently, binding energy was calculated for all complexes using the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area method. Finally, docking poses were quantitatively assessed in the light of experimental data to derive a binding hypothesis. Collectively, the results indicate that PQs at the α1+/β3- site likely exhibit a common binding mode that can be characterized by a hydrogen bond interaction with β3Q64 and hydrophobic interactions involving residues α1F99, β3Y62, β3M115, α1Y159, and α1Y209. Importantly, our results are in good agreement with the recently resolved cryo-Electron Microscopy structures of the human α1β3γ2 and α1β2γ2 subtypes of GABA(A) receptors.","Singh, Natesh; Villoutreix, Bruno O.",Front Pharmacol,2,1

It is challenging and confusing for the clinicians to make the decision of the febrile neutropenic patients under chemotherapy to be monitored at intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study was to define the factors supporting decision-making for the critical patients with febrile neutropenia. METHODS: The data of 60 patients, who were taken to the ICU while they were under treatment in the Hematology Clinic with a diagnosis of febrile neutropenia, were analyzed retrospectively, in order to identify clinically useful prognostic parameters. RESULTS: The ICU mortality rate was 80%. Mortality was significantly associated with higher sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA), quick sequential organ failure assessment score (qSOFA), and hematological SOFA (SOFAhem) scores on admission. All cases having SOFA score 10 and above and qSOFA score 2 and above died. In multivariate analysis, qSOFA score was found to be statistically significant in predicting mortality in regard to ICU admission (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Mortality of febrile neutropenic patients admitted to ICU is high. It would be appropriate to determine the extent of organ dysfunction instead of underlying disease, for making the decision of ICU admission. It should be noticed that the risk mortality is high for the FN cases with SOFA score 10 or above, qSOFA score 2 or above, and in need of mechanical ventilation and positive inotropic support; hence, early intervention is recommended. In our study, the most significant parameter in predicting ICU mortality was found to be qSOFA.","Cetintepe, Tugba; Cetintepe, Lutfi; Solmaz, Serife; Calık, Sebnem; Ugur, Mehmet Can; Gediz, Fusun; Bilgir, Oktay",Support Care Cancer,2,1

Existing evidence suggests success rates for CPR in COVID-19 patients is low and the risk to healthcare professionals from this aerosol-generating procedure complicates the benefit/harm balance of CPR. METHODS: The study is based at a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom where all DNACPR decisions are documented on an electronic healthcare record (EHR). Data from all DNACPR/TEAL status forms between 1st January 2017 and 30th April 2020 were collected and analysed. We compared patterns of decision making and rates of form completion during the 2-month peak pandemic phase to an analogous period during 2019. RESULTS: A total of 16,007 forms were completed during the study period with a marked increase in form completion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with a form completed were on average younger and had fewer co-morbidities during the COVID-19 period than in March-April 2019. Several questions on the DNACPR/TEAL forms were answered significantly differently with increases in patients being identified as suitable for CPR (23.8% versus 9.05%; p < 0.001) and full active treatment (30.5% versus 26.1%; p = 0.028). Whilst proportions of discussions that involved the patient remained similar during COVID-19 (95.8% versus 95.6%; p = 0.871), fewer discussions took place with relatives (50.6% versus 75.4%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emphasis on senior decision making and conversations around ceilings of treatment appears to have changed practice, with a higher proportion of patients having DNACPR/TEAL status documented. Understanding patient preferences around life-sustaining treatment versus comfort care is part of holistic practice and supports shared decision making. It is unclear whether these attitudinal changes will be sustained after COVID-19 admissions decrease.","Marson, Ella J; Botkai, Adam H; Coleman, Jamie J; Evison, Felicity; Atia, Jolene; Wang, Jingyi; Gallier, Suzy; Speakman, John; Pankhurst, Tanya; Marson, Ella",BJS Open,2,1

Moreover, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is frequently overexpressed in different types of cancers and has a role in the promotion of malignancy, apoptosis inhibition, and metastasis of tumor cells. Combination therapy has been emerged to improve the therapeutic benefit against cancer and curb intrinsic and acquired resistance. METHODS: Three semi-synthetic series of compounds (C1-4, P1-4, and G1-4) were prepared and evaluated biologically as potential dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and COX-2 inhibitors. The main phenolic constituents of Amaranthus spinosus L. (p-coumaric, caffeic and gallic) acids have been isolated and subsequently subjected to diazo coupling with various amines to get novel three chemical scaffolds with potential anticancer activities. RESULTS: Compounds C4 and G4 showed superior inhibitory activity against EGFR (IC(50): 0.9 and 0.5 µM, respectively) and displayed good COX-2 inhibition (IC(50): 4.35 and 2.47 µM, respectively). Moreover, the final compounds were further evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against human colon cancer (HT-29), pancreatic cancer (PaCa-2), human malignant melanoma (A375), lung cancer (H-460), and pancreatic ductal cancer (Panc-1) cell lines. Interestingly, compounds C4 and G4 exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity with average IC(50) values of 1.5 µM and 2.8 µM against H-460 and Panc-1, respectively. The virtual docking study was conducted to gain proper understandings of the plausible-binding modes of target compounds within EGFR and COX-2 binding sites. DISCUSSION: The NMR of prepared compounds showed characteristic peaks that confirmed the structure of the target compounds. The synthesized benzoxazolyl scaffold containing compounds showed inhibitory activities for both COXs and EGFR which are consistent with the virtual docking study.","Abdelgawad, Mohamed A; Musa, Arafa; Almalki, Atiah H; Alzarea, Sami I; Mostafa, Ehab M; Hegazy, Mostafa M; Mostafa-Hedeab, Gomaa; Ghoneim, Mohammed M; Parambi, Della G T; Bakr, Rania B; Al-Muaikel, Nayef S; Alanazi, Abdullah S; Alharbi, Metab; Ahmad, Waqas; Bukhari, Syed N A; Al-Sanea, Mohammad M",Drug Des Devel Ther,2,1

Recycling and sorting are in their infancy in Saudi Arabia and huge amounts of mixed household and industrial wastes are still dumped without any pre-treatment. Solid waste management techniques such as incineration, pyrolysis and gasification have high investment costs. Composting and vermicomposting of solid organic waste have been considered as an economically viable and sustainable waste management technologies. However, wastes often contain pollutants, such as heavy metals that are toxic to decomposer micro-organisms. Thus, heavy metals are a challenge for the successful biological treatments. Waste may also contain a mixture of organic pollutants that certain microbes, such as micro-algae are known to degrade. The present review paper focuses on understanding the role of vermicomposting as a management tool in mitigating solid organic wastes. It is noteworthy to mention that the microbes also play a pivotal role in the degradation process, wherein the enzymes secreted during the process aid in decomposition of complex molecules into simpler compounds. Also, the extracellular polymeric substance secreted by the earthworm under metal stress serves a source of nutrient for the bacteria to flourish. Henceforth the goal of discussion in present review shows the way forward in using vermicomposting as a novel approach in dealing with solid organic waste.","Alshehrei, Fatimah; Ameen, Fuad",Saudi J Biol Sci,2,1

Those who lost their job during the pandemic are more likely to experience changes in their daily routine and behaviors, and face shifts in their mental health status. The purpose of this study was to assess trends in dietary and lifestyle factors in relation to mental distress pre- vs during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adults based on education level. METHODS: This study is part of a larger study on dietary patterns and mood. Data collection started prior to the pandemic with a pre-COVID-19 sample size of 2,853 and COVID-19 sample size of 692. Data were collected anonymously via several social media platforms using the validated Food-Mood Questionnaire. Data collected since March 2020 was considered COVID-19 data as most of the major restrictions that may have impacted job security around the world started around this date. We examined trends in population characteristics using two-sample Welch's t test for all the variables to identify statistically significant changes (P < 0.05) due to the pandemic. RESULTS: Those with a graduate degree were more likely to eat more vegetables, less fast food, exercise more frequently and use more multivitamin and fish oil supplement and less likely to experience an increase in mental distress. Those without a graduate degree were more likely to skip breakfast, eat more fruits, meat, high glycemic index food, increase use of multivitamin and fish oil supplements and exercise frequently. They were also less likely to eat nuts. Interestingly, this group had seen an increase in mental distress. CONCLUSIONS: Those with a graduate degree experienced minimal disruption in their dietary and lifestyle factors, which may explain the lower likelihood of mental distress in this population. In addition, all the changes noted were beneficial to physical and mental health. However, those with no graduate degree have experienced greater dietary and lifestyle changes, which may explain the upsurge of their mental distress. In essence, education level during COVID-19 pandemic allegedly contributed to changes in dietary and lifestyle factors that in turn may have impacted mental wellbeing.

METHODS: We used SummerStyles data collected in June 2020 (3,916 US adults, ≥18 y). The outcome was the reported frequency of 1) consuming more unhealthy snacks and desserts including chips, cookies, and ice cream and 2) drinking more sugary drinks like regular soda, fruit drinks, sports/energy drinks, sweetened coffee/teas during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses were categorized as Never/Rarely, Sometimes, or Often/Always. Exposure variables were sociodemographics, currently having children (<18 y), weight status, and Census regions. Multinomial regressions were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) for Sometimes or Often/Always consuming more unhealthy snacks/desserts (vs. Never/Rarely); and Sometimes or Often/Always more sugary drinks (vs. Never/Rarely). RESULTS: 36% of adults reported Sometimes consuming more unhealthy snacks/desserts; 16% did so Often/Always. 22% of adults reported Sometimes drinking more sugary drinks; 10% did so Often/Always. Factors significantly associated with higher odds of reporting Often/Always consuming more unhealthy snacks/desserts were younger adults (OR range = 1.51–2.86 vs. adults ≥65 y), females (OR = 1.58), non-Hispanic (NH) Black (OR = 1.89 vs. NH White), lower household income (OR = 2.01 for < $35K vs. ≥$100K), and obesity (OR = 1.56 vs. underweight/healthy weight). Factors significantly associated with odds of Often/Always drinking more sugary drinks were being younger (OR range = 2.26–4.39 vs. adults ≥65 y), NH Black (OR = 3.25), Hispanic (OR = 1.75), NH other (OR = 2.41 vs. NH White), lower education (OR = 2.03 for ≤high school; OR = 1.80 for some college vs. college graduate), lower household income (OR range = 1.64–3.15 vs. ≥$100k), and obesity (OR = 1.61 vs. underweight/healthy weight). CONCLUSIONS: Consuming more foods and beverages with added sugars during the pandemic was higher in younger adults, racial/ethnic minority groups, lower-income adults, and adults with obesity.

Private car driving has for a long time been the main mode of transport for retail and service trips, and grocery shopping trips represent over 60% of the retail and service travels. Despite the growing number of studies addressing accessibility to daily destinations, to the best of the authors’ knowledge there are no studies examining these issues over time. METHODS: This paper aims to investigate changes in accessibility to grocery stores over time and use two counties in Norway as examples. Based on GIS data at a detailed level, distances from dwellings to nearest grocery store has been examined. FINDINGS: The results from the spatial analyses reveal significant changes from 1980 to 2019: The share of the population living within 500-m from a grocery store has decreased from 55% to 34% in one of the counties examined and from 36% to 19% in the other. This indicates that the share of people living within walking distance to a local grocery store has nearly halved. With such changes in accessibility to grocery stores, increased car driving for grocery shopping should not come as a surprise. Contrary to the frequent statements about sustainable urban development and active transportation, it seems that Norway still is developing as a country that in the future will be more and not less dependent on private cars.","Rokseth, Lillian Sve; Heinen, Eva; Hauglin, Espen Aukrust; Nordström, Tobias; Manum, Bendik",Eur,2,13

Using the case study of South Africa, a suite of interviews has been conducted with diverse energy interests, to develop and analyse four key issues pertinent to the energy transition there. We do so primarily through the lens of delivering energy justice to that society. In doing so, we emphasise the need to monitor, model, and modify the dynamic characteristic of the energy transition process and the delivery of energy justice; a static approach which ignores the fluid nature of transition will be insufficient.

Data for the study was gathered by administering an unstructured, anonymous questionnaire to 207 female university students and staff. The survey design included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, views on different facets of volunteering, unhealthy behaviors, and correlation between volunteering and unhealthy behaviors. The results revealed unhealthy behavior detected by the respondents (51.7%). Twenty-eight (13.5%) of the 207 respondents reported using social media in detecting women with offending behavior. The value of Pearson's R is 0.245; thus, it is considered as weak or no correlation. There is hence no correlation between how respondents preferred volunteer work and the obstacle to volunteering. There is not much difference in the obstacles to volunteering faced by respondents despite their preferred style of volunteering. The findings reveal that digital volunteering effectively gains ground in detecting and managing unhealthy behaviors among university students. Much more could be achieved through digital volunteering if more awareness is created and volunteering programs are designed to be more interesting and less time-consuming to allow more students to participate.","Alarnous, Razan; Albasalah, Aida; Alshawwa, Samar",J Healthc Eng,2,12

However, previous research has revealed discrepancies in the connection. This article develops a theoretical model of the impact of citizenship pressure on organizational citizenship performance based on expectancy theory. A leader–employee paired questionnaire was used to evaluate the hypotheses. The results indicate that organizational citizenship performance is positively influenced by citizenship pressure. The connection between organizational citizenship performance and citizenship pressure is positively moderated by transformational leadership. The better the transformational leadership, the greater the influence of citizenship pressure on organizational citizenship performance. Furthermore, the impact of transformational leadership on the link between citizenship pressure and organizational citizenship performance is dependent on the political skill of employees. When individuals with strong political skill encounter transformational leadership, the relationship between citizenship pressure and organizational citizenship performance is minimal. On the contrary, this relationship is enhanced when personnel with limited political skill are confronted with transformational leadership.","Liu, Yazhen; Fu, Jingtao; Pervaiz, Sabeeh; He, Qi",Front Psychol,2,16

In this report, we described a COVID-19-positive case who had COVID-related complications and iatrogenic left subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm after central venous catheter insertion. Case Presentation. A 58-year-old male patient presented with a high-grade fever, myalgia, and shortness of breath due to COVID-19 infection. He required mechanical ventilation support and hemodialysis. He also developed uneventful deep vein thrombosis and myocardial infarction. As a complication of central line insertion, the patient developed pseudoaneurysm that originated from the subclavian artery with significant bleeding and large hematoma. Balloon-assisted percutaneous thrombin injection was done under ultrasound guidance. The patient was extubated 2 days later with no evidence of flow in the pseudoaneurysm. However, he lost movement in the left arm secondary to the compression of the brachial plexus from the pseudoaneurysm/hematoma, and therefore, 1.5 litres of the hematoma was evacuated in the operating room through a lateral left chest wall incision along the anterior axillary line to relieve the compression over the brachial plexus. The patient declined surgical reconstruction of the brachial plexus, and the flaccid paralysis of the arm did not recover during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: This is a case of unusual complications of COVID infection and iatrogenic left subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm postcentral vein cannulation. Balloon-assisted percutaneous thrombin injection for treatment of left subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm is feasible; however, delayed diagnosis could be associated with long-term or permanent disability.","Al-Thani, Hassan; Hussein, Ahmed; Sadek, Ahmed; Barah, Ali; El-Menyar, Ayman",Case Rep Vasc Med,2,31

Previous authors have suggested the use of color-flow duplex monitoring, magnetic resonance angiography and segmental pressure monitoring as objective steps to ascertain blood flow following adequate internal fixation. We examine the use of the waveform of the pulse oximeter in objectively determining a perfused limb and in predicting the need for surgical exploration in patients who present with a pulseless perfused hand after operative stabilisation for supracondylar fracture of the humerus. METHODS A retrospective review of all supracondylar fractures over a 60 month duration (2005-2009) in our instituition was performed. Each electronic record was reviewed and limbs which had absent radial pulse following admission were identified. X-ray films of each of the patients were reviewed. A search using the Pubmed database was performed with the following keywords, supracondylar humerus fracture, pediatric, pulseless, vascular injury, arterial repair. RESULTS In this series of pulseless perfused hands following operative fixation of supracondylar fracture, a total of 26 patients were reviewed. All were Gartland grade III extension type fractures. Postoperative pulse oximeter waveforms were present in all but 4 patients. These patients subsequently had exploration of the brachial artery with significant findings. In the remaining 22 patients, waveforms were present and the child had return of the radial pulse soon after operative fixation without any further need for surgical exploration. At 24 months follow-up, all children were well with no neurovascular compromise. CONCLUSIONS The presence of a waveform on a pulse oximeter is a sensitive and easily available modality in determining vascular perfusion as compared to other more complex investigations. The high sensitivity of this test will allow surgeons to objectively determine the requirement for surgical exploration of the brachial artery.","Soh, Reuben Chee Cheong; Tawng, D Khawn; Mahadev, Arjandas",Clinics in orthopedic surgery,2,5

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of this measure on the management of the heart failure outpatient clinic at our institution. METHODS We analyzed the clinical outcome of 110 chronic heart failure patients (mean age 73 ± 9 years) whose follow-up visit had been delayed. RESULTS At their last visit before the lockdown, 80.9% was in NYHA class II, had an ejection fraction of 37 ± 7%, and B-type natriuretic peptide level was moderately elevated (266 ± 138 pg/ml). All patients received loop diuretics, 97.2% beta-blockers, 64.9% an aldosterone antagonist, 60.9% sacubitril/valsartan (S/V), and 72.2% of the remaining patients were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or valsartan therapy. Patients were contacted by phone during and at the end of the lockdown period to fix a new appointment and underwent a structured interview to assess their clinical conditions and ongoing therapy and to verify whether they had contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection. Twelve patients (13.2%) contracted COVID-19. None was hospitalized for worsening heart failure or reported defibrillator shocks and none changed autonomously the prescribed therapy. Overall, 75% of patients reported stable or improved general well-being from the last in-person visit, while 25% described subjective worsening due to the social effect of the pandemic. Unchanged body weight and blood pressure values were reported by 86% and 78.4% of patients, respectively. Lower blood pressure values compared to baseline were recorded in 15.2% of patients on conventional renin-angiotensin system inhibition vs 21% of those on S/V, one of whom had to down-titrate S/V for persistent but asymptomatic hypotension; 4 patients up-titrated S/V to 200 mg/day following phone indications. CONCLUSIONS Cancellation of scheduled follow-up visits during 3 months did not have significant negative effects in a cohort of stable patients with chronic heart failure on optimized medical therapy. Telephone support was effective in keeping connections with the patients during the lockdown, allowing appropriate management and implementation of drug therapy. In particular, patients who received S/V were not affected by delays in scheduled visits, confirming the tolerability and safety of this novel therapy in terms of both clinical and biohumoral parameters.","Di Tano, Giuseppe; Verde, Simone; Loffi, Marco; De Maria, Renata; Danzi, Gian Battista",Giornale italiano di cardiologia,2,27

Pediatric and immunocompromised individuals are at particular risk for developing severe disease, however, no approved antiviral therapies specific to HAdV exist. Ivermectin is an FDA-approved broad spectrum antiparasitic drug that also exhibits antiviral properties against a diverse range of viruses. Its proposed function is inhibiting the classical protein nuclear import pathway mediated by importin-α (Imp-α) and -β1 (Imp-β1). Many viruses, including HAdV, rely on this host pathway for transport of viral proteins across the nuclear envelope. In this study we show that ivermectin inhibits HAdV-C5 early gene transcription, early and late protein expression, genome replication, and production of infectious viral progeny. Similarly, ivermectin inhibits genome replication of HAdV-B3, a clinically important pathogen responsible for numerous recent outbreaks. Mechanistically, we show that ivermectin disrupts binding of the viral E1A protein to Imp-α without affecting the interaction between Imp-α and Imp-β1. Our results further extend ivermectin's broad antiviral activity and provide a mechanistic underpinning for its mode of action as an inhibitor of cellular Imp-α/β1 mediated nuclear import.IMPORTANCE Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) represent a ubiquitous and clinically important pathogen without an effective antiviral treatment. HAdV infections typically cause mild symptoms, however individuals such as children, those with underlying conditions, and those with compromised immune systems can develop severe disseminated disease. Our results demonstrate that ivermectin, an FDA approved antiparasitic agent, is effective at inhibiting replication of several HAdV types in vitro This is in agreement with the growing body of literature suggesting ivermectin has broad antiviral activity. This study expands our mechanistic knowledge of ivermectin by showing that ivermectin targets the ability of Imp-α to recognize nuclear localization sequences, without effecting the Imp-α/β1 interaction. These data also exemplify the applicability of targeting host factors upon which viruses rely as a viable antiviral strategy.","King, Cason R; Tessier, Tanner M; Dodge, Mackenzie J; Weinberg, Jason B; Mymryk, Joe S",Journal of virology,2,20

However, one of the issues is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of PDLSCs for clinical application because very few PDLSCs can be isolated from PDL tissue of donors. Therefore, we aimed to identify a specific factor that converts human PDL cells into stem-like cells. In this study, microarray analysis comparing the gene profiles of human PDLSC lines (2-14 and 2-23) with those of a cell line with a low differentiation potential (2-52) identified the imprinted gene mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST). MEST was expressed in the cytoplasm of 2-23 cells. Knockdown of MEST by siRNA in 2-23 cells inhibited the expression of stem cell markers, such as CD105, CD146, p75NTR, N-cadherin, and NANOG; the proliferative potential; and multidifferentiation capacity for osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. On the other hand, overexpression of MEST in 2-52 cells enhanced the expression of stem cell markers and PDL-related markers and the multidifferentiation capacity. In addition, MEST-overexpressing 2-52 cells exhibited a change in morphology from a spindle shape to a stem cell-like round shape that was similar to 2-14 and 2-23 cell morphologies. These results suggest that MEST plays a critical role in the maintenance of stemness in PDLSCs and converts PDL cells into PDLSC-like cells. Therefore, this study indicates that MEST may be a therapeutic factor for periodontal tissue regeneration by inducing PDLSCs.","Hasegawa, Daigaku; Hasegawa, Kana; Kaneko, Hiroshi; Yoshida, Shinichiro; Mitarai, Hiromi; Arima, Mai; Tomokiyo, Atsushi; Hamano, Sayuri; Sugii, Hideki; Wada, Naohisa; Kiyoshima, Tamotsu; Maeda, Hidefumi",Stem cells international,2,30

However, its effects on stool output reduction, the key outcome for pediatric antidiarrheal drugs, have not been shown. METHODS Two parallel, double-blind studies of diosmectite efficacy on stool reduction were conducted in children 1 to 36 months old in Peru (n = 300) and Malaysia (n = 302). Inclusion criteria included 3 or more watery stools per day for less than 72 hours and weight/height ratios of 0.8 or greater. Exclusion criteria were the need for intravenous rehydration, gross blood in stools, fever higher than 39 degrees C, or current treatment with antidiarrheal or antibiotic medications. Rotavirus status was determined. Diosmectite dosage was 6 g/day (children 1-12 months old) or 12 g/day (children 13-36 months old), given for at least 3 days, followed by half doses until complete recovery. Patients were assigned randomly to groups given diosmectite or placebo, in addition to oral rehydration solution (World Health Organization). RESULTS Children in each study had comparable average ages and weights. The frequencies of rotavirus infection were 22% in Peru and 12% in Malaysia. Similar amounts of oral rehydration solution were given to children in the diosmectite and placebo groups. Stool output was decreased significantly by diosmectite in both studies, especially among rotavirus-positive children. In pooled data, children had a mean stool output of 94.5 +/- 74.4 g/kg of body weight in the diosmectite group versus 104.1 +/- 94.2 g/kg in the placebo group (P = .002). Diarrhea duration was reduced by diosmectite, which was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS These results show that diosmectite significantly decreased stool output in children with acute watery diarrhea, especially those who were rotavirus-positive.","Dupont, Christophe; Foo, Jimmy Lee Kok; Garnier, Philippe; Moore, Nicholas; Mathiex-Fortunet, Hèlène; Salazar-Lindo, Eduardo",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,2,6

These families are characterized by a highly penetrant susceptibility to diffuse gastric cancer with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. We describe the clinical presentation of three sibling cases with advanced gastric cancer, the way of confirming the suspicion of underlying HDGC and the clinical management of the other healthy family members. METHODS Screening for CDH1 germline mutation was carried out by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and automated DNA sequencing. The clinical suspicion of HDGC has been confirmed by identifying a frameshift mutation in exon 9 (1302_1303insA, 1306_1307delTT) of the E-cadherin gene. RESULTS Eight of nine tested family members were positive for the CDH1 germline mutation. Prophylactic laparoscopic gastrectomies were performed in five mutation carriers.

Serious vascular complications are rare but when they do occur, they can be associated with significant morbidity, risking limb loss or even death. Near infra-red spectroscopy has the potential to monitor limb perfusion. Our study investigates changes in tissue oxygenation and perfusion in the abdominal and leg circulation following UAC insertion. METHODS A prospective observational study performing ultrasound pulsed Doppler measurements in the coeliac, superior mesenteric artery, renal arteries and the femoral arteries as well as near infrared spectroscopy measurements of both thighs at three time points (immediately before = Time 1, 1 h after = Time 2 and 24 h after UAC insertion = Time 3). RESULTS We monitored 30 infants, the mean gestational age was 30 weeks (24-41) and the mean birthweight was 1720 g (600-4070 g). We observed statistically significant changes (P < 0.05) in pulse Doppler measurements in coeliac (mean peak systolic velocity (PSV): Time 1 = 70.51, Time 2 = 61.75; resistive index (RI): Time 1 = 0.75, Time 2 = 0.67), superior mesenteric (PSV: Time 1 = 41.72, Time 2 = 36.10; RI: Time 1 = 0.92, Time 2 = 0.87), renal (same side end-diastolic velocity: Time 1 = 1.98, Time 2 = 3.80; RI: Time 1 = 0.93, Time 2 = 0.87; opposite side end-diastolic velocity: Time 1 = 2.62, Time 2 = 3.84; RI: Time 1 = 0.92, Time 2 = 0.85) and femoral arteries (same side PSV: Time 1 = 72.75, Time 2 = 62.18; opposite side PSV: Time 1 = 81.89, Time 2 = 62.74). Tissue oxygenation in lower limbs remained unaffected (same side (mean): Time 1 = 68.59, Time 2 = 68.99, Time 3 = 66.40, opposite side: Time 1 = 67.72, Time 2 = 66.92, Time 3 = 65.40). All infants on clinical examination had normal lower limb perfusion, lower limb arterial pulses and normal perfusion to the gluteal region before and after insertion of UAC.

To survive in the host, FMDV has evolved to antagonize the host type I interferon (IFN) response. Previous studies have reported that the leader proteinase (L(pro)) and 3C(pro) of FMDV are involved in the inhibition of type I IFN production. However, whether the proteins of FMDV can inhibit type I IFN signaling is less well understood. In this study, we first found that 3C(pro) of FMDV functioned to interfere with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Expression of 3C(pro) significantly reduced the transcript levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activity. The protein level, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, and their heterodimerization were not affected. However, the nuclear translocation of STAT1/STAT2 was blocked by the 3C(pro) protein. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that 3C(pro) induced proteasome- and caspase-independent protein degradation of karyopherin α1 (KPNA1), the nuclear localization signal receptor for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, but not karyopherin α2, α3, or α4. Finally, we showed that the protease activity of 3C(pro) contributed to the degradation of KPNA1 and thus blocked STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. Taken together, results of our experiments describe for the first time a novel mechanism by which FMDV evolves to inhibit IFN signaling and counteract host innate antiviral responses. IMPORTANCE We show that 3C(pro) of FMDV antagonizes the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by blocking STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, 3C(pro) induces KPNA1 degradation, which is independent of proteasome and caspase pathways. The protease activity of 3C(pro) contributes to the degradation of KPNA1 and governs the ability of 3C(pro) to inhibit the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This study uncovers a novel mechanism evolved by FMDV to antagonize host innate immune responses.","Du, Yijun; Bi, Jingshan; Liu, Jiyu; Liu, Xing; Wu, Xiangju; Jiang, Ping; Yoo, Dongwan; Zhang, Yongguang; Wu, Jiaqiang; Wan, Renzhong; Zhao, Xiaomin; Guo, Lihui; Sun, Wenbo; Cong, Xiaoyan; Chen, Lei; Wang, Jinbao",Journal of virology,2,31

Our purpose was to evaluate the extent of angiographic devascularization and intraoperative blood loss by using only Onyx for percutaneous juvenile angiofibroma tumor embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the clinical records and preoperative and postoperative imaging studies of a consecutive series of 9 patients with juvenile angiofibromas who were treated with preoperative embolization with direct percutaneous injection of Onyx followed by resection from a standard open surgical or endoscopic approach. RESULTS Two Fisch type I, 1 Fisch type II, 5 Fisch type IIIa, and 1 Fisch type IVa tumor were treated. Complete devascularization was achieved in all cases percutaneously with only Onyx. There were no complications. The average intraoperative blood loss was 567.7 mL (range, 10-1700 mL). An average of 2.2 needles (range, 1-5 needles) was placed into the tumor. An average of 14.6 mL of Onyx (range, 2-25 mL) was injected into each tumor. Four Fisch type IIIa tumors were removed completely from only an ENE approach. CONCLUSIONS Presurgical direct percutaneous embolization of a juvenile angiofibroma with only EVOH before surgical resection is safe and feasible. Our preliminary experience suggests that Onyx may offer a higher degree of devascularization compared with other embolic agents. This may facilitate an easier surgical resection with lower blood loss.","Gemmete, J J; Patel, S; Pandey, A S; Sullivan, S E; McKean, E L; Marentette, L J; Chaudhary, N",AJNR.

The authors hypothesize that hydrofiber dressings will hold mafenide acetate solution for an extended period of time and maintain antimicrobial activity longer than traditional gauze, thus possibly obviating the need for frequent dressing changes. Four experimental arms included: 1) hydrofiber, stored on a dry well plate as control, 2) gauze saturated with 2.5% mafenide acetate, stored on nonsterile porcine skin, 3) hydrofiber saturated with mafenide acetate, stored on dry well plate, and 4) hydrofiber saturated with mafenide acetate, stored on nonsterile porcine skin. At 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours, a 1-cm disk was cut from the dressing sheet of each study arm, placed on agar plates seeded with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and incubated for 24 hours, and the zone of inhibition was measured. A zone of 2 mm or greater was indicative of susceptibility. Each arm of the experiment was performed four times to demonstrate reproducibility. Plain hydrofiber (control) demonstrated no zone of inhibition at any time point, thereby possessing no antimicrobial activity alone. Gauze saturated with mafenide acetate did not reliably demonstrate antimicrobial activity beyond 0 hours. Hydrofiber saturated with mafenide acetate, whether stored on a dry well plate or nonsterile porcine skin, consistently possessed sustained antimicrobial activity as demonstrated by zones of inhibition greater than 2 mm to both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.

Meta-analysis showed that the use of distal perfusion cannula was associated with lower odds of limb ischemia (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.17-2.47; p = 0.03) Meta-regression showed that male sex, smoking, advanced age, and comorbidities contributed to higher in-hospital mortality, while distal perfusion cannula was protective. CONCLUSIONS Nearly a third of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation develop vascular complications; elderly males with comorbidities appear vulnerable. The use of distal perfusion cannulas caused significant reduction in limb ischemia and mortality.","Jia, Deng; Yang, Isabelle Xiaorui; Ling, Ryan Ruiyang; Syn, Nicholas; Poon, Wynne Hsing; Murughan, Kavita; Tan, Chuen Seng; Choong, Andrew M T L; MacLaren, Graeme; Ramanathan, Kollengode",Critical care medicine,2,31

VAD has been found to be usually a consequence of traumatic vertebral artery injury. ABAO usually presents with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) of the posterior circulation or transient ischemic attack (TIA). It may lead to death or long-term disability if not promptly recanalized. Basilar artery recanalization in children can be achieved safely and with excellent clinical outcome using endovascular thrombectomy with the new generation self-expanding and retrievable stents. CLINICAL PRESENTATION We report the case of a 23-month old baby that came to the emergency room of our hospital for progressive impairment of consciousness associated with widespread stiffness and plaintive cry, appeared after accidental fall from stroller. An emergency brain CT scan was obtained showing multiple infarction lesions in the brainstem and left cerebellum suggestive of acute stroke in posterior circulation territories. An MR scan with angiography and diffusion-weighted sequences confirmed the multiple infarction lesions and demonstrated poor representation of the flow signal at the V3 segment of the left vertebral artery and absent representation of the flow signal at the distal segment of the basilar artery suggestive of acute thrombotic occlusion. The patient was immediately referred to interventional neuroradiology unit, and digital subtraction angiography showed complete basilar artery occlusion and left vertebral artery dissection at extracranial V2-V3 segment. The patient underwent intra-arterial thrombectomy using stent retrievers and occlusion of the V2-V3 segment of the left vertebral artery. The patient survived and long-term outcome was excellent. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, only nine cases of ABAO in children treated with intra-arterial thrombectomy have been previously reported in the literature. In only three cases, the Solitaire stent was applied. Our case is the first case of basilar artery occlusion treated with Solitaire stent, in a child under 24 months. The reports that are available so far indicate that basilar artery recanalization in children can be achieved safely and with excellent clinical outcome using endovascular thrombectomy with the new generation self-expanding and retrievable stents.","Nicosia, Giancarlo; Cicala, Domenico; Mirone, Giuseppe; Spennato, Pietro; Trischitta, Vincenzo; Ruggiero, Claudio; Guarneri, Gianluigi; Muto, Mario; Cinalli, Giuseppe",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,2,1

For women who wish to preserve their uterus and who have not had a response to medical treatment, myomectomy and uterine-artery embolization are therapeutic options. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate myomectomy, as compared with uterine-artery embolization, in women who had symptomatic uterine fibroids and did not want to undergo hysterectomy. Procedural options included open abdominal, laparoscopic, or hysteroscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome was fibroid-related quality of life, as assessed by the score on the health-related quality-of-life domain of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QOL) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life) at 2 years; adjustment was made for the baseline score. RESULTS A total of 254 women, recruited at 29 hospitals in the United Kingdom, were randomly assigned: 127 to the myomectomy group (of whom 105 underwent myomectomy) and 127 to the uterine-artery embolization group (of whom 98 underwent embolization). Data on the primary outcome were available for 206 women (81%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean (±SD) score on the health-related quality-of-life domain of the UFS-QOL questionnaire at 2 years was 84.6±21.5 in the myomectomy group and 80.0±22.0 in the uterine-artery embolization group (mean adjusted difference with complete case analysis, 8.0 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 14.1; P = 0.01; mean adjusted difference with missing responses imputed, 6.5 points; 95% CI, 1.1 to 11.9). Perioperative and postoperative complications from all initial procedures, irrespective of adherence to the assigned procedure, occurred in 29% of the women in the myomectomy group and in 24% of the women in the uterine-artery embolization group. CONCLUSIONS Among women with symptomatic uterine fibroids, those who underwent myomectomy had a better fibroid-related quality of life at 2 years than those who underwent uterine-artery embolization.

The tight links that necessarily exist between the virus as it multiplies and the metabolism of its host are systematically ignored. Here we show that the metabolism of all cells is coordinated by the availability of a core building block of the cell's genome, cytidine triphosphate (CTP). This metabolite is also the key to the synthesis of the viral envelope and to the translation of its genome into proteins. This unique role explains why evolution has led to the early emergence in animals of an antiviral immunity enzyme, viperin, that synthesizes a toxic analogue of CTP. The constraints arising from this dependency guide the evolution of the virus. With this in mind, we explored the real-time experiment taking place before our eyes using probabilistic modelling approaches to the molecular evolution of the virus. We have thus followed, almost on a daily basis, the evolution of the composition of the viral genome to link it to the progeny produced over time, particularly in the form of blooms that sparked a firework of viral mutations. Some of those certainly increase the propagation of the virus. This led us to make out the critical role in this evolution of several proteins of the virus, such as its nucleocapsid N, and more generally to begin to understand how the virus ties up the host metabolism to its own benefit. A way for the virus to escape CTP-dependent control in cells would be to infect cells that are not expected to grow, such as neurons. This may account for unexpected body sites of viral development in the present epidemic.","Cluzel, Nicolas; Lambert, Amaury; Maday, Yvon; Turinici, Gabriel; Danchin, Antoine",Comptes rendus biologies,2,16

BACKGROUND There is no consensus on the best means of preventing SLCs after SG. METHODS This was a prospective, intention-to-treat, randomized, 2 center study of a group of 586 patients undergoing primary SG (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01613664) between March 2014 and June 2017. The 1:1 randomization was stratified by center, age, sex, gender, and body mass index, giving 293 patients in the FS group and 293 in the control group (without FS). The primary endpoint (composite criteria) was the incidence of SLCs in each of the 2 groups. The secondary criteria were the mortality rate, morbidity rate, reoperation rate, length of hospital stay, readmission rate, and risk factors for SLC. RESULTS There were no intergroup differences in demographic variables. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of SLCs was similar in the FS and control groups (1.3% vs 2%, respectively; P = 0.52). All secondary endpoints were similar: complication rate (5.4% vs 5.1%, respectively; P = 0.85), mortality rate (0.3% vs 0%, respectively; P = 0.99), GL rate (0.3% vs 1.3%, respectively; P = 0.18), postoperative hemorrhage/hematoma rate (1% vs 0.7%, respectively; P = 0.68), reoperation rate (1% vs 0.3%, respectively; P = 0.32). Length of stay was 1 day in both groups (P = 0.89), and the readmission rate was similar (5.1% vs 3.4%, respectively; P = 0.32). No risk factors for SLCs were found. CONCLUSION The incidence of postoperative SLCs did not appear to depend on the presence or absence of FS.","Rebibo, Lionel; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Chati, Rachid; Cosse, Cyril; Huet, Emmanuel; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Annals of surgery,2,17

The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China and millions of cases and thousands of deaths were reported within five months. Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography (CT) are clinically prescribed for COVID-19 detection across the globe. AREAS COVERED This systematic review is focused on currently used diagnostic methods for COVID-19 detection and their future prospects. Online searches on Google scholar, PubMed and online resources were conducted on the period of year 2017 to mid-2020. Studies investigating laboratory examinations, radiographical analysis, and potential sensors for COVID-19 detection were included. Along with this, the current status of commercially available kits for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus detection is discussed. EXPERT OPINION The search has identified the potential applications of nucleic acid technology, diagnostics radiology examinations, and in-vitro diagnostic kits in detection of COVID-19 infections. Despite having their own limitations of each technology, the emerging diagnostic technologies for COVID-19 detection along with undergoing clinical trials are summarized suggesting more collaborations and funding are required for fast track clinical trials.","Chauhan, Nidhi; Soni, Shringika; Gupta, Abhinandan; Jain, Utkarsh",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,2,1

We evaluated the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) and a visualization quality score, and organized evaluation findings according to the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Model. Results Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. Ten of these addressed all MMAT items; 13 addressed all visualization quality items.

However, these symptoms may be associated with other factors, such as orofacial myofunctional disorders and temporomandibular disorder (TMD), which have not been comprehensively assessed in this population. OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to investigate orofacial muscles and functions as well as the presence of TMD in patients with SS compared with a group without SS and analyze whether the patients' experience of limitations in orofacial functioning is associated with the orofacial functional status and muscle pain related to TMD. METHODS Women with SS based on the 2002 American-European Criteria and volunteers paired by age and sex were compared. The exams included the orofacial myofunctional evaluation with scores protocol (OMES), tongue and lip strength measures and electromyography of the masticatory muscles. TMD investigations included clinical examination, self-report of symptoms and jaw functional limitation scale. RESULTS Patients with Sjögren's Syndrome present impaired muscle and orofacial functions based on lower scores of all categories of orofacial myofunctional evaluation (P< 0.0001), tongue strength (P= 0.0003-0.0004), and masticatory muscle activity (P= 0.0002-0.007) as well as worse TMD signs and symptoms (P< 0.05) and jaw functional limitation (P< 0.0001-0.0003). The patients' experiences with limitation in mastication and swallowing were associated with orofacial myofunctional status and muscle pain related to TMD. Those disorders should be monitored along with disease control and must be addressed in the clinical evaluation to prevent nutritional and metabolic comorbidities in SS patients.

The need is perhaps most acute in neonates and infants with life-threatening congenital heart disease, in whom mechanical support devices are largely unsuccessful. If orthotopic (life-supporting) heart transplantation (OHTx) were consistently successful in the genetically engineered pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) model, a clinical trial of bridging with a pig heart in such patients might be justified. However, the results of pig OHTx in NHPs have been mixed and largely poor. We hypothesise that a factor is the detrimental effects of the inflammatory response that is known to develop (a) during any surgical procedure that requires cardiopulmonary bypass, and (b) immediately after an NHP recipient is exposed to a pig xenograft. We suggest that the combination of these two inflammatory responses has a direct detrimental effect on pig heart graft function, but also, and possibly of more importance, on recipient baboon pulmonary function, which further impacts survival of the pig heart graft. In addition, the inflammatory response almost certainly adversely impacts the immune response to the graft. If our hypothesis is correct, the potential steps that could be taken to reduce the inflammatory response or its effects (with varying degrees of efficacy) include (a) white blood cell filtration, (b) complement depletion or inactivation, (c) immunosuppressive therapy, (d) high-dose corticosteroid therapy, (e) cytokine/chemokine-targeted therapy, (f) ultrafiltration or CytoSorb hemoperfusion, (g) reduction in the levels of endogenous catecholamines, (h) triiodothyronine therapy and (i) genetic engineering of the organ-source pig. Prevention of the inflammatory response, or attenuation of its effects, by judicious anti-inflammatory therapy may contribute not only to early survival of the recipient of a genetically engineered pig OHTx, but also to improved long-term pig heart graft survival. This would open the possibility of initiating a clinical trial of genetically engineered pig OHTx as a bridge to allotransplantation.","Thompson, Charles P; Jagdale, Abhijit; Walcott, Gregory; Iwase, Hayato; Foote, Jeremy B; Cron, Randall Q; Hara, Hidetaka; Cleveland, David C; Cooper, David K C",Xenotransplantation,2,1

To understand the phylogenetic relationship among these cathepsin L-like proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on their sequences. In addition, models of the tertiary structures of cathepsin L were constructed using homology modeling methods and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to obtain reasonable structure to understand its dynamical behavior. Our findings demonstrate that all of the potential Drosophila cathepsin L-like proteins contain at least one cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain. Multiple sequence alignment and homology models clearly highlight the conservation of active site residues, disulfide bonds, and amino acid residues critical for inhibitor binding. Furthermore, comparative modeling indicates that the sequence/structure/function profiles and active site architectures are conserved.","Kumar, Sunil; Farmer, Rohit; Turnbull, Andrew P; Tripathy, Niraj Kanti; Manjasetty, Babu A",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2,1

Commercial vendors and academic institutions have created AI tools for radiation oncology, but such tools have not yet been widely adopted into clinical practice. In addition, numerous discussions have prompted careful thoughts about AI's impact upon the future landscape of radiation oncology: How can we preserve innovation, creativity, and patient safety? When will AI-based tools be widely adopted into the clinic? Will the need for clinical staff be reduced? How will these devices and tools be developed and regulated? SUMMARY In this work, we examine how deep learning, a rapidly emerging subset of AI, fits into the broader historical context of advancements made in radiation oncology and medical physics. In addition, we examine a representative set of deep learning-based tools that are being made available for use in external beam radiotherapy treatment planning and how these deep learning-based tools and other AI-based tools will impact members of the radiation treatment planning team. Key Messages: Compared to past transformative innovations explored in this article, such as the Monte Carlo method or intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the development and adoption of deep learning-based tools is occurring at faster rates and promises to transform practices of the radiation treatment planning team. However, accessibility to these tools will be determined by each clinic's access to the internet, web-based solutions, or high-performance computing hardware. As seen by the trends exhibited by many technologies, high dependence on new technology can result in harm should the product fail in an unexpected manner, be misused by the operator, or if the mitigation to an expected failure is not adequate. Thus, the need for developers and researchers to rigorously validate deep learning-based tools, for users to understand how to operate tools appropriately, and for professional bodies to develop guidelines for their use and maintenance is essential. Given that members of the radiation treatment planning team perform many tasks that are automatable, the use of deep learning-based tools, in combination with other automated treatment planning tools, may refocus tasks performed by the treatment planning team and may potentially reduce resource-related burdens for clinics with limited resources.","Netherton, Tucker J; Cardenas, Carlos E; Rhee, Dong Joo; Court, Laurence E; Beadle, Beth M",Oncology,2,1

We aimed to assess outcomes of diabetes control and treatment risks 2 years after adding Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to intensive lifestyle and medical management. METHODS We report 2-year outcomes of a 5-year randomised trial (the Diabetes Surgery Study) at four teaching hospitals (three in the USA and one in Taiwan). At baseline, eligible participants had to have HbA1c of at least 8·0% (64 mmol/mol), BMI between 30·0 and 39·9 kg/m(2), and type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and be aged 30-67 years. We randomly assigned participants to receive either intensive lifestyle and medical management alone (lifestyle and medical management), or lifestyle and medical management plus standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (gastric bypass). Staff from the clinical centres had access to data from individual patients, but were masked to other patients' data and aggregated data until the 2-year follow-up. Drugs for hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia were prescribed by protocol. The primary endpoint was achievement of the composite treatment goal of HbA1c less than 7·0% (53 mmol/mol), LDL cholesterol less than 2·59 mmol/L, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg at 12 months; here we report the composite outcome and other pre-planned secondary outcomes at 24 months. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis, with multiple imputations for missing data. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00641251, and is still ongoing. FINDINGS Between April 21, 2008, and Nov 21, 2011, we randomly assigned 120 eligible patients to either lifestyle and medical management alone (n=60) or with the addition of gastric bypass (n=60). One patient in the lifestyle and medical management group died (from pancreatic cancer), thus 119 were included in the primary analysis. Significantly more participants in the gastric bypass group achieved the composite triple endpoint at 24 months than in the lifestyle and medical management group (26 [43%] vs eight [14%]; odds ratio 5·1 [95% CI 2·0-12·6], p=0·0004), mainly through improved glycaemic control (HbA1c <7·0% [53 mmol/mol] in 45 [75%] vs 14 [24%]; treatment difference -1·9% (-2·5 to -1·4); p=0·0001). 46 clinically important adverse events occurred in the gastric bypass group and 25 in the lifestyle and medical management group (mainly infections in both groups [four in the lifestyle and medical management group, eight in the gastric bypass group]). With a negative binomial model adjusted for site, the event rate for the gastric bypass group was non-significantly higher than the lifestyle and medical management group by a factor of 1·67 (95% CI 0·98-2·87, p=0·06). Across both years of the study, the gastric bypass group had seven serious falls with five fractures, compared with three serious falls and one fracture in the lifestyle and medical management group. All fractures happened in women. Many more nutritional deficiencies occurred in the gastric bypass group (mainly deficiencies in iron, albumin, calcium, and vitamin D), despite protocol use of nutritional supplements. INTERPRETATION The addition of gastric bypass to lifestyle and medical management in patients with type 2 diabetes improved diabetes control, but adverse events and nutritional deficiencies were more frequent. Larger and longer studies are needed to investigate whether the benefits and risk of gastric bypass for type 2 diabetes can be balanced.

69646,69646,69646,Lemierre's Syndrome.,13.408652,7.719907,2019,"BACKGROUND Evidence has suggested that exercise protects against cognitive decline in aging, but the recent lockdown measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have limited the opportunity for outdoor exercise. Herein we tested the effects of an indoor exercise, Qigong, on neurocognitive functioning as well as its potential neuro-immune pathway. METHODS We conducted a 12-week randomized active-controlled trial with two study arms in cognitively healthy older people. We applied Wu Xing Ping Heng Gong (Qigong), which was designed by an experienced Daoist Qigong master, to the experimental group, whereas we applied the physical stretching exercise to the control group. The Qigong exercise consisted of a range of movements involving the stretching of arms and legs, the turning of the torso, and relaxing, which would follow the fundamental principles of Daoism and traditional Chinese medicine (e.g., Qi). We measured aging-sensitive neurocognitive abilities, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and brain structural volumes in the experimental (Qigong, n= 22) and control groups (stretching, n = 26) before and after the 12-week training. RESULTS We observed that Qigong caused significant improvement in processing speed (t (46) = 2.03, p = 0.048) and sustained attention (t (46) = -2.34, p = 0.023), increased hippocampal volume (t (41) = 3.94, p < 0.001), and reduced peripheral IL-6 levels (t (46) = -3.17, p = 0.003). Moreover, following Qigong training, greater reduction of peripheral IL-6 levels was associated with a greater increase of processing speed performance (bootstrapping CI: [0.16, 3.30]) and a more significant training-induced effect of hippocampal volume on the improvement in sustained attention (bootstrapping CI: [-0.35, -0.004]). CONCLUSION Overall, these findings offer significant insight into the mechanistic role of peripheral IL-6-and its intricate interplay with neural processes-in the beneficial neurocognitive effects of Qigong. The findings have profound implications for early identification and intervention of older individuals vulnerable to cognitive decline, focusing on the neuro-immune pathway. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT04641429).","Qi, Di; M L Wong, Nichol; Shao, Robin; S C Man, Idy; H Y Wong, Clive; Ping Yuen, Lai; C H Chan, Chetwyn; M C Lee, Tatia","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2,4

When confronted with fatal or novel pathogens, people exhibit a variety of behaviours from anxiety to hoarding of medical supplies, overwhelming medical infrastructure and rioting. We developed a coupled network approach to understanding and predicting social response. We couple the disease spread and panic spread processes and model them through local interactions between agents. The social contagion process depends on the prevalence of the disease, its perceived risk and a global media signal. We verify the model by analysing the spread of disease and social response during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Mexico City and 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome and 2009 H1N1 outbreaks in Hong Kong, accurately predicting population-level behaviour. This kind of empirically validated model is critical to exploring strategies for public health intervention, increasing our ability to anticipate the response to infectious disease outbreaks.","Fast, Shannon M; González, Marta C; Wilson, James M; Markuzon, Natasha","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2,19

Initially, citizens were required to stay at home and not to mix with others outside of their household (Phase 1); eventually, some of these restrictions were lifted (Phase 2). To investigate the impact of lockdown on emotional and binge eating, an online survey was conducted to compare measures of self-reported physical (BMI), psychological (Alexithymia), affective (anxiety, stress, and depression) and social (income, workload) state during Phase 1 and Phase 2. Data from 365 Italian residents showed that increased emotional eating was predicted by higher depression, anxiety, quality of personal relationships, and quality of life, while the increase of bingeing was predicted by higher stress. Moreover, we showed that higher alexithymia scores were associated by increased emotional eating and higher BMI scores were associated with both increased emotional eating and binge eating. Finally, we found that from Phase 1 to Phase 2 binge and emotional eating decreased. These data provide evidence of the negative effects of isolation and lockdown on emotional wellbeing, and, relatedly, on eating behaviour.","Cecchetto, Cinzia; Aiello, Marilena; Gentili, Claudio; Ionta, Silvio; Osimo, Sofia Adelaide",Appetite,2,16

Consequently, the results of ""molecular autopsy"" may have important implications for their relatives. Our objective was to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a molecular autopsy program using next-generation sequencing. METHODS We performed a prospective study of a cohort of consecutive patients who died from nonviolent SCD, aged ≤ 50 years, and who underwent molecular autopsy using large panels of next-generation sequencing, with subsequent clinical and genetic family screening. We analyzed demographic, clinical, toxicological, and genetic data. RESULTS We studied 123 consecutive cases of SCD in persons aged ≤ 50 years. The incidence of SCD was 5.8 cases/100 000 individuals/y, mean age was 36.15±12.7 years, and 95 were men (77%). The cause was cardiac in 53%, unexplained SCD in 24%, toxic in 10.6%, and infant SCD in 4%. Among cardiac causes, ischemic heart disease accounted for 38% of deaths, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy for 7%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy for 5%, and idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy for 11%. Genetic analysis was performed in 62 cases (50.4%). Genetic variants were found in 42 cases (67.7%), with a mean of 3.4±4 genetic variants/patient, and the variant found was considered to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic in 30.6%. In unexplained SCD, 70% showed some genetic variant. Family screening diagnosed 21 carriers or affected individuals, 5 of whom were at risk, indicating an implantable cardiac defibrillator. CONCLUSIONS Protocol-based and exhaustive study of SCD from cardiac causes in persons aged ≤ 50 years is feasible and necessary. In a high percentage of cases, the cause is genetic, indicating the existence of relatives at risk who could benefit from early diagnosis and treatment to avoid complications.","Ripoll-Vera, Tomás; Pérez Luengo, Consuelo; Borondo Alcázar, Juan Carlos; García Ruiz, Ana Belén; Sánchez Del Valle, Nieves; Barceló Martín, Bernardino; Poncela García, Juan Luis; Gutiérrez Buitrago, Gloria; Dasi Martínez, Concepción; Canós Villena, Juan Carlos; Moyano Corvillo, Susana; Esgueva Pallarés, Raquel; Sancho Sancho, Juan Ramón; Guitart Pinedo, Gemma; Hernández Marín, Elena; García García, Estela; Vingut López, Albert; Álvarez Rubio, Jorge; Govea Callizo, Nancy; Gómez Pérez, Yolanda; Melià Mesquida, Catalina; Heine, Damián; Rosell Andreo, Jordi; Socías Crespí, Lorenzo",Revista espanola de cardiologia,2,17

Improving autoregulation monitoring methods would significantly advance neonatal neurocritical care. METHODS We tested several mathematical algorithms from the frequency and time domains in a piglet model of HIE, hypothermia, and hypotension. We used laser Doppler flowmetry and induced hypotension to delineate the gold standard lower limit of autoregulation (LLA). Receiver operating characteristics curve analyses were used to determine which indices could distinguish blood pressure above the LLA from that below the LLA in each piglet. RESULTS Phase calculation in the frequency band with maximum coherence, as well as the correlation between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and near-infrared spectroscopy relative total tissue hemoglobin (HbT) or regional oxygen saturation (rSO2), accurately discriminated functional from dysfunctional autoregulation. Neither hypoxia-ischemia nor hypothermia affected the accuracy of these indices. Coherence alone and gain had low diagnostic value relative to phase and correlation. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that phase shift is the most accurate component of autoregulation monitoring in the developing brain, and it can be measured using correlation or by calculating phase when coherence is maximal. Phase and correlation autoregulation indices from MAP and rSO2 and vasoreactivity indices from MAP and HbT are accurate metrics that are suitable for clinical HIE studies.","Govindan, Rathinaswamy B; Brady, Ken M; Massaro, An N; Perin, Jamie; Jennings, Jacky M; DuPlessis, Adre J; Koehler, Raymond C; Lee, Jennifer K",Developmental neuroscience,2,5

Although subjects played a role (acting) as simulated participants (SPs) for simulation, workshop content and role-play also applied to them personally. We aimed to explore the effect that learning frailty-focused content, scripts, and portrayal of prefrail and frail older adults has on older adult SPs. METHODS Qualitative focus group. Participants included older adults older than 70 years (N = 6). PROCEDURE Focus group questions pertained to (1) the SP experience, (2) thoughts and emotions throughout the SP experience, and (3) applicability of workshop content and SP experience to personal life. The focus group lasted 90 min, was digitally recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Authors independently coded transcripts to identify categories and supporting quotations. Categories and subcategories were condensed and modified through iterative discussions. Descriptive content analysis was utilized for data analysis. RESULTS Six categories and 2 subcategories emerged, including (1) inevitability of aging: not playing a role (sub: inevitability of death), (2) shifting perceptions: how aging impacts thought and actions, (3) time as a factor: getting information sooner, (4) changing behavior/safety: mental recalibration, (5) attitude as a determining factor (sub: loss of independence), and (6) sharing information with others. CONCLUSION The study supports the use of frailty-focused communication with older adults to prompt contemplation of aging and frailty and eventual decline/death. Providing information earlier in the aging trajectory enables time for behavior change that can prevent and delay frailty and mitigate untoward outcomes (falls, hospitalizations).","Lee, Deborah A; Maxwell, Cathy A; Miller, Sally",Journal of trauma nursing : the official journal of the Society of Trauma Nurses,2,31

Surgical approaches are limited in aesthetic outcomes. Three innovative surgical approaches based on selection criteria are presented for enhanced and more predictable wound healing and posterior hairline cosmesis. Methods ""Bat excision"" and secondary intention healing are shown for 2 of 37 representative patients and confined to the area between the occipital protuberance superiorly and posterior hairline inferiorly. Lesions with ≤3 cm vertical width were required to be in the lower one-half portion of this zone. The same procedure was aided by the use of tension sutures for lesions with >3 cm vertical width area within the defined zone. It was also suitable for breaches of the 2 horizontal lines defined above but generally located in the nuchal area. Debridement of premature epithelizing granulation tissue is shown in 2 additional patients. Results Use of these procedures with debridement in selected patients allowed fine control over the hairline shape and resulted in narrower scars. The mean maximum sagittal width of excised lesions was 5.4 cm. Excised lesion width ≥6.5 cm was highly predictive of >2.5 cm wide scar (P = 0.001). Conclusion Innovative procedures based on selection criteria can extend the approach of acne keloidalis nuchae excision with secondary intention healing to better control the final hairline shape and minimize scarring.","Umar, Sanusi; David, Consuelo V; Castillo, Jason R; Queller, Jenna; Sandhu, Sophia",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

However, to date, a paucity of robust, reliable immune-related biomarkers has been identified that are capable of estimating prognosis in HNSCC patients. METHODS High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed in tumors and matched adjacent tissues from five HNSCC patients, and the immune signatures expression of 730 immune-related transcripts selected from the nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel were assessed. Survival analyzes were performed in a training cohort, consisting of 416 HNSCC cases, retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A prognostic signature was built, using elastic net-penalized Cox regression and backward, stepwise Cox regression analyzes. The outcomes were validated by an independent cohort of 115 HNSCC patients, using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry staining. Cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) was also used to estimate the relative fractions of 22 immune-cell types and their correlations coefficients with prognostic biomarkers. RESULTS Collectively, 248 immune-related genes were differentially expressed in paired tumors and normal tissues using RNA sequencing. After process screening in the training TCGA cohort, four immune-related genes (PVR, TNFRSF12A, IL21R, and SOCS1) were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Integrating these genes with Path_N stage, a multiplex model was built and suggested better performance in determining 5 years OS (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC)=0.709) than others. Further protein-based validation was conducted in 115 HNSCC patients. Similarly, high expression of PVR and TNFRSF12A were associated with poor OS (Kaplan-Meier p=0.017 and 0.0032), while high expression of IL21R and SOCS1 indicated favorable OS (Kaplan-Meier p<0.0001 and =0.0018). The integrated model with Path_N stage still demonstrated efficacy in OS evaluation (Kaplan-Meier p<0.0001, ROC AUC=0.893). Besides, the four prognostic genes were significantly correlated with activated CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, follicular helper T cells and regulatory T cells, implying the possible involvement of these genes in the immunoregulation and development of HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS The well-established model encompassing both immune-related biomarkers and clinicopathological factor might serve as a promising tool for the prognostic prediction of HNSCC.","Yao, Yao; Yan, Zhongyi; Lian, Senlin; Wei, Liangnian; Zhou, Chao; Feng, Dongju; Zhang, Yuan; Yang, Jianrong; Li, Ming; Chen, Yun",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,2,31

The use of ENDS is increasing rapidly worldwide, yet the BP characteristics of the PG + GL system have been characterized as the mixtures; here we re-do this, but significantly, also study the effects of added water and nicotine. BP values at 1 atmosphere pressure were measured over the full binary composition range.

BPs of PG + GL mixtures were then tested in the presence of additives such as water (2.5 and 5 mol% added) and nicotine (3 mol%). Water was found to decrease the BP of PG + GL mixtures significantly at all compositions tested, and nicotine was found to decrease the BP of PG + GL mixtures containing ~75 GL: 25 PG (by moles) or more. The effect of added water (5, 10, and 15 mol% added) on electronic cigarette degradation production (some aldehydes and formaldehyde hemiacetals) was examined and found to have no significant impact on solvent (PG or GL) degradation for the particular device used.","Duell, Anna K; Pankow, James F; Gillette, Samantha M; Peyton, David H",Chemical engineering communications,2,1

To determine whether IL-1beta elicits these responses through an upregulation of VEGF, transgenic mice that overexpress IL-1beta in the lens were evaluated at various time points for the localization of VEGF, the location and extent of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown, and the origin and extent of neovascularization (NV). In homozygous and heterozygous transgenic mice, but not controls, intense VEGF immunoreactivity was scattered throughout the retina at postnatal days 5-7 (P5-7), just after the onset of inflammatory cell infiltration. VEGF staining in the retina remained widespread, but weak from P9-15. Beginning at P15, the intensity of VEGF immunoreactivity achieved a second peak, which it maintained through adulthood. This peak coincided with significant retinal destruction due to massive inflammation. The onset of BRB breakdown coincided with the upregulation of VEGF (P5-7) and widespread BRB breakdown was demonstrated from about P9. From P9-12, aggregates of cells positive for Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin-B4, a marker for vascular endothelial cells, formed on the retinal surface. These cells migrated into the retina at P12-15 with the more superficial cells forming a network of vessels and the deeper cells remaining in small clusters, thus demonstrating that NV occurs much later than BRB breakdown. Non-transgenic FVB/N mice, which undergo retinal degeneration beginning at about P9, also demonstrate the latter peak of VEGF upregulation and the accompanying BRB breakdown, but not the early upregulation. VEGF immunostaining of transgenic and non-transgenic mouse retinas was eliminated by pre-incubation of the VEGF antibodies with VEGF peptide. The data suggest that the early peak of VEGF upregulation (P5-7) and its accompanying BRB breakdown is due to IL-1beta expression and is likely to be dependent on inflammatory cell infiltration. The latter peak appears to be related to retinal destruction.","Vinores, S A; Xiao, W-H; Zimmerman, R; Whitcup, S M; Wawrousek, E F",Histology and histopathology,2,17

We followed patients who received RFA for BE containing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and/or early-stage cancer for 5 years to determine the durability of treatment response. METHODS We followed 54 patients with BE (2-12 cm), previously enrolled in 4 consecutive cohort studies in which they underwent focal endoscopic resection in case of visible lesions (n = 40 [72%]), followed by serial RFA every 3 months. Patients underwent high-resolution endoscopy with narrow-band imaging at 6 and 12 months after treatment and then annually for 5 years (median, 61 months; interquartile range, 53-65 months); random biopsy samples were collected from neosquamous epithelium and gastric cardia. After 5 years, endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic resection of neosquamous epithelium were performed. Outcomes included sustained complete remission of neoplasia or intestinal metaplasia (IM), IM in gastric cardia, or buried glands in neosquamous epithelium. RESULTS After 5 years, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed sustained complete remission of neoplasia and intestinal metaplasia in 90% of patients; neoplasia recurred in 3 patients and was managed endoscopically. Focal IM in the cardia was found in 19 of 54 patients (35%), in 53 of 1143 gastric cardia biopsies (4.6%). The incidence of IM of the cardia did not increase over time; and IM was diagnosed based on only a single biopsy in 89% of patients. Buried glands were detected in 3 of 3543 neosquamous epithelium biopsies (0.08%, from 3 patients). No endoscopic resection samples had buried glands. CONCLUSIONS Among patients who have undergone RFA with or without endoscopic resection for neoplastic BE, 90% remain in remission at 5-year follow-up, with all recurrences managed endoscopically. This treatment approach is therefore an effective and durable alternative to esophagectomy; www.trialregister.nl number, NTR2938.","Phoa, K Nadine; Pouw, Roos E; van Vilsteren, Frederike G I; Sondermeijer, Carine M T; Ten Kate, Fiebo J W; Visser, Mike; Meijer, Sybren L; van Berge Henegouwen, Mark I; Weusten, Bas L A M; Schoon, Erik J; Mallant-Hent, Rosalie C; Bergman, Jacques J G H M",Gastroenterology,2,17

Evidence-based qualification programmes via e-learning offer valuable tools for attenuating the world's huge double burden of both under- and overnutrition in early childhood. We evaluated use and learner satisfaction of a global e-learning programme on early nutrition and lifestyle addressing international healthcare professionals. METHODS We implemented the Early Nutrition Specialist Programme (ENS) with six interactive e-learning courses on early nutrition building on more than ten years of experience with global e-learning platforms, expert knowledge and an international network in the subject field. We collected descriptive and explorative evaluation data on usage and learner satisfaction with a questionnaire and log data over three years among 4003 learners from 48 countries. RESULTS Results show high completion of the ENS programme, with 85.5% of learners finalizing the programme after enrollment into the first of six courses. Very good results were provided for learner satisfaction with the courses (96.7% of users), for increasing understanding of the topic (97.4%) and matching the indicated time investment (94.4%). Most predominant themes in the open text fields of user feedback questionnaires were ""Increase interactivity or number of audio-visuals"", ""Content suggestions or more examples"" and ""Technical (quality) issues or navigation problems"". CONCLUSIONS The ENS programme evaluation shows high completion rates and level of satisfaction by learners from numerous countries. The different needs for Continuing Medical Education (CME) of healthcare professionals in diverse healthcare system settings can be met by a joint e-learning qualification programme. Further optimizations will be implemented based on user feedback. More research with a learning analytics approach may help to further identify the most effective and efficient didactic and pedagogic elements of e-learning.","Brands, Brigitte; Tran, Ngoc Nhan; Baudendistel-Happ, Erin; Sanchez-Garcia, Marina; Fischer, Martin R; Koletzko, Berthold",Nutrients,2,16
75621,75621,75621,A paradigm shift in the treatment of extreme prematurity: the artificial placenta.,13.287402,7.9699736,2014,"Due to COVID-19 outbreak, to lighten the burden of acute and critical care hospitals, some respiratory rehabilitation departments have been used to host patients with COVID-19 in the post-acute phase. This new and unexpected situation required a change of roles and scheduling of the rehabilitation teams. In this manuscript we describe the unexpected and urgent organizational change of the Cardio-Pulmonary Rehabilitation (CPR) service during the COVID-19 emergency in a Northern Italian rehabilitation hospital, focusing on the Respiratory Physiotherapists' (RPTs) role. A quick three-days complete reorganization of the entire hospital was needed. A COVID-19 care team including a multidisciplinary panel of physicians, nurses, and RPTs was quickly performed to manage 90 beds for post acute patients with COVID-19. Within the team, the RPTs changed their shifts, so as to be available 16h per day, 7 days out of 7. Remodelled tasks in charge of RPTs were: oxygen therapy daily monitoring, non invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) delivery, pronation and postural changes to improve oxygenation, reconditioning with leg/arm cranking and exercises, initial and final patients' functional assessment by short-physical performance battery (SPPB) and 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-STS) to evaluate motor conditions and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. Three ""what-to-do"" algorithms were developed to guide: i) oxygen de-escalation by reducing inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2); ii) oxygenation improvement through the use of Venturi mask; iii) reconditioning and physical activity. One-hundred seventy patients were treated in one month. As main topics, RPTs have been involved in oxygen therapy management in almost a third of the admitted patients, reconditioning exercises in 60% of the cases, and initial and final functional motor capacity assessment in all patients. Details of activities performed by the RPT in one typical working day are also shown. Our reorganization has exploited the professional skills and clinical expertise of the RPTs. This re-organization can provide practical insights to other facilities that are facing this crisis, and may be a starting point for implementing post-COVID-19 rehabilitation. Future studies will have to improve and review this organization.","Simonelli, Carla; Paneroni, Mara; Fokom, Aubin Georges; Saleri, Manuela; Speltoni, Ilaria; Favero, Irene; Garofali, Francesca; Scalvini, Simonetta; Vitacca, Michele",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,2,28

In this review, we explore the historical development, regulatory database and clinical literature of sutures to gain a fuller picture of suture advances to date. First, we examine historical shifts in suture manufacturing companies and review suture regulatory databases to understand the forces driving suture development. Second, we gather the existing clinical evidence of suture efficacy from reviewing the clinical literature and the Food and Drug Administration database in order to identify to what extent sutures have been clinically evaluated and the key clinical areas that would benefit from improved suture materials. Finally, we apply tissue engineering and regenerative medicine design hypotheses to suture materials to identify routes by which bioactive sutures can be designed and passed through regulatory hurdles, to improve surgical outcomes. Our review of the clinical literature revealed that many of the sutures currently in use have been available for decades, yet have never been clinically evaluated. Since suture design and development is industry driven, incremental modifications have allowed for a steady outflow of products while maintaining a safe regulatory position and limiting costs. Until recently, there has been little academic interest in suture development, however the rise of regenerative medicine strategies is shifting the suture paradigm from an inert material, which mechanically approximates tissue, to a bioactive material, which also actively promotes cell-directed repair and a positive healing response. These materials hold significant therapeutic potential, but could be associated with an increased regulatory burden, cost, and clinical evaluation compared with current devices.","Abhari, Roxanna E; Martins, Joana A; Morris, Hayley L; Mouthuy, Pierre-Alexis; Carr, Andrew",Journal of biomaterials applications,2,1

Here we discuss ethical, social, and technical challenges to the concept of authorship that may impede the recognition of contributions to a scholarly work. Recent work in the field of authorship shows that shifting to a more inclusive contributorship approach may address these challenges. Recent efforts to enable better recognition of contributions to scholarship include the development of the Contributor Role Ontology (CRO), which extends the CRediT taxonomy and can be used in information systems for structuring contributions. We also introduce the Contributor Attribution Model (CAM), which provides a simple data model that relates the contributor to research objects via the role that they played, as well as the provenance of the information. Finally, requirements for the adoption of a contributorship-based approach are discussed.","Vasilevsky, Nicole A; Hosseini, Mohammad; Teplitzky, Samantha; Ilik, Violeta; Mohammadi, Ehsan; Schneider, Juliane; Kern, Barbara; Colomb, Julien; Edmunds, Scott C; Gutzman, Karen; Himmelstein, Daniel S; White, Marijane; Smith, Britton; O'Keefe, Lisa; Haendel, Melissa; Holmes, Kristi L",Accountability in research,2,11

The current literature focuses largely on tissue expansion for breast reconstruction and in the context of burn and pediatric skin/soft tissue replacement; however, less traditional applications are also prevalent. The aim of this study was to systematically review the utilization of tissue expansion in such less well-characterized circumstances. Methods The authors conducted a systematic review of all publications describing non-breast applications of tissue expansion. Variables regarding expander specifications, expansion process, and complications were collected and further analyzed. Results A total of 565 publications were identified. Of these, 166 publications described tissue expansion for ""less traditional"" indications, which fell into 5 categories: ear reconstruction, cranioplasty, abdominal wall reconstruction, orthopedic procedures, and genital (penile/scrotal and vaginal/vulva) reconstruction. While lower extremity expansion is known to have high complication rates, tissue expander failure, infection, and exposure rates were in fact highest for penile/scrotal (failure: 18.5%; infection: 15.5%; exposure: 12.5%) and vaginal/vulva (failure: 20.6%; infection: 10.3%; exposure: 6.9%) reconstruction. Conclusions Tissue expansion enables index operations by providing additional skin before definitive reconstruction. Tissue expanders are a valuable option along the reconstructive ladder because they obviate the need for free tissue transfer. Although tissue expansion comes with inherent risk, aggregate outcome failures of the final reconstruction are similar to published rates of complications without pre-expansion. Thus, although tissue expansion requires a staged approach, it remains a valuable option in facilitating a variety of reconstructive procedures.","Langdell, Hannah C; Taskindoust, Mahsa; Levites, Heather A; Mateas, Catalin; Sergesketter, Amanda R; Kaplan, Samantha J; Marcus, Jeffrey R; Erdmann, Detlev",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

From a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb - 1 , events containing one muon or electron and two or three jets are analysed. The cross section is measured as a function of the top quark transverse momentum ( p T ), rapidity, and polarisation angle, the charged lepton p T and rapidity, and the p T of the W boson from the top quark decay. In addition, the charge ratio is measured differentially as a function of the top quark, charged lepton, and W boson kinematic observables. The results are found to be in agreement with standard model predictions using various next-to-leading-order event generators and sets of parton distribution functions. Additionally, the spin asymmetry, sensitive to the top quark polarisation, is determined from the differential distribution of the polarisation angle at parton level to be 0.440 ± 0.070 , in agreement with the standard model prediction.","Sirunyan, A M;

Several studies have attempted to characterise the physical demands of rugby league match-play, but these studies often have relatively small sample sizes based on one or two clubs, which makes generalisation of the findings difficult. Therefore, the aim of this review was to synthesise studies that investigated the physical demands of professional rugby league match-play. METHODS SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, MEDLINE (EBSCO) and Embase (EBSCO) databases were systematically searched from inception until October 2018. Articles were included if they (1) recruited professional rugby league athletes aged ≥ 18 years and (2) provided at least one match-play relevant variable (including playing time, total and relative distance, repeat high-intensity efforts (RHIE), efforts per RHIE, accelerations and decelerations, total and relative collisions). Meta-analyses were used to provide pooled estimates ± 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS A total of 30 studies were included. Pooled estimates indicated that, compared to adjustables and backs, forwards have less playing time (- 17.2 ± 5.6 and - 25.6 ± 5.8 min, respectively), cover less 'slow-speed' (- 2230 ± 735 and - 1348 ± 655 m, respectively) and 'high-speed' distance (- 139 ± 108 and - 229 ± 101 m, respectively), but complete more relative RHIEs (+ 0.05 ± 0.05 and + 0.08 ± 0.04 per minute, respectively), and total (+ 12.0 ± 8.1 and + 12.8 ± 7.2 collisions, respectively) and relative collisions (+ 0.32 ± 0.22 and + 0.41 ± 0.22 collisions per minute, respectively). Notably, when the distance was expressed relative to playing time, forwards were not different from adjustables and backs in slow-speed (P ≥ 0.295) and high-speed (P ≥ 0.889) relative distance. The adjustables and backs subgroups were similar in most variables, except playing time (shorter for adjustables, - 8.5 ± 6.2 min), slow-speed distance (greater for adjustables, + 882 ± 763 m) and total relative distance (greater for adjustables, + 11.3 ± 5.2 m·min-1). There were no significant differences between positional groups for efforts per RHIE, accelerations and decelerations (P ≥ 0.745). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate the unique physical demands of each playing position and should be considered by strength and conditioning and tactical coaches when planning for professional rugby league performance.

79238,79238,79238,Multipotent adult progenitor cells for hypoxic-ischemic injury in the preterm brain.,13.578549,7.7758603,2015,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Moderate to severe hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is treated with splenectomy. However, total splenectomy leads to decreased immunologic function with the risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis. Splenic preservation is postulated as a method to avoid this potentially fatal complication. Although mainly performed through laparotomy, we report our experience with a laparoscopic approach to partial splenectomy for HS. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted on 9 laparoscopic partial splenectomies performed for HS at our institution. Follow-up was from 1 to 3.5 years. Data included preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, absolute reticulocyte count, splenic size, operative time, complications, and length of stay. RESULTS All patients successfully underwent laparoscopic partial splenectomy with a radiologically determined upper-pole remnant of 10% to 30% and preservation of the blood supply through the upper short gastric arteries. The mean preoperative spleen length was 13 cm. Mean hospital stay was 3.6 days (range, 1-6 days). There was 1 intraoperative complication (a small bowel tear during spleen extraction) and 2 minor postoperative complications (ileus and wound infection). One patient underwent completion total splenectomy 2 years after partial splenectomy. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic partial splenectomy is a feasible and effective procedure that addresses the hematologic consequences of HS while retaining a portion of functional spleen, in addition to conferring the advantages of laparoscopy.","Slater, Bethany J; Chan, Frandics P; Davis, Karen; Dutta, Sanjeev",Journal of pediatric surgery,2,1
79472,79472,79472,Big Data for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Modeling.,13.229025,7.823156,2016,"BACKGROUND The left atrial (LA) appendage (LAA) is the main source of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation. This study addressed initial pressure resistance of surgical LAA closures. METHODS In an experimental model, pneumatic pressure resistances of different surgical closure techniques were examined, and variations in technique and access were studied. In preparations of the LA from freshly slaughtered pigs, pneumatic pressure was applied to the LAA. Burst pressures (mbar) of various closure techniques (n = 12 specimens per group) were measured: (1) epicardial double-layer suture, (2) epicardial stapler closure (staple height 2 mm), (3) epicardial stapler closure (staple height 4, 4.5, and 5 mm), (4) endocardial inverse double-layer suture, (5) endocardial inverse stapler seam (staple height 2 mm), and (6) endocardial inverse stapler seam (staple height 4, 4.5, and 5 mm). RESULTS The mean burst pressure in group 1 was 175.5 ± 19.35 mbar. There was no significant difference compared with group 2 (174.5 ± 28.45 mbar) or group 3 (176 ± 27.69 mbar). Group 4 scored significantly higher than all other groups (198.9 ± 18.35 mbar). Burst pressures in group 5 (136.2 ± 16.68 mbar) were significantly lower than in group 4 and in group 6 (165.1 ± 21.94 mbar), but the differences between groups 5 and 6 were also significant. CONCLUSIONS In an ex vivo model, double-layer suturing of the inverted LAA from an internal LA access led to higher burst pressures compared with epicardial suturing and with both endocardial and epicardial stapled closures.","Mirow, Nikolas; Vogt, Sebastian; Moosdorf, Rainer; Kirschbaum, Andreas",The Annals of thoracic surgery,2,28

Equally important, understanding the impact of the virus on the host system in convalescent patients, healthy otherwise or with co-morbidities, is expected to aid in developing effective strategies in the management of patients afflicted with the disease. Viruses possess the uncanny ability to redirect host metabolism to serve their needs and also limit host immune response to ensure their survival. An ever-increasingly powerful approach uses metabolomics to uncover diverse molecular signatures that influence a wide array of host signalling networks in different viral infections. This would also help integrate experimental findings from individual studies to yield robust evidence. In addition, unravelling the molecular mechanisms harnessed by both viruses and tumours in their host metabolism will help broaden the repertoire of therapeutic tools available to combat viral disease.","Ganesh, Goutham V; Mohanram, Ramkumar K",Reviews in medical virology,2,16

METHODS Sixty patients undergoing surgical valve replacement were randomized into the HP group (n = 30) with an HA380 hemoperfusion cartridge in the CPB circuit or the control group (n = 30) with the conventional CPB circuit. The results of routine blood tests, blood biochemical indexes, and inflammatory factors were analyzed at V0 (pre-CPB), V1 (CPB 30 min), V2 (ICU 0 h), V3 (ICU 6 h), and V4 (ICU 24 h). RESULTS The HP group had significantly lower levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Significant estimation of group differences in the generalized estimating equation (GEE) models was also observed in IL-6 and IL-10. The HP group had significantly lower levels of creatinine (Cr), aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBil) compared to the control group. The estimation of differences of Cr, AST, and TBil all reached statistical significance in GEE results. The HP group had significantly less vasopressor requirement and shorter mechanical ventilation time and ICU stay time as compared to the control group. CONCLUSION The HA380 hemoperfusion cartridge could effectively reduce the systemic inflammatory responses and improve postoperative recovery of patients during adult CPB.","He, Zijian; Lu, Hongyu; Jian, Xuhua; Li, Guanhua; Xiao, Dengke; Meng, Qingqing; Chen, Jimei; Zhou, Chengbin",Blood purification,2,1

Anticoagulant treatments have demonstrated their efficacy in preventing VTE. However, when the bleeding risk is high, they are contraindicated, and mechanical devices are recommended. To date, mechanical prophylaxis has not been rigorously evaluated in any trials in ICU patients. METHODS In this multicenter, open-label, randomized trial with blinded evaluation of endpoints, we randomly assigned 407 patients with a high risk of bleeding to receive intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) associated with graduated compression stockings (GCS) or GCS alone for 6 days during their ICU stay. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a VTE between days 1 and 6, including nonfatal symptomatic documented VTE, or death due to a pulmonary embolism, or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis detected by ultrasonography systematically performed on day 6. RESULTS The primary outcome was assessed in 363 patients (89.2%). By day 6, the incidence of the primary outcome was 5.6% (10 of 179 patients) in the IPC + GCS group and 9.2% (17 of 184 patients) in the GCS group (relative risk 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.28-1.28; p = 0.19). Tolerance of IPC was poor in only 12 patients (6.0%). No intergroup difference in mortality rate was observed. CONCLUSIONS With the limitation of a low statistical power, our results do not support the superiority of the combination of IPC + GCS compared to GCS alone to prevent VTE in ICU patients at high risk of bleeding.","Vignon, Philippe; Dequin, Pierre-François; Renault, Anne; Mathonnet, Armelle; Paleiron, Nicolas; Imbert, Audrey; Chatellier, Delphine; Gissot, Valérie; Lhéritier, Gwenaelle; Aboyans, Victor; Prat, Gwenael; Garot, Denis; Boulain, Thierry; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Bressollette, Luc; Delluc, Aurélien; Lacut, Karine",Intensive care medicine,2,11

MATERIALS AND METHODS The early complications that occurred within 30 days after RFA at a single institution from January 2000 to July 2010 were reviewed in order to evaluate the morbidity, mortality, and risk factors associated with the complications. In total, 1,211 patients (845 men, 70.5%) with a mean age of 68 years (range, 27-88 years) underwent 1,843 RFA procedures. RESULTS The overall incidence rate of complications was 6.8% (125 cases). Major complications (n=36, 2%) included liver abscess (n=15, 0.8%), intraperitoneal bleeding (n=8, 0.4%), liver failure (n=5, 0.3%), variceal bleeding (n=3, 0.2%), haemothorax (n=2, 0.1%), cholecystitis (n=2, 0.1%), and bowel perforation (n=1, 0.1%). Among the minor complications (n=89, 4.8%), the most common was the post RFA syndrome accompanied by pain and fever (n=75, 4.1%). Other minor complications included significant pleural effusion (n=7, 0.4%), skin wound infection (n=4, 0.2%), and thermal injuries to the skin (n=3, 0.2%). Procedural infections significantly increased with tumour size (OR=1.379; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.191-1.579; p<0.001), and multiple overlapping ablations (OR=1.118; 95% CI, 1.019-1.227, p=0.018). Thrombocytopenia (<50,000/μl), prothrombin time, and serum albumin level were significantly associated with post-RFA bleeding episodes (p=0.041, p=0.021, and p=0.003, respectively). The overall mortality rate was 0.3% (three cases of hepatic failure, two case of sepsis, and one case of renal failure). CONCLUSIONS RFA is a safe and effective local treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Careful selection of patients and appropriate RFA planning could decrease procedural mortality and morbidity.","Park, J G; Park, S Y; Tak, W Y; Kweon, Y O; Jang, S Y; Lee, Y R; Hur, K; Lee, H J; Lee, H W",Clinical radiology,2,20

However, these approaches are slow to develop and may be limited in their production, thus restricting the patients who can access these treatments. BiTEs exhibit a particularly short half-life and difficult production. The development of an approach allowing simplified development, delivery, and in vivo production would be an important advance. Here we describe the development of a designed synthetic DNA plasmid, which we optimized to permit high expression of an anti-HER2 antibody (HER2dMAb) and delivered it into animals through adaptive electroporation. HER2dMAb was efficiently expressed in vitro and in vivo, reaching levels of 50 μg/ml in mouse sera. Mechanistically, HER2dMAb blocked HER2 signaling and induced antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. HER2dMAb delayed tumor progression for HER2-expressing ovarian and breast cancer models. We next used the HER2dMAb single-chain variable fragment portion to engineer a DNA-encoded BiTE (DBiTE). This HER2DBiTE was expressed in vivo for approximately 4 months after a single administration. The HER2DBiTE was highly cytolytic and delayed cancer progression in mice. These studies illustrate an approach to generate DBiTEs in vivo, which represent promising immunotherapies for HER2+ tumors, including ovarian and potentially other cancers.","Perales-Puchalt, Alfredo; Duperret, Elizabeth K; Yang, Xue; Hernandez, Patricia; Wojtak, Krzysztof; Zhu, Xizhou; Jung, Seang-Hwan; Tello-Ruiz, Edgar; Wise, Megan C; Montaner, Luis J; Muthumani, Kar; Weiner, David B",JCI insight,2,1

In addition to the usual challenges inherent to device trials (such as the difficulty of double-blinding and potential for bias), studies of implantable monitoring devices present unique difficulties because they involve assessment of therapeutic end points for diagnostic devices. Problems include the lack of uniform approaches to treatment in study protocols for device alerts or out-of-range values, and the requirement of levels of evidence traditionally associated with therapeutic devices to establish effectiveness and safety. In this Review, the approaches used to deal with these issues are discussed, including the use of objective primary end points with blinded adjudication, identical duration of follow-up and number of encounters for patients in active monitoring and control groups, and treatment recommendations between groups that are consistent with international guidelines. Remote monitoring devices hold promise for reducing the rate of hospitalization among patients with HF.

Careful attention should be paid to avoidance of postoperative bile leakage during surgical treatment. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report the case of a 74-year-old man who visited our department complaining of right upper abdominal pain and elevated serum levels of the liver enzymes. Computed tomography revealed hepatic cysts including a large one measuring 16cm in diameter in Segments IV and VIII. Percutaneous drainage of the cyst revealed bile-staining of the cyst fluid. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography demonstrated the presence of a cyst-biliary communication. We performed open deroofing of the cyst. During the operation, the biliary fistula was invisible, however, air injection into the bile duct through the stump of the cystic duct caused release of air bubbles from the cyst cavity, which allowed us to detect the small biliary orifice and repair it successfully by suture. DISCUSSION We utilized the intraoperative air leak test, which has previously been reported to be effective for preventing postoperative bile leakage in patients undergoing hepatectomy to detect of a small cyst-biliary communication in a case undergoing non-parasitic hepatic cyst surgery. CONCLUSION An intraoperative air leak test may be a useful test during surgical treatment of non-parasitic hepatic cysts with biliary communication.","Shimizu, Atsushi; Hata, Shojiro; Kobayashi, Kaoru; Teruya, Masanori; Kaminishi, Michio",International journal of surgery case reports,2,1

METHODS We obtained random urine samples from 9,275 cases of acute first stroke and 9,726 matched controls (8,761 matched pairs for conditional analysis) from 27 countries and estimated the 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion, a surrogate for intake, using the Tanaka formula. Using multivariable conditional logistic regression, we determined the associations of estimated 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion with stroke and its subtypes. RESULTS The mean estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium urinary excretion was 3·29g/day and 1·57g/day, with 0·01% of participants having both low sodium (<2·0g/day) and high potassium excretion (>3·5g/day). There was a moderate positive correlation between sodium and potassium excretion (r=0·4435, P<0.001) and between sodium excretion and blood pressure (P<0.001). Compared with an estimated urinary sodium excretion of 2·8-3·5g/day (second quartile, reference), higher (>4·26g/day) (OR 1.81;95%CI,1.65-2.00) and lower (<2·8g/day) sodium excretion (OR 1.39;95%CI,1.26-1.53) were significantly associated with increased risk of stroke. The stroke risk associated with the highest quartile of sodium intake (sodium excretion >4·26g/day) was significantly greater (P<0.001) for intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) (OR 2.38;95%CI,1.93-2.92) than for ischemic stroke (OR 1.67;95%CI,1.50-1.87), and greater for large vessel and small vessel ischemic stroke than for cardioembolic ischemic stroke. Urinary potassium was inversely and linearly associated with risk of stroke, and stronger for ischemic stroke than ICH (P=0.026). In an analysis of combined sodium and potassium excretion, the combination of high potassium intake (>1·58g/day) and moderate sodium intake (2.8-3.5 g/day) was associated with the lowest risk of stroke. CONCLUSION The association of sodium intake and stroke is J-shaped, with high sodium intake a stronger risk factor for intracerebral haemorrhage than ischemic stroke. Our data suggest that moderate sodium intake - rather than low sodium intake - combined with high potassium intake may be associated with the lowest risk of stroke and expected to be a more feasible combined dietary target.","Judge, Conor; O'Donnell, Martin J; Hankey, Graeme J; Rangarajan, Sumathy; Chin, Siu Lim; Rao-Melacini, Purnima; Ferguson, John; Smyth, Andrew; Xavier, Denis; Lisheng, Liu; Zhang, Hongye; Lopez-Jaramillo, Patricio; Damasceno, Albertino; Langhorne, Peter; Rosengren, Annika; Dans, Antonio L; Elsayed, Ahmed; Avezum, Alvaro; Mondo, Charles; Ryglewicz, Danuta; Czlonkowska, Anna; Pogosova, Nana; Weimar, Christian; Diaz, Rafael; Yusoff, Khalid; Yusufali, Afzalhussein; Oguz, Aytekin; Wang, Xingyu; Lanas, Fernando; Ogah, Okechukwu S; Ogunniyi, Adesola; Iversen, Helle K; Malaga, German; Rumboldt, Zvonko; Oveisgharan, Shahram; Hussain, Fawaz Al; Yusuf, Salim",American journal of hypertension,2,1

However, beside the administration of physiological saline, local rewarming, local disinfection and symptomatic medications, today no causal therapy is known which would accelerate angiogenesis and wound healing. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of dilative acting drugs on microcirculation, angiogenesis and leukocyte behavior. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ears of male hairless mice (n=40) were inflicted with full thickness frostbites using a cold air jet. Then the affects of four intraperitoneal injections of isosorbitdinitrate (ISDN, n=10), l-nitroarginine-methyl-ester (l-NAME, n=10), selenium (n=10) or sodium chloride (n=10; each administered to one of four corresponding study groups), on microcirculation, leukocyte-endothelial interaction and angiogenesis were investigated over a 12-day period using intravital fluorescent microscopy. RESULTS Angiogenesis was most improved by ISDN (36.8 vs. 54.5% non-perfused area on day 3, 3.9 vs. 17.0% on day 7 compared to selenium, p<0.006). Venular diameter was most significantly dilated in the ISDN-group, l-NAME showed significantly decreased diameter over the complete time of 12 days. ISDN had positive influences on edema formation, which was significantly reduced compared to control (27% lower values compared to control; p=0.007 on day 3). The l-NAME-group showed the significant highest leukocyte-adhesion compared to control on days 7 and 12 (53% resp. 58% higher, p<0.006). CONCLUSION Overall, out of all the drugs tested, ISDN improved angiogenesis, dilated venules and decreased edema formation and therefore seems to have the greatest positive impact on these crucial parameters after frostbite injury.","Goertz, O; Haddad, H; von der Lohe, L; Lauer, H; Hirsch, T; Daigeler, A; Lehnhardt, M; Kolbenschlag, J",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,2,1

Benefits have been shown to be significant within certain parameters, but a systematic review of the economic evidence across multiple sectors including health, education and social welfare will have the capacity to inform policy relative to the full range of social determinants. This review will take a broad approach, encompassing a range of costs and benefits to enable the identification of the most beneficial investments in early childhood and to highlight gaps in current research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Economic evaluations incorporating both costs and long-term outcomes of early childhood interventions and programmes will be included. Outcomes may be valued in monetary units or quantified non-monetary units (eg, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), disability-adjusted life years (DALY)). Results will be expressed as a ratio according to the outcome; with monetary outcomes expressed as cost-benefit ratios or return on investment, and non-monetary outcomes expressed as cost per QALY or DALY. The target population is children aged 0-5 years.Extensive database searches across sectors will be undertaken.

METHODS Interested participants, n=28, actively employed as medical personnel, support staff and emergency responders, in the Midwestern USA in May-June of 2020, provided informed consent and were randomised to complete either low-dose or high-dose intervention, one time daily for 1 week via smartphone application. Each daily intervention included expressive writing, adaptive emotion regulation activity and (one vs two) positive emotion-generation activities, lasting 3-6 min a day. Ratings of negative and positive emotion were provided before and after each activity daily. Analyses tested compliance, acceptability, as well as efficacy at increasing positive emotion and decreasing negative emotion with each use and across time.

However, there was a clear advantage for individuals in the high-dose condition as daily boosts in positive emotion were significantly greater (an additional 9.4%) B=0.47, p=0.018. Overall, compliance was good. Acceptability ratings were good for those who completed the follow-up assessment. CONCLUSION Front-line personnel, including medical staff and emergency responders, are experiencing unprecedented psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This investigation suggests both feasibility and efficacy for a brief, daily, ambulatory intervention which could provide essential psychological support to individuals at risk in the workplace.","Coifman, Karin G; Disabato, David D; Seah, T H Stanley; Ostrowski-Delahanty, Sarah; Palmieri, Patrick A; Delahanty, Douglas L; Gunstad, John",Occupational and environmental medicine,2,1

Deslorelin implants have been widely available in Europe since 2008. Little, if anything, is known about the interval between treatment and onset of sterility, as well as semen quality, after treatment in tom cats. The purpose of this study was to investigate semen quality and interval to sterility in tom cats treated with a 9.4 mg deslorelin implant. Methods Fifteen healthy adult tom cats were treated with a 9.4 mg deslorelin implant (Suprelorin 12). For each cat, semen collection and a GnRH stimulation test (intramuscular administration of 50 μg gonadorelin [Fertagyl], followed by blood sampling 1 h later, to assay serum testosterone) were performed on the first consultation and then repeated every 15 days until complete sterility was achieved. Semen collection was performed by introducing a 14 cm, open-end feline catheter (Argyle) 9 cm into the distal urethra 10 mins after sedation by intramuscular injection of 100 μg/kg medetomidine (Domitor). Results Semen collection was not successful in all cats at each attempt. In the first month after treatment, the semen of only four cats could be evaluated, while the semen of eight cats could be evaluated during the second and third months of the study. Semen quality (ejaculate volume, progressive motility and morphological abnormalities) improved slightly during the first 19-25 days in 2/4 cats, and in 1/4 cats motility was still very high (80%) 25 days post-treatment (PT), but we have no data regarding fertility prior to treatment in this cat. The last cat never produced spermatozoa. Subsequently, semen quality gradually worsened in all cats from 30 days onwards. At 70 days PT, one cat was still potentially fertile. After 72 days all cats were sterile. Conclusions and relevance Semen quality increased slightly in treated cats during the first month after treatment, and then gradually decreased over the following months. Complete sterility was reached within 40-72 days following implantation.","Romagnoli, Stefano; Baldan, Anna; Righetti, Camilla; Milani, Chiara; Mollo, Antonio; Stelletta, Calogero",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2,20

The aim of this study is to systematically review the methodological strengths and limitations, as well as the impact of delirium educational interventions for healthcare professionals working in inpatient settings. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, PsychINFO and CINAHL databases were searched according to PRISMA guidelines for delirium educational interventions in hospital inpatient settings from 2007 to 2017. Identified studies were rated using a standardised quality assessment criteria checklist (Kmet). Reported outcomes were organised by level on the Kirkpatrick model for educational outcomes. The search was repeated in March 2018. RESULTS 1354 papers were screened, of which 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions delivered included face-to-face education (n = 34), e-learning (n = 8) and interprofessional education (n = 8). Quality of studies varied in Kmet score (14-96%). There were 17 high-quality studies (Kmet > 80%) and 4 very high-quality studies (Kmet over > 90%). Thirty-eight studies (90%) reported improved outcomes post-intervention. In terms of Kirkpatrick level of educational outcomes, 6 studies were rated at level 1; 13 studies at level 2; 15 studies at level 3; and 8 studies at level 4. Thirteen studies measured intervention sustainability with variable impacts. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare professional education has benefits for inpatient delirium care, as shown by the high number of good-quality studies and the majority demonstrating improved outcomes post-intervention. The sustainability of educational interventions warrants further exploration.","Lee, Song Yuin; Fisher, James; Wand, Anne P F; Milisen, Koen; Detroyer, Elke; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Agar, Meera; Hosie, Annmarie; Teodorczuk, Andrew",European geriatric medicine,2,7

More than 50 different transcripts can be generated from a single HIV-1 unspliced pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and a balanced proportion of unspliced and spliced transcripts is critical for the production of infectious virions. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of viral RNA is therefore of potential therapeutic interest. However, monitoring the regulation of alternative splicing events at a transcriptome-wide level during cell infection is challenging. Here we used the long-read cDNA sequencing developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to explore in a quantitative manner the complexity of the HIV-1 transcriptome regulation in infected primary CD4+ T cells. RESULTS ONT reads mapping to the viral genome proved sufficiently long to span all possible splice junctions, even distant ones, and to be assigned to a total of 150 exon combinations. Fifty-three viral RNA isoforms, including 14 new ones were further considered for quantification. Relative levels of viral RNAs determined by ONT sequencing showed a high degree of reproducibility, compared favourably to those produced in previous reports and highly correlated with quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. To get further insights into alternative splicing regulation, we then compiled quantifications of splice site (SS) usage and transcript levels to build ""splice trees"", a quantitative representation of the cascade of events leading to the different viral isoforms. This approach allowed visualizing the complete rewiring of SS usages upon perturbation of SS D2 and its impact on viral isoform levels. Furthermore, we produced the first dynamic picture of the cascade of events occurring between 12 and 24 h of viral infection. In particular, our data highlighted the importance of non-coding exons in viral RNA transcriptome regulation. CONCLUSION ONT sequencing is a convenient and reliable strategy that enabled us to grasp the dynamic of the early splicing events modulating the viral RNA landscape in HIV-1 infected cells.","Nguyen Quang, Nam; Goudey, Sophie; Ségéral, Emmanuel; Mohammad, Ammara; Lemoine, Sophie; Blugeon, Corinne; Versapuech, Margaux; Paillart, Jean-Christophe; Berlioz-Torrent, Clarisse; Emiliani, Stéphane; Gallois-Montbrun, Sarah",Retrovirology,2,27

The aim of our study is to evaluate left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functions with speckle tracking echocardiography in preeclamptic patients. Fifty-five preeclamptic (mean age: 30.7 ± 5.9 years) and 35 healthy pregnant women (mean age: 28.8 ± 5.7 years) of the same race, similar age and gestational week were consecutively included. The diagnosis of preeclampsia was based on the criteria proposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. LV and RV functions were assessed by both conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography after the 30th gestational week and at the postpartum 6th months. The preeclamptic patients had significantly larger left atrium, thicker interventricular septum, higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure and mitral E/e' ratio compared to controls during pregnancy while LV ejection fraction was similar. Preeclamptic patients had significantly lower LV and RV global longitudinal strain (GLS) during pregnancy compared to controls (- 18.0 ± 2.6% vs. - 19.8 ± 2.1% p = 0.001 and - 26.7 ± 3.3% vs. 28.9 ± 3.3% p = 0.002, respectively). In the postpartum period, while LVGLS values of preeclamptic patients increased significantly (- 18.0 ± 2.6% vs. - 20.4 ± 2.4% p < 0.001) and became similar to those of controls at the sixth month, the RVGLS decreased significantly (- 26.7 ± 3.3% vs. - 25.8 ± 2.7% p = 0.003) making the difference in RVGLS between the preeclamptic patients and controls more prominent. Preeclampsia may impair LV and RV function.

Here, we investigated the protective effect and mechanism of hypoxia-induced renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-derived exosomes on acute tubular injury. We found that in vitro hypoxia-induced tubular exosomes (Hy-EXOs) were protective in acute tubular injury by promoting TECs proliferation and improving mitochondrial functions. By using exosome miRNA sequencing, we identified miR-20a-5p was abundant and was a key mechanism for the protective effect of Hy-EXOs on tubular injury as up-regulation of miR-20a-5p enhanced but down regulation of miR-20a-5p inhibited the protective effect of Hy-EXOs on tubular injury under hypoxia conditions. Further study in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion induced acute kidney injury (IRI-AKI) also confirmed this notion as pre-treating mice with the miR-20a-5p agomir 48 hours prior to AKI induction was capable of inhibiting IRI-AKI by lowering serum levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen, and attenuating the severity of tubular necrosis, F4/80(+) macrophages infiltration and vascular rarefaction. Mechanistically, the protective effect of miR-20a-5p on AKI was associated with inhibition of TECs mitochondrial injury and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, miR-20a-5p is enriched in hypoxia-derived tubular exosomes and protects against acute tubular injury. Results from this study also reveal that miR-20a-5p may represent as a novel therapy for AKI.","Yu, Wenjuan; Zeng, Honghui; Chen, Junzhe; Fu, Sha; Huang, Qiuyan; Xu, Yanchun; Xu, Anping; Lan, Hui-Yao; Tang, Ying",Clinical science,2,29

In the early stage of silicosis, inhaled silica crystals initiate oxidative stress, a cycle of persistent inflammation and lung injury. And it is crucial to prevent the deteriorative progression in the onset of the disease. Herein, we present a promising candidate for the treatment of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary inflammation, using a silicosis mouse model caused by intratracheal instillation based on local administration of β-alanine and hydroxyl functionalized C70 fullerene nanoparticles (FNs). The results demonstrate that FNs could significantly alleviate inflammatory cells infiltration, lower the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduce the destruction of lung architecture stimulated by crystalline silica. Further investigations reveal that FNs could effectively inhibit the activation of NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome, and thus prevent the secretion of mature IL-1β and neutrophil influx, deriving from the superior ROS scavenging capability. Importantly, FNs could not cause any obvious toxicity after pulmonary administration.","Liu, Shuai; Chen, Daiqin; Li, Xue; Guan, Mirong; Zhou, Yue; Li, Lei; Jia, Wang; Zhou, Chen; Shu, Chunying; Wang, Chunru; Bai, Chunli",Nanoscale,2,26

METHODS Forty-six sexagenary patients who underwent transcatheter device closure of ASDs in our hospital were included in this study. The patients' preoperative and postoperative clinical symptoms, echocardiographic results, and quality of life were investigated and analyzed. RESULTS Of the 46 sexagenary patients who participated in the study, 40 completed the study. After ASD closure, the clinical symptoms of the patients significantly improved, and the number of patients with dyspnea and palpitations significantly decreased after the operation. According to the echocardiographic results, few patients had a tiny residual shunt after closure, but the shunt disappeared completely at the three-month follow-up. The size of the right ventricular cavity was significantly smaller postoperatively compared with preoperatively. Regarding the patients' quality of life, their feedback in all dimensions of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (or SF-36) was significantly improved at the three-month follow-up, and it remained improved at the one-year follow-up. CONCLUSION The clinical outcomes and subjective quality of life of sexagenary patients with ASDs improved significantly after transcatheter device closure of ASDs.

In fact, manipulation of PGE2 levels was proposed as an approach for countering the Type I IFN signature of tuberculosis (TB). However, very limited information regarding the PGE2 pathway in patients with active TB is currently available. In the present work, we demonstrated that PGE2 exerts a potent immunosuppressive action during the immune response of the human host against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Actually, we showed that PGE2 significantly reduced the surface expression of several immunological receptors, the lymphoproliferation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, PGE2 promoted autophagy in monocytes and neutrophils cultured with Mtb antigens. These results suggest that PGE2 might be attenuating the excessive inflammatory immune response caused by Mtb, emerging as an attractive therapeutic target. Taken together, our findings contribute to the knowledge of the role of PGE2 in the human host resistance to Mtb and highlight the potential of this lipid mediator as a tool to improve anti-TB treatment.","Pellegrini, Joaquín Miguel; Martin, Candela; Morelli, María Paula; Schander, Julieta Aylen; Tateosian, Nancy Liliana; Amiano, Nicolás Oscar; Rollandelli, Agustín; Palmero, Domingo Juan; Levi, Alberto; Ciallella, Lorena; Colombo, María Isabel; García, Verónica Edith",Scientific reports,2,16

However, development of COS may be a time consuming and expensive process. Publicly available repositories, such as ClinicalTrials.gov (CTG), provide access to a vast collection of clinical trial characteristics including primary and secondary outcomes, which can be analyzed using a comprehensive set of tools. With growing number of COVID-19 clinical trials, COS development may provide crucial means to standardize, aggregate, share, and analyze diverse research results in a harmonized way. This study was aimed at initial assessment of utility of CTG analytics for identifying COVID-19 COS. At the time of this study, January, 2021, we analyzed 120 ongoing NIH-funded COVID-19 clinical trials initiated in 2020 to inform COVID-19 COS development by evaluating and ranking clinical trial outcomes based on their structured representation in CTG. Using this approach, COS comprised of 25 major clinical outcomes has been identified with mortality, mental health status, and COVID-19 antibodies at the top of the list. We concluded that CTG analytics can be instrumental for COVID-19 COS development and that further analysis is warranted including broader number of international trials combined with more granular approach and ontology-driven pipelines for outcome extraction and curation.","Parvanova, Irena; Finkelstein, Joseph",Studies in health technology and informatics,2,5

METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a prospective registry at 46 centers between October 2014 and January 2017. Eligible patients were those who were aged 20 years or older, with acute cerebral large-vessel occlusion, and who were hospitalized within 24 hours of the onset. We enrolled both consecutive patients who were treated with or without endovascular therapy. Endovascular therapy included thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty, stenting, local fibrinolysis, and piercing. The primary outcome was a favorable outcome as defined by a modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 at 90 days after onset. Secondary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 1 and mortality. Safety outcomes were intracerebral hemorrhage or a recurrence of ischemic stroke. We constructed the 2242 (1121 each) propensity score-matched patients cohort based on a propensity score for endovascular therapy and estimated the adjusted odds ratio, followed by sensitivity analyses on original 2399 (1278 in endovascular therapy versus 1121 in no endovascular therapy) patients.

Several studies have demonstrated that major blood loss during PD is associated with both short-term and long-term poor outcomes. Administration of perioperative tranexamic acid (TXA) has been reported to reduce intraoperative blood loss in various surgeries, including cardiovascular surgery and orthopaedic surgery. Nevertheless, the effect of perioperative TXA use in patients undergoing PD has not been investigated. This study aims to investigate the effect of TXA on blood loss during PD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A multicentre (six hospitals), randomised, blind (patient-blinded, surgeon-blinded, anaesthesiologist-blinded, monitor-blinded), placebo-controlled trial of TXA during PD was started in September 2019. Patients undergoing PD for biliary, duodenal or pancreatic diseases are randomly assigned to the TXA or placebo group. The stratification factors are the institutions and preoperative clinical diagnosis. Before skin incision, the participants in TXA group are administrated 1 g TXA as a loading infusion followed by a maintenance infusion of 125 mg/hour TXA until the end of surgery or 8 hours from the incision. Participants in the placebo group are administrated the same volume of saline that is indistinguishable from the TXA. The primary outcome is blood loss during PD. The secondary outcomes are intraoperative and postoperative (up to day 2) blood transfusions, operation time, anaesthesia time, postoperative laboratory variables, length of hospital stay, in-hospital and 90-day mortality and postoperative complications occurring within 28 days of surgery or requiring readmission.

We present the evolution in cases and deaths according to epidemiological weeks. We analyzed the series of accumulated daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, with projections for the subsequent 15 days, using the JoinPoint app. This software allows identifying turning points, testing their statistical significance. We also analyze the trend in the spread of COVID-19 to the interior of the state, considering the percent distribution of cases in the state capital, Recife, municipalities in Greater Metropolitan Recife, and the state's interior, by sets of three weeks, constructing thematic maps. The first hundred days of the COVID-19 epidemic resulted in 52,213 cases and 4,235 deaths from March 12, or epidemiological week 11, until June 20, 2020 (epidemiological week 25). The peak in the epidemic curve occurred in epidemiological week 21 (May 23), followed by deceleration in the number of cases. We initially detected the spread of cases from the city center to the periphery of the state capital and Metropolitan Area, followed by rapid spread to the state's interior. There was a decrease in the mean daily growth starting in April, but with an average threshold of more than 6,000 weekly cases of COVID-19. At the end of the period, the state's case series indicates the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation and community transmission.

Many reports from several countries have underlined a remarkable increase in the cases of IPV during the COVID-19 emergency. In this opinion article, we discussed the hypothesis that such an increase may be related to the restrictive measures enacted to contain the pandemic, including women's forced cohabitation with the abusive partner, as well as the exacerbation of partners' pre-existing psychological disorders during the lockdown. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed some data derived from our practice in a public Italian referral center for sexual and domestic violence (Service for Sexual and Domestic Violence [SVSeD]). These data interestingly revealed an opposite trend, that is, a decrease in the number of women who sought assistance since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Such a reduction should be interpreted as a negative consequence of the pandemic-related restrictive measures. Although necessary, these measures reduced women's possibilities of seeking help from antiviolence centers and/or emergency services. Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need for developing and implementing alternative treatment options for IPV victims (such as online and phone counseling and telemedicine), as well as training programs for health care professionals, especially those employed in emergency departments, to facilitate early detection of IPV.","Barbara, Giussy; Facchin, Federica; Micci, Laila; Rendiniello, Mitia; Giulini, Paolo; Cattaneo, Cristina; Vercellini, Paolo; Kustermann, Alessandra",Journal of women's health,2,1

Some found novel ways to join efforts to respond to the pandemic. Georgetown University School of Medicine medical students created Medical Supply Drive (MSD or MedSupplyDrive), a 501(c)(3), on March 17, 2020, in response to the national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This article reviews the formation of a national response to the pandemic, the methods employed to distribute PPE, and the results of MSD's work from March 17, 2020, through June 20, 2020. A focus was placed on equitable distribution, both within local regions and on the national scale by distinguishing COVID-19 hotspots, including Native American reservations. As of June 20, over half a million items were donated, with 1,001 deliveries made to 423 hospitals, 182 clinics, 175 long-term care facilities, 25 homeless shelters, 32 public health departments, and 164 other facilities. From 46 states and the District of Columbia, 1,514 individuals volunteered, and 202 signed up as regional coordinators. MSD formed 2 international organizations, MedSupplyDrive UK and MedSupplyDrive Scotland, and established U.S.-based partnerships with 19 different PPE and aid organizations. MSD gained local, national, and international media attention with over 45 interviews conducted about the organization. While the pandemic temporarily disrupted formal medical education, MSD empowered medical students to actively learn about the needs of their communities and organize ways to address them, while incorporating these values into their professional identities. The 3-step framework this organization employed also provides a potential model for future disaster relief efforts in times of crisis. MSD hopes to motivate budding physicians to collaborate and play an active role in tackling public health inequities outside hospitals and within the communities students will one day serve.","Baker, Melissa L; Peesay, Tejasvi; Rooney, Allison; Sayyed, Adaah; Syed, Zuby",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2,27

Methods Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the mortality records from non-violent causes registered in the National Death Information System in the 50 districts of Metropolitan Lima of the first 24 weeks of the years 2019 and 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed using contingency tables and time series graphs by sex, age group, and quintile of the district of residence according to the HDI. Negative binomial regression analysis was performed to identify possible explanatory factors for excess mortality. Results An excess of 20 093 non-violent deaths and 2,979 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 were registered in Metropolitan Lima during the study period. The increase was observed primarily in men and adults aged 60 and over. Residents in the districts belonging to the fifth quintile, according to HDI, presented, in most cases, the lowest rates. Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher HDI level (p = 0.009) and a higher proportion of inhabitants living in extreme poverty (p = 0.014) decreased the excess mortality. Conclusion Excess of non-violent deaths in Metropolitan Lima is higher in the quintiles with the lowest HDI, in men, and the age group from 60 to more years of age. The study of social and economic health determinants in Peru is crucial for the design of measures to be taken by the government against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hernández-Vásquez, Akram; Gamboa-Unsihuay, Jesús Eduardo; Vargas-Fernández, Rodrigo; Azañedo, Diego",Medwave,2,5

Our focus in the first half of this Review is on synthetic methods based on ring-opening polymerization and enzyme-catalyzed polymerization, along with controlled radical polymerization. In the second half of this Review, sugar-based polymers are discussed on the basis of their remarkable success in competitive receptor binding, as multifunctional nanocarriers of targeting inhibitors for cancer treatment, in genome-editing delivery, in immunotherapy based on endogenous antibody recruitment, and in treatment of respiratory diseases, including influenza A. Particular emphasis is put on the synthesis and biopharmaceutical applications of sugar-based polymers published in the most recent 5 years. A noticeable attribute of carbohydrate-based polymers is that the sugar-receptor interactions can be facilitated by the cooperative effect of multiple sugar units. Their diversified topology and structures will drive the development of new synthetic strategies and bring about important applications, including coronavirus-related drug therapy.","Wang, Jie; Wang, Dong; Zhang, Yixian; Dong, Jian",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2,1

PROCEDURE AYA survivors ages 13-25 years were randomized to the intervention (eight in-person group sessions with mobile app and FitBit followed by 4 weeks of app and FitBit only) or waitlist control. Assessments were at 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9 months. Feasibility was evaluated by enrollment, retention, attendance, app engagement, and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included physical activity, muscular strength/endurance, cardiorespiratory fitness, health-related quality of life, and fatigue. RESULTS A total of 354 survivors were mailed participation letters; 68 (19%) were screened, of which 56 were eligible and 49 enrolled (88% of those screened eligible, 14% of total potentially eligible). Forty-nine survivors (Mage = 18.5 years, 49% female) completed baseline assessments and were randomized (25 intervention, 24 waitlist). Thirty-seven (76%) completed the postintervention assessment and 32 (65%) completed the final assessment. On average, participants attended 5.7 of eight sessions (range 1-8). Overall intervention satisfaction was high (M = 4.3, SD = 0.58 on 1-5 scale). Satisfaction with the companion app was moderately high (M = 3.4, SD = 0.97). The intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in lower body muscle strength compared to the waitlist postintervention, and small but not statistically significant changes in other secondary measures. CONCLUSIONS A group-based intervention with a mobile app and fitness tracker was acceptable but has limited reach due to geographical barriers and competing demands experienced by AYA survivors.","Devine, Katie A; Viola, Adrienne; Levonyan-Radloff, Kristine; Mackowski, Nicholas; Bozzini, Brittany; Chandler, Alexa; Xu, Baichen; Ohman-Strickland, Pamela; Mayans, Sherri; Farrar-Anton, Anne; Sahler, Olle Jane Z; Masterson, Margaret; Manne, Sharon; Arent, Shawn",Pediatric blood & cancer,2,16

Knowledge about the prevalence rates, medical and psychosocial characteristics, and care needs of this particular group of residents is mandatory for providing high-quality and evidence-based care. The purpose of this paper was to review the literature regarding these features. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from January 1, 1988 to August 16, 2011. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility of studies on pre-established inclusion criteria as well as methodological quality using standardized checklists. RESULTS Seventeen articles were included. Only one small study describes multimorbidity of a wide range of chronic psychiatric and somatic conditions in LTC residents and suggests that physical-mental multimorbidity is rather rule than exception. All other studies show prevalence rates of comorbid physical and mental illnesses (range, 0.5%-64.7%), roughly in line with reported prevalence rates among community-dwelling older people. LTC residents with mental-physical multimorbidity were younger than other LTC residents and had more cognitive impairment, no dementia, and problem behaviors. Care needs of these residents were not described. CONCLUSIONS Although exact figures are lacking, mental-physical multimorbidity is common in LTC residents. Given the specific characteristics of the pertaining residents, more knowledge of their specific care needs is essential. The first step now should be to perform research on symptoms and behavior, which seem more informative than diagnostic labels as well as care needs of LTC residents with mental-physical multimorbidity.","van den Brink, Anne M A; Gerritsen, Debby L; Voshaar, Richard C Oude; Koopmans, Raymond T C M",International psychogeriatrics,2,30

Published data from large studies appear to corroborate a significant relationship between higher serum vitamin D concentrations and improved survival. Mechanistic reviews on commonly-studied cancers - including breast cancer, colon cancer and melanoma - focus predominantly on data from older studies. In outlining avenues for future research, we believe there is utility in summarizing novel findings introduced to the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this narrative review, we used MEDLINE, PUBMED and Cochrane databases to identify mechanistic studies published from January 1, 2015 onwards exploring this topic. RESULTS Twenty-five mechanistic studies were included in this review. It was found that vitamin D plays a critical role in both direct (i.e. tumor gene expression, proliferation, invasiveness, sensitivity to chemotherapy etc.) and indirect (i.e. effects on the tumor microenvironment and immunomodulation) tumor suppression mechanisms. CONCLUSION These newly-identified pathways warrant further research, with the hopes that we may understand how and when vitamin D supplementation can be integrated into precision medicine therapeutics for cancers of the breast, colon and skin.

This can lead to a misunderstanding of CXR reports and makes comparison between examinations and research studies challenging. With this need for consistency, we propose language for standardized CXR reporting and severity assessment of persons under investigation for having COVID-19, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and patients who may have radiographic findings typical or suggestive of COVID-19 when the diagnosis is not suspected clinically. We recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection when typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR are present as an incidental finding. In addition, we summarize the currently available literature related to the use of CXR for COVID-19 and discuss the evolving techniques of obtaining CXR in COVID-19-positive patients.

Transduodenal excision of ampullary tumour offers significantly lower risks with low recurrence rate, and can be offered for benign or early grade tumours. Limited cases of laparoscopic transduodenal excision of ampullary tumours were reported in the literature, probably due to the technical difficulties in performing the operation, especially during the reconstruction of the pancreaticobiliary ducts with the laparoscopic approach.

We performed a feasibility pilot study using CGM in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS Single-center, retrospective study of glucose monitoring in critically ill patients with COVID-19 on insulin therapy using Medtronic Guardian Connect and Dexcom G6 CGM systems. Primary outcomes were feasibility and accuracy for trending POC-BG. Secondary outcomes included reliability and nurse acceptance. Sensor glucose (SG) was used for trends between POC-BG with nursing guidance to reduce POC-BG frequency from one to two hours to four hours when the SG was in the target range. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD), Clarke error grids analysis (EGA), and Bland-Altman (B&A) plots were calculated for accuracy of paired SG and POC-BG measurements. RESULTS CGM devices were placed on 11 patients: Medtronic (n = 6) and Dexcom G6 (n = 5). Both systems were feasible and reliable with good nurse acceptance. To determine accuracy, 437 paired SG and POC-BG readings were analyzed. For Medtronic, the MARD was 13.1% with 100% of readings in zones A and B on Clarke EGA. For Dexcom, MARD was 11.1% with 98% of readings in zones A and B. B&A plots had a mean bias of -17.76 mg/dL (Medtronic) and -1.94 mg/dL (Dexcom), with wide 95% limits of agreement. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, CGM is feasible in critically ill patients and has acceptable accuracy to identify trends and guide intermittent blood glucose monitoring with insulin therapy.","Sadhu, Archana R; Serrano, Ivan Alexander; Xu, Jiaqiong; Nisar, Tariq; Lucier, Jessica; Pandya, Anjani R; Patham, Bhargavi",Journal of diabetes science and technology,2,1

Forty-one trials including 7864 patients were identified for evaluation. Results Only 15 trials (36.6%) employed disease-related end points to account for death from other causes, and only one study used statistical analysis that addressed competing risk. Seventeen studies (41.5%) of trials included some assessment of comorbidity or frailty. Twenty-one trials (51.2%) included any assessment of quality of life.

We had previously hinted the pathway via the nose to the brain across the olfactory mucosa and cribriform plate. Here we detail three pathways by which the infection can ascend to the brain and have highlighted routes that can lead to CNS involvement from other body cavities like the mouth and pharynx. The spaces contained within the ensheathed olfactory nerves connected to the cerebrospinal fluid of the cranial cavity, in particular, has been described in addition to other routes of ascending infection toward the CNS.

This review provides an overview of the advantages of telemedicine during times of pandemic and the changes that have followed the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease. RECENT FINDINGS Telemedicine has been utilized during infectious outbreaks for many years. COVID-19 has induced a variety of changes in laws (i.e. data privacy protection) and reimbursement procedures to accelerate new setups of telemedicine. Existing networks provide novel data about teleactivation resulting from social restrictions during the nadir of the lockdown in spring 2020. SUMMARY Telemedicine is a safe and ideal expert support system for hospitals during infectious outbreaks. It makes high-quality medical procedures possible, limits potentially contagious interhospital transfers, saves critical resources such as protective gear and rescue/emergency transport services, and offers safe home office work for medical specialists.","Hubert, Gordian J; Corea, Francesco; Schlachetzki, Felix",Current opinion in neurology,2,12

Traditional methods for DPB prediction that depend on manually extracted features may lead to classification errors. Recently, deep learning such as convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied to classification tasks and improved DPB prediction performance significantly. Yet, these methods are based on the original DNA sequence modeling, ignoring the hidden complex dependency and complementarity between multiple sequence features. In consideration of this problem, we propose a method to fuse different sequence features and analyze them systematically through multi-scale CNN. First, sliding windows of specified lengths are set on distinct DNA sequences to generate multiple sequence features with unequal lengths. Second, multiple feature sequences are fused and encoded for feature representation. Third, multi-scale CNN with different binding motif lengths is used to automatically learn and mine the influence of internal attributes and hidden complex relations between the fusion sequence features and make full use of the complementary advantages of extracted CNN features to predict DPB. When our model is applied to 690 ChIP-seq datasets, it achieves an average AUC of 0.9112, which is significantly better than the latest methods. The results show that our method is effective for DPB prediction and is freely available at http://121.5.71.120/mscDPB/.","Du, Xiuquan; Hu, Jiajia; Li, Shuo",Journal of proteome research,2,31

While a multitude of studies have examined nucleocapsid function, none have described the effects of OC43 nucleocapsid on the transcription factor NF-κB. We report that the nucleocapsid protein of OC43 causes potentiation of NF-κB activation. This prolonged activation is the direct result of the ability of the nucleocapsid to bind RNA, specifically microRNA 9 (miR-9), which is a negative regulator of NF-κB.

However, IM-HCC includes various clinical conditions, and various therapies were conducted in practice. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the actually conducted treatments for IM-HCC and their efficacies to elucidate the treatment strategies suitable for IM-HCC. Methods This study included 627 IM-HCC of 5,260 HCC from 9 hospitals. We examined the treatment strategies of these patients and analyzed the efficacy of each therapy with the Cox proportional hazard model and propensity score-matched analysis. Results Liver resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and TACE were performed in 165, 108, and 351 patients, respectively. Liver resection and RFA were preferably selected in cases of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-B1/B2, and patient survival was significantly longer than in those treated with TACE (p< 0.0001). However, no beneficial effect of these active therapies was observed in cases of BCLC-B3/B4. Multivariate analysis revealed that surgical resection (hazard ratio = 0.384) and RFA (hazard ratio = 0.597) were negative risk factors for survival. Propensity score-matching analysis revealed that -survival of RFA-treated patients was longer than that of TACE-treated patients (p = 0.036).

However, therapeutic antibodies would need to effectively neutralize all four DENV serotypes. It must not induce antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection in monocytes/macrophages through Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)-mediated phagocytosis, which is hypothesized to increase the risk of severe dengue.

We describe outcomes in such patients undergoing robotic nephrectomy for suspected RCC, with intraoperative specimen assessment to guide completion ureterectomy if TCC is present. Between September 2010 and August 2015, ten patients had central renal masses suspicious for RCC, which were not amenable to nephron-sparing surgery. Patients underwent a four-arm robotic nephrectomy technique using a GelPOINT(®) access port. Following hilar ligation, the ureter was divided between adjacent hem-o-lok clips, placed in an endocatch bag, and extracted through the GelPOINT incision for the frozen section analysis. If intraoperative assessment confirmed TCC, a robotic completion ureterectomy and a bladder cuff excision were performed. Of the ten patients with central tumors who underwent robotic nephrectomy for suspected RCC, four (40 %) had TCC on the frozen section analysis and underwent completion ureterectomy. Five patients had RCC, and one patient had an oncocytoma. Mean age was 63.1 years (49-76) and mean tumor size was 4.0 cm (1.9-7.6). Mean operating time was 246 min (135-328). All patients had negative margins. Mean length of stay was 2.5 days. No recurrences were documented at median 8.5 months follow-up.

The quality of care management is a factor that needs to be explored, more specifically optimal organisation of first-line treatment. METHODS A retrospective study, dealing with all patients diagnosed within the Rhone-Alpes region with initial diagnosis EOC in 2012, was performed. The aim was to describe the impact of multidisciplinary tumour boards (MTB) in the organisation of care and the consequence on the patient's outcomes. RESULTS 271 EOC were analysed. 206 patients had an advanced EOC. Median progression-free survival (PFS) is 17.8 months (CI95%, 14.6-21.2) for AOC. 157 patients (57.9%) had a front-line surgery versus 114 patients (42.1%) interval debulking surgery. PFS for AOC patients with no residual disease is 24.3 months compared with 15.3 months for patients with residual disease (p = .01). No macroscopic residual disease is more frequent in the patients discussed before surgery in MTB compared with patients not submitted before surgery (73% vs. 56.2%, p < .001). CONCLUSION These results highlight the heterogeneity of medical practices in terms of front-line surgery versus interval surgery, in the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in the setting of MTB discussion.","Ferraioli, Domenico; Bally, Olivia; Meeus, Pierre; Benayoun, David; Bakrin, Naoual; De Saint Hilaire, Pierre; Beal Ardisson, Dominique; Provençal, Jocelyne; Barletta, Hugues; Mousseau, Mireille; Chauleur, Céline; Verbaere, Sylvain; Knibiehly, Alain; Fuso, Luca; Charreton, Amandine; Devouassoux-Shisheboran, Mojgan; Chopin, Nicolas; Glehen, Olivier; Labrosse-Canat, Hélène; Farsi, Fadila; Ray-Coquard, Isabelle",European journal of cancer care,2,20

This study examines the host tissue response to a new cyanoacrylate (CA) adhesive (n-octyl, OCA). Partial defects (3 × 5 cm) created in the rabbit anterior abdominal wall were repaired by mesh fixation using OCA, Glubran2®(n-butyl-CA), Ifabond®(n-hexyl-CA) or sutures. Samples were obtained at 14/90 days for morphology, collagens qRT-PCR/immunofluorescence and biomechanical studies. All meshes were successfully fixed. Seroma was detected mainly in the Glubran group at 14 days. Meshes fixed using all methods showed good host tissue incorporation. No signs of degradation of any of the adhesives were observed. At 14 days, collagen 1 and 3 mRNA expression levels were greater in the suture and OCA groups, and lower in Ifabond, with levels varying significantly in the latter group with respect to the others. By 90 days, expression levels had fallen in all groups, except for collagen 3 mRNA in Ifabond. Collagen I and III protein expression was marked in the suture and OCA groups at 90 days, but lower in Ifabond at both time points. Tensile strengths were similar across groups. Our findings indicate the similar behavior of the adhesives to sutures in terms of good tissue incorporation of the meshes and optimal repair zone strength. The lower seroma rate and similar collagenization to controls induced by OCA suggests its improved behavior over the other two glues. This article deals with a preclinical study to examine different aspects of the repair process in the host of three alkyl cyanoacrylates (n-butyl (GLUBRAN 2), n-hexyl (IFABOND), and n-octyl cyanoacrylate (EVOBOND)) compared to sutures (control), in the fixation of surgical meshes for hernia repair. It goes into detail about collagen deposition in the repair zone at short and medium term. The results obtained demonstrate lower seroma rate and similar collagenization to sutures induced by the n-octyl suggesting better behavior than the other two cyanoacrylates.","Pascual, Gemma; Rodríguez, Marta; Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Mesa-Ciller, Claudia; Fernández-Gutiérrez, Mar; San Román, Julio; Bellón, Juan M",Journal of materials science.

Understanding the patterning of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the population with regards to incidence, risk factors, impacts on dementia care, and economic costs associated with ADRD can provide clues to target risk and protective factors for all populations as well as addressing health disparities. METHODS We discuss information presented at the 2020 National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers, Theme 1: Impact of Dementia. In this article, we describe select population trends, care interventions, and economic impacts, health disparities and implications for future research from the perspective of our diverse panel comprised of academic stakeholders, and persons living with dementia, and care partners. RESULTS Dementia incidence is decreasing yet the advances in population health are uneven. Studies examining the educational, geographic and race/ethnic distribution of ADRD have identified clear disparities. Disparities in health and healthcare may be amplified by significant gaps in the evidence base for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The economic costs for persons living with dementia and the value of family care partners' time are high, and may persist into future generations. CONCLUSIONS Significant research gaps remain. Ensuring that ADRD healthcare services and long-term care services and supports are accessible, affordable, and effective for all segments of our population is essential for health equity. Policy-level interventions are in short supply to redress broad unmet needs and systemic sources of disparities. Whole of society challenges demand research producing whole of society solutions.

Our results showed that blind rats showed more robust responses to ultrasound stimulation compared to normal rats. (p<0.001, two-sample t-test). Three different types of ultrasound waveforms were used in the three experimental groups. Different types of cortical activities were observed when different US waveforms were used. In all rats, when stimulated with continuous ultrasound waves, only short-duration responses were observed at 'US on & off' time points. In comparison, pulsed waves evoked longer low-frequency responses. Testing different parameters of pulsed waves showed that a pulse repetition frequency higher than 100Hz is required to obtain the low-frequency responses.

The mean time of dispatch to arterial puncture was 3:34+1:02. The mean teleneuro consult duration was 0:04+0:02. The mean time of last know well (LKW) to tPA administration was 1:28+0:48 with 4 (57.1 %) patients receiving tPA within 60 min of LKW and 5 (71.4 %) patients receiving tPA within 90 min. The mean time of dispatch to tPA was 0:37+0:09 and scene arrival to tPA administration was 0:28+0:07. CONCLUSION MSUs may expedite each step along the stroke standards of care. In theory, this should drastically improve functional outcomes. However, the impact on functional outcomes or reductions in stroke-related morbidity is still unknown.","Weinberg, Joshua H; Sweid, Ahmad; DePrince, Mauren; Roussis, John; Herial, Nabeel; Gooch, Michael Reid; Zarzour, Hekmat; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Topley, Thomas; Wang, Alvin; Wydro, Gerald; Durland, Lawrence; Elliot, Robert; Fox, James; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2,17

Contained morcellation inside a bag is supposed to minimize this risk. The present study evaluated routine use of in-bag morcellation during laparoscopic hysterectomy in a consecutive patient cohort (n = 49). The system used was More-Cell-Safe (A.M.I. Austria). Median age was 47 (35 to 76) years and BMI 25.1 (18.8 to 39.8). Indications for hysterectomy were fibroids (71.4%), adenomyosis (16.3%), prolapse (8.2%), and bleeding disorders (4.1%). 48 (98%) patients underwent supracervical hysterectomy and 1 (2%) underwent total hysterectomy. No unsuspected malignancy occurred. Median weight of extirpated tissue was 195 g (18 to 1110). Residual tissue and/or fluid in the bag amounted to 29 g (0 to 291). Median overall duration of surgeries was 100.5 min, and median time associated with the use of the bag was 10 min (5 to 28), significantly correlated with uterine volume (p = 0.0094) and specimen weight (p = 0.0002), but not with patient's BMI (p = 0.6970).

We confirm CTP thresholds over time to imaging and reperfusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke from the HERMES collaboration (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke Trials) data. Methods- Patients with occlusion on CT angiography were acutely imaged with CTP. Noncontrast CT and magnetic resonance-diffusion weighted imaging at 24 to 48 hours defined follow-up infarction. Reperfusion was assessed on conventional angiogram. Tmax, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral blood volume maps were derived from delay-insensitive CTP postprocessing. These parameters were analyzed using receiver operator characteristics to derive optimal thresholds based on time from stroke onset-to-CTP or to reperfusion. ANOVA and linear regression were used to test whether the derived CTP thresholds were different by time. Results- One hundred thirty-seven patients were included. Tmax thresholds of >15.7 s and >15.8 s and absolute CBF thresholds of <8.9 and <7.5 mL∙min-1∙100 g-1 for gray matter and white matter respectively were associated with infarct if reperfusion was achieved <90 minutes from CTP with stroke onset-to-CTP <180 minutes. The discriminative ability of cerebral blood volume was modest. There were no statistically significant relationships between stroke onset-to-CTP time and Tmax, CBF, and cerebral blood volume thresholds (all P>0.05). A statistically significant relationship was observed between CTP-to-reperfusion time and the optimal thresholds for Tmax (P<0.001) and CBF (P<0.001). Similar but more modest relationship was noted for onset-to-reperfusion time and optimal thresholds for CBF (P≤0.01). Conclusions- CTP thresholds based on stroke onset and imaging time and taking into account time needed for reperfusion may improve infarct prediction in patients with acute ischemic stroke.","Qiu, Wu; Kuang, Hulin; Lee, Ting Y; Boers, Anna M; Brown, Scott; Muir, Keith; Majoie, Charles B L M; Dippel, Diederik W J; White, Phil; Guillemin, Francis; Mitchell, Peter J; Dávalos, Antoni; Bracard, Serge; Campbell, Bruce; Saver, Jeffrey L; Jovin, Tudor G; Hill, Michael D; Demchuk, Andrew M; Goyal, Mayank; Menon, Bijoy K",Stroke,2,1

The pandemic puts health services, including cardiac surgery units, under escalating pressure. There are significant challenges caused by this novel virus and ensuing disease that leads to great uncertainty. While it has been advocated to delay elective surgeries, most cardiac surgical patients present in a more urgent manner which elevates the critical nature for intervention, which may make the surgical decision inevitable. To date, no definitive treatments to the pandemic have been promoted. Cardiac surgical centers may experience an increasing number of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice. Preparation for managing these patients will require a change in the current modalities for perioperative care. Therefore, the goal of this report is to share our own experiences, combined with a review of the emerging literature, by highlighting principles for the adult cardiac surgery community regarding treatment of patients scheduled for surgery.

However, the effect-site of hypnotic drugs that cause general anaesthesia is the central nervous system (the brain). In the present, the adjustment of hypnotic drugs in veterinary anaesthesia is performed according to subjective evaluation of clinical signs which are not direct reflexes of anaesthetic effects on the brain, making depth of anaesthesia (DoA) assessment a complicated task. The difficulties in assessing the real anaesthetic state of a laboratory animal may not only result in welfare-threatening situations, such as awareness and pain sensation during surgery, but also in a lack of standardization of experimental conditions, as it is not easy to keep all animals from an experiment in the same DoA without a measure of anaesthetic effect. A direct measure of this dose-effect relationship, although highly necessary, is still missing in the veterinary market. Meanwhile, research has been intense in this subject and methods based on the brain electrical activity (electroencephalogram) have been explored in laboratory animal species. The objective of this review is to explain the achievements made in this topic and clarify how far we are from an objective measure of DoA for animals.","Silva, Aura; Antunes, Luis",Laboratory animals,2,16

The aim of this research was to examine the construct validity of the concept of parental burnout and to provide researchers which an instrument to measure it. We conducted two successive questionnaire-based online studies, the first with a community-sample of 379 parents using principal component analyses and the second with a community- sample of 1,723 parents using both principal component analyses and confirmatory factor analyses. We investigated whether the tridimensional structure of the burnout syndrome (i.e., exhaustion, inefficacy, and depersonalization) held in the parental context. We then examined the specificity of parental burnout vis-à-vis professional burnout assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory, parental stress assessed with the Parental Stress Questionnaire and depression assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory. The results support the validity of a tri-dimensional burnout syndrome including exhaustion, inefficacy and emotional distancing with, respectively, 53.96 and 55.76% variance explained in study 1 and study 2, and reliability ranging from 0.89 to 0.94. The final version of the Parental Burnout Inventory (PBI) consists of 22 items and displays strong psychometric properties (CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.06). Low to moderate correlations between parental burnout and professional burnout, parental stress and depression suggests that parental burnout is not just burnout, stress or depression. The prevalence of parental burnout confirms that some parents are so exhausted that the term ""burnout"" is appropriate. The proportion of burnout parents lies somewhere between 2 and 12%. The results are discussed in light of their implications at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels.","Roskam, Isabelle; Raes, Marie-Emilie; Mikolajczak, Moïra",Frontiers in psychology,2,1

Currently, there is very little information about the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents and associated factors affecting their mental health. The aim of the present study is to determine the severity of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to investigate the associated factors with these symptoms. METHODS The present study was conducted with a total of 447 adolescents. Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated by the use of DSM-5 Level 2 Anxiety Scale, DSM-5 Level 2 Depression Scale and National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale. The association between age, gender, residential area, presence of COVID-19 in the participant, presence of COVID-19 in the family or environment and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with linear regression analysis. RESULTS The mean age of participants was 15.06, and 38.3% of the participants were male and 61.7% were female. The rate of participants with moderate or high levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms was 28%, 37.6% and 28.5%, respectively. High age and living in an urban area were associated with increased anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms. In addition, female gender was associated with increased depression symptoms, and the presence of COVID-19 in the family or environment was associated with increased anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSION The present study shows that adolescents have serious levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results emphasize the need for mental health interventions that are appropriate for the characteristics of this age group.","Selçuk, Engin Burak; Demir, Arzu Çalışkan; Erbay, Lale Gönenir; Özcan, Özlem Özel; Gürer, Hüseyin; Dönmez, Yunus Emre",International journal of clinical practice,2,15

An EFTR method with a simple suturing technique that does not expose the gastric mucosa to the peritoneum (non-exposure simple suturing, NESS) was recently developed. To date, there have been no prospective studies that compare EFTR with laparoscopic wedge resection in human or animal. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between NESS-EFTR and laparoscopic wedge resection (LWR) using the linear staplers in a randomized animal study. METHODS NESS-EFTR includes steps of laparoscopic seromuscular suturing, EFTR of the inverted stomach wall, and endoscopic mucosal suturing with endoloops and clips. Sixteen pigs underwent NESS-EFTR (n = 8) or LWR (n = 8). The resected locations were the cardia, fundus, upper body anterior and greater curvature, antrum lesser and greater curvature side. The pigs were killed 3 weeks after surgery. Rates of successful complete resection (en-bloc resection with clear margins), successful closure, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS The complete resection rates in the NESS-EFTR and LWR groups were 100 and 75%, respectively (P = 0.467). All wounds were successfully closed in both groups. Resected tissues were significantly larger in the LWR group (mean ± SD: 8.0 ± 0.8 cm vs. 4.4 ± 0.5 cm, P < 0.001). Procedure time was significantly shorter in the LWR group (31.7 ± 10.0 min vs. 118.1 ± 23.4 min, P < 0.001). Early deaths due to complications only occurred in the LWR group (a leakage at cardia and a stenosis at the antrum lesser curvature side). CONCLUSIONS Incomplete resection and complications were occurred in only LWR group. NESS-EFTR was feasible and safe in animal.","Yoon, Hong Man; Kim, Chan Gyoo; Lee, Jong Yeul; Cho, Soo-Jeong; Kook, Myeong-Cherl; Eom, Bang Wool; Ryu, Keun Won; Kim, Young-Woo; Choi, Il Ju",Surgical endoscopy,2,12

In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel-based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re-paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.","Clemenza, Kelly; Weiss, Shira H; Cheslack, Keely; Kandel, Denise B; Kandel, Eric R; Levine, Amir A",Journal of neuroscience research,2,1

The long-term consequences of infection from SARS-CoV-2 include long COVID. or post-COVID syndrome, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Several case reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) have shown the presentation at more than four weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 in adults more than 21 years of age. In September 2021, a published systematic review of the literature identified 221 patients with MIS-A, representing the most comprehensive clinical study to date. MIS-A occurs in the post-acute COVID-19 period. The pathogenesis may involve a dysregulated antibody-mediated immune response, similar to MIS-C.

In addition, the mechanisms underlying the immune responses and cytokine storm induction after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also discussed. Although some neurological symptoms are mild and disappear after recovery from infection, some severe neurological complications contribute to the mortality of COVID-19 patients.

Allicin is a versatile sulfur-containing organic compound extracted from garlic (Allium sativum L.), which has many pharmacological effects. However, the effect of allicin on the sensitivity of CRC radiotherapy has not been confirmed. The present study is to observe the radiosensitivity effects of allicin and to explore its mechanism in CRC radiotherapy. The proliferation inhibition effects of allicin combined with X-ray radiotherapy in HCT116 cells were measured by growth curve of cell and colony formation assays. The cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 nucleus staining assay. The migration ability of cells was detected by Transwell chamber migration assay. The animal model of CRC was established in BALB/c mice via transplantation of CT26 cell, and the radiosensitization effect of allicin on CRC was detected in vivo. The mRNA expressions of NF-κB, IKKβ, and IκBα were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expressions of NF-κB, p-NF-κB, IKKβ, p-IKKβ, IκBα, and p-IκBα were detected by western blotting. Our results showed that allicin improves the sensitivity of X-ray radiotherapy in CRC, and its mechanism may be associated with inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings suggest that allicin may be used as a potential sensitizer for tumor radiotherapy in the clinic.","Huang, Wen-Liang; Wu, Shu-Fen; Xu, Song-Tao; Ma, Yong-Chao; Wang, Rui; Jin, Shaoju; Zhou, Shan",Journal of food science,2,9

AIM To assess safety/efficacy and cost/advantages of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of gastric antral vascular ectasia in patients with cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with cirrhosis and severe gastric antral vascular ectasia who underwent radiofrequency ablation were enrolled. Clinical data, gastric antral vascular ectasia grade, and gastric antral vascular ectasia-related hospitalizations were collected. Primary outcome was defined as the absence of transfusion over the 6 months after radiofrequency. An economic analysis was performed in the same period. RESULTS Forty patients (50% Child B) were enrolled (80% refractory to argon plasma coagulation). Gastric antral vascular ectasia eradication was obtained in all patients and 65% of these patients achieved primary outcome. After radiofrequency, mean number of red blood cells transfusions dropped (from 25 to 0.9, P < 0.0001), with a parallel increase in hemoglobin (from 8 to 10.5 g/dL, P < 0.0001). No major complication occurred and liver function remained stable in all patients. The cost-analysis demonstrated a profound reduction of health care cost (from &OV0556; 536.084 to &OV0556; 189.044 in the 6 months before vs. after radiofrequency, respectively). These results were confirmed in the subgroup analysis in patients refractory to argon plasma coagulation. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation is safe and effective for the treatment of gastric antral vascular ectasia in patients with cirrhosis, including those refractory to argon plasma coagulation. Although the cost of single radiofrequency ablation is relatively high, the cost-analysis demonstrated considerable saving.","Senzolo, Marco; Realdon, Stefano; Zanetto, Alberto; Simoncin, Beatrice; Schepis, Filippo; Caronna, Stefania; Saracco, Giorgio Maria; De Angelis, Claudio Giovanni; Debernardi Venon, Wilma",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,2,1

METHODS This is a review of prospectively collected data from 217 patients who underwent laparoscopic bowel resection for endometriosis from January 2009 to April 2015. Patients with an anastomotic leakage or ureteral injury were identified and classified. RESULTS The frequency of anastomotic leakage requiring reoperation was 8.3%. The frequency of ureteral injury was 4.6%. Median time to diagnosis was 6 days for anastomotic leakage and 8 days for ureteral injury. The daily mean values of serum CRP were significantly higher in patients with a surgical complication starting at the second postoperative day (POD 2, p = 0.004).

This activation contributes to the beneficial effects of radon therapy, but there are no studies on the risks of radon therapy, such as DNA damage. We evaluated the effect of radon inhalation on DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and explored the underlying mechanisms. Mice were exposed to radon inhalation at concentrations of 2 or 20 kBq/m3 (for one, three, or 10 days). The 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels decreased in the brains of mice that inhaled 20 kBq/m3 radon for three days and in the kidneys of mice that inhaled 2 or 20 kBq/m3 radon for one, three or 10 days. The 8-OHdG levels in the small intestine decreased by approximately 20-40% (2 kBq/m3 for three days or 20 kBq/m3 for one, three or 10 days), but there were no significant differences in the 8-OHdG levels between mice that inhaled a sham treatment and those that inhaled radon. There was no significant change in the levels of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, which plays an important role in DNA repair. However, the level of Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased by 15-60% and 15-45% in the small intestine and kidney, respectively, following radon inhalation. These results suggest that Mn-SOD probably plays an important role in the inhibition of oxidative DNA damage.","Kataoka, Takahiro; Shuto, Hina; Naoe, Shota; Yano, Junki; Kanzaki, Norie; Sakoda, Akihiro; Tanaka, Hiroshi; Hanamoto, Katsumi; Mitsunobu, Fumihiro; Terato, Hiroaki; Yamaoka, Kiyonori",Journal of radiation research,2,10

In doing so, one reduces the number of hopping events and comes closer to a truly fewest switches surface hopping approach with independent trajectories. With this algorithmic change, we demonstrate that surface hopping can be reasonably accurate for nuclear dynamics in a multidimensional configuration space with a complex-valued (i.e., not real-valued) electronic Hamiltonian; without this adjustment, surface hopping often fails. The added computational cost is marginal. Future research will be needed to assess whether or not this backtracking correction can improve the accuracy of a typical FSSH calculation with a real-valued electronic Hamiltonian (that ignores spin).","Miao, Gaohan; Bian, Xuezhi; Zhou, Zeyu; Subotnik, Joseph",The Journal of chemical physics,2,30

Intrinsic resistance to oncolysis is found in some cell lines and many primary tumors as a consequence of residual innate immunity to VSV. In resistant-tumor models, VSV oncolytic potential can be reversibly stimulated by combination with epigenetic modulators, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. Based on this reversible effect of vorinostat, we reasoned that critical host genes involved in oncolysis may likewise be reversibly regulated by vorinostat. A transcriptome analysis in prostate cancer PC3 cells identified a subset of NF-κB target genes reversibly regulated by vorinostat, as well as a group of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consistent with the induction of NF-κB target genes, vorinostat-mediated enhancement of VSV oncolysis increased hyperacetylation of NF-κB RELA/p65. Additional bioinformatics analysis revealed that NF-κB signaling also increased the expression of several autophagy-related genes. Kinetically, autophagy preceded apoptosis, and apoptosis was observed only when cells were treated with both VSV and vorinostat. VSV replication and cell killing were suppressed when NF-κB signaling was inhibited using pharmacological or genetic approaches. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhanced expression of ISGs, and either 3-MA treatment or genetic ablation of the autophagic marker Atg5 decreased VSV replication and oncolysis. Together, these data demonstrate that vorinostat stimulates NF-κB activity in a reversible manner via modulation of RELA/p65 signaling, leading to induction of autophagy, suppression of the IFN-mediated response, and subsequent enhancement of VSV replication and apoptosis.","Shulak, Laura; Beljanski, Vladimir; Chiang, Cindy; Dutta, Sucharita M; Van Grevenynghe, Julien; Belgnaoui, S Mehdi; Nguyên, Thi Lien-Anh; Di Lenardo, Thomas; Semmes, O John; Lin, Rongtuan; Hiscott, John",Journal of virology,2,1

A biomarker predicting treatment response could optimize treatment success.Materials and methods: Secondary analysis of a trial including 84 hospitalized patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia. Patients were randomized to four days of treatment with empagliflozin 25mg/day (n = 43) or placebo (n = 41) with both groups receiving fluid restriction <1000ml/day. Baseline levels of copeptin, the natriuretic peptides MR-proANP and NT-proBNP and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated as predictors for treatment response defined as absolute sodium change, using linear regression models. Additionally, urinary sodium was assessed as predictor for non-response to fluid restriction alone by constructing the receiver operating characteristic curve.Results: No clinically relevant predictive value for treatment response to empagliflozin could be found for copeptin, MR-proANP, NT-proBNP or CRP. A urinary sodium cutoff of >76mmol/l led to a specificity of 91.7% [95%-confidence-interval: 75%, 100%] and sensitivity of 51.9% [33.3%, 70.4%] to predict non-response to fluid restriction alone.Conclusions: Based on our data, no biomarker could be identified as predictor for treatment response to empagliflozin.

In the present work, the mechanisms by which HMS provides UV photoprotection are unravelled, using a multi-pronged approach involving a combination of time-resolved ultrafast laser spectroscopy in the gas-phase and in solution, laser-induced fluorescence, steady-state absorption spectroscopy, and computational methods. The unique combination of these techniques allow us to show that the enol tautomer of HMS undergoes ultrafast excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) upon photoexcitation in the UVB (290-320 nm) region; once in the keto tautomer, the excess energy is predominantly dissipated non-radiatively. Sharp transitions are observed in the LIF spectrum at close-to-origin excitation energies, which points towards the potential presence of a second conformer that does not undergo ESIPT. These studies demonstrate that, overall, HMS exhibits mostly favourable photophysical characteristics of a UV filter for inclusion in sunscreen formulations.","Holt, Emily L; Krokidi, Konstantina M; Turner, Matthew A P; Mishra, Piyush; Zwier, Timothy S; Rodrigues, Natércia D N; Stavros, Vasilios G",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2,12

Reduced port laparoscopic gastrectomy has a number of potential advantages for patients compared with conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy: relieving postoperative pain, shortening hospital stay and offering a better cosmetic outcome. Nevertheless, there are no previous reports on the use of SILS+1/L TLDG with uncut Roux-en-Y (uncut R-Y) reconstruction. AIM To investigate the initial feasibility of SILS+1/L TLDG with uncut Roux-en-Y digestive tract reconstruction (uncut R-Y reconstruction) to treat distal gastric cancer. METHODS A total of 21 patients who underwent SILS+1/L TLDG with uncut R-Y reconstruction for gastric cancer were enrolled. All patients were treated at The Second Hospital of Shandong University. Reconstructions were performed intracorporeally with 60 mm endoscopic linear stapler and 45 mm no-knife stapler. The clinicopathological characteristics, surgical details, postoperative short-term outcomes, postoperative follow-up upper gastrointestinal radiography findings and endoscopy results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS All SILS+1/L operations were performed by SILS+1/L TLDG successfully. The patient population included 13 men and 8 women with a mean age of 48.2 years (ranged from 40 years to 70 years) and median body mass index of 22.8 kg/m2. There were no conversions to open laparotomy, and no other port was placed. The mean operation time was 146 min (ranged 130-180 min), and the estimated mean blood loss was 54 mL (ranged 20-110 mL). The mean duration to flatus and discharge was 2.3 (ranged 1-3.5) and 7.3 (ranged 6-9) d, respectively. The mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was 42 (ranged 30-47). Two patients experienced mild postoperative complications, including surgical site infection (wound at the navel incision) and mild postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade A). Follow-up upper gastrointestinal radiography and endoscopy were carried out at 3 mo postoperatively. No patients experienced moderate or severe food stasis, alkaline gastritis or bile reflux during the follow-up period. No recanalization of the biliopancreatic limb was found. CONCLUSION SILS+1/L TLDG with uncut R-Y reconstruction could be safely performed as a reduced port surgery.","Zhou, Wei; Dong, Chang-Zheng; Zang, Yi-Feng; Xue, Ying; Zhou, Xing-Guo; Wang, Yu; Ding, Yin-Lu",World journal of gastroenterology,2,1

Standardized case definitions that are applicable to variety of populations are critical for robust surveillance systems to guide decision-making regarding RSV control strategies including vaccine evaluation. Limited data exist on performance of RSV syndromic case definitions among young infants or in high-resource settings. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate existing and potential syndromic case definitions for RSV among young infants in an urban, high-income setting using latent class analyses (LCA). METHODS We used data collected on infants <6 months of age tested for RSV as part of routine clinical care at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta between January 2010 and December 2015. We computed the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of clinical features, existing syndromic case definitions used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and alternative definitions we constructed using LCA to detect RSV infection. RESULTS Among 565 infants tested for RSV, 161 (28.5%) had laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. Among all case definitions evaluated, the definition developed through LCA (cough plus shortness of breath plus coryza plus wheeze plus poor feeding plus chest in-drawing) was the most specific (95.8%, 95% CI 93.8-97.8) and had the highest positive predictive value (51.4%, 95% CI, 34.9-68.0). WHO-acute respiratory infection (cough or sore throat or shortness of breath or coryza, plus a clinician's judgment that illness is due to infection) was the most sensitive (98.1%, 95% CI, 96.1-100.0; negative predictive value 96.3%, 95% CI 92.2-100.0). CONCLUSIONS The WHO acute respiratory infection definition could be useful for initial screening for RSV among infants <6 months, whereas our alternative syndromic case definition may serve as the strongest confirmatory case definition in the same population. Appropriate case definitions will vary depending on the content and setting in which they are utilized.","Lalani, Karim; Yildirim, Inci; Phadke, Varun K; Bednarczyk, Robert A; Omer, Saad B",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,2,31

We note how our participants perceived they would acquire the ability to manage these negative emotions simply by becoming doctors, despite being only a few months from qualification. A cultural shift in undergraduate training, combined with a challenging period for the medical profession in general, may leave new doctors isolated in the face of the emotional strain of medicine.

PEGDA-QT gels were formulated using PEGDA of different molecular weights (PEGDA575 and PEGDA700), and their characteristics were examined in vitro. Experiments examined gel time, mass change, crosslink integrity, cytotoxicity, and protein release capabilities. In general, PEGDA575-QT gels were more hydrophobic, requiring an initiating solution with a higher pH (pH 9.5) to achieve a gel time comparable to PEGDA700-QT gels, which used an initiating solution at pH 9.19. The mass change and crosslink integrity of gels were analyzed over time after gels were submerged in 150 mM phosphate buffered saline. After 380 days, PEGDA575-QT gels achieved a maximum mass increase of 72% due to water uptake, while PEGDA700-QT gels doubled their initial mass (100% increase) by 165 days. Compression tests showed that PEGDA700-QT gels hydrolyzed more quickly than PEGDA575-QT gels. Cytotoxicity assays showed that in general, PEGDA575-QT negatively affected cell growth, while PEGDA700-QT gels promoted cell viability. Sustained, controlled release of lysozyme, a 14.3 kDa protein, was achieved over an 8-week period when loaded into PEGDA700-QT gels, but PEGDA575-QT gels did not show sustained release. These studies show that although they are similar in composition, these PEGDA-QT gel formulations behave considerably differently. Although PEGDA700-QT gels swell more and degrade faster than PEGDA575-QT gels, their cytocompatibility and protein release characteristics may prove to be more beneficial for in vivo aneurysm treatment.","Soodak, Kristen F; Brennecka, Celeste R; Vernon, Brent L","Journal of biomedical materials research.

Due to this high expression, CCK-2 receptors might be suitable targets for radionuclide imaging and/or radionuclide therapy. Several CCK-2 receptor-binding radiopeptides have been developed and some have been tested in patients. Here we aimed to compare the in vivo tumour targeting properties of 12 (111)In-labelled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated gastrin/CCK2 receptor-binding peptides. METHODS Two CCK8-based peptides and ten gastrin-based peptide analogues were tested. All peptides were conjugated with DOTA and labelled with (111)In. Biodistribution studies were performed in mice with subcutaneous CCK2/gastrin receptor-expressing tumours and with receptor-negative tumours contralaterally. Biodistribution was studied by counting dissected tissues at 1 and 4 h after injection. RESULTS Both the CCK analogues displayed relatively low tumour uptake (approximately 2.5%ID/g) as compared to minigastrin analogues. Two linear minigastrin peptides (MG0 and sargastrin) displayed moderate tumour uptake at both 1 and 4 h after injection, but also very high kidney uptake (both higher than 48%ID/g). The linear MG11, lacking the penta-Glu sequence, showed lower tumour uptake and also low kidney uptake. Varying the N-terminal Glu residues in the minigastrin analogues led to improved tumour targeting properties, with PP-F11 displaying the optimal biodistribution. Besides the monomeric linear peptides, a cyclized peptide and a divalent peptide were tested. CONCLUSION Based on these studies, optimal peptides for peptide receptor radionuclide targeting of CCK2/gastrin receptor-expressing tumours were the linear minigastrin analogue with six D-Glu residues (PP-F11), the divalent analogue MGD5 and the cyclic peptide cyclo-MG1. These peptides combined high tumour uptake with low kidney retention, and may therefore be good candidates for future clinical studies.","Laverman, Peter; Joosten, Lieke; Eek, Annemarie; Roosenburg, Susan; Peitl, Petra Kolenc; Maina, Theodosia; Mäcke, Helmut; Aloj, Luigi; von Guggenberg, Elisabeth; Sosabowski, Jane K; de Jong, Marion; Reubi, Jean-Claude; Oyen, Wim J G; Boerman, Otto C",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,2,6

It is expected that the three strategic landfills in Hong Kong will be exhausted by 2020. In consideration of the food waste management environment and community needs in Hong Kong, as well as with reference to the food waste management systems in cities such as Linköping in Sweden and Oslo in Norway, a framework of food waste separation, collection, and recycling for food waste valorization is proposed in this paper. Food waste can be packed in an optic bag (i.e., a bag in green color), while the residual municipal solid waste (MSW) can be packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the refuse transfer stations, in which food waste is separated from the residual MSW using an optic sensor. On the one hand, the sorted food waste can be converted into valuable materials (e.g., compost, swine feed, fish feed). On the other hand, the sorted food waste can be sent to the proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities and sewage treatment works for producing biogas. The biogas can be recovered to produce electricity and city gas (i.e., heating fuel for cooking purpose). Due to the challenges faced by the value-added products in Hong Kong, the biogas is recommended to be upgraded as a biogas fuel for vehicle use. Hopefully, the proposed framework will provide a simple and effective approach to food waste separation at source and promote sustainable use of waste to resource in Hong Kong.","Lo, Irene M C; Woon, Kok Sin",Environmental science and pollution research international,2,16

A binary logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between phthalate exposure and the risk of HBP. RESULTS Monomethyl phthalate (MMP) concentrations were significantly higher in HBP children than normal BP children. MMP, monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobutyl phthalate (MnBP), mono(5-carboxy-2-ethylpentyl) phthalate, mono-[(2-carboxy methyl)hexyl] phthalate (MCMHP), the sum of four short-chain mPAEs (∑LMW), and the sum of all nine mPAEs (∑9mPAEs) were significantly positively associated with increases in systolic BP z-score, while only MMP was significantly positively associated with diastolic BP z-score. MMP, MiBP, MnBP, MCMHP, ∑LMW, and ∑9mPAEs were significantly associated with increases in PP, while MMP and MnBP were significantly associated with increases in MAP. MMP was significantly associated with the risk of HBP, with an odds ratio of 1.87 (95% CI: 1.23, 2.85). CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that dimethyl phthalate exposure increases the risk of HBP. And some types of phthalates are associated with elevations in systolic/diastolic BP z scores, PP, and MAP in Chinese children.","Yao, Yao; Chen, Ding-Yan; Yin, Jiang-Wei; Zhou, Li; Cheng, Jin-Quan; Lu, Shao-You; Li, Hong-Hua; Wen, Ying; Wu, Yu",Environment international,2,1

These articles not only chronicle nursing's growth as a profession within the context of the events of the day, but they also reveal prevailing societal attitudes about women, health care, and human rights. Today's nursing school curricula rarely include nursing's history, but it's a history worth knowing. To this end, From the AJN Archives highlights articles selected to fit today's topics and times. This month's article is by public health expert Dorothy Deming, whose many roles over her long career included director of the Visiting Nurse Association in Holyoke, Massachusetts; editor of Public Health Nursing; and author of the Penny Marsh: Public Health Nurse series for young adult readers. In her October 1957 AJN article, Deming recalls her experiences as a nursing student in New York City during the 1918 influenza pandemic. She and a classmate managed a 32-bed women's influenza unit through 12-hour night shifts, a ""baptism of fire for a young nurse,"" she writes. Deming describes shifts that sound eerily familiar given today's COVID-19 pandemic: overcrowded units, staff shortages, patients whose condition could change ""in split seconds,"" and the emotional impact of working under these conditions.

We used the factor analysis for mixed data method for preprocessing. It performed principle component analysis on numeric values and multiple correspondence analysis on categorical values which helped convert categorical data into numeric. Cluster analysis was an effective means to both distinguish subgroups of CLRD patients with COVID-19 as well as identify patient clusters which were adversely affected by the infection. Age, comorbidity index and race were important factors for cluster separations. Furthermore, diseases of the circulatory system, the nervous system and sense organs, digestive system, genitourinary system, metabolic diseases and immunity disorders were also important criteria in the resulting cluster analyses.","Cui, Wanting; Cabrera, Manuel; Finkelstein, Joseph",Studies in health technology and informatics,2,10

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the knowledge of intensive care physicians in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes towards the strategies and application methods to be used for COVID-19 cases that need to be followed up in an intensive care unit, and to raise awareness about this issue. DESIGN AND SETTING The population for this descriptive study comprised clinicians working in a variety of healthcare organizations in Turkey who provide monitoring and treatment within the intensive care process for COVID-19 patients. METHODS Data were collected online using a survey form on the SurveyMonkey website between April 20 and April 25, 2020. RESULTS The mean age of the 248 intensive care clinicians participating in the study was 37.2 ± 13.7 years and 49.19% were female. High rates of classical laryngoscope use were observed, especially among clinicians employed in state hospitals. Among all the participants, 54.8% stated that they were undecided about corticosteroid treatment for patients who had been intubated due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Many medications and methods are used for COVID-19 treatment. All national science committees are attempting to create standard treatment protocols. For intensive care treatment of COVID-19 patients, many factors require management, and clinicians' experience is guiding future processes. We believe that this study will create awareness about this topic and contribute to the creation of standard treatment algorithms and the provision of better and safer healthcare services for this patient group.","Erbas, Mesut; Dost, Burhan",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,2,4

We compared this standard with a suction calibration system (SCS) that performs all functions with one insertion, and measured each step's duration. METHODS Primary LSG was performed using a bougie and SCS in alternating order. Number of tube movements to achieve optimal placement, durations of decompression, leak testing, and overall operative time, and remnant linear measurements were obtained. RESULTS LSG was performed in 26 patients (15 women, 11 men; mean age 36.8 years; mean BMI 45.3 kg/m(2)). The mean number of tube movements was significantly greater for the bougie than for the SCS (8.13 vs. 3.58; p < 0.0001). Percent reductions achieved using the SCS were: time to full decompression of the stomach, 62% (21 vs. 8 s; p < 0.138); tube placement, 51% (101 vs. 49 s; p < 0.0001); leak testing, 78% (119 vs. 26 s; p < 0.0003); and mean operative duration (from tube insertion to end of stapling), 21% (875 vs. 697 s; p < 0.019). Variance of the staple-line distance, measured from the greater curvature to the staple line, was 1.64 and 0.92 for the bougie and SCS, respectively, indicating a reduction in corkscrewing, for a 43.9% straighter sleeve. CONCLUSION SCS maintained the gastric wall in place, thereby preventing corkscrewing, and reducing total operating time. Reducing the number of tube insertions may prevent esophageal damage and accidental tube stapling.","Gagner, Michel; Huang, Rose Y",Surgical endoscopy,2,24

MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Patients were placed in the lithotomy position, and only the upper body was twisted to the right side. Five trocars were placed. After the bursa omentalis was opened, an avascular layer was identified behind the pancreas. This avascular layer was bluntly dissected, and the pancreatic tail was isolated from the retroperitoneum. The tissue surrounding the splenic hilum was dissected by a handling tape that was placed around the pancreatic tail. Because the spleen remained connected to the retroperitoneum with the splenorenal ligament, a good operative view of the splenic hilum was obtained with proper extension. After sufficient space was secured between the pancreatic tail and the spleen, the splenic vessels were divided with a linear stapler. The spleen was detached in the final stage.

The Advanced Thrombectomy System (ANCD) is a novel stroke thrombectomy device designed to reduce clot fragmentation and facilitate retrieval by inducing local flow arrest and allowing distal aspiration in combination with a stent retriever. We aimed to assess the preclinical efficacy of ANCD. METHODS Soft red blood cell (RBC)-rich (n=20/group) and sticky fibrin-rich (n=30/group) clots were used to create middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions in two vascular phantoms. Three different treatment strategies were tested: (1) balloon guide catheter + Solitaire (BGC+SR); (2) distal access catheter + SR (DAC+SR); and (3) ANCD+SR, until complete recanalization was achieved or to a maximum of three passes. The recanalization rate was determined after each pass. RESULTS After one pass, ANCD+SR resulted in an increased recanalization rate (94%) for all clots together compared with BGC+SR (66%; p<0.01) or DAC+SR (80%; p=0.04). After the final pass the recanalization rate increased in all three groups but remained higher with ANCD+SR (100%) than with BGC+SR (74%; p<0.01) or DAC+SR (90%; p=0.02). The mean number of passes was lower with ANCD+SR (1.06) than with BGC+SR (1.46) or DAC+SR (1.25) (p=0.01). A logistic regression model adjusted for treatment arm, clot type, and model used showed that both RBC-rich clots (OR 8.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 13.5) and ANCD+SR (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.01 to 15.8) were independent predictors of first-pass recanalization. CONCLUSION In in vitro three-dimensional models replicating MCA-M1 occlusion, ANCD+SR showed significantly better recanalization rates in fewer passes than other commonly used combinations of devices.","Sanchez, Sonia; Cortiñas, Ignacio; Villanova, Helena; Rios, Anna; Galve, Iñaki; Andersson, Tommy; Nogueira, Raul; Jovin, Tudor; Ribo, Marc",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,2,17

A specific type of single cytosine insertion in the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the mucin 1 (MUC1) gene is the only known cause of MCKD1; however, genetic analysis of this mutation is difficult and not yet offered routinely. To identify the causative mutation/s and establish a definitive diagnosis in a Chinese family with chronic kidney disease, clinical assessments and genetic analysis were performed, including using a modified genotyping method to identify the MUC1- VNTR single cytosine insertion. METHODS Clinical data from three patients in a Chinese family with chronic kidney disease were collected and evaluated. Linkage analysis was used to map the causative locus. Mutation analysis of uromodulin (UMOD) gene was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. For MUC1 genotyping, the mutant repeat units were enriched by MwoI restriction, and then were amplified and introduced into pMD-18T vectors. The 192 clones per transformant were picked up and tested by colony PCR and second round of MwoI digestion. Finally, Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the MUC1 mutation. RESULTS Clinical findings and laboratory results were consistent with a tubulointerstitial lesion. Linkage analysis indicated that the family was compatible with the MCKD1 locus. No mutations were found in UMOD gene. Using the modified MUC1 genotyping method, we detected the MUC1-VNTR single cytosine insertion events in three patients of the family; and mutation-containing clones were 12/192, 14/192, and 5/96, respectively, in the three patients. CONCLUSIONS Clinical and genetic findings could support the MCKD1 diagnosis. The modified strategy has been demonstrated to be a practical way to detect MUC1 mutation.","Si, Nuo; Zheng, Ke; Ma, Jie; Meng, Xiao-Lu; Li, Xue-Mei; Zhang, Xue",Chinese medical journal,2,28

However, far less is known about such a link during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly based on nationally representative samples. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine this association among middle-aged/older adults. METHODS/DESIGN Data were taken from the short survey of the German Ageing Survey (June/July 2020, 3,134 individuals in the analytical sample). The De Jong Gierveld scale was used to quantify loneliness, the Satisfaction with Life Scale was used to quantify life satisfaction and the 15-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression was used to quantify depressive symptoms. RESULTS Regressions showed that - compared to daily users - less frequent users of the internet for contact with friends and relatives reported increased loneliness, lower life satisfaction and more depressive symptoms. With regard to covariates, better psychosocial factors were associated with medium education (compared to low education), living with partner in the same household (compared to singles), better self-rated health, and favorable COVID-19 factors (in terms of decreased feeling that the Corona crisis is a threat for oneself, not having an infection with the coronavirus and an increased feeling that you can influence an infection with the coronavirus yourself).

Anesthetic depth monitoring in these patients can be difficult due to their already altered mental state prior to anesthesia. In this study, the utility of electroencephalographic indexes to reflect anesthetic depth was evaluated in pediatric patients with ID. Methods Seventeen patients (mean age, 9.6 ± 2.9 years) scheduled for dental procedures were enrolled in this study. After anesthesia induction with propofol or sevoflurane, a bilateral sensor was placed on the patient's forehead and the bispectral index (BIS) was recorded. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, which was adjusted according to the clinical signs by an anesthesiologist blinded to the BIS value. The index performance was accessed by correlation (with the end-tidal sevoflurane [EtSevo] concentration) and prediction probability (with a clinical scale of anesthesia). The asymmetry of the electroencephalogram between the left and right sides was also analyzed. Results The BIS had good correlation and prediction probabilities (above 0.5) in the majority of patients; however, BIS was not correlated with EtSevo or the clinical scale of anesthesia in patients with Lennox-Gastaut, West syndrome, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. BIS showed better correlations than SEF95 and TP. No significant differences were observed between the left- and right-side indexes. Conclusion BIS may be able to reflect sevoflurane anesthetic depth in patients with some types of ID; however, more research is required to better define the neurological conditions and/or degrees of disability that may allow anesthesiologists to use the BIS.","Silva, Aura; Amorim, Pedro; Felix, Luiza; Abelha, Fernando; Mourão, Joana",Journal of dental anesthesia and pain medicine,2,27

Secondary aims were to determine predictors of COVID-19 status on presentation and later in the admission; the rate of hospital acquired COVID-19; and the predictive value of negative swabs on admission. METHODS A nationwide multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted of all patients presenting with a hip fracture to 17 Scottish centres in March and April 2020. Demographics, presentation blood tests, COVID-19 status, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, management, length of stay, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS In all, 78/833 (9.4%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The 30-day survival of patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower than for those without (65.4% vs 91%; p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 within seven days of admission (likely community acquired) was independently associated with male sex (odds ratio (OR) 2.34, p = 0.040, confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 5.25) and symptoms of COVID-19 (OR 15.56, CI 6.61 to 36.60, p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 made between seven and 30 days of admission to hospital (likely hospital acquired) was independently associated with male sex (OR 1.73, CI 1.05 to 2.87, p = 0.032), Nottingham Hip Fracture Score ≥ 7 (OR 1.91, CI 1.09 to 3.34, p = 0.024), pulmonary disease (OR 1.68, CI 1.00 to 2.81, p = 0.049), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade ≥ 3 (OR 2.37, CI 1.13 to 4.97, p = 0.022), and length of stay ≥ nine days (OR 1.98, CI 1.18 to 3.31, p = 0.009). A total of 38 (58.5%) COVID-19 cases were probably hospital acquired infections. The false-negative rate of a negative swab on admission was 0% in asymptomatic patients and 2.9% in symptomatic patients. CONCLUSION COVID-19 was independently associated with a three times increased 30-day mortality rate. Nosocomial transmission may have accounted for approximately half of all cases during the first wave of the pandemic. Identification of risk factors for having COVID-19 on admission or acquiring COVID-19 in hospital may guide pathways for isolating or shielding patients respectively. Length of stay was the only modifiable risk factor, which emphasizes the importance of high-quality and timely care in this patient group.","Hall, Andrew J; Clement, Nick D; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; White, Tim O; Duckworth, Andrew D",The bone & joint journal,2,30

Background Given the covid-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, to spare resources, have limited access to operating rooms for elective surgical activity, including cancer, thus forcing deferral or cancellation of cancer surgeries. Surgery for hepatobiliary cancer is high-risk and particularly resource-intensive. Surgeons must critically appraise which patients will benefit most from surgery and which ones have other therapeutic options to delay surgery. Little guidance is currently available about potential delaying strategies for hepatobiliary cancers when surgery is not possible. Methods An international multidisciplinary panel reviewed the available literature to summarize data relating to standard-of-care surgical management and possible mitigating strategies to be used as a bridge to surgery for colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Results Outcomes of surgery during the covid-19 pandemic are reviewed. Resource requirements are summarized, including logistics and adverse effects profiles for hepatectomy and delaying strategies using systemic, percutaneous and radiation ablative, and liver embolic therapies. For each cancer type, the long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy and the clinical tools that can be used to prognosticate for individual patients are detailed. Conclusions There are a variety of delaying strategies to consider if availability of operating rooms decreases.

Good-quality parent-child interaction (PCI) is a key predictor for the successful development of deaf children's signed and/or spoken language. Though professionals have standard assessments to monitor child language, a clinical tool to observe the quality of parental interaction is yet to be developed. AIMS AND METHODS This systematic review with narrative synthesis aims to uncover which parent behaviours are assessed in PCI studies with deaf infants aged 0-3 years, how these behaviours are assessed, and which are correlated with higher scores in child language. RESULTS Sixty-one papers were included, spanning 40 years of research. Research included in the review assessed parents' skills in gaining attention, joint engagement, emotional sensitivity, and language input. PCI was mostly assessed using coding systems and frame-by-frame video analysis. Some of the parent behaviours mentioned previously are associated with more words produced by deaf children. CONCLUSION The results of the review provide the evidence base required to develop the content of a future clinical assessment tool for parent-child interaction in deafness.","Curtin, Martina; Dirks, Evelien; Cruice, Madeline; Herman, Rosalind; Newman, Lauren; Rodgers, Lucy; Morgan, Gary",Journal of clinical medicine,2,23

Paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir (PRO) and/or dasabuvir (D), with or without ribavirin [PRO (D) ± ribavirin], which are direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), is the currently approved treatment regimen for CHC genotype 1; this regimen can also be used in patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment factors on RVR in patients treated with PRO (D) ± ribavirin. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study included 60 patients with CHC genotype 1 who were treated with PRO (D) ± ribavirin and achieved RVR. Patients' demographic data; baseline HCV RNA levels; HCV genotype information; biochemical, histologic, and radiologic results; and previous treatment history were recorded. Patients were categorized into two groups: virologic responses achieved in the first week (group 1) and in the first to the fourth week (group 2). Pretreatment factors were compared between the groups. RESULTS Patients in group 1 who achieved ultraRVR (undetectable HCV RNA after 1 week of treatment) had significantly lower mean pretreatment HCV RNA levels and lower prevalence of ESRF than patients in group 2. CONCLUSIONS RVR has been indicated to be a robust positive predictor of sustained virologic response. We concluded that some pretreatment factors such as low HCV RNA level and absence of ESRF might lead to faster RVR and shorter treatment duration with DAAs for CHC.","Turken, Melda; Kose, Sukran; Colak Ergun, Nadide; Tatar, Bengu",Arab journal of gastroenterology : the official publication of the Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology,2,1

In this study, we find that dual-specificity phosphatase 16 (DUSP16) regulates resistance to chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric and breast cancer. Cancer cells expressing higher DUSP16 are intrinsically more resistant to chemotherapy-induced cell death than cells with lower DUSP16 expression. Overexpression of DUSP16 in cancer cells leads to increased resistance to cell death upon chemotherapy treatment. In contrast, knockdown of DUSP16 in cancer cells increases their sensitivity to treatment. Mechanistically, DUSP16 inhibits JNK and p38 activation, thereby reducing BAX accumulation in mitochondria to reduce apoptosis. Analysis of patient survival in head & neck cancer and breast cancer patient cohorts supports DUSP16 as a marker for sensitivity to chemotherapy and therapeutic outcome. This study therefore identifies DUSP16 as a prognostic marker for the efficacy of chemotherapy, and as a therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance in cancer.","Low, Heng Boon; Wong, Zhen Lim; Wu, Bangyuan; Kong, Li Ren; Png, Chin Wen; Cho, Yik-Lam; Li, Chun-Wei; Xiao, Fengchun; Xin, Xuan; Yang, Henry; Loo, Jia Min; Lee, Fiona Yi Xin; Tan, Iain Bee Huat; DasGupta, Ramanuj; Shen, Han-Ming; Schwarz, Herbert; Gascoigne, Nicholas R J; Goh, Boon Cher; Xu, Xiaohong; Zhang, Yongliang",Nature communications,2,5

Aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection is a new sclerosing therapy for the treatment of internal hemorrhoids. Although ALTA injection has been widely used, there are no previous reports of rectal cancer patients who underwent robot-assisted low anterior resection (Rob-LAR) after ALTA injection to treat internal hemorrhoids. CASE PRESENTATION A 70-year-old man with rectal cancer was presented to our hospital. He had an ALTA injection 2 months before presentation at a clinic due to hematochezia with internal hemorrhoids. The rectal tumor was located 7 cm above the anal verge, and Rob-LAR with the da Vinci Xi system was performed. The patient had sclerosis on the stump of the anal side, which made it difficult to transect the rectum with linear staplers. This required multiple repeats of compression through the SmartClamp feedback. After anastomosis with the double-stapling technique, we constructed a diverting ileostomy. CONCLUSION Although ALTA injection is a promising strategy for internal hemorrhoids, rectal cancer should be excluded before the sclerosing therapy.","Itatani, Yoshiro; Okada, Tomoaki; Kawada, Kenji; Hida, Koya; Oshima, Nobu; Inamoto, Susumu; Mizuno, Rei; Okuchi, Yoshihisa; Sakai, Yoshiharu",Surgical case reports,2,10

Methods: The clinical and epidemiological data of 135 cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin were collected, and the data were analyzed with descriptive method. The factors influencing the severity of the illness were analyzed. Results: Among the 135 COVID-19 cases, 72 were males and 63 were females, the age of the cases was (48.62±16.83) years, and the case fatality rate was 2.22%. Local transmission caused 74.81% of the cases. A total of 33 clusters occurred, involving 85.92% of all COVID-19 cases. The median of the incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.50 days, the average generation interval was 5 days, and the household secondary transmission rate was 20.46%. Fever was the main symptom (78.63%), followed by cough (56.48%). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that age (OR=1.038, 95%CI: 1.010-1.167) and the number of chronic underlying diseases (OR=1.709, 95%CI: 1.052-2.777) were the risk factors of severe illness. Conclusions: Fever was the main symptom at the early phase of COVID-19 in Tianjin, and the local cluster cases accounted for high proportion in confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Tianjin. Severe illness was prone to occur in people with old age and multi underlying diseases. Strict isolation of close contacts and intensive care of high-risk groups are the main measures to reduce the morbidity and case fatality of COVID-19.","Dong, X C; Li, J M; Bai, J Y; Liu, Z Q; Zhou, P H; Gao, L; Li, X Y; Zhang, Y",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,2,0

Improved organ preservation techniques will decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) contributing to PGD. Adult bone marrow-derived adherent stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), have potent anti-inflammatory actions, and we thus postulated that intratracheal MAPC administration during donor lung processing would decrease IRI. The goal of the study was therefore to determine if intratracheal MAPC instillation would decrease lung injury and inflammation in an ex vivo human lung explant model of prolonged cold storage and subsequent reperfusion. METHODS Four donor lungs not utilized for transplant underwent 8 h of cold storage (4°C). Following rewarming for approximately 30 min, non-HLA-matched allogeneic MAPCs (1 × 10(7) MAPCs/lung) were bronchoscopically instilled into the left lower lobe (LLL) and vehicle comparably instilled into the right lower lobe (RLL). The lungs were then perfused and mechanically ventilated for 4 h and subsequently assessed for histologic injury and for inflammatory markers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. RESULTS All LLLs consistently demonstrated a significant decrease in histologic and BALF inflammation compared to vehicle-treated RLLs. CONCLUSIONS These initial pilot studies suggest that use of non-HLA-matched allogeneic MAPCs during donor lung processing can decrease markers of cold ischemia-induced lung injury.","La Francesca, Saverio; Ting, Anthony E; Sakamoto, Jason; Rhudy, Jessica; Bonenfant, Nicholas R; Borg, Zachary D; Cruz, Fernanda F; Goodwin, Meagan; Lehman, Nicholas A; Taggart, Jennifer M; Deans, Robert; Weiss, Daniel J",Transplantation research,2,16

We investigated the attack-inducing effects of PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal peptide in cluster headache, hypothesising that PACAP38, but not vasoactive intestinal peptide, would induce cluster-like attacks in episodic active phase and chronic cluster headache patients. METHODS In a double-blind crossover study, 14 episodic cluster headache patients in active phase, 15 episodic cluster headache patients in remission phase and 15 chronic cluster headache patients were randomly allocated to receive intravenous infusion of PACAP38 (10 pmol/kg/min) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (8 pmol/kg/min) over 20 min on two study days separated by at least 7 days. We recorded headache intensity, incidence of cluster-like attacks, cranial autonomic symptoms and vital signs using a questionnaire (0-90 min). RESULTS In episodic cluster headache active phase, PACAP38 induced cluster-like attacks in 6/14 patients and vasoactive intestinal peptide induced cluster-like attacks in 5/14 patients (p = 1.000). In chronic cluster headache, PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal peptide both induced cluster-like attacks in 7/15 patients (p = 0.765). In episodic cluster headache remission phase, neither PACAP38 nor vasoactive intestinal peptide induced cluster-like attacks. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to our hypothesis, attack induction was lower than expected and roughly equal by PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal peptide in episodic active phase and chronic cluster headache patients, which contradicts the PAC1-receptor as being solely responsible for attack induction.Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT03814226).","Vollesen, Anne Luise H; Snoer, Agneta; Chaudhry, Basit; Petersen, Anja Sofie; Hagedorn, Andreas; Hoffmann, Jan; Jensen, Rigmor H; Ashina, Messoud",Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,2,28

Adhesiogenesis is the result of increased fibrin formation, impaired fibrinolysis, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. Despite the recent advancements, the ideal anti-adhesive agent remains to be determined. To this end, we performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases to identify studies investigating the antiadhesive role of anti-VEGF agents in peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial experimental adhesion models. Fifteen studies were eligible for inclusion with a total population of 602 animals (334 rats, 180 rabbits, and 88 mice). The majority of included studies (11/15) used bevacizumab, while three studies used other anti-VEGF antibodies and one study used an anti-VEGFR-antibody. A rat model was used in nine studies, while rabbit (n = 3) or mouse (n = 3) models were used less frequently. Eleven studies used peritoneal models, three studies used pleural models, and one study used a pericardial model. The scales (n = 12) and interval (Range: 1-42 days) used for the evaluation of adhesions varied between the studies. All studies demonstrated a significant decrease in adhesion scores between the anti-VEGF and control groups up to 42 days postprocedure. VEGF blockade resulted in decreased fibrosis in four out of five studies that used peritoneal models, while the effect on pleural models depended on the pleurodesis agent and was significant between 7 and 28 days. The effect of anti-VEGF agents on anastomosis integrity depends on the dose and the model that is used (inconclusive results).Current data support the anti-adhesive role of Anti-VEGF agents in all three serosal surfaces up to 6 weeks postprocedure. Further studies are needed to confirm the anti-adhesive role of anti-VEGF agents in pleural and pericardial adhesion experimental models and investigate any effect on anastomosis integrity in peritoneal models.","Giannis, Dimitrios; Geropoulos, Georgios; Ziogas, Ioannis A; Gitlin, Jordan; Oropallo, Alisha",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,2,1

METHODS The utility of CT compared with chest radiography (CR) for the diagnosis of CAP was prospectively studied among elderly inpatients with clinical symptoms and signs indicative of CAP at the Department of Respiratory Medicine in Nissan Tamagawa Hospital during the one-year period from January 2013 to December 2013. Additionally, we evaluated whether the findings of CT were useful as predictive factors related to the mortality rate associated with CAP. RESULTS One hundred and forty-two patients, 65 years of age or older, were surveyed upon hospital admission for suspected CAP. Of the 142 patients included, 127 (89.4%) had pneumonic infiltration diagnosed by CT, however, CR could not recognize pneumonic infiltration in 9.4% (12/127) of these patients. In 127 CAP-positive patients, bilateral pneumonic infiltration was more frequently detected by CT in non-survivors than survivors (79.0% vs. 53.7%; p <0.05). By a multivariable analysis to determine the prognostic factors related to mortality from CAP, oxygen desaturation showed the greatest odds ratio among the other predictive factors, followed by comorbid neoplastic disease, blood urea nitrogen ≥21 mg/dL, male gender, and bilateral pneumonic infiltration diagnosed by CT. CONCLUSION We herein demonstrated that CT was superior to CR for diagnosing and evaluating the severity of CAP in elderly patients.","Haga, Takahiro; Fukuoka, Mizuki; Morita, Mizuo; Cho, Kohei; Tatsumi, Koichiro",Internal medicine,2,1

We previously demonstrated a high incidence of ictal hypoxemia in temporal lobe seizures. We now report on the temporal relationship between ictal apnea and seizure onset and spread in patients undergoing video-EEG (electroencephalography) telemetry (VET) with intracranial electrodes. METHODS Ten patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing VET were studied. Data from synchronously recorded digital pulse oximetry (SaO(2)), end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), nasal airflow, abdominal excursions, and electrocardiography were obtained. RESULTS Sixty-one seizures were captured. SaO(2) in the ictal/postictal period was available for 52 seizures, apnea onset times for 27 seizures, and ETCO(2) for 16 seizures. Apneas occurred only when seizures spread to the contralateral temporal lobe. The mean delay to apnea onset was significantly shorter after contralateral seizure spread (2.87 s) than after seizure onset (58.4 s); p < 0.001. The mean SaO(2) nadir with partial seizures or partial seizures prior to secondary generalization was 89.4 +/- 8.6% (91.5, 69-100). Following generalized convulsions the mean oxygen saturation nadir was 75.8 +/- 10.6% (78.5, 58-90). ETCO(2) elevations occurred with each ictal desaturation below 85%. CONCLUSIONS There is a close temporal relationship between spread of seizures to the contralateral hemisphere and the onset of seizure-associated apnea. Apnea onsets are more tightly linked to time of contralateral spread than to time of seizure onset. Patients with TLE in whom there is evidence of contralateral seizure spread may be at higher risk for ictal-related respiratory dysfunction than those in whom seizures remain unilateral.","Seyal, Masud; Bateman, Lisa M",Epilepsia,2,17

For many years the only available devices were the Hyperform and the Hyperglide balloon catheters. Recently, other companies have developed newer devices, single or dual-lumen. We present our initial experience with the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS We retrospectively analysed from our prospectively gathered aneurysm database all aneurysms that were treated with balloon remodelling using TransForm occlusion balloon catheters from January 2013 to February 2014. We assessed patient demographics, morphological features of the aneurysms, procedure feasibility, technical and clinical complications. RESULTS Thirty-three patients harbouring 36 intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated during 33 procedures. Clinical finding were: 15 incidental discovery, 13 subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), five aneurysms with mass effect, one ruptured aneurysm with SAH and mass effect, one recanalisation and one intraparenchymal haematoma. Thirty-five aneurysms were in the anterior and one in the posterior circulation. Mean dome and neck size were, respectively, 5.8 mm and 3.6 mm. Twenty-three aneurysms were treated with TransForm C and 13 with TransForm SC. We had two procedural thromboembolic complications, without permanent clinical events. No early rebleeding occurred. CONCLUSIONS In our small series, the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter seems to be safe and effective for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, in ruptured and unruptured cases.","Bartolini, Bruno; Blanc, Raphaël; Pistocchi, Silvia; Redjem, Hocine; Ciccio, Gabriele; Piotin, Michel","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",2,5

METHODS Twenty-eight Wistar rats were randomized into four groups (n=7). Control (C) group animals were injected once a day with intraperitoneal (i.p) 0.9 % saline for two days. In the Adalimumab (Ada) group, adalimumab was injected at a dose of 10 mg/kg/ day (i.p) for two days. Lipopolysaccharide (Lps) group rats were injected with a dose of 5 mg/kg (i.p) lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide + Adalimumab (Lps+Ada) group rats received adalimumab before the administration of lipopolysaccharide. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection and blood samples were obtained for determination of biochemical cardiac injury markers and circulating levels of TNF-α and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Hearts were harvested for histological examination. RESULTS Endotoxin exposure resulted in significant increases in serum cardiac injury markers, serum cytokines and histological myocardial injury scores in the Lps group. The levels of circulating cytokines, cardiac injury markers and histological injury scores for myocardial necrosis, perivascular cell infiltration, and inflammation were significantly reduced in Lps+Ada as compared to Lps group (p<0.05).

125895,125895,125895,What will it take to eliminate drug-resistant tuberculosis?,13.50473,8.116379,2019,"In patients with hematologic malignancies due to immune system disorders, especially persistent febrile neutropenia, invasive fungal infections (IFI) occur with high mortality. Aspergillosis, candidiasis, fusariosis, mucormycosis, cryptococcosis and trichosporonosis are the most important infections reported in patients with hematologic malignancies that undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These infections are caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens that do not cause severe issues in healthy individuals, but in patients with hematologic malignancies lead to disseminated infection with different clinical manifestations. Prophylaxis and creating a safe environment with proper filters and air pressure for patients to avoid contact with the pathogens in the surrounding environment can prevent IFI. Furthermore, due to the absence of specific symptoms in IFI, rapid and accurate diagnosis reduces the mortality rate of these infections and using molecular techniques along with standard mycological methods will improve the diagnosis of disseminated fungal infection in patients with hematologic disorders. Amphotericin B products, extended-spectrum azoles, and echinocandins are the essential drugs to control invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, and according to various conditions of patients, different results of treatment with these drugs have been reported in different studies. On the other hand, drug resistance in recent years has led to therapeutic failures and deaths in patients with blood malignancies, which indicates the need for antifungal susceptibility tests to use appropriate therapies. Life-threatening fungal infections have become more prevalent in patients with hematologic malignancies in recent years due to the emergence of new risk factors, new species, and increased drug resistance. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the different dimensions of the most critical invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies and present a list of these infections with different clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcomes.","Shariati, Aref; Moradabadi, Alireza; Chegini, Zahra; Khoshbayan, Amin; Didehdar, Mojtaba",Infection and drug resistance,2,5

It is currently unclear how highly modular social networks influence the persistence of contagious pathogens that generate lifelong immunity in their hosts when between-group interactions are age-dependent. This trait occurs in social species with communal nurseries, where juveniles are reared together for a substantial period in burrows or similar forms of containment and are thus in isolation from contact with individuals in other social groups. Our main objective was to determine whether, and to what extent, such age-dependent patterns of between-group interactions consistently increased the fade-out probability of contagious pathogens that generate lifelong immunity in their hosts. We hypothesised that in populations of species where juveniles are raised in communal nurseries, a high proportion of recovered adults in a group would form a 'protective barrier' around susceptible juveniles against pathogen transmission, thereby increasing the probability of epidemic fade-out in the population. To test this idea we implemented a spatially implicit individual-based Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for a large range of generic host and pathogen traits. Our results indicate that (i) the probability of epidemic fade-out was consistently higher in populations with communal nurseries, especially for highly contagious pathogens (high basic reproduction number, R0 ) and (ii) communal nurseries can counteract the cost of group-living in terms of infection risk to a greater extent than variation in other traits. We discuss our findings in relation to herd immunity and outline the importance of considering the network structure of a given host population before implementing management measures such as vaccinations, since interventions focused on individuals with high between-group contact should be particularly effective for controlling pathogen spread in hosts with communal nurseries.","Marescot, L; Franz, M; Benhaiem, S; Hofer, H; Scherer, C; East, M L; Kramer-Schadt, S",The Journal of animal ecology,2,1

The aim of the current study was to confirm the previously proposed concept of coronary remodeling as first described by Glagov who studied postmortem left main coronary arteries (LMCAs). METHODS Using the in-vivo intravascular ultrasound data from the Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in the Coronary Tree (PROSPECT) study, we evaluated 552 LMCAs in 552 patients. RESULTS External elastic membrane cross-sectional areas (CSAs) increased in proportion to the increase in plaque and media CSAs (r=0.61, P<0.0001), especially when the plaque burden was 20% or lower (r=0.88, P<0.0001). For more advanced atherosclerosis (>40% plaque burden), there was an inverse relationship between lumen CSA and plaque burden (r=-0.57, P<0.0001), whereas this relationship was weak in the presence of less than 40% plaque burden. The frequency of virtual histology derived thin-cap fibroatheroma increased with increasing plaque burden. In contrast, the frequency of pathological intimal thickening decreased. CONCLUSION The previously proposed remodeling concept of Glagov was validated in vivo in the PROSPECT study patients. In addition, the present study suggested that plaque phenotype worsened with increasing LMCA plaque growth.","Inaba, Shinji; Mintz, Gary S; Shimizu, Takehisa; Weisz, Giora; Mehran, Roxana; Marso, Steven P; Xu, Ke; de Bruyne, Bernard; Serruys, Patrick W; Stone, Gregg W; Maehara, Akiko",Coronary artery disease,2,30

Because microorganisms differ in their capacity to methylate mercury, the abundance and distribution of methylating populations may determine MeHg production in the environment. We compared rates of MeHg production and the distribution of hgcAB genes in epilimnetic sediments from a freshwater lake that were experimentally amended with sulfate levels from 7 to 300 mg L-1. The most abundant hgcAB sequences were associated with clades of Methanomicrobia, sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and unknown environmental sequences. The hgcAB+ communities from higher sulfate amendments were less diverse and had relatively more Deltaproteobacteria, whereas the communities from lower amendments were more diverse with a larger proportion of hgcAB sequences affiliated with other clades. Potential methylation rate constants varied 52-fold across the experiment. Both potential methylation rate constants and % MeHg were the highest in sediments from the lowest sulfate amendments, which had the most diverse hgcAB+ communities and relatively fewer hgcAB genes from clades associated with sulfate reduction. Although pore water sulfide concentration covaried with hgcAB diversity across our experimental sulfate gradient, major changes in the community of hgcAB+ organisms occurred prior to a significant buildup of sulfide in pore waters. Our results indicate that methylating communities dominated by diverse anaerobic microorganisms that do not reduce sulfate can produce MeHg as effectively as communities dominated by sulfate-reducing populations.","Jones, Daniel S; Johnson, Nathan W; Mitchell, Carl P J; Walker, Gabriel M; Bailey, Jake V; Pastor, John; Swain, Edward B",Environmental science & technology,2,1

Despite a wealth of metagenomics studies, methods to leverage these datasets to identify future threats are underdeveloped. In this study, we describe an approach that combines existing metagenomics data with reverse genetics to engineer reagents to evaluate emergence and pathogenic potential of circulating zoonotic viruses. Focusing on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses, the results indicate that the WIV1-coronavirus (CoV) cluster has the ability to directly infect and may undergo limited transmission in human populations. However, in vivo attenuation suggests additional adaptation is required for epidemic disease. Importantly, available SARS monoclonal antibodies offered success in limiting viral infection absent from available vaccine approaches. Together, the data highlight the utility of a platform to identify and prioritize prepandemic strains harbored in animal reservoirs and document the threat posed by WIV1-CoV for emergence in human populations.","Menachery, Vineet D; Yount, Boyd L; Sims, Amy C; Debbink, Kari; Agnihothram, Sudhakar S; Gralinski, Lisa E; Graham, Rachel L; Scobey, Trevor; Plante, Jessica A; Royal, Scott R; Swanstrom, Jesica; Sheahan, Timothy P; Pickles, Raymond J; Corti, Davide; Randell, Scott H; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Marasco, Wayne A; Baric, Ralph S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2,31

To overcome this drawback, we developed a new pharmacokinetic propofol model-the Choi model-for use in underweight patients. In the present study, we evaluated the predictive performance of the Choi model. METHODS Twenty underweight patients undergoing elective surgery received propofol via TCI using the Choi model. The target effect-site concentrations (Ces) of propofol were 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 2 μg/mL. Arterial blood samples were obtained at least 10 minutes after achieving pseudo-steady-state. Predicted propofol concentrations with the modified Marsh, Schnider, and Eleveld pharmacokinetic models were obtained by simulation (Asan pump, version 2.1.3; Bionet Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea). The predictive performance of each model was assessed by calculation of four parameters: inaccuracy, divergence, bias, and wobble. RESULTS A total of 119 plasma samples were used to determine the predictive performance of the Choi model. Our evaluation showed that the pooled median (95% CI) bias and inaccuracy were 4.0 (-4.2 to 12.2) and 23.9 (17.6-30.3), respectively. The pooled biases and inaccuracies of the modified Marsh, Schnider, and Eleveld models were clinically acceptable. However, the modified Marsh and Eleveld models consistently produced negatively biased predictions in underweight patients. In particular, the Schnider model showed greater inaccuracy at a target Ce ≥ 3 µg/mL. CONCLUSION The new propofol pharmacokinetic model (the Choi model) developed for underweight patient showed adequate performance for clinical use.","Yi, Jung-Min; Doh, Il; Lee, Seok-Hwan; Kim, Soo-Young; Lee, Yong-Hun; Lee, Eun-Kyung; Lee, Soo-Han; Choi, Byung-Moon; Noh, Gyu-Jeong",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,2,19

MATERIAL AND METHODS From March 16, the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals began telephone consultations. Due to the disparity in the actions of the different department members, the decision was made to create a protocol to manage these consultations which started to be implemented March 23. RESULTS During the study period, 1054 patients were attended in the consultations of both departments; 663 (62.9%) were first visits and 391 (37.10%) were successive visits. Twenty-one percent (229) of the consultations could be resolved by telephone, 10.82% (114) required face-to-face care, 57.40% (605) were indicated for an on-demand check-up depending on their disease course, and 10.05% (106) of the patients could not be reached by telephone. DISCUSSION The state of alarm caused by COVID-19 has been a determining factor in how we undertake our care work. In the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals we decided to carry out consultations by telephone as an alternative to the traditional consultation. During this period, we have observed that up to 21.73% of the consultations could be dealt with by telephone. CONCLUSION The telephone consultation seems to be a very useful tool to attend our patients avoiding the risk of COVID-19 infection during the state of alarm. Furthermore, according to the data analysed and the different studies, it seems a good alternative to the traditional consultation in selected patients.","Gómez González, María Del Rosario; Piqueras Pérez, Francisco M; Guillamón Vivancos, Laura; Galindo Iñiguez, Lorena; Jara Maquilón, Alejandra; Martínez Alonso, Jesús Aaron",Acta otorrinolaringologica espanola,2,17

Disease risk analyses (DRA) are used to identify, prioritise and design mitigation strategies to address these threats. Here we use a DRA undertaken for Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) to illustrate how specific methodology can optimise mitigation strategy design. A literature review identified a total of 98 infectious hazards, and 28 non-infectious hazards. Separate analyses were undertaken for disease risks in leopards from hazards of source origin (captive zoo collections and the transit pathway to the Russian Far East), or of destination origin (in breeding enclosures and wider release areas); and for disease risks in other wildlife, domesticated species or humans, similarly from hazards of source or destination origin. Hazards were assessed and ranked as priority 1, priority 2, priority 3 or low priority in each of the defined scenarios. In addition, we undertook a generic assessment of stress on individual leopards. We use three examples to illustrate the process: Chlamydophila felis, canine distemper virus (CDV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). We found that many potentially expensive screening procedures could be performed prior to export of leopards, putting the onus of responsibility onto the zoo sector, for which access to diagnostic testing facilities is likely to be optimal. We discuss how our methods highlighted significant data gaps relating to pathogen prevalence in the RFE and likely future unpredictability, in particular with respect to CDV. There was emphasis at all stages on record keeping, meticulous planning, design, staff training, and enclosure management, which are relatively financially inexpensive. Actions to minimise stress featured at all time-points in the strategy, and also focussed on planning, design and management.","Lewis, J; Tomlinson, A; Gilbert, M; Alshinetski, M; Arzhanova, T; Goncharuk, M; Goodrich, J; Kerley, L; Korotkova, I; Miquelle, D; Naidenko, S; Sulikhan, N; Uphyrkina, O",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2,16

DESIGN Systematic review of observational studies. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, Embase and Swemed+ were searched through October 2018. Reference lists in included studies were hand searched for potential relevant studies. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included observational studies, published 1990 or later as full-text empirical articles in peer-reviewed journals in English or a Scandinavian language, containing one or more statistical tests regarding a relationship between a measure of alcohol consumption and a measure of work performance. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data. Tested associations between alcohol consumption and work performance within the included studies were quality assessed and analysed with frequency tables, cross-tabulations and χ2 tests of independence. RESULTS Twenty-six studies were included, containing 132 tested associations. The vast majority of associations (77%) indicated that higher levels of alcohol consumption were associated with higher levels of impaired work performance, and these positive associations were considerably more likely than negative associations to be statistically significant (OR=14.00, phi=0.37, p<0.001). Alcohol exposure measured by hangover episodes and composite instruments were over-represented among significant positive associations of moderate and high quality (15 of 17 associations). Overall, 61% of the associations were characterised by low quality. CONCLUSIONS Evidence does provide some support for the notion of alcohol-related presenteeism. However, due to low research quality and lack of longitudinal designs, evidence should be characterised as somewhat inconclusive. More robust and less heterogeneous research is warranted. This review, however, does provide support for targeting alcohol consumption within the frame of workplace interventions aimed at improving employee health and productivity.

This work was aimed to decode rhizosphere microbe interactions and potential ecological hazards associated with GE maize. Rhizobacterial communities of field grown transgenic insect-resistant 2A5 maize carrying mcry1Ab and mcry2Ab genes were compared with control Z58 using PacBio sequencing platform. Also full-length 16S rDNA gene sequencing was used to verify the partial (V3-V4) sequencing results obtained in 2017. Measures of α-diversity displayed transgenic 2A5 to be significantly lower in species richness at the flowering stage; however, diversity remained undisturbed. β-diversity was least affected by genetic modifications where similar community profiles were shared by transgenic 2A5 and control Z58. In addition, root exudation patterns were found to drive variations in bacterial assemblages based on developmental stages. For example, genus Massilia successfully colonized the rhizosphere at jointing stage, while Mucilaginobacter showed higher relative abundance in flowering stages of both 2A5 and Z58. These members are known to possess attributes related to plant growth. The impact of dual-transgene insertion on nifH gene abundance was also analyzed where no apparent significant difference in nifH gene copy number was observed. Our results confirmed that full-length 16S rDNA sequencing was sufficient to provide higher taxonomic resolution. Also, results of our 2-year field trials confirmed that there is no significant impact of mcry gene integration on belowground biomasses. Therefore, GE insect-resistant 2A5 maize carrying mcry1Ab and mcry2Ab genes can continue to benefit human populations by increasing crop productivity. In future, further research needs to be catalyzed to analyze the impact of Bt-insertion on microbial community structure across the years for ecosystem sustainability.","Fazal, Aliya; Wen, Zhongling; Yang, Minkai; Liao, Yonghui; Fu, Jiangyan; He, Cong; Wang, Xuan; Jie, Wencai; Ali, Farman; Hu, Dongqing; Yin, Tongming; Hong, Zhi; Lu, Guihua; Qi, Jinliang; Yang, Yonghua",Environmental science and pollution research international,2,1

Most medical schools have paused or severely limited the direct patient care that has been the core educational requirement of the clinical clerkships. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a curricular model that meets the family medicine clerkship learning objectives via telemedicine clinical instruction. Methods We created a clerkship where all clinical encounters took place by phone or video visits. Students were required to have telemedicine encounters with at least 20 patients over a 4-week clerkship. We also created a telemedicine illness script-writing assignment to prepare students and faculty for these encounters. We evaluated our curriculum by surveying participating students and faculty members. Results Student surveys revealed that all learning objectives were met during the telemedicine clerkship experience. Students felt they made a difference during the COVID-19 pandemic. Faculty felt that the medical students were helpful and that they were able to provide meaningful clinical instruction. Conclusion Our study reveals that a family medicine clerkship can be successfully delivered using telemedicine and remote learning techniques. Senior medical students are a valuable resource and can have a meaningful clinical impact while learning more about family medicine. If social distancing precautions continue, this model can be used by other clerkships to continue medical education and provide medical care.","Hayes, John R; Johnston, Bryan; Lundh, Rebecca",PRiMER,2,12

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban administered for an extended period, as compared with subcutaneous enoxaparin administered for a standard period, followed by placebo. METHODS We randomly assigned patients 40 years of age or older who were hospitalized for an acute medical illness to receive subcutaneous enoxaparin, 40 mg once daily, for 10±4 days and oral placebo for 35±4 days or to receive subcutaneous placebo for 10±4 days and oral rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, for 35±4 days. The primary efficacy outcomes were the composite of asymptomatic proximal or symptomatic venous thromboembolism up to day 10 (noninferiority test) and up to day 35 (superiority test). The principal safety outcome was the composite of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. RESULTS A total of 8101 patients underwent randomization. A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 78 of 2938 patients (2.7%) receiving rivaroxaban and 82 of 2993 patients (2.7%) receiving enoxaparin at day 10 (relative risk with rivaroxaban, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 1.31; P=0.003 for noninferiority) and in 131 of 2967 patients (4.4%) who received rivaroxaban and 175 of 3057 patients (5.7%) who received enoxaparin followed by placebo at day 35 (relative risk, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.02). A principal safety outcome event occurred in 111 of 3997 patients (2.8%) in the rivaroxaban group and 49 of 4001 patients (1.2%) in the enoxaparin group at day 10 (P<0.001) and in 164 patients (4.1%) and 67 patients (1.7%) in the respective groups at day 35 (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS In acutely ill medical patients, rivaroxaban was noninferior to enoxaparin for standard-duration thromboprophylaxis. Extended-duration rivaroxaban reduced the risk of venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban was associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

The aims of this study were to evaluate peri-operative complications and long-term functional outcome of the technique and to analyse whether or not the rectal defect needs to be closed. METHOD Consecutive patients undergoing TAMIS using the SILS port (Covidien) and standard laparoscopic instruments were studied. RESULTS Seventy-five patients (68% male) of mean age 67 (± 15) years underwent single-port transanal surgery at three different centres for 37 benign lesions and 38 low-risk cancers located at a mean of 6.4 ± 2.3 cm from the anal verge. The median operating time was 77 (25-245) min including a median time for resection of 36 (15-75) min and for closure of the rectal defect of 38 (9-105) min. The defect was closed in 53% using interrupted (75%) or a running suture (25%). Intra-operative complications occurred in six (8%) patients and postoperative morbidity was 19% with only one patient requiring reoperation for Grade IIIb local infection. There was no difference in the incidence of complications whether the rectal defect was closed or left open. Patients were discharged after 3.4 (1-21) days. At a median follow-up of 12.8 (2-29) months, the continence was normal (Vaizey score of 1.5; 0-16). CONCLUSION Transanal rectal resection can be safely and efficiently performed by means of a SILS port and standard laparoscopic instruments.

On admission, children had respiratory problems (53%), fever (39%), or other systemic problems (8%). The median charge of a lower respiratory disease hospitalization was highest in January ($1334) and lowest in October ($1076). Median hospitalization charges were highest among children 8-15 years of age compared with younger children </=2 years and those 3-7 years of age. Respiratory disease hospitalizations among children demonstrated annual variations reflecting patterns of children with laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections. In the Republic of Korea, prospective studies that use standardized laboratory testing for respiratory pathogens in children will help to estimate the total burden of viral lower respiratory tract disease.","Kim, Yun K; Nyambat, Batmunkh; Hong, Young S; Lee, Chang G; Lee, Joo W; Kilgore, Paul E",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,2,31

Our purpose is to highlight the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) on stroke disparities, to inspire dialogue, to encourage research to deepen our understanding of the mechanism by which SDOH impact stroke outcomes, and to develop strategies to address SDOH and reduce stroke racial/ethnic disparities. We begin by defining SDOH and health disparities in today's context; we then move to discussing SDOH and stroke, particularly secondary stroke prevention, and conclude with possible approaches to addressing SDOH and reducing stroke disparities. These approaches include (1) building on prior work; (2) enhancing our understanding of populations and subpopulations, including intersectionality, of people who experience stroke disparities; (3) prioritizing populations and points along the stroke care continuum when racial/ethnic disparities are most prominent; (4) understanding how SDOH impact stroke disparities in order to test SDOH interventions that contribute to the disparity; (5) partnering with communities; and (6) exploring technological innovations. By building on the prior work and expanding efforts to address SDOH, we believe that stroke disparities can be reduced.","Skolarus, Lesli E; Sharrief, Anjail; Gardener, Hannah; Jenkins, Carolyn; Boden-Albala, Bernadette",Stroke,2,1

METHODS Between 1995 and 2013, demographic, clinical, and angiographic data of cerebral AVMs have been prospectively collected. We retrospectively analyzed data of patients presenting multiple cerebral AVMs. RESULTS Six patients (mean age, 44 years, male-to-female ratio, 5) presented an angiographic diagnosis of cerebral mAVMs. Only one of them was known to have a HHT. Five patients presented two cerebral AVMs and one patient had three. Three AVMs (23.1 %) presented bleeding at admission. Three patients had supratentorial mAVMs only and the three others had supra and infratentorial AVMs. Only one patient suffered from bleeding of more than one of his mAVMs with an interval of 23 years. CONCLUSIONS For asymptomatic AVMs discovered incidentally without angiographic bleeding risk, we propose a therapeutic abstention. In case of AVM rupture and bleeding, the other ""associated"" AVMs (discovered through a complete angiographic assessment) should also be treated if they are not located in an eloquent area and if the treatment does not present technical difficulties. AVMs with a history of bleeding or associated to angiographic risks have to be treated more aggressively.","Robert, Thomas; Blanc, Raphaël; Botta, Daniele; Ciccio, Gabriele; Smajda, Stanislas; Redjem, Hocine; Fahed, Robert; Piotin, Michel",Acta neurochirurgica,2,1

Using the peptide probe 12p1 (sequence, RINNIPWSEAMM), which was identified previously as an entry inhibitor that binds to gp120, we identify atoms of 12p1 in close contact with gp120 in the monomeric and trimeric states. Interestingly, the binding mode of 12p1 with gp120 is similar for clades B and C. In addition, we show a subtle difference in the binding mode of 12p1 in the presence of gp41 domains, i.e. the trimeric state, which we interpret as small differences in the gp120 structure in the presence of gp41.","Celigoy, Jessica; Ramirez, Benjamin; Tao, Lin; Rong, Lijun; Yan, Lianying; Feng, Yan-Ru; Quinnan, Gerald V; Broder, Christopher C; Caffrey, Michael",The Journal of biological chemistry,2,8

METHODS XRCC1 rs25487 was genotyped in lymphocytes from serial peripheral blood samples. Severe RIL was defined as absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <0.3×109 cells/L. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify independent risk factors, which were then used to group patients according to risk of severe RIL. RESULTS Univariate analysis of the 178 patients in this analysis showed that older age, larger tumors, higher lung V5 and mean lung dose, and higher heart V5 and mean heart dose were associated with severe RIL during treatment (P<0.05). The XRCC1 rs25487 AA genotype was also associated with increased risk of severe RIL during treatment (AA vs. others: hazard ratio [HR] =1.065, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.089-2.500, P = 0.018). Multivariate analyses showed that older age (HR=1.031, 95% CI 1.009-1.054, P=0.005), lung V5 (HR=1.039, 95% CI 1.023-1.055, P<0.001), and AA genotype (AA vs. others, HR=1.768, 95% CI 1.165-2.684, P=0.007) were independently associated with higher incidence of severe RIL. These three risk factors (age ≥56 years, lung V5 ≥51% and XRCC1 rs25487 AA) distinguished patients at different risk of developing severe RIL (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Age, lung V5 and XRCC1 rs25487 AA were all linked with risk of severe RIL. Our predictive risk model may be helpful for identifying patients at high risk of severe RIL so that treatment can be modified.","Xie, Xiaoxue; Lin, Steven H; Welsh, James W; Wei, Xiong; Jin, Hekun; Mohan, Radhe; Liao, Zhongxing; Xu, Ting",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,2,1

DESIGN Scoping review using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Published peer-reviewed and gray literature written in English between 2000 and 2020 about instrumental swallowing assessment (ISA) in adults in residential aged care homes (RACHs). MEASURES A systematic, 3-tiered search of databases including Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and gray literature databases was conducted. Content analysis identified common themes. RESULTS Forty-two sources, 30 from peer-reviewed journals, 12 gray literature publications, and 66 websites of mobile ISA providers that discussed videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSS) and/or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) use in RACHs were included. Most peer-reviewed sources were referenced narratives or surveys of speech pathology practice patterns (53.3%). Researchers in 3 studies used onsite mobile FEES and in 2 studies off-site VFSS, with adults living in RACHs, as part of their research design (16.7%). There were 66 mobile instrumental swallowing assessment provider websites, based within the United States. Three countries (Australia, United States, United Kingdom) had professional guidelines that stipulated minimal requirements for the safe and appropriate provision of ISA services across settings. Themes identified across sources included (1) the approach to swallowing management and clinical indicators for ISA, (2) the role of ISA, (3) service and consumer influences on ISA, and (4) mobile FEES. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS There is a paucity of quality research on instrumental swallowing assessment in adults living in RACHs. There are broad regional and international variances in the way that videofluoroscopy and FEES are accessed and used. A more robust evidence base is required to guide health professionals to design tailored ISA care pathways for residents of RACHs, to achieve high-quality health, social, and economic outcomes.","Birchall, Olga; Bennett, Michelle; Lawson, Nadine; Cotton, Susan M; Vogel, Adam P",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2,1

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a highly immunogenic, safe and robust approach that can be used to base several vaccine candidates on. Particularly, HIV-1 Gag VLPs are a flexible system comprising a Gag core surrounded by a lipid bilayer that can be modified to present diverse types of membrane proteins or antigens against several diseases, like Influenza, dengue, west Nile virus or HPV, where it has been proven successful. The size distribution, and structural characteristics of produced VLPs vary depending on the cell line used to produce them. In this work we established an analytical method of characterization for the Gag protein core and clarify the current variability of Gag stoichiometry in HIV-1 VLPs depending on the cell-based production platform, directly determining the number of Gag molecules per VLP in each case. Three Gag peptides have been validated to quantify the number of monomers using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), an accurate and fast, mass-spectrometry-based method that can be used to assess the quality of the produced Gag VLPs regardless of the cell line used. An average of 3617 ± 17 monomers per VLP was obtained for HEK293, substantially varying between platforms, including mammalian and insect cells. This offers a key advantage in quantification and quality control methods to characterize VLP production at large scale to accelerate new recombinant vaccine production technologies.

Although the mechanical Brockenbrough needle has historically been used for this procedure, a needle employing radiofrequency (RF) energy has more recently been approved for clinical use. We sought to investigate the comparative effectiveness of an RF versus conventional needle for transseptal LA access. METHODS AND RESULTS In this prospective, single-blinded, controlled trial, 72 patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to an RF versus conventional (BRK-1) transseptal needle. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome was time required for transseptal LA access. Secondary outcomes included failure of the assigned needle, visible plastic dilator shavings from needle introduction, and any procedural complication. The median transseptal puncture time was 68% shorter using the RF needle compared with the conventional needle (2.3 minutes [interquartile range {IQR}, 1.7 to 3.8 minutes] versus 7.3 minutes [IQR, 2.7 to 14.1 minutes], P = 0.005). Failure to achieve transseptal LA access with the assigned needle was less common using the RF versus conventional needle (0/36 [0%] versus 10/36 [27.8%], P < 0.001). Plastic shavings were grossly visible after needle advancement through the dilator and sheath in 0 (0%) RF needle cases and 12 (33.3%) conventional needle cases (P < 0.001). There were no differences in procedural complications (1/36 [2.8%] versus 1/36 [2.8%]). CONCLUSIONS Use of an RF needle resulted in shorter time to transseptal LA access, less failure in achieving transseptal LA access, and fewer visible plastic shavings.","Hsu, Jonathan C; Badhwar, Nitish; Gerstenfeld, Edward P; Lee, Randall J; Mandyam, Mala C; Dewland, Thomas A; Imburgia, Kourtney E; Hoffmayer, Kurt S; Vedantham, Vasanth; Lee, Byron K; Tseng, Zian H; Scheinman, Melvin M; Olgin, Jeffrey E; Marcus, Gregory M",Journal of the American Heart Association,2,1

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LPR in COVID-19 pediatric patients with mild symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective multicenter analysis included hospitalized children with mild COVID-19 who received LPR at one of 13 hospitals in China from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2020. Patients treated with LPR were matched with patients not treated with LPR (1:4) according to age, sex, and length of symptom onset and hospitalization. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were applied to compare differences between groups. Kaplan-Meier probability curves and Cox regression models were used to analyze nasal swab turning negative time (recovery time) and hospital discharge days. RESULTS In total, 23 patients treated with LPR were matched with 92 untreated controls. The median age of patients was 6 years, and 56.52% of them were male. All patients were discharged from the hospital after being cured. The treatment group had a longer nasal swab turning negative time (hazard ratio [HR] 5.33; 95% CI: 1.94-14.67; p = 0.001) than the control group. LPR treatment was also associated with a longer hospitalization time (HR 2.01; 95% CI: 1.24-3.29; p = 0.005). After adjusting for the influence of LPR treatment, adverse drug reaction events were associated with a longer nasopharyngeal swab negative time (HR 4.67; 95% CI 1.35-16.11; p = 0.015).

However, increasing reports show that some tumors are resistant to metformin. Identification of factors affecting metformin mediated cancer therapy is of great significance. FGFR1 is a receptor-tyrosine-kinase that is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, which is associated with poor-prognosis. To investigate the effect of FGFR1 overexpression on metformin-induced inhibition of breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that FGFR1 overexpression rendered MCF-7 and T47D cells resistant to metformin. In particular, we found that, in addition to AKT and ERK1/2 activation, FGFR1-induced activation of IRS1 and IGF1R, key regulators connecting metabolism and cancer, was associated with metformin resistance. Targeting IRS with IRS1 KO or IRS inhibitor NT157 significantly sensitized FGFR1 overexpressing cells to metformin. Combination of NT157 with metformin induced enhanced inhibition of p-IGF1R, p-ERK1/2 and p-mTOR. Moreover, we demonstrated that IRS1 functions as a critical mediator of the crosstalk between FGFR1 and IGF1R pathways, which involves a feedback loop between IRS1 and MAPK/ERK. Our study highlights the significance of FGFR1 status and IRS1 activation in metformin-resistance, which will facilitate the development of strategies targeting FGFR overexpression-associated metformin resistance.","Shi, Yujie; Ma, Zhikun; Cheng, Qiong; Wu, Yudan; Parris, Amanda B; Kong, Lingfei; Yang, Xiaohe",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Ceftriaxone (CEF) upregulates astrocytic GLT-1 expression/activity, which could counteract excessive glutamate levels and aggressive behavior induced by anabolic synthetic steroids such as nandrolone decanoate (ND). Here, adult male CF-1 mice were allocated to oil (VEH), ND, CEF, and ND/CEF groups. Mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected with ND (15 mg/kg) or VEH for 19 days, and received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of CEF (200 mg/kg) or saline for 5 days. The ND/CEF group received ND for 19 days plus coadministration of CEF in the last 5 days. On the 19th day, the aggressive phenotypes were evaluated through the resident-intruder test. After 24 h, cerebrospinal fluid was collected to measure glutamate levels, and the pre-frontal cortex was used to assess GLT-1, pGluN2BTyr1472, and pGluN2ATyr1246 by Western blot. Synaptosomes from the left brain hemisphere was used to evaluate mitochondrial function including complex II-succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), Ca2+ handling, membrane potential (ΔѰm), and H2O2 production. ND decreased the latency for the first attack and number of attacks by the resident mice against the intruder, mechanistically associated with an increase in glutamate and pGluN2BTyr1472 but not pGluN2ATyr1244 and GLT-1 downregulation. The abnormalities in mitochondrial Ca2+ influx, SDH, ΔѰm, and H2O2 implies in deficient energy support to the synaptic machinery. The ND/CEF group displayed a decreased aggressive behavior, normalization of glutamate and pGluN2BTyr1472levels, and mitochondrial function at synaptic terminals. In conclusion, the pharmacological modulation of GLT-1 highlights its relevance as an astrocytic target against highly impulsive and aggressive phenotypes.","Rodolphi, Marcelo S; Kopczynski, Afonso; Carteri, Randhall B K; Sartor, Monia; Fontella, Fernanda U; Feldmann, Marceli; Hansel, Gisele; Strogulski, Nathan R; Portela, Luis V",Hormones and behavior,2,5

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that can occur in severe cases with acute pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. In these cases, ICU admission is necessary. CASE SUMMARY A 59-year-old Caucasian man with septic shock and bilateral interstitial pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 and schizotypal personality disorder presented with catatonic behaviour manifested by soporous state, response to intense painful stimuli with opening of the eyes, execution of simple verbal commands, maintenance of the same position, catalepsy, immobility, rigidity and mutism. At the same time, there were symptoms of septic shock and catatonic symptoms causing greater difficulty in the correct formulation of the diagnosis. During the course of his hospitalization, he was treated with asenapine 20 mg/day. The catatonia responded rapidly and significantly to the asenapine. DISCUSSION To date, the pathophysiology of catatonia is unclear and few guidelines are available for the treatment of catatonia. In the literature, studies have reported the efficacy of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam, GABAA agonists such as zolpidem, NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine, antidepressant SSRIs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine and antipsychotics such as olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole. We demonstrate that the antipsychotic asenapine is also effective in treating catatonic symptoms in psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION Asenapine produced a rapid and significant reduction in catatonic symptoms in our patient with schizotypal personality disorder.","Fiaschè, F; Adriani, B; Mancinelli, I; Taranto, A",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2,33

Pro-drug activation, a modality of cancer therapy leads to Ganciclovir triphosphate (GCV-TP) incorporation into newly synthesized DNA resulting in cell death. The objective was to enhance, with Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and All Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA), GJIC, crucial for drug delivery, and with combination, abrogate the observed detrimental effect of Dexamethasone (DXM). METHODS Cell lines (NT8E, and HeLa) were pre-treated with Valproic Acid (VPA) (1 mM), 4 Phenyl Butyrate (4PB) (2 mM), ATRA (10 μM) and Dexamethasone (1 μM). Protein quantitated with the Bicinchoninic (BCA) assay for cell lysates, membrane and soluble fractions was assessed with Western blotting for Connexins (43, 26 and 32) and E-Cadherin. A qRT-PCR was done for CX 43-GJA1, CX 26-GJB2, CX 32-GJB1 and E-Cadherin, and normalized with Glyceraldehyde Phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Further, localization of Connexins (CX) and E-Cadherin, GJIC competence, pre-clinical in-vitro studies and the mechanism of cell death were evaluated. RESULTS There was no toxicity or change in growth patterns observed with the drugs. In both the cell lines CX 43 localized to the membrane whereas CX 32 and CX 26 were present but not membrane bound. E-Cadherin was present on the membrane in NT8E and completely absent in HeLa cells. Effects of HDACi, DXM and ATRA were seen on the expression of Connexins and E-Cadherin in both the cell lines. NT8E and HeLa cell lines showed enhanced GJIC with 4PB [30 %], VPA [36 %] and ATRA [54 %] with a 60 % increase in cytotoxicity and an abrogation of Dexamethasone inhibition on combination with VPA or ATRA. CONCLUSION An enhancement of GJIC function by HDACi and ATRA increased cytotoxicity and could be effective in the presence of Dexamethasone, when combined with ATRA or VPA.","Warawdekar, Ujjwala M; Jain, Vaishali; Patel, Himani; Nanda, Adyasha; Kamble, Vishal",Current research in translational medicine,2,29
134243,134243,134243,Defining neonatal sepsis.,13.404808,8.158139,2016,"OBJECTIVES The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected various populations differently. We investigated the relationship between socioeconomic determinants of health obtained from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings and COVID-19 incidence and mortality at the county level in Georgia. METHODS We analyzed data on COVID-19 incidence and case-fatality rates (CFRs) from the Georgia Department of Public Health from March 1 through August 31, 2020. We used repeated measures generalized linear mixed models to determine differences over time in Georgia counties among quartile health rankings of health outcomes, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. RESULTS COVID-19 incidence per 100 000 population increased across all quartile county groups for all health rankings (range, 23.1-51.6 in May to 688.4-1062.0 in August). COVID-19 CFRs per 100 000 population peaked in April and May (range, 3312-6835) for all health rankings, declined in June and July (range, 827-5202), and increased again in August (range, 1877-3310). Peak CFRs occurred later in counties with low health rankings for health behavior and clinical care and in counties with high health rankings for social and economic factors and physical environment. All interactions between the health ranking quartile variables and month were significant (P < .001). County-level Gini indices were associated with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 incidence (P < .001) but not CFRs. CONCLUSIONS From March through August 2020, COVID-19 incidence rose in Georgia's counties independent of health rankings categorization. Differences in time to peak CFRs differed at the county level based upon key health rankings. Public health interventions should incorporate unique strategies to improve COVID-19-related patient outcomes in these environments.","Berman, Adam E; Miller, D Douglas; Rahn, Daniel W; Hess, David C; Thompson, Mark A; Mossialos, Elias A; Waller, Jennifer L",Public health reports,2,1

Data suggesting a benefit to using ICIs in the neoadjuvant therapy of patients with early stage NSCLC are emerging. Eligible subjects were treatment naïve patients with stage IB, II, and resectable IIIA NSCLC. Patients received three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with four doses of avelumab every 2 weeks. Patients with squamous cell cancer received cisplatin or carboplatin on day 1 and gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 of each cycle of chemotherapy. Patients with nonsquamous histology received cisplatin or carboplatin with pemetrexed on day 1 of each cycle. Patients then proceeded to their planned surgery. Out of 15 patients accrued as part of stage 1 of the study, four had a radiologic response (1 complete response), lower than the minimum of six responses needed to continue to phase 2 of the study. The study was therefore terminated. Majority had adenocarcinoma histology and stage IIIA disease. The treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects. Four patients (26.7%) had grade III/IV CTCAE toxicity. This study confirms that the preoperative administration of chemotherapy and avelumab is safe. There was no indication of increased surgical complications. The benefit of adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy did not appear to enhance the overall response rate of patients in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with resectable NSCLC because this study failed to meet its primary endpoint.","Tfayli, Arafat; Al Assaad, Majd; Fakhri, Ghina; Akel, Reem; Atwi, Hanine; Ghanem, Hady; El Karak, Fadi; Farhat, Fadi; Al Rabi, Kamal; Sfeir, Pierre; Youssef, Pierre; Mansour, Ziad; Assi, Hazem; Haidar, Mohamad; Abi Ghanem, Alain; Khalifeh, Ibrahim; Boulos, Fouad; Mahfouz, Ramy; Youssef, Bassem; Zeidan, Youssef; Bejjany, Rachelle; Khuri, Fadlo",Cancer medicine,2,24

We investigated a cluster of COVID-19 cases in returning Australian residents who attended wedding events in Bali, Indonesia, during 15- 21 March 2020. Attendees participated in various social events and were in close proximity, providing multiple opportunities for transmission. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the 41 attendees, of whom 17 participated in a structured interview that included history of illness, risk exposures and event attendance. We obtained data for the remaining 24 participants through corroborative histories and public health unit case investigations. Results COVID-19 was identified in 56% of attendees (23/41), with illness onset between 21 March and 2 April 2020. One secondary case was identified in a household contact of an attendee. The median age of cases was 31 years (range 3-64). One case was hospitalised and did not require critical care. There were no deaths. No cases occurred among six attendees who left prior to the actual wedding day. Guests attended multiple events and participated in high-risk transmission behaviours such as shaking hands, kissing, dancing, sharing drinks and sharing shisha (water pipes). Attack rates ranged from 64% to 87% for different exposures. We could not identify a single risk exposure that accounted for all cases; it is therefore likely there were multiple episodes of transmission. Conclusion Our investigation identified a high attack rate of COVID-19 among a cohort of wedding event attendees. Attendees engaged in close physical contact, shared drinks and shisha, and were in close proximity during the wedding events, which may have contributed to the high attack rate. This outbreak highlights the significant role social events can play in transmission of COVID-19 and underscores why it is important to limit gatherings and close physical contact to control the spread of the virus.","Ravindran, Bhavi; Hogarth, Freya; Williamson, Kirsten; Wright, Rose; Kirk, Martyn; Dalton, Craig",Communicable diseases intelligence,2,23

METHODS Consecutive adult admissions with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this single-centre retrospective UK cohort study. We analysed all electronic clinical observations recorded within 28 days of admission until discharge or occurrence of a serious event, defined as any of the following: initiation of respiratory support, admission to intensive care, initiation of end of life care, or in-hospital death. RESULTS 133/296 (44.9%) patients experienced at least one serious event. NEWS2 ≥ 5 heralded the first occurrence of a serious event with sensitivity 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00), specificity 0.28 (0.21-0.35), positive predictive value (PPV) 0.53 (0.47-0.59), and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.96 (0.90-1.00). The NPV (but not PPV) of NEWS2 monitoring exceeded that of other early warning scores including the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) (0.59 [0.52-0.66], p<0.001) and quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score (0.58 [0.51-0.65], p<0.001). CONCLUSION Our results support the use of NEWS2 monitoring as a sensitive method to identify deterioration of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, albeit at the expense of a relatively high false-trigger rate.","Baker, Kenneth F; Hanrath, Aidan T; Schim van der Loeff, Ina; Kay, Lesley J; Back, Jonathan; Duncan, Christopher Ja",Clinical medicine,2,10

In this short communication, we trace a particular perspective for the application of telemedicine for PWEs undergoing ketogenic diet (KD) treatment, considering the social and economic difficulties faced by healthcare teams in resource-poor countries, such as Brazil. During the pandemic, financial strain was the main impediment to following KD. The pandemic increased socioeconomic insecurity and access to KD-related products, as well as increasing anxiety in 71% of PWE, impacting their KD treatment follow-up.

Methods- Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched until March 14, 2019 to identify relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies assessing the risk of incident stroke based on hs-cTn were eligible. Pooled adjusted hazard ratios including 95% CI were calculated using a random-effects model due to study heterogeneity per population, coding of hs-cTn (categorical/continuous data), per hs-cTn subunit (T or I), for low risk of bias, and for all-cause and ischemic stroke separately. Results- We included 17 articles with 96 702 participants. In studies conducted in the general population (n=12; 77 780 participants), the pooled adjusted hazard ratio for incident stroke was 1.25 (CI, 1.10-1.40) for high versus low hs-cTn (as defined by included studies) during an average follow-up of 1 to 20 years (median 10). When categorical data were used, this was increased to 1.58 (CI, 1.26-1.90). The results were robust when accounting for stroke classification (all-cause stroke/ischemic stroke), hs-cTn subunit, risk of bias, and coding of hs-cTn. In patients with atrial fibrillation (4 studies; 18 725 participants), the pooled adjusted hazard ratio for incident stroke was 1.95 (CI, 1.29-2.62) for high versus low hs-cTn. Due to lack of data (one study, 197 participants), no meta-analysis could be performed in patients with previous stroke. Conclusions- This meta-analysis suggests that hs-cTn can be regarded as a risk marker for incident stroke, with different effect size in different subgroups. More research about the association between hs-cTn and incident stroke in high-risk populations is needed, especially in patients with history of ischemic stroke.","Broersen, Leonie H A; Stengl, Helena; Nolte, Christian H; Westermann, Dirk; Endres, Matthias; Siegerink, Bob; Scheitz, Jan F",Stroke,2,15

This, in turn, has led to a need to understand better the evidence underpinning such moves. Based on a review of existing reviews, this paper critically analyses the relevant literature related to intervention with children with communication disabilities drawing on the COM-B model. METHODS & PROCEDURES Ten reviews were identified following a systematic searching of electronic databases. These were then coded according to both PRISMA criteria and the components of the COM-B model. Based on these findings, a critical analysis of the state of the tele-practice intervention literature is discussed and fed into evidence-based advice for practitioners transitioning to this mode of service delivery. OUTCOMES & RESULTS The COM-B mapping suggests that the existing literature has provided primary evidence for physical opportunity and reflective motivation (e.g., participants have the time to take part and the necessary materials, as well as a desire to do it). It has also focused on elements of social opportunity (e.g., having support and prompts from others to take part). However, there are significant gaps in the description and analysis of both physical and psychological capability components. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS Whilst the evidence for tele-practice interventions for children and young people with communication disabilities is growing, it is also lacking a comprehensive framework to support its implementation. In times of rapid transitions, researchers and practitioners alike need to understand how to evaluate comprehensively the impact of changing the mode of intervention delivery. The COM-B model provides a powerful tool to reflect on the key elements for the successful design and implementation of tele-practice interventions. What this paper adds What is already known on this subject Tele-practice has been a feature of service delivery for speech and language therapists working with children and young people with speech and language disorders for many years, as it has in other areas of practice. This came into sharp focus during 2020 during the 'lock-down' following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic when most practice went online. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study set out to provide a framework for understanding service delivery, drawing on the COM-B behaviour change model. This is applied using a rapid review methodology to 10 systematic and narrative reviews of the existing literature published since 2005. The findings suggest that while most studies demonstrated efficacy, there was a lack of information regarding specific aspects of the model which would affect their implementation. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? It is anticipated that the paper has the potential to have a direct bearing on how tele-practice services for children and young people with speech and language disorders will be delivered in the future. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for practice and research in terms of the application of the COM-B model to tele-practice in speech and language therapy.","Law, James; Dornstauder, Melanie; Charlton, Jenna; Gréaux, Mélanie",International journal of language & communication disorders,2,1

This has placed added significance on EM away rotations (ARs). We sought to determine the overall availability of ARs in EM. Methods We surveyed clerkships sites at the end of 2018-2019 application season. The survey requested data about maximum rotation spots available, actual number of students that rotated, and data about application processing and rotation offer decision making. Results We received 190 responses, of which 129 (49% of 262 clerkship sites surveyed) provided data regarding available positions and student rotators. A total of 3,472 ARs were completed at the responding sites. The average capacity ratio (CR; maximum available AR spots divided by AR completed by students) for responding sites was 1.57. AR availability varied by time and geography. Most AR positions were filled during peak season (CR = 1.22); however, many went unfilled outside of this time frame (CR = 2.41). Geographic data showed some locations had significant unfilled AR availability. Conclusions Our survey data show that there are at least 1.5 AR positions per applicant. Students can be reasonably expected to complete one AR and, in select cases, a second. CR during peak season indicates nearly saturated AR positions. Flexibility of rotation timing and tools to link open AR positions with students needing to complete a rotation will help optimize filling available AR positions. Continued effort in application advising from home clerkships and processes to ensure equitable distribution of AR positions among students will help ensure interested students obtain a position.","Kiemeney, Michael; Franzen, Doug",AEM education and training,2,16

STUDY DESIGN A prospective randomized study. SETTING Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS Twenty-four patients, ages 21 to 82 years, with a diagnosis of cholesteatoma, undergoing CWD tympanomastoidectomy for the first time. INTERVENTION Placement of a STSG to line the mastoid cavity at the time of surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the amount of time required for epithelialization of the mastoid cavity. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, specifically, presence of otorrhea, granulation tissue, meatal stenosis, or tympanic membrane perforation. RESULTS Twenty-four patients met inclusion criteria. Thirteen patients were randomized to the study group and 11 patients to the control group. Data were collected at follow-up appointments scheduled at postoperative Weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12, as well as every 6 months thereafter.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of applying a watchful waiting strategy for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia in men. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to May 14, 2020. Included were all types of original data written in English, German, Danish, Swedish, or Norwegian involving ≥ 5 male patients aged ≥ 18 years old with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia and undergoing watchful waiting. This review was reported according to the PRISMA guideline. RESULTS A total of nine studies were included; three randomized controlled trials, three prospective cohort studies, and three retrospective cohort studies. Data on a total of 858 unique patients following a watchful waiting strategy were included. Approximately one-third of patients crossed over from watchful waiting to surgery after 3 years increasing to more than two-thirds after 10 years. The most frequent reason for crossover was hernia-related pain (median 79%, range 48-91%). The rate of acute hernia-related operations was low (2-3%), and watchful waiting was not associated with increased mortality or postoperative complications. Levels of pain and discomfort after randomization were similar over time between patients undergoing elective repair or watchful waiting. CONCLUSION Applying a watchful waiting strategy to men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia was safe, but two-thirds of patients crossed over to surgical repair within 10 years mainly due to pain.","Reistrup, Hugin; Fonnes, Siv; Rosenberg, Jacob",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,2,1

Data from previous research have suggested that veterinarians may face challenges in investigation of disease events due to time and money constraints. As part of an Australia-wide survey project, veterinarians were asked to answer an open-ended question regarding potential constraints in investigation of a typical disease events where there may be concern about a zoonosis or emerging infectious disease. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis with the consideration of the respondent's area of practice and level of experience. Five main themes were identified which encapsulated constraints to disease investigation described by participants, namely: (a) financing of disease investigations, including client willingness/ability to pay in absence of alternative government schemes; (b) client-related factors, including willingness to consent to investigation and comply with instructions; (c) professional preparedness to act, related to practitioner knowledge and technical competency; (d) workplace environment, impacted by physical, logistical and managerial aspects of workplaces; and (e) access to external technical support, primarily from government veterinary services. Successful investigation and management of atypical diseases, including potential zoonoses, requires preparedness of all veterinarians. Continuing professional education for veterinarians in infection prevention and control and biosecurity, alongside adequate government funding and support will help facilitate optimal health and biosecurity outcomes. Both state and federal governments need to review existing animal health structures to ensure cohesive responses for future disease events.","Steele, Sandra G; Mor, Siobhan M; Toribio, Jenny-Ann L M L",Zoonoses and public health,2,1

OBJECTIVES We aimed to assess the therapeutic success of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in severe ARF in the course of COVID-19 in a noncritical care setting as well as to identify predictors of HFNO failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted between March and December 2020. We enrolled all consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in whom HFNO therapy was used. The primary outcome measure was death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission. RESULTS Of the 380 patients with COVID-19, 116 individuals (30.5%) requiring HFNO due to severe pneumonia were analyzed. The primary outcome, defined as death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission, occurred in 54 patients (46.6%). The overall 30-day mortality was 30.2% (35/116) in the entire cohort and 64.7% (34/51) among patients requiring endotracheal intubation. A multivariable analysis revealed that the ROX index measured within the first 12 hours of therapy below 3.85 was related to increased mortality (hazard ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.03-11.35) compared with the ROX index of 4.88 or higher. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that nearly half of patients treated with HFNO due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia will require mechanical ventilation.

Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, there has been the considerable emphasis placed on the implications for cancer patients in terms of their vulnerability to the virus and potential exposure in healthcare settings. But little emphasis has been placed on the significant and potentially enduring, consequences of COVID-19 for how cancer care is delivered. In this article we outline the importance of a focus on the effects of COVID-19 for oncology practice during and potentially after the pandemic, focusing on key shifts that are already evident, including the pivot to online consultations; shifts in access to clinical trials, and definitions of 'essential care'; the changing economics of practice; and, the potential legacy effects of rapidly implemented changes in cancer care. COVID-19 is re-shaping oncology practice, clinical trials, and delivery of cancer care broadly, and these changes might endure well beyond the short- to mid-term of the active pandemic. Therefore, shifts in practice brought about by the pandemic must be accompanied by improved training and awareness, enhanced infrastructure, and evidence-based support if they are to harness the positives and offset the potential negative consequences of the impacts of COVID-19 on cancer care.","Broom, Alex; Kenny, Katherine; Page, Alexander; Cort, Nicole; Lipp, Eric; Tan, Aaron C; Ashley, David M; Walsh, Kyle M; Khasraw, Mustafa",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2,1

Challenges include congregate activities, consistency/accuracy of COVID-19 related communications, availability of alternate housing, barriers to testing and contact tracing, lack of internet connectivity in farmworker housing and insufficient personal protective equipment. Challenges are discussed in no order of occurrence or level of importance as many are inter-related. To meet these challenges, a migrant health and housing workgroup was convened. Members include the NC Department of Labor-Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau, NC Department of Health and Human Services - Communicable Disease Branch and NC Farmworker Health Program, NC Community Health Center Association and NC Agromedicine Institute. Members work collaboratively along the continuum from local to state levels and across agencies and communities to facilitate strategies to address COVID-19 challenges. Implications exist for practice, research and policy including testing of MSFWs on arrival with a 14-day quarantine before moving to assigned farm, a ""strike team"" to do on-farm tests for workers in the event of a positive case or exposure; and, research on COVID-19 outbreaks and impact of telehealth on MSFWs wellbeing.","Tutor Marcom, Robin; Freeman Lambar, Elizabeth; Rodman, Beth; Thomas, Gayle; Watson, Ann; Parrish, Bryan; Wilburn, Jessica",Journal of agromedicine,2,17

RESULTS The Multimodal Strategy, proposed for hospitals in general, can be adapted for field hospitals in order to reduce the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Investments to adapt the infrastructure and education of workers require foresight and speed and are of special relevance to promote hand hygiene in this care context.

MATERIALS AND METHODS All 321 patients who presented with respiratory impairment suspicious for COVID-19 infection between February 3 and May 8, 2020 and who received a chest radiograph were included in this analysis. Imaging findings were classified as typical for COVID-19 (bilateral, peripheral opacifications/consolidations), non-typical (findings consistent with lobar pneumonia), indeterminate (all other distribution patterns of opacifications/consolidations), or none (no opacifications/consolidations). The sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive value for the diagnostic value of the category ""typical"" were determined. Chi² test was used to compare the pattern distribution between the different types of pneumonia. RESULTS Imaging patterns defined as typical for COVID-19 infections were documented in 35/111 (31.5 %) patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection but only in 4/210 (2 %) patients with any other kind of pneumonia, resulting in a sensitivity of 31.5 %, a specificity of 98.1 %, and a positive and negative predictive value of 89.7 % or 73 %, respectively. The sensitivity could be increased to 45.9 % when defining also unilateral, peripheral opacifications/consolidations with no relevant pathology contralaterally as consistent with a COVID-19 infection, while the specificity decreases slightly to 93.3 %. The pattern distribution between COVID-19 patients and those with other types of pneumonia differed significantly (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Although the moderate sensitivity does not allow the meaningful use of chest radiographs as part of primary screening, the specific pattern of findings in a relevant proportion of those affected should be communicated quickly as additional information and trigger appropriate protective measures. KEY POINTS · COVID-19 infections show specific X-ray image patterns in 1/3 of patients.. · Bilateral, peripheral opacities and/or consolidations are typical imaging patterns.. · Unilateral, peripheral opacities and/or consolidations should also raise suspicion of COVID-19 infection..

Previous studies have noted hypertension is associated with increased mortality due to COVID-19; however, it is not clear whether the increased risk is due to hypertension itself or antihypertensive agents. We aimed to evaluate the impact of antihypertensive agents on the clinical outcomes of hypertensive patients with COVID-19. METHODS Our study included 169 consecutive hypertensive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 between March 20 and April 10, 2020. The demographic characteristics, clinical data, and type of antihypertensive agents being used were reviewed. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 65.8±11.7 years.30 patients(17.7%) died during hospitalization. A total of 142 patients(84%) were using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), 91 (53.8%) were using diuretics, 69 (40.8%) were using calcium channel blockers (CCBs), 66 (39.1%) were using beta-blockers, 12 (7.1%) were using alpha-blockers, and 5 (2.9%) were using mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). There was no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors based on the type of antihypertensive agents being used. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the type of the antihypertensive agent being used had no effect on mortality [OR=0.527 (0.130-2.138), p=0.370 for ACEIs/ARBs; OR=0.731 (0.296-1.808), p=0.498 for CCBs; OR=0.673 (0.254-1.782), p=0.425 for diuretics; OR=1.846 (0.688-4.950), p=0.223 for beta-blockers; OR=0.389 (0.089-1.695), p=0.208 for alpha-blockers; and OR=1.372 (0.107-17.639), p=0.808 for MRAs]. CONCLUSION The type of antihypertensive agent being used had no effect on the clinical course and mortality in hypertensive patients with COVID-19. The use of these agents should be maintained for the treatment of hypertension during hospitalization.","Kocayigit, Ibrahim; Kocayigit, Havva; Yaylaci, Selcuk; Can, Yusuf; Erdem, Ali Fuat; Karabay, Oguz",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,2,9

We aimed to determine how many older patients admitted to acute medical wards had a pre-existing 'do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation' (DNACPR) decision, how many had one recorded on the ward and how many of those who died had a DNACPR decision in place. METHODS A prospective cohort study, using data from medical records, of 481 consecutive patients aged ≥65 years admitted to the six acute medical wards of the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. RESULTS 105/481 (22%) had a DNACPR decision at ward admission, 30 of which had been made in the emergency unit. A further 45 decisions were recorded on the ward, mostly after discussion with relatives. Of the 37 patients who died, 36 had a DNACPR decision. For the 20 deceased patients whose DNACPR decision was recorded during their admission, the median time from documentation to death was 4 days with 7/20 (35%) recorded the day before death. CONCLUSIONS Older patients with multimorbidity need the opportunity to discuss the role of CPR earlier in their care and preferably before acute hospital admission.","Walker, Jane; Burke, Katy; Wanat, Marta; Hobbs, Harriet; Rocroi, Isabelle; Sharpe, Michael",BMJ supportive & palliative care,2,22

This report presents the safety and feasibility of performing SILC right hemicolectomy with the SILS™ Port Multiple Instrument Access Port. METHODS Between July 2009 and October 2009, SILC right hemicolectomy was performed for 13 consecutive, unselected patients presenting with benign or malignant pathology. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS For 11 of the 13 patients (84.6%), the SILC procedure was performed with a mean incision length of 3.1 ± 1.1 cm (range, 2.5-6.0 cm) and a mean operative time of 131.5 ± 36.2 min (range, 79-180 min). Two cases required conversion to hand-assisted technique. Overall, the operative time was found to be significantly longer for the patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m(2) (152.1 ± 26.6 min) compared with the patients with a BMI less than 25 kg/m(2) (93.3 ± 11.6 min) (p < 0.002). For the subset of patients with malignant disease (five adenocarcinomas and one carcinoid), the mean number of lymph nodes extracted was 26.7 ± 14.5. There were no intraoperative complications, and the overall mean hospital stay was 2.5 ± 0.7 days (range, 2-4 days). One postoperative complication occurred (7.7%). CONCLUSION The SILC procedure is a safe and feasible method for benign and malignant diseases requiring a right hemicolectomy. This method results in a low complication rate and a short postoperative hospital stay.","Ramos-Valadez, Diego I; Patel, Chirag B; Ragupathi, Madhu; Bartley Pickron, T; Haas, Eric M",Surgical endoscopy,2,23

Countries must stop OPV use to end all cases of poliomyelitis, including vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and cases caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of all type 2 OPV (OPV2) use in routine immunization in 2016 but did not successfully end the transmission of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), and consequently continues to use type 2 OPV (OPV2) for outbreak response activities. Using an updated global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model, we characterize outbreak response options for 2019-2029 related to responding to VDPV2 outbreaks with a genetically stabilized novel OPV (nOPV2) strain or with the currently licensed monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2). Given uncertainties about the properties of nOPV2, we model different assumptions that appear consistent with the evidence on nOPV2 to date. Using nOPV2 to respond to detected cases may reduce the expected VDPV and VAPP cases and the risk of needing to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization compared to mOPV2 use for outbreak response. The actual properties, availability, and use of nOPV2 will determine its effects on type 2 poliovirus transmission in populations. Even with optimal nOPV2 performance, countries and the GPEI would still likely need to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization in OPV-using countries if operational improvements in outbreak response to stop the transmission of cVDPV2s are not implemented effectively.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Pallansch, Mark A; Wilkinson, Amanda; Bandyopadhyay, Ananda S; Konopka-Anstadt, Jennifer L; Burns, Cara C; Oberste, M Steven; Wassilak, Steven G F; Badizadegan, Kamran; Thompson, Kimberly M",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2,1

Results were summarised using numeric and thematic analysis.Results: Twenty four publications were included. Four themes were identified; attitudes towards occupation-based practice, benefits of occupation-based approaches, challenges implementing occupation-based practice, and strategies to overcome challenges.Conclusion and Significance: Findings highlighted therapists value occupation as an important aspect of practice, however they experience many environmental and personal challenges in acute settings. Strategies to overcome these challenges related to individual's changing their practice to be more occupation-focussed and changes within the practice context including adapting environments, documentation and intervention protocols to focus on occupation. These strategies may support therapists to align practice with their professional values.","Murray, Alice; Di Tommaso, Amelia; Molineux, Matthew; Young, Anna; Power, Penny",Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy,2,0

Regular exercise can also improve S(I) in obese individuals; however, it is unknown whether exercise and RYGB surgery-induced weight loss would additively improve S(I) and other cardiometabolic factors. METHODS We conducted a single-blind, prospective, randomized trial with 128 men and women who recently underwent RYGB surgery (within 1-3 months). Participants were randomized to either a 6-month semi-supervised moderate exercise protocol (EX, n = 66) or a health education control (CON; n = 62) intervention. Main outcomes measured included S(I) and glucose effectiveness (S(G)), which were determined from an intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal modeling. Secondary outcomes measured were cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) and body composition. Data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) approach to assess the efficacy of the exercise intervention (>120 min of exercise/week). RESULTS 119 (93%) participants completed the interventions, 95% for CON and 91% for EX. There was a significant decrease in body weight and fat mass for both groups (P < 0.001 for time effect). S(I) improved in both groups following the intervention (ITT: CON vs. EX; +1.64 vs. +2.24 min⁻¹/μU/ml, P = 0.18 for Δ, P < 0.001 for time effect). A PP analysis revealed that exercise produced an additive S(I) improvement (PP: CON vs. EX; +1.57 vs. +2.69 min⁻¹/μU/ml, P = 0.019) above that of surgery. Exercise also improved S(G) (ITT: CON vs. EX; +0.0023 vs. +0.0063 min⁻¹, P = 0.009) compared with the CON group. Exercise improved cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) compared with the CON group. CONCLUSION Moderate exercise following RYGB surgery provides additional improvements in S(I), S(G), and cardiorespiratory fitness compared with a sedentary lifestyle during similar weight loss.

This includes younger, often nulliparous, women; however, uptake has been relatively low in this group. METHODS In February 2017 we conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies to identify barriers to IUC use in nulliparous women. RESULTS Study quality was poor. No differences in rates of infection or expulsions between nulliparous and parous were seen. Fertility rates following removal appeared no different from the general population. Higher rates insertion difficulty, insertion failure and pain during insertion were observed in nulliparous women. CONCLUSION A long-acting reversible contraceptive method such as IUC reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy since user failure is minimised. Evidence-based information about the advantages and disadvantages of IUC is required to inform decision-making and dispel any myths and misperceptions. Potential barriers to IUC use in nulliparous women, particularly concerns around infection, significantly higher rates of device expulsion and adverse effects on fertility, do not appear to be justified. IUC is appropriate for all medically-eligible women, including nulliparous women, and should be included in the range of contraceptive options discussed during counselling.","Foran, Therese; Butcher, Belinda E; Kovacs, Gab; Bateson, Deborah; O'Connor, Vivienne",The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,2,33

We hypothesized that the different biomaterials used to construct commonly used prosthetic mesh may influence permeability to fluid and affect seroma formation rates. METHODS We designed an in vitro study where a 5 cm piece of mesh was placed in a closed system where normal saline was forced across the mesh and the pressure (mmHg) required for a constant stream of fluid was recorded. Eight prosthetic materials were studied: polyester/oxidized collagen (PC), expanded PTFE (DM), polypropylene/ePTFE (BC), polypropylene/oxidized cellulose (PR), light weight polypropylene/omega 3 fatty acid (CQ), compressed PTFE (MM), polypropylene (PP) and polyester (P) mesh. RESULTS Each mesh was tested five times and the results averaged. The 3 meshes without anti-adhesive barriers (MM, PP, P) had fluid move across with minimal pressure (<1 mmHg). For the intraperitoneal mesh, there was a significant difference in pressure necessary for fluid movement (PR = 3.6, CQ = 36, PC = 56.6, DM > 350, BC > 350 mmHg, p = <0.001). However, the fenestrations at the suture lines necessary to combine the PP and DM in the BC mesh permitted fluid transport at low pressures (<1 mmHg). CONCLUSION Based on our in vitro study, each mesh exhibited different fluid permeability, especially in the case of meshes with anti-adhesive barriers. This study also infers that methods to create pressure gradients across mesh, such as an abdominal binder, may reduce seroma formation of certain meshes.","Jin, Judy; Schomisch, Steve; Rosen, Michael J",Surgical innovation,2,1

RECENT FINDINGS Rhinovirus infection is now recognized as an important cause of acute exacerbations of asthma in school-aged children. Along with other respiratory viruses, rhinovirus infection is also a cause of exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence that rhinovirus can infect the lower airways and may be associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia in immunocompetent children and with lower respiratory tract disease in the immunocompromised host. SUMMARY The use of nucleic acid hybridization-based assays has expanded our understanding of the spectrum of clinical illness that is associated with rhinovirus infection. The prevalence of rhinovirus infection in children is high and presents a risk for coincidental detection of rhinovirus in the face of other infectious syndromes. The detection of rhinovirus from patients with new or unusual clinical syndromes does not permit the assumption that rhinovirus is playing a causal role in the illness.","Brownlee, Joshua W; Turner, Ronald B",Current opinion in pediatrics,2,1

However, complications do occur, and may be very severe, such as intravascular injection (with occasional residual tissue loss, visual and neurological sequelae) and late nodularity and swelling. Methods to lessen the likelihood of complications have been the subject of much recent literature. Depth of injection has been identified as a key safety consideration. METHODS The role of injection of facial filler into the muscular layer of the face is explored in this article. Literature was explored using available search facilities to study the role of injections in or around this layer in the production of significant adverse reactions. RESULTS A body of literature seems to suggest that injection into mimetic musculature of the face especially the musculature in the periorbital and perioral regions is prone to adverse reactions. DISCUSSION Injection of agents into the perioral and periorbital mimetic muscular layer may produce, product clumping, displacement, tendency to late nodularity and swelling. It also risks intravascular injection as compared to injection of other layers of the face. CONCLUSIONS Injection into the mimetic muscles especially the sphincteric muscles should be avoided to minimize the risk of complications.","Goodman, Greg J; Al-Niaimi, Firas; McDonald, Cara; Ciconte, Antoinette; Porter, Catherine",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,2,1

The present study aimed to report our experience with LigaSure and the advantages of using this device during transaxillary submuscular pocket dissection over those of a monopolar electrocautery dissector in patients undergoing breast augmentation. Methods A total of 156 patients who underwent transaxillary breast augmentation between November 2019 and May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Submuscular pocket dissection using LigaSure was performed in 92 patients and a conventional technique using a monopolar electrocautery dissector was performed in the remaining 64 patients. A bloodless breast pocket was defined as a clear operating field with little or no blood staining at any stage of the procedure. All endoscopic procedures were recorded to determine whether bloodless pockets had been established. The amount of postoperative drainage at 1 day after surgery was also assessed to compare between the LigaSure and conventional groups. Results Bloodless breast pockets were successfully established in 83 patients (90.2%) in the LigaSure group and in 38 patients (59.4%) in the conventional group (P < 0.001). Postoperative drainage amount at 1 day following surgery was significantly lower in the LigaSure group than in the conventional group (P < 0.001). Conclusion Our findings indicate that the LigaSure system is a safe and effective alternative in breast augmentation requiring transaxillary submuscular dissection.,"Kim, Min Kuk; Lee, Sangdal",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

METHODS Between May 2012 and May 2013, 41 patients with PTH and hypersplenism undergoing LSPD were retrospectively analyzed. Of them, 29 patients received LSPD by LigaSure Vessel Sealing System (LVSS) and Endo-GIA universal endoscopic vascular linear staplers (Endo-GIA) (EG Group) and 12 patients received LSPD by LVSS and Hem-o-Lock (HL Group). Operating time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative course, and hospitalization costs were compared between the two LSPD combination techniques. RESULTS There were no significant differences in preoperative patient characteristics of the two groups. Significantly less operating time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications were observed in EG Group. The incidence of portal vein thrombosis was lower in the EG Group (3.4 vs. 8.3%), as well as the incidence of pancreatic fistula (0 vs. 8.3%). Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was not observed in either group. Uncontrolled bleeding warranted conversion to open surgery in one case in EG Group (conversion rate 3.4%) and in two cases in HL Group (conversion rate 16.7%). Two patients (16.7%) in HL Group underwent successful emergency exploratory laparotomy due to uncontrolled intraabdominal bleeding postoperatively. No re-operation was needed in EG Group. Two patients experienced liver failure after surgery in each group. Of those, three patients were managed successfully and one patient refused further therapy. While the overall complication rate was significantly lower in EG Group (17.2 vs. 58.3%, P < 0.05), overall hospitalization costs remained significantly higher for EG Group. CONCLUSION The results suggest that the modified Endo-GIA and LVSS technique is a safe and effective combination approach to LSPD with shorter operative time, less intraoperative blood loss, lower conversion rate to laparotomy, shorter hospital stay, better recovery, and lower postoperative complication rate compared with the Hem-o-Lock and LVSS approach. Higher hospitalization expenses associated with the Endo-GIA and LVSS approach.","Hong, Defei; Cheng, Jian; Wang, Zhifei; Shen, Guoliang; Xie, Zhijie; Wu, Weiding; Zhang, Yuhua; Zhang, Yuanbiao; Liu, Xiaolong",Surgical endoscopy,2,17

Nonpharmacologic techniques (sucrose taste, pacifier suckling, breastfeeding) are effective and now widely used to combat minor neonatal pain. This study examined the analgesic effect of sucrose combined with radiant warmth compared with the taste of sucrose alone during a painful procedure in healthy full-term newborns. METHODS A randomized, controlled trial included 29 healthy, full-term newborns born at the University of Chicago Hospital. Both groups of infants were given 1.0 mL of 25% sucrose solution 2 minutes before the vaccination, and 1 group additionally was given radiant warmth from an infant warmer before the vaccination. We assessed pain by comparing differences in cry, grimace, heart rate variability (ie, respiratory sinus arrhythmia), and heart rate between the groups. RESULTS The sucrose plus warmer group cried and grimaced for 50% less time after the vaccination than the sucrose alone group (P < .05, respectively). The sucrose plus warmer group had lower heart rate and heart rate variability (ie, respiratory sinus arrhythmia) responses compared with the sucrose alone group (P < .01), reflecting a greater ability to physiologically regulate in response to the painful vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The combination of sucrose and radiant warmth is an effective analgesic in newborns and reduces pain better than sucrose alone. The ready availability of this practical nonpharmacologic technique has the potential to reduce the burden of newborn pain.","Gray, Larry; Garza, Elizabeth; Zageris, Danielle; Heilman, Keri J; Porges, Stephen W",Pediatrics,2,17

However, the neurobiological mechanisms of anhedonia are poorly understood as few studies have disentangled the specific effects of anhedonia from other co-occurring symptoms. Here, we take a transdiagnostic, dimensional approach to distinguish anhedonia alterations from other internalizing symptoms on intrinsic functional brain circuits. 53 adults with varying degrees of anxiety and/or depression completed resting-state fMRI. Neural networks were identified through independent components analysis. Dual regression was used to characterize within-network functional connectivity alterations associated with individual differences in anhedonia. Modulation of between-network functional connectivity by anhedonia was tested using region-of-interest to region-of-interest correlational analyses. Anhedonia was associated with visual network hyperconnectivity and expansion of the visual, dorsal attention, and default networks. Additionally, anhedonia was associated with decreased between-network connectivity among default, salience, dorsal attention, somatomotor, and visual networks. Findings suggest that anhedonia is associated with aberrant connectivity and structural alterations in resting-state networks that contribute to impairments in reward learning, low motivation, and negativity bias characteristic of depression. Results reveal dissociable effects of anhedonia on resting-state network dynamics, characterizing possible neurocircuit mechanisms for intervention.","Geller, Whitney N; Liu, Kevin; Warren, Stacie L",Psychiatry research.

The continuous improvements of implant design have resulted in an optimized mechanical function that supports tissue healing and restoration of function. One of the still unsolved problems with using implants and materials is infection. Trauma and material implantation change the local inflammatory situation and enable bacterial survival and material colonization. The main pathogen in orthopedic infections is Staphylococcus aureus. The research efforts to optimize antimicrobial surfaces and to develop new anti-infective strategies are enormous. This mini-review focuses on the publications from 2021 with the keywords S. aureus AND (surface modification OR drug delivery) AND (orthopedics OR trauma) AND (implants OR nails OR devices). The PubMed search yielded 16 original publications and two reviews.

The optimal duration of DAPT after PCI remains controversial at present. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy and safety of short-term DAPT in patients undergoing PCI. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of science from inception to September 2019 were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials were included to compare short term (3 months or less) with a standard 12-months DAPT in patients undergoing PCI. Random effect model and fixed effect model wereused to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each endpoint. This meta-analysis included 38479 patients undergoing PCI from 8 randomized clinical trials. No difference was observed in the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80-1.06, P = 0.25), cardiovascular death (RR 0.88, 0.69-1.12, P = 0.29), myocardial infarction (RR 1.05, 0.94-1.19, P = 0.38), definite or probable stent thrombosis (RR 1.05, 0.80-1.36, P = 0.73), and stroke (RR 1.02, 0.80-1.30, P = 0.89) between short term and standard DAPT. The short-term DAPT could reduce the risk of major bleeding (RR 0.67, 0.48-0.94, P = 0.02) and any bleeding (RR 0.63, 0.48-0.82, P = 0.0005) compared with 12 months of DAPT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven consecutive patients with 21 GIST liver metastases received RF ablation under computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic guidance. Liver metastases were solitary in two patients and multiple in five patients, with a mean maximum tumor diameter of 2.2 cm±1.1 (range, 1.2-4.2 cm). In addition to feasibility and safety, local tumor progression and overall and GIST-related survival associated with RF ablation were assessed. RESULTS All liver metastases were treated in 12 RF sessions, after which contrast-enhanced CT showed disappearance of tumor enhancement. No RF procedure-related complications occurred. Local tumor progression developed in one tumor (4.8%) during the mean follow-up period of 30.6 months±27.5 (range, 5.9-76.4 mo). New liver metastasis in untreated liver and lung metastasis developed in one patient each. One patient died of subarachnoid hemorrhage 5.9 months after RF ablation, but no GIST-related deaths occurred. The respective overall and GIST-related survival rates were 85.7% (95% confidence interval, 33.6%-97.8%) and 100% at 1, 3, and 5 years.

RT-PCR data is traditionally analyzed by estimating the threshold cycle (CT) at which the fluorescence signal produced by emission of a probe crosses a baseline level. Current models used to estimate the CT value are based on approximations that do not adequately account for the stochastic variation of the fluorescence signal that is detected during RT-PCR. Less common deviations become more apparent as the sample size increases, as is the case in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this work we employ a method independent of CT value to interpret to RT-PCR data. In this novel approach we built and trained a deep learning model, qPCRdeepNet, to analyze the fluorescent readings obtained during RT-PCR. We describe how this model can be deployed as a quality assurance tool to monitor results interpretation in real-time. The model's performance with the TaqPath COVID19 Combo Kit, widely used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, is described. This model can be applied broadly for the primary interpretation of RT-PCR assays and potentially replace the CT interpretive paradigm.","Alouani, David J; Rajapaksha, Roshani R P; Jani, Mehul; Rhoads, Daniel D; Sadri, Navid",Journal of clinical microbiology,2,27

Since this disease is highly contagious and 33% of cases are asymptomatic, it is crucial to develop methods to predict its course. We developed a predictive model for Covid-19 infection in Spanish provinces. METHODS We applied main components analysis to epidemiological data for Spanish provinces obtained from the National Centre of Epidemiology, based on the epidemiological curve between 24 February and 8 June 2020. Using this method, we classified provinces according to their epidemiological progress (worst, intermediate, and good). RESULTS We identified 2 components that explained 99% of variability in the 52 epidemiological curves. The first component can be interpreted as the crude incidence rate trend and the second component as the speed of increase or decrease in the incidence rate during the period analysed. We identified 10 provinces in the group with the worst progress and 17 in the intermediate group. The threshold values for the 7-day incidence rate for an alert 1 (intermediate) were 134 cases/100,000 inhabitants, and 167 for alert 2 (high), respectively, showing a high discriminative power between provinces. CONCLUSIONS These alert levels might be useful for deciding which measures may affect population mobility and other public health decisions when considering community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a given geographical area. This information would also facilitate intercomparison between healthcare areas and Autonomous Communities.","Santiago Pérez, María Isolina; López-Vizcaíno, Esther; Ruano-Ravina, Alberto; Pérez-Ríos, Mónica",Archivos de bronconeumologia,2,17

A patient with rectal cancer was selected according to preoperative evaluation criteria. Purse-string sutures were placed into the rectum distal to the tumor using the procedure of prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH) anoscope. A full-thickness incision of the rectal wall was made circumferentially below the purse string and a three-channel cannula was inserted. The artificial orifice was insufflated. The entire mesorectum was dissected upward according to the principles of TME. Pneumoperitoneum was created by opening the rectouterine pouch. The sigmoid colon and its mesentery were dissected, and the inferior mesenteric vessels were ligated and divided. After dissection of a sufficient length of sigmoid colon, the PPH anoscope and the three-channel cannula were removed. The rectum and sigmoid colon were brought out through the anus. The tumor was resected. After removal of the specimens, a stapled end-to-end anastomosis was fashioned between the rectum and the sigmoid colon. Operative time was 300 min. The mesorectum was completely removed with negative distal and circumferential margin. The final pathological stage was pT3N1M0, with one positive lymph node (1/12). The patient recovered uneventfully after surgery. Pure-NOTES performed as transanal single-port laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer appears to be feasible and safe.","Zhang, H; Zhang, Y-S; Jin, X-W; Li, M-Z; Fan, J-S; Yang, Z-H",Techniques in coloproctology,2,5

The computed tomographic angiography (CTA) spot sign is a promising predictor of expansion; however, frequency and predictive values are variable across studies, possibly because of differences in onset-to-CTA time. We performed a patient-level meta-analysis to define the relationship between onset-to-CTA time and frequency and predictive ability of the spot sign. METHODS We completed a systematic review for studies of CTA spot sign and hematoma expansion. We subsequently pooled patient-level data on the frequency and predictive values for significant hematoma expansion according to 5 predefined categorized onset-to-CTA times. We calculated spot-sign frequency both as raw and frequency-adjusted rates. RESULTS Among 2051 studies identified, 12 met our inclusion criteria. Baseline hematoma volume, spot-sign status, and time-to-CTA were available for 1176 patients, and 1039 patients had follow-up computed tomographies for hematoma expansion analysis. The overall spot sign frequency was 26%, decreasing from 39% within 2 hours of onset to 13% beyond 8 hours (P<0.001). There was a significant decrease in hematoma expansion in spot-positive patients as onset-to-CTA time increased (P=0.004), with positive predictive values decreasing from 53% to 33%. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of the CTA spot sign is inversely related to intracerebral hemorrhage onset-to-CTA time. Furthermore, the positive predictive value of the spot sign for significant hematoma expansion decreases as time-to-CTA increases. Our results offer more precise risk stratification for patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage and will help refine clinical prediction rules for intracerebral hemorrhage expansion.","Dowlatshahi, Dar; Brouwers, H Bart; Demchuk, Andrew M; Hill, Michael D; Aviv, Richard I; Ufholz, Lee-Anne; Reaume, Michael; Wintermark, Max; Hemphill, J Claude; Murai, Yasuo; Wang, Yongjun; Zhao, Xingquan; Wang, Yilong; Li, Na; Sorimachi, Takatoshi; Matsumae, Mitsunori; Steiner, Thorsten; Rizos, Timolaos; Greenberg, Steven M; Romero, Javier M; Rosand, Jonathan; Goldstein, Joshua N; Sharma, Mukul",Stroke,2,17

METHODS This was a retrospective multicenter study of all pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosed with ARDS between February 15, and May 1, 2020 in nine level III maternity centers in Iran (ARDS group). The control COVID-19 pregnant women were selected from 3 of 9 level III maternity centers between March 15 and April 20, 2020. Univariate statistics were used to look at differences between groups. Cluster dendrograms were used to look at the correlations between clinical and laboratory findings in the groups. A value of p <.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Fifteen COVID-19 infected women with ARDS were compared to 29 COVID-19 positive and ARDS negative control (moderate: (n = 26) 89.7% and severe: (n = 3)10.3%). The mean maternal age (35.6 vs. 29.4 years; p = .002) and diagnosis of chronic hypertension (20.0% vs. 0%, p = .034) were significantly higher in the ARDS group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in their presenting symptoms. The ARDS group had a significantly higher prevalence of tachypnea (66.6% vs. 10.3%, p = .042) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) <93% (66.6% vs. 10.3%, p = .004) at presentation. Relative lymphopenia (lymphocyte ratio < 10.5%, 66.6% vs. 17.2%, p = .002), lymphocytes to leukocytes ratio (11.3% vs. 17.7%, p = .010), and neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) >7.5 were significantly different between the two groups (all p < .05). CONCLUSION Our data demonstrate that symptom-based strategies for identifying the critically ill pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 are insufficient; however, vital signs and laboratory data might be helpful to predict ARDS in critically ill COVID-19 pregnant patients.","Kazemi Aski, Soudabeh; Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein; Shamshirsaz, Amir A; Mostafaei, Shayan; Aleyasin, Ashraf; Nabavian, Seyedeh Maedeh; Alimohammadi, Shohreh; Ahangari, Roghaye; Ariana, Shideh; Ghotbizadeh, Fahimeh; Tara, Fatemeh; Pooransari, Parichehr; Gharib Laki, Mahboobeh; Zarean, Elaheh; Soleimani, Zahra; Saliminia, Alireza; Havaei, Arash; Akbari, Razieh; Ramezani, Masoud; Soleimani, Azam; Naemi, Mahsa; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A; Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2,1

METHODS Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging lesion volumes were determined with the RAPID software program. HIR was defined as the proportion of TMax >6 s lesion volume with a Tmax >10 s delay and was dichotomized based on its median value (0.4) into low versus high subgroups as well as quartiles. Final infarct volumes were assessed at day 5. Initial infarct growth velocity was calculated as the baseline diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume divided by the delay from symptom onset to baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Total Infarct growth was determined by the difference between final infarct and baseline DWI volumes. Collateral flow was assessed on conventional angiography and dichotomized into good and poor flow. Good functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale ≤2 at 90 days. RESULTS Ninety-nine patients were included; baseline DWI, perfusion-weighted imaging, and final infarct volumes increased with HIR quartiles (P<0.01). A high HIR predicted poor collaterals with an area under the curve of 0.73. Initial infarct growth velocity and total infarct growth were greater among patients with a high HIR (P<0.001). After adjustment for age, DWI volume, and reperfusion, a low HIR was associated with good functional outcome: odds ratio=4.4 (95% CI, 1.3-14.3); P=0.014. CONCLUSIONS HIR can be easily assessed on automatically processed perfusion maps and predicts the rate of collateral flow, infarct growth, and clinical outcome.","Olivot, Jean Marc; Mlynash, Michael; Inoue, Manabu; Marks, Michael P; Wheeler, Hayley M; Kemp, Stephanie; Straka, Matus; Zaharchuk, Gregory; Bammer, Roland; Lansberg, Maarten G; Albers, Gregory W",Stroke,2,20

METHODS We analyzed data from practices enrolled in RISE between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017. Eight quality measures in the areas of RA disease management, cardiovascular risk reduction, and patient safety were examined. Variability in performance was evaluated at the practice level. Multivariate linear models were used to predict change in measure performance by year and determine the effect of practice characteristics on change in performance over time. RESULTS Data from 59,986 patients from 54 practices was examined. Mean age was 62±14 years, 77% were female, 69% were Caucasian, and most patients were seen in a single-specialty group practice (46%). Average performance on measures related to RA treatments was consistently high (>90%) across the study period. Measures related to RA functional status and disease activity assessment had the greatest improvements over time (8.4% and 13.0% increase per year, respectively; p<0.001). Single-specialty group practices had the fastest rates of improvement over time across all measures. CONCLUSIONS Among practices participating in RISE between 2015 to 2017, performance on most RA quality measures improved. Single specialty group practices saw the fastest rates of improvement over time. Identification of workflow patterns leading to dramatic improvements in quality of care will help guide process redesign to address gaps in priority areas, such as TB screening and blood pressure control.","Izadi, Zara; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Gianfrancesco, Milena; Subash, Meera; Evans, Michael; Trupin, Laura; Yazdany, Jinoos",Arthritis care & research,2,1

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the prospectively collected database of patients with clinical stage I lung cancer who underwent cVATS lobectomy using the 3D endoscopic system; the patients who underwent surgery using the 2D endoscopic system were considered the historical control group. The operative and perioperative data were compared, and propensity-score matched comparisons were used to assess the potential impact of selection bias. RESULTS We performed 189 cVATS lobectomies. Of these, 105 were performed using the 3D endoscopic system, while 84 were performed using the 2D endoscopic system. After matching, there was no significant difference in the preoperative factors between the two groups. The operation time was significantly shortened (P = 0.003), and the intraoperative blood loss was significantly reduced in the 3D group (P < 0.001). In particular, there was only one case of intraoperative hemorrhage of 201 mL or more in the 3D group, compared to 12 cases in the 2D group (P < 0.001). After matching, the intraoperative blood loss and operation time were significantly reduced in the 3D group. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that the 3D endoscopic system for cVATS lobectomy may be a useful surgical tool and switching to it from the 2D endoscopic system can be performed safely.","Mimura, Takeshi; Yamashita, Yoshinori; Hirai, Yuya; Nishina, Mai; Kagimoto, Atsushi; Miyamoto, Tatsuya; Nakashima, Chika; Harada, Hiroaki",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2,1

OBJECTIVES The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the OS-MRS in predicting postoperative complications after LRYGB. Secondarily, the postoperative complication rate between primary and revisional LRYGB was systematically analyzed. SETTING The Obesity Center Amsterdam, located in a large teaching hospital, in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. METHODS The OS-MRS was applied to a consecutive database of patients who underwent LRYGB from November 2007 onwards. Postoperative complications were scored according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Revisional LRYGB was separately analyzed. RESULTS LRYGB was performed in 1667 patients either as a primary (81.5%) or revisional (18.5%) procedure. The majority (n = 1371, 82.2%) were female, mean age 44.6 (standard deviation 14.4) years and mean body mass index 44.2 (6.5) kg/m2. Nine hundred and four (54.2%) were OS-MRS class A, 642 class B (38.5%), and 121 (7.3%) class C. Complications occurred in 143 (10.5%) and 44 (14.2%) patients after primary and revisional surgery, respectively. In both primary and revisional LRYGB, there was no association between complications and the OS-MRS classification. Subanalysis comparing primary with revisional LRYGB found a significant association between revisional surgery and the development of severe complications (Clavien-Dindo≥3) (P = .003) and mortality (P = .017). CONCLUSION The OS-MRS was not an accurate predictor for postoperative complications in patients who underwent primary or revisional LRYGB. As in other studies, revisional surgery is an independent risk factor for the development of severe complications.","Coblijn, Usha K; Lagarde, Sjoerd M; de Raaff, Christel A L; de Castro, Steve M; van Tets, Willem F; Jaap Bonjer, H; van Wagensveld, Bart A",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,2,20

Because portable and home-care ventilators use turbines, blowers, pistons, or compressors to inhale in ambient air, they may have higher gas temperature than ventilators with piping systems. We carried out a bench study to investigate the temperature of gas delivered from portable and home-care ventilators, including the effects of distance from ventilator outlet, fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FIO2), and minute volume (MV). METHODS We evaluated five ventilators equipped with turbine, blower, piston, or compressor system. Ambient air temperature was adjusted to 24°C ± 0.5°C, and ventilation was set at FIO2 0.21, 0.6, and 1.0, at MV 5 and 10 L/min. We analyzed gas temperature at 0, 40, 80, and 120 cm from ventilator outlet and altered ventilator settings. RESULTS While temperature varied according to ventilators, the outlet gas temperature of ventilators became stable after, at the most, 5 h. Gas temperature was 34.3°C ± 3.9°C at the ventilator outlet, 29.5°C ± 2.2°C after 40 cm, 25.4°C ± 1.2°C after 80 cm and 25.1°C ± 1.2°C after 120 cm (P < 0.01). FIO2 and MV did not affect gas temperature. CONCLUSION Gas delivered from portable and home-care ventilator was not too hot to induce heated humidifier malfunctioning. Gas soon declined when passing through the limb.","Chikata, Yusuke; Onodera, Mutsuo; Imanaka, Hideaki; Nishimura, Masaji",Journal of intensive care,2,1

Traditionally, the training of these techniques is on patients, though manikins, simulators and cadavers are also used, with their respective limitations. In this study, we investigated whether the novel 'Fix for Life' (F4L) cadaver model is a suitable and realistic model for the teaching of these two intubation techniques to novices in airway management. METHODS Forty consultant anaesthetists and senior trainees were instructed to perform tracheal intubation with videolaryngoscopy and fibreoptic tracheoscopy in four F4L cadaver models. The primary outcome measure was the verbal rating scores (scale 1-10, higher scores indicate a better rating) for suitability and for realism of the F4L cadavers as training model for these techniques. Secondary outcomes included success rates of the procedures and the time to successful completion of the procedures. RESULTS The mean verbal rating scores for suitability and realism for videolaryngoscopy was 8.3 (95% CI, 7.9-8.6) and 7.2 (95% CI, 6.7-7.6), respectively. For fibreoptic tracheoscopy, suitability was 8.2 (95% CI, 7.9-8.5) and realism 7.5 (95% CI, 7.1-7.8). In videolaryngoscopy, 100% of the procedures were successful. The mean (SD) time until successful tracheal intubation was 34.8 (30.9) s. For fibreoptic tracheoscopy, the success rate was 96.3%, with a mean time of 89.4 (80.1) s. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the F4L cadaver model is a suitable and realistic model to train and teach tracheal intubation with videolaryngoscopy and fibreoptic tracheoscopy to novices in airway management training.","van Emden, Michael W; Geurts, Jeroen J G; Schober, Patrick; Schwarte, Lothar A",BMC anesthesiology,2,1

Objective To study skeletal muscle and myocardial inflammation in patients with COVID-19 who had died. Design, Setting, and Participants This case-control autopsy series was conducted in a university hospital as a multidisciplinary postmortem investigation. Patients with COVID-19 or other critical illnesses who had died between March 2020 and February 2021 and on whom an autopsy was performed were included. Individuals for whom informed consent to autopsy was available and the postmortem interval was less than 6 days were randomly selected. Individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 per polymerase chain reaction test results and had clinical features suggestive of COVID-19 were compared with individuals with negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test results and an absence of clinical features suggestive of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures Inflammation of skeletal muscle tissue was assessed by quantification of immune cell infiltrates, expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II antigens on the sarcolemma, and a blinded evaluation on a visual analog scale ranging from absence of pathology to the most pronounced pathology. Inflammation of cardiac muscles was assessed by quantification of immune cell infiltrates. Results Forty-three patients with COVID-19 (median [interquartile range] age, 72 [16] years; 31 men [72%]) and 11 patients with diseases other than COVID-19 (median [interquartile range] age, 71 [5] years; 7 men [64%]) were included. Skeletal muscle samples from the patients who died with COVID-19 showed a higher overall pathology score (mean [SD], 3.4 [1.8] vs 1.5 [1.0]; 95% CI, 0-3; P < .001) and a higher inflammation score (mean [SD], 3.5 [2.1] vs 1.0 [0.6]; 95% CI, 0-4; P < .001). Relevant expression of MHC class I antigens on the sarcolemma was present in 23 of 42 specimens from patients with COVID-19 (55%) and upregulation of MHC class II antigens in 7 of 42 specimens from patients with COVID-19 (17%), but neither were found in any of the controls. Increased numbers of natural killer cells (median [interquartile range], 8 [8] vs 3 [4] cells per 10 high-power fields; 95% CI, 1-10 cells per 10 high-power fields; P < .001) were found. Skeletal muscles showed more inflammatory features than cardiac muscles, and inflammation was most pronounced in patients with COVID-19 with chronic courses. In some muscle specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but no evidence for a direct viral infection of myofibers was found by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Conclusions and Relevance In this case-control study of patients who had died with and without COVID-19, most individuals with severe COVID-19 showed signs of myositis ranging from mild to severe. Inflammation of skeletal muscles was associated with the duration of illness and was more pronounced than cardiac inflammation. Detection of viral load was low or negative in most skeletal and cardiac muscles and probably attributable to circulating viral RNA rather than genuine infection of myocytes. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with a postinfectious, immune-mediated myopathy.","Aschman, Tom; Schneider, Julia; Greuel, Selina; Meinhardt, Jenny; Streit, Simon; Goebel, Hans-Hilmar; Büttnerova, Ivana; Elezkurtaj, Sefer; Scheibe, Franziska; Radke, Josefine; Meisel, Christian; Drosten, Christian; Radbruch, Helena; Heppner, Frank L; Corman, Victor Max; Stenzel, Werner",JAMA neurology,2,19

However, little information on the role of GRXs in the regulation of fruit ripening and the response to stress is available. In this study, we isolated 64 GRX genes from banana genome. Their encoded GRX proteins could be classified into four classes: CC, CGFS, CPYC and GRL types. The distribution and synteny of these GRXs on chromosomes, the gene structures, the promoter sequences, and the possible protein subcellular localizations were characterized. Molecular interaction network analysis suggested that MaGRX might interact with glutathione reductase (GR), sulfiredoxin, peroxiredoxin (Prx), and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC), contributing to the antioxidative defense of banana fruit. MicroRNA prediction showed that MaGRX genes might be targeted by different miRNAs. Transcriptome analysis characterized the expression profiles of different MaGRX genes during banana fruit ripening, and in response to different storage stresses. The results suggested that CC-type, CPYC-type and GRL-type MaGRXs might be more active than CGFS-type MaGRXs during banana fruit ripening and the response to stress. Moreover, MaGRX6/7/9/11/17/23/28 and MaGRL3/16/19 might play important roles in regulating fruit ripening or in response to low and high temperature, or Fusarium proliferatum infection.","Li, Taotao; Li, Mingzhi; Jiang, Yueming; Duan, Xuewu",International journal of biological macromolecules,2,1

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted the commercial airline industry. To understand potential pandemic-related disruptions in the transportation network of kidneys across the United States, we used national flight data to compare scheduled flights during the pandemic versus 1-year earlier, focusing on OPO pairs between which kidneys historically most likely traveled by direct flight (High-Volume by direct Air transport OPO Pairs, HVA-OPs). Across the US, there were 39% fewer flights in April 2020 versus April 2019. Specific to the kidney transportation network, there were 65.1% fewer flights between HVA-OPs, with considerable OPO-level variation (IQR 54.7%-75.3%, range 0%-100%). This translated to a drop in median number of flights between HVA-OPs from 112 flights/week in April 2019 to 34 in April 2020 (p<0.001), and a rise in wait time between scheduled flights from 1.5 hours in April 2019 (IQR 0.76-3.3) to 4.9 hours in April 2020 (IQR 2.6-11.2) (p<0.001). Fewer flights and longer wait times can impact logistics as well as cold ischemia time; our findings motivate an exploration of creative approaches to KT transport as the impact of this pandemic on the airline industry evolves.","Strauss, Alexandra T; Cartier, David; Gunning, Bruce A; Boyarsky, Brian J; Snyder, Jon; Segev, Dorry L; Roush, Michael; Massie, Allan B",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2,17

STUDY DESIGN Clinical case report. ANIMAL Client-owned cat. METHODS An 11-year-old castrated male domestic shorthair cat was examined for generalized weakness, voice change, hypersalivation, hyporexia, vomiting, coughing, and gagging. Thoracic ultrasound revealed a cranial mediastinal mass for which cytology was consistent with a thymoma (or lymphoid tissue). Acetylcholine receptor antibody concentration was elevated at 3.16 mmol/L (reference interval < 0.3 mmol/L). Thoracic computed tomography showed two round, contrast-enhancing structures in the cranioventral mediastinum identified as the sternal lymph node and a cranial mediastinal mass (11 × 17 × 24 mm). A presumptive diagnosis of thymoma with paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis was made and surgical resection of both mediastinal masses was recommended. RESULTS Video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of the cranial mediastinal mass and sternal lymph node were performed with low-pressure carbon dioxide insufflation maintained at an intrathoracic pressure of 2-3 mmHg. The cat recovered from surgery without serious complications. Nineteen months after surgery, the cat developed hind limb stiffness. Thoracic radiographs ruled out a cranial mediastinal mass or megaesophagus. Acetylcholine receptor antibody concentration remained elevated at 2.72 mmol/L.

Existing systems are not able to measure sperm count and both motility and morphology of individual live sperm. Morphology measurement requires invasive staining, making the sperm after morphology measurement not applicable to infertility treatment. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the reproducibility and reliability of automated measurement of individual live sperm's motility and morphology. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fresh semen samples were obtained from twenty male partners attending for fertility investigations. The system firstly measured motility for all the sperm within the field of view under a low magnification (20×), then a sperm of interest is selected by the user and automatically relocated by the system after switching to a high magnification (100×) for morphology measurement. Reproducibility of sperm measurements was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficients on consecutive measurement. Reliability of motility and morphology measurement was evaluated by tracking error rate and limits of agreement, respectively, with manual measurement as benchmark. RESULTS Measurement of all motility and morphology parameters had intraclass correlation coefficients higher than 0.94. Sperm motility measurement had a tracking error rate of 2.1%. Limit of agreement analysis indicated that automated measurement and manual measurement of sperm morphology were interchangeable. Automated measurement of all morphology parameters was not statistically different from manual measurement, as confirmed by the paired sample t-test. DISCUSSION Automated motility and morphology measurement of single sperm revealed high reproducibility and reliability. The system also achieved a high efficiency for motility and morphology measurement. In addition to the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) samples with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), the developed sperm measurement technique is also effective for analyzing semen and washed samples. The system provides a valuable tool for quantitative measurement and selection of single sperm for ICSI. It can also be used for sperm motility and morphology analysis in andrology labs.","Dai, Changsheng; Zhang, Zhuoran; Jahangiri, Sahar; Shan, Guanqiao; Moskovstev, Sergey; Librach, Clifford; Jarvi, Keith; Sun, Yu",Andrology,2,1

We aimed to reveal the general health status of the pediatric asthmatic patients during the pandemic, considering the role of household factors in parental attitudes. METHODS We asked 60 asthmatic patients and their parents to respond to a questionnaire, aiming to reveal the current health status of the patients and the general approach of the family to the asthma management during the pandemic. RESULTS A total of 8 patients had had an asthma attack during the outbreak, but there was no confirmed correlation with COVID-19 infection. Most of the parents had never considered to stop their children's current medications. However, the majority of them reported concerns about failure of the ambulatory care services and almost all saw their children as being at high risk for COVID-19 infection. There was no significant relationship between these concerns and their psychological statuses (p>0.05).

The aim of this study was to describe OHCA in the Cape Town metropole, South Africa. DESIGN Observational study with a retrospective descriptive design. SETTING Cape Town metropole, Western Cape province, South Africa. PARTICIPANTS All patients with OHCA for the period 1 January 2018-31 December 2018 were extracted from public and private emergency medical services (EMS) and described. OUTCOME MEASURES Description of patients with OHCA in terms of demographics, treatment and short-term outcome. RESULTS A total of 929 patients with OHCA received an EMS response in the Cape Town metropole, corresponding to an annual prevalence of 23.2 per 100 000 persons. Most patients were adult (n=885; 96.5%) and male (n=526; 56.6%) with a median (IQR) age of 63 (26) years. The majority of cardiac arrests occurred in private residences (n=740; 79.7%) and presented with asystole (n=322; 34.6%). EMS resuscitation was only attempted in 7.4% (n=69) of cases and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) occurred in 1.3% (n=13) of cases. Almost all patients (n=909; 97.8%) were declared dead on the scene. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this was the largest study investigating OHCA ever undertaken in Africa. We found that while the incidence of OHCA in Cape Town was similar to the literature, resuscitation is attempted in very few patients and ROSC-rates are negligible. This may be as a consequence of protracted response times, poor patient prognosis or an underdeveloped and under-resourced Chain of Survival in low- to middle-income countries, like South Africa. The development of contextual guidelines given resources and disease burden is essential.","Stassen, Willem; Wylie, Craig; Djärv, Therese; Wallis, Lee A",BMJ open,2,1

We conducted a randomized phase II trial (the TOP-G trial) comparing omentectomy and omentum preservation for gastric cancer. This report describes the short-term findings regarding the trial's secondary endpoints. METHODS The trial protocol was submitted to the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry ( http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ : UMIN000005421). The key eligibility criteria were histologically confirmed cT2-4a and N0-2 gastric adenocarcinoma. Short-term surgical outcomes, including morbidity and mortality, were compared between the omentectomy group (group A, control arm) and the omentum-preserving surgery group (group B, test arm). All procedures were performed via an open approach. Based on a non-inferiority margin of 7%, statistical power of 0.7, and type I error of 0.2, the sample size was set to 250 patients. RESULTS A total of 251 patients were eligible and randomized (group A: 125 patients, group B: 126 patients) between April 2011 and October 2018. After excluding patients who had peritoneal metastasis or laparotomy history, safety outcomes were analyzed for 247 patients. Group A had a significantly longer median operation time (225 min vs. 204 min, p = 0.022) and tended to have greater median blood loss (260 mL vs. 210 mL p = 0.073). The incidences of morbidity were similar and < 10% in both groups (8% vs. 9%, p = 1.000). There was no mortality in either group.

METHODS Participants (N=1,590) were assessed three times: early February 2020 before the coronavirus crisis in the United States and again in mid-March and late April 2020. Participants reported their weight, height, and weight discrimination in February. Depressed affect, loneliness, purpose in life, life satisfaction, and perceived support were assessed in all surveys; anxiety and stress were assessed in the March/April surveys. RESULTS Prior to the pandemic, reporting weight discrimination or being in the underweight or obesity 2-3 category was associated with more distress and lower well-being. Weight discrimination, not BMI, was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of incident depression from before to during the pandemic. Weight discrimination was associated with declines in purpose in life and life satisfaction across the pandemic. BMI categories were unrelated to changes in distress/well-being across the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Prior to the pandemic, BMI and weight discrimination were a vulnerability for greater distress and lower well-being. Weight discrimination, but not BMI, increased risk for incident depression and declines in well-being during the coronavirus pandemic.","Sutin, Angelina R; Stephan, Yannick; Luchetti, Martina; Aschwanden, Damaris; Strickhouser, Jason E; Lee, Ji Hyun; Sesker, Amanda A; Terracciano, Antonio",Obesity,2,1

As we adapt to function in the era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a better understanding of how surgical techniques generate potentially infectious aerosolized particles will enhance the safety of operating room (OR) staff and learners. OBJECTIVE To provide greater understanding of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk during endonasal surgeries by quantifying increases in airborne particle concentrations during endoscopic sinonasal surgery. METHODS Aerosol concentrations were measured during live-patient endoscopic endonasal surgeries in ORs with an optical particle sizer. Measurements were taken throughout the procedure at six time points: 1) before patient entered the OR, 2) before pre-incision timeout during OR setup, 3) during cold instrumentation with suction, 4) during microdebrider use, 5) during drill use and, 6) at the end of the case prior to extubation. Measurements were taken at three different OR position: surgeon, circulating nurse, and anesthesia provider. RESULTS Significant increases in airborne particle concentration were measured at the surgeon position with both the microdebrider (p = 0.001) and drill (p = 0.001), but not for cold instrumentation with suction (p = 0.340). Particle concentration did not significantly increase at the anesthesia position or the circulator position with any form of instrumentation. Overall, the surgeon position had a mean increase in particle concentration of 2445 particles/ft3 (95% CI 881 to 3955; p = 0.001) during drill use and 1825 particles/ft3 (95% CI 641 to 3009; p = 0.001) during microdebrider use. CONCLUSION Drilling and microdebrider use during endonasal surgery in a standard operating room is associated with a significant increase in airborne particle concentrations. Fortunately, this increase in aerosol concentration is localized to the area of the operating surgeon, with no detectable increase in aerosol particles at other OR positions.","Murr, Alex; Lenze, Nicholas R; Brown, William Colby; Gelpi, Mark W; Ebert, Charles S; Senior, Brent A; Thorp, Brian D; Zanation, Adam M; Kimple, Adam J",American journal of rhinology & allergy,2,1

It is found that the Co element more easily to form Mn enriched surface bimetallic oxides with Mn than Ni and Cu, resulting in Co-MnOx exhibited the best deNOx activity and SO2 tolerance, followed by Ni-MnOx and Cu-MnOx. The role of different transition metal and structure-activity relationships were systematically investigated by advanced techniques including Synchrotron XAFS and in situ DRIFTs analysis. The excellent activity of Co-MnOx was related to its unique Mn-enriched surface (Co2+)tet(Mn3+ Co3+)octO4 structure with Mn cations occupying the octahedral sites, which is superior to the Ni-MnOx and Cu-MnOx with Mn-lean surface. In addition, the reaction energy barrier of Co-MnOx is weakened due to the lower electron cloud density around the Mn atom as compared to Ni-MnOx and Cu-MnOx. Moreover, Co-MnOx benefiting from the rapid electron migration between Mn and Co, more active bidentate/bridged nitrates could react with adsorbed NH3 in faster reaction rates following the L-H mechanism.","Shi, Yiran; Yi, Honghong; Gao, Fengyu; Zhao, Shunzheng; Xie, Zongli; Tang, Xiaolong",Journal of hazardous materials,2,15

Organ shortage is currently the main limitation to liver transplant in many countries worldwide, with fewer donors than patients waiting for transplant. Different solutions have been proposed, including the use of marginal grafts, living donors, and machine perfusion. Potential organs are sometimes discarded due to technical difficulties that may hamper the success of their retrieval and eventual transplant. Here, we present the case of a 69-year-old man with a history of cardiac and pulmonary disease who was considered a potential organ donor after brain death. According to the patient's history, a computed tomography before acceptance was required. The scan revealed a giant thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. The donor had previous cardiac surgery with sternotomy and a talcage of the right pleural space. The 2 renal arteries were also unusable because of spread calcifications and involvement by the aneurism. We decided to cannulate the superior mesenteric vessels. Liver transplant was uneventful, and the recipient had no vascular complications, as shown by Doppler ultrasonography performed on days 1, 3, and 7. Length of hospitalization was 14 days.

Many have underlying severe atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis coexisting with acute thrombosis, requiring treatment of both pathologies in the same session, though technical risks may be encountered. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of combined treatment by using stent retrievers for the thrombosis, together with angioplasty and stent placement for the underlying stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective review of 13 patients with basilar occlusions treated with thrombectomy by the Solitaire stent retriever and angioplasty and intracranial stent placement for underlying severe vertebrobasilar stenosis in the same session. Reperfusion was assessed in terms of the TICI score. Perioperative complications were recorded. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the NIHSS at discharge and the mRS on follow-up at 90 days. RESULTS Of the 30 patients with acute basilar artery occlusions treated with stent retrievers during the study period, 18 had coexisting severe intracranial stenosis. Thirteen patients meeting the criteria for our study received combined mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty with stent placement. The successful recanalization rate was 100%. Distal vessel embolizations occurred in 3 patients. There were 2 mortalities. On discharge, 10 patients (77%) had an improvement in NIHSS of ≥10 points. At 90 days, 6 patients (46%) had a good functional outcome with an mRS of ≤2. CONCLUSIONS The combined use of mechanical thrombectomy with angioplasty and stent placement for acute basilar occlusions with underlying severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis is technically feasible and safe.","Gao, F; Lo, W T; Sun, X; Mo, D P; Ma, N; Miao, Z R",AJNR.

However, this system is composed of organs that are extremely complex. Among the different parts, the intestine is viewed as an incredible surface of contact with the environment and is colonised by hundreds of trillions of gut microbes. The role of the gut barrier has been studied for decades, but the exact mechanisms involved in the protection of the gut barrier are various and complementary. Among them, the integrity of the mucus barrier is one of the first lines of protection of the gastrointestinal tract. In the past, this 'slimy' partner was mostly considered a simple lubricant for facilitating the progression of the food bolus and the stools in the gut. Since then, different researchers have made important progress, and currently, the regulation of this mucus barrier is gaining increasing attention from the scientific community. Among the factors influencing the mucus barrier, the microbiome plays a major role in driving mucus changes. Additionally, our dietary habits (ie, high-fat diet, low-fibre/high-fibre diet, food additives, pre- probiotics) influence the mucus at different levels. Given that the mucus layer has been linked with the appearance of diseases, proper knowledge is highly warranted. Here, we debate different aspects of the mucus layer by focusing on its chemical composition, regulation of synthesis and degradation by the microbiota as well as some characteristics of the mucus layer in both physiological and pathological situations.","Paone, Paola; Cani, Patrice D",Gut,2,1

After successful arterial peripheral cannulation, a certain grade of peripheral limb malperfusion is a fairly common phenomenon. Detection of peripheral malperfusion is vital, since it can result in compartment syndrome or even loss of the affected limb. To prevent or resolve emerging lower limb ischaemia, a newly designed perfusion catheter is placed into the superficial femoral artery, distal to the arterial cannula via ECMO. The aim of our study was to evaluate flow and haemodynamic characteristics of this novel distal limb perfusion cannula for ECMO therapy and present these important findings for the first time. The distal perfusion cannula blood flow increases in linear correlation with ECMO blood flow The variability of distal perfusion cannula blood flow with a 15 Fr cannula ranges between 160 ± 0.40 mL min-1 at 1.5 L min-1 ECMO flow rate and 480 ± 80 mL min-1 at 5.0 L min-1 ECMO blood flow, respectively. Comparatively, the 17-Fr-sized cannula performs on a scale of 140 ± 20 to 390 ± 60 mL distal perfusion cannula blood flow at 1.5-5.0 L min-1 ECMO blood flow, respectively. The quantitative assessment of the distal perfusion cannula blood flow has revealed that distal perfusion cannula blood flow can measure up to 10% of the ECMO blood flow. Furthermore, it has been also well demonstrated that the novel distal perfusion cannula is sufficient to compensate peripheral limb ischaemia.","Foltan, Maik; Philipp, Alois; Göbölös, Laszlo; Holzamer, Andreas; Schneckenpointner, Roland; Lehle, Karla; Kornilov, Igor; Schmid, Christof; Lunz, Dirk",Perfusion,2,22

Nevertheless, IAAs account for at least 10%-15% of hemorrhagic strokes during the first 2 decades of life. Traditional vascular risk factors, which are common in the adult population, are generally absent in the pediatric population, engendering distinct modes of IAA pathogenesis. Classification of pediatric IAAs according to the pathogenetic mechanism shows eight distinct categories: idiopathic, traumatic, those due to excessive hemodynamic stress, vasculopathic, infectious, noninfectious inflammatory, oncotic, and familial. Pathogenetic mechanism is the best predictor of the clinical course of the disease, response to treatment, and long-term prognosis. The pathogenetic subtypes of pediatric IAA show characteristic and variably overlapping features. In most cases, IAAs manifesting during the first 2 decades of life are idiopathic. IAAs that are idiopathic, traumatic (second most common type), or due to excessive hemodynamic stresses (third most common type) account for more than 80% of IAAs in the pediatric age group.

METHODS A retrospective case review at the Brooklyn Veteran's Association Hospital of patients with corneal stromal edema that were treated with netarsudil and subsequently developed cystic epithelial edema. RESULTS Four male patients with a mean age of 72 ± 8.0 years developed a reticular, honeycomb-like pattern of epithelial edema located in the interpalpebral and inferior cornea. In 3 of 4 patients, epithelial edema arose within 1 month compared with 2 months in 1 patient. New epithelial cysts did not correlate with worsening central corneal thickness and best spectacle-corrected visual acuity in every patient, which was likely due to the location of the cysts. Two of 4 patients developed increased central corneal thickness with worsening best spectacle-corrected visual acuity. In comparison, 1 patient had improvement in both parameters, whereas 1 patient had no significant change. In all cases, there was resolution of the epithelial cysts after discontinuation of netarsudil. CONCLUSIONS Although rho-kinase inhibitors have been suggested to improve endothelial function, we have documented worsening epithelial cysts in a subset of patients with pre-existing corneal edema. These effects of netarsudil were transient and resolved after discontinuing treatment within 2 weeks in most patients. We hypothesize that the incidence of this adverse finding is more common than previously believed.

In China, comprehensive studies of the etiology of CAP in children aged between 2 months and 14 years who are serious enough to require hospitalization are lacking. Previous studies have been limited in child age range, focused on fatal cases, and/or limited in etiologies sought. An understanding of the etiologies is needed for development of best prevention and management practices. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to prospectively determine during a 12-month period the etiology of CAP in hospitalized children in a center in Northwest China. DESIGN/METHODS A prospective 12-month study (2004-2005) of CAP cases in children who were 2 months to 14 years of age admitted to the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, China. Testing included admission and 1-month postdischarge serum for viral and bacterial serologic analyses (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, paraflu 1-3, adenovirus; Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza B, Mycoplasma, and Moraxella. catarrhalis), blood culture, a nasopharyngeal aspirate for viral antigen testing, and a chest radiograph on admission and 1 month postdischarge. The study was funded by Lanzhou University. The study was performed in compliance with the guidelines of the institutional review board of the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University. RESULTS CAP was the admitting diagnosis for 29% of all admissions during the 12-month study. Of the 884 CAP cases, 821 (93%) were enrolled and completed the study. The age range was 2 months to 14 years; mean age was 2.3 years; 40% were <1 year. The average length of stay was 9.2 days (range, 6-20) but varied by age and etiology. Fourteen percent had received antibiotics before admission and 14% had underlying illnesses; 12% required intensive care unit treatment and 5 died. A microbial etiology for CAP was identified in 547 (67%); viral 535 (43%), bacterial 228 (27%), mixed viral bacterial 107 (13%), mixed viral in 1%, and mixed bacterial in 1%. The etiology varied by age; respiratory syncytial virus was most common in <1 year, S. pneumoniae and Hib 1-3 years, and Mycoplasma 5 years. Three potentially vaccine preventable etiologies accounted for 35% of the cases: influenza 9%, Hib 12%, and S. pneumonia 14%. CONCLUSIONS CAP is a major cause of childhood admission in China. Given the etiologic findings in this study, potentially 25% to 35% of cases could be prevented if seasonal influenza vaccine and conjugated H. influenza b and conjugated pneumococcal vaccines were introduced into routine practice.","Zhang, Qingli; Guo, Zhongqin; MacDonald, Noni E",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,2,17

Significant differences were identified in the perceived seriousness and risk of CHD between younger and older age groups (p < 0.001) and groups with lower and higher education levels (p < 0.001), but not between genders (p > 0.05). Over 50% of participants expressed greater concern about infectious disease than about CHD, while two-thirds to over half of female, older, and less educated participants were more concerned about stroke. This study highlighted populations with lower levels of CHD perception that need increased public education. The findings have implications for the societal readiness to establishing ongoing public healthcare strategies to increase awareness of CHD.","Chan, C W; Leung, S F","Psychology, health & medicine",2,28

Despite its demonstrated prevalence and high case fatality rate, antibiotics remain the only target-oriented treatment option currently available. Starting from results showing that low-dose anthracyclines protect against sepsis in mice, we sought to find new causative treatment options to improve sepsis outcomes. METHODS Sepsis was induced in mice, and different treatment options were evaluated regarding cytokine and biomarker expression, lung epithelial cell permeability, autophagy induction, and survival benefit. Results were validated in cell culture experiments and correlated with patient samples. FINDINGS Effective low-dose epirubicin treatment resulted in substantial downregulation of the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) degrading enzyme S1P lyase (SPL). Consequent accumulation and secretion of S1P in lung parenchyma cells stimulated the S1P-receptor type 3 (S1PR3) and mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and ERK, reducing tissue damage via increased disease tolerance. The protective effects of SPL inhibition were absent in S1PR3 deficient mice. Sepsis patients showed increased expression of SPL, stable expression of S1PR3, and increased levels of mucin-1 and surfactant protein D as indicators of lung damage. INTERPRETATION Our work highlights a tissue-protective effect of SPL inhibition in sepsis due to activation of the S1P/S1PR3 axis and implies that SPL inhibitors and S1PR3 agonists might be potential therapeutics to protect against sepsis by increasing disease tolerance against infections.

Case-control studies select participants based on outcome status, not exposure status, and therefore differ from other observational studies in their aims, limitations, and conclusions. Misclassification of a different kind of study as a case-control study can lead to misinterpretation of the data and misreporting of its level of evidence (LOE), either ""overselling"" or ""underselling"" its importance. Questions/Purposes We sought to answer three questions: (1) How frequently do studies reported to be orthopedic case-control studies actually reflect other study designs? (2) What factors might be associated with misclassification? (3) How does study design misclassification affect LOE reporting? Methods A bibliometric analysis was performed to identify all studies published in 75 orthopedic journals over a one-year period (January 2017 through December 2017) that included the term ""case-control"" in the title, abstract, or main text. We identified the proportion of studies that were misclassified as ""case-control"" in design and recorded the associated changes in reported LOE. We also examined associations between study misclassification (and by extension LOE misclassification) and the study specialty, journal specialty, and journal impact factor. Results Of 339 studies that reported a case-control design, 227 (67%) were misclassified and reflected other study designs. The study designs most often misclassified as case-control designs were retrospective cohort studies (n = 97; 43%) and cross-sectional studies (n = 88; 39%). The frequency of misclassification was associated with the subspecialty of the journal and the impact factor but not the study subspecialty. After correction of the LOE in the misclassified studies that reported an LOE (n = 193), it was found that 28 (15%) had underreported their LOE, and eight (4%) had overreported their LOE. Conclusions Studies reported in the orthopedic literature to have a case-control design frequently have another study design, and this pattern is consistent across subspecialties. Enhanced rigor in accurately defining study designs in orthopedics could be achieved through training and stricter review processes.","LeBrun, Drake G; Bido, Jen; Kocher, Mininder S; Baldwin, Keith D; Fabricant, Peter D",HSS journal : the musculoskeletal journal of Hospital for Special Surgery,2,10

There is evidence that patients and family members can benefit from participation in PEoLC research. AIM To synthesise the evidence regarding patients', family members' and carers' experiences of participating in PEoLC research. To identify recommendations for enhancing the experience of participants. DESIGN A qualitative rapid review and thematic synthesis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed were searched from 2010 to 2020. Studies reporting patients', family members' or carers' experiences of participating in PEoLC research were included. RESULTS 4 studies were included and 7 themes identified relating to the benefits of, and barriers to, participation in PEoLC research. Both altruistic and personal benefits of participation were reported. Barriers (negative aspects) to participation included feeling overwhelmed, practical issues, reminders of being a patient, not seeing the research as relevant to them and unmet needs. CONCLUSIONS A number of benefits (positive aspects) surround participation in PEoLC research. However, several barriers (negative aspects) can prevent or discourage participation.

The 2015 update of the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations: Mood, Cognition and Fatigue Module guideline is a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based recommendations for clinicians in a range of settings, who provide care to patients following stroke. The three consequences of stroke that are the focus of the this guideline (poststroke depression, vascular cognitive impairment, and fatigue) have high incidence rates and significant impact on the lives of people who have had a stroke, impede recovery, and result in worse long-term outcomes. Significant practice variations and gaps in the research evidence have been reported for initial screening and in-depth assessment of stroke patients for these conditions. Also of concern, an increased number of family members and informal caregivers may also experience depressive symptoms in the poststroke recovery phase which further impact patient recovery. These factors emphasize the need for a system of care that ensures screening occurs as a standard and consistent component of clinical practice across settings as stroke patients transition from acute care to active rehabilitation and reintegration into their community. Additionally, building system capacity to ensure access to appropriate specialists for treatment and ongoing management of stroke survivors with these conditions is another great challenge.","Eskes, Gail A; Lanctôt, Krista L; Herrmann, Nathan; Lindsay, Patrice; Bayley, Mark; Bouvier, Laurie; Dawson, Deirdre; Egi, Sandra; Gilchrist, Elizabeth; Green, Theresa; Gubitz, Gord; Hill, Michael D; Hopper, Tammy; Khan, Aisha; King, Andrea; Kirton, Adam; Moorhouse, Paige; Smith, Eric E; Green, Janet; Foley, Norine; Salter, Katherine; Swartz, Richard H",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2,1

However, resistance to Lenvatinib results in tumor progression and has become a major obstacle to improving the prognosis of HCC patients. Exploring the mechanisms underlying Lenvatinib resistance is considered essential for the treatment of advanced HCC. METHODS Lenvatinib resistant HCC (LR-HCC) cells were generated and potential long non-coding RNAs (Lnc-RNAs) upregulated in LR-HCC cells were identified by RNA sequencing. The effects of upregulated Lnc-RNAs were evaluated in vitro in cell models and in vivo in experimental animals using quantitative cell viability and apoptosis assays. RESULTS We found that Lnc-RNA MT1JP (MT1JP) was upregulated in LR-HCC cells and inhibited the apoptosis signaling pathway. In addition, we found that sponging of microRNA-24-3p by MT1JP released Bcl-2 like 2 (BCL2L2), an anti-apoptotic protein, thereby forming a positive-feedback loop. The role of this feedback loop was validated using rescue assays. Additionally, we found that upregulation of MT1JP and BCL2L2 impaired the sensitivity of HCC cells to Lenvatinib both vitro and vivo. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest a novel molecular feedback loop between MT1JP and apoptosis signaling in Lenvatinib sensitive HCC cells.","Yu, Ting; Yu, Jiajian; Lu, Lu; Zhang, Yize; Zhou, Yadong; Zhou, Yong; Huang, Fengling; Sun, Lu; Guo, Zhixian; Hou, Guojun; Dong, Zihui; Wang, Bibo",Cellular oncology,2,17

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective analysis. METHODS One hundred fourteen patients affected by endolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent salvage total laryngectomy following primary treatment failure were reviewed. We divided patients into two groups based on type of pharyngeal suture performed: mechanical suture with stapler (group A) and manual suture (group B). These two groups were compared for surgical time, start of oral feeding, hospitalization length, surgical margins and pharyngocutaneous fistula incidence considering its relationship with diabetes mellitus, nutritional status, primary treatment, and neck dissection. RESULTS In group A and group B, oral feeding restarting time was 15 ± 9.33 versus 20.03 ± 13.81 days, hospitalization was 17.63 ± 10.08 versus 23.72 ± 14.29 days, and surgery lasted 268.39 ± 76.93 versus 294.26 ± 140.58 minutes, respectively (P < .05). Surgical margins resulted infiltrated in two patients (4.3%) in group A and 12 patients in group B (17.6%) (P = .03). Twenty-one patients (18.4%) presented with pharyngocutanoeus fistula. In group A and group B the incidence of fistula was 15.2% and 20.6%, respectively (P = .468). Fistula occurred in 7 of 18 diabetic patients (38.9%) and 14 of 96 (14.6%) nondiabetic patients (P = .015). Nineteen fistulas (90.5%) occurred in patients who had undergone previous radiation treatment (P = .013). CONCLUSIONS Using a stapler shortened operative time and hospitalization, while also providing a faster restart of oral feeding. Moreover, mechanical pharyngeal suture seems to decrease fistula rate even though its prevention role in salvage laryngectomy should be confirmed by further studies.

It is also an endocrine disruptor and is thought to be related to abnormalities of the reproductive tract. However, its mechanism of inducing abnormalities of the male reproductive tract is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to study the effect of gestational vinclozolin exposure on the development of rat fetal Leydig cells. Female pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to vinclozolin (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg body weight/day) by gavage from gestational day 14-21. Vinclozolin dose-dependently reduced serum testosterone levels at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg and the anogenital distance at 100 mg/kg. RNA-seq, qPCR, and Western blotting showed that vinclozolin down-regulated the expression of Nr5a1, Sox9, Lhcgr, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, Hsd17b3, Amh, Pdgfa, and Dhh and their encoded proteins. Vinclozolin reduced the number of NR2F2-positive stem Leydig cells at a dose of 100 mg/kg and enhanced autophagy in the testes.

The proposed basis for the activity against negative-sense RNA viruses is the binding to exposed 5'-triphosphates (5'-ppp) on the genome of viral RNA. However, recent studies reported relatively low binding affinities of IFIT1 for 5'-ppp RNA, suggesting that IFIT1 may not interact efficiently with this moiety under physiological conditions. To evaluate the ability of IFIT1 to have an impact on negative-sense RNA viruses, we infected Ifit1(-/-) and wild-type control mice and primary cells with four negative-sense RNA viruses (influenza A virus [IAV], La Crosse virus [LACV], Oropouche virus [OROV], and Ebola virus) corresponding to three distinct families. Unexpectedly, a lack of Ifit1 gene expression did not result in increased infection by any of these viruses in cell culture. Analogously, morbidity, mortality, and viral burdens in tissues were identical between Ifit1(-/-) and control mice after infection with IAV, LACV, or OROV. Finally, deletion of the human IFIT1 protein in A549 cells did not affect IAV replication or infection, and reciprocally, ectopic expression of IFIT1 in HEK293T cells did not inhibit IAV infection. To explain the lack of antiviral activity against IAV, we measured the binding affinity of IFIT1 for RNA oligonucleotides resembling the 5' ends of IAV gene segments. The affinity for 5'-ppp RNA was approximately 10-fold lower than that for non-2'-O-methylated (cap 0) RNA oligonucleotides. Based on this analysis, we conclude that IFIT1 is not a dominant restriction factor against negative-sense RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE Negative-sense RNA viruses, including influenza virus and Ebola virus, have been responsible for some of the most deadly outbreaks in recent history. The host interferon response and induction of antiviral genes contribute to the control of infections by these viruses. IFIT1 is highly induced after virus infection and reportedly has antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. However, its role in restricting infection by negative-sense RNA viruses remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the ability of IFIT1 to inhibit negative-sense RNA virus replication and pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Detailed cell culture and animal studies demonstrated that IFIT1 is not a dominant restriction factor against three different families of negative-sense RNA viruses.","Pinto, Amelia K; Williams, Graham D; Szretter, Kristy J; White, James P; Proença-Módena, José Luiz; Liu, Gai; Olejnik, Judith; Brien, James D; Ebihara, Hideki; Mühlberger, Elke; Amarasinghe, Gaya; Diamond, Michael S; Boon, Adrianus C M",Journal of virology,2,23

They are particularly numerous in the field of health, contributing to the movement called ehealth. What is the potential role of these devices as prevention supports? The purpose of this article is to provide an exploratory analysis of the use, efficacy and contribution to conventional prevention strategies. METHODS To address this issue, we conducted a scoping-review on the basis of 105 publications from the fields of medicine and human sciences. RESULTS Three dimensions of the use of smart devices in the field of health were identified: 1/a quantification tool allowing the users to measure their activities; 2/a tool of self-positioning in the community; 3/an interface between the medical world and the population, modifying the hierarchy of knowledge. However, few published studies have investigated the determinants of the efficacy of these devices and their impact on individual behaviours and professional health practices. CONCLUSION Based on the hypothesis of possible integration of these devices in prevention policies, it would be interesting to investigate two research issues: how and under what psycho-socio-environmental conditions can smart devices contribute to the adoption of positive health behaviours? To what degree does the use of smart devices modify the health care professional-patient relationship? Finding answers to these questions could help to define the real place of these devices in prevention strategies by determining their complementarity with respect to other prevention strategies, and the conditions of their efficacy on behaviours and inequalities.","Petit, Audrey; Cambon, Linda",BMC public health,2,15

This study aimed to investigate the methylation profile of SERPINA1 in blood cells from ACS patients, with (COPD+) or without COPD (COPD-). METHODS Blood samples were from 115 ACS patients, including 30 COPD+ and 85 COPD- according to lung function phenotype, obtained with spirometry. DNA treated with sodium bisulfite was PCR-amplified at SERPINA1 promoter region. Methylation analysis was carried out by sequencing the PCR products. Lymphocytes count in ACS patients was recorded at hospital admission and discharge. RESULTS SERPINA1 was hypermethylated in 24/30 (80%) COPD+ and 48/85 (56.5%) COPD- (p < 0.05). Interestingly, at hospital discharge, lymphocytes count was higher in COPD- patients carrying SERPINA1 hypermethylated (1.98 × 103 ± 0.6 cell/µl) than in COPD- carrying SERPINA1 hypomethylated (1.7 × 103 ± 0.48 cell/µl) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS SERPINA1 is hypermethylated in blood cells from COPD+ patients. COPD- carrying SERPINA1 hypermethylated and high lymphocytes count may be at risk of COPD development. Therefore, SERPINA1 hypermethylation may represent a potential biomarker for predicting COPD development in ACS patients.","Rotondo, John Charles; Aquila, Giorgio; Oton-Gonzalez, Lucia; Selvatici, Rita; Rizzo, Paola; De Mattei, Monica; Pavasini, Rita; Tognon, Mauro; Campo, Gianluca Calogero; Martini, Fernanda",Clinical epigenetics,2,2

Thematic analysis of meeting minutes revealed four categories: timing and urgency;collaboration, preparation, and teaching;altruism;and what we learned. Further themes were identified from each of the categories. Innovative outcomes were identified from the text including creation of website teaching resources and development of a computer based clinical checklist. Implications for future nursing education included that computer- based simulation will continue to be embedded in nursing curricula. Also, the need for nursing faculty to remain technologically savvy to deliver trailblazing online pedagogies will prominently continue. We conclude that the synergistic collaboration of nursing program directors can have momentous outcomes for support and success of nursing programs.","Liesveld, Judy Petrovic Kimberly León Teresa G.; Grohman, Susan Wright Mary",Journal of Professional Nursing,2,1

There are no proven effective therapeutic agents or vaccines. Some antiviral agents and micronutrients have been repurposed for the management. There are claims of herbal preparations with therapeutic effects. Vangag herbal formulation for the management of COVID-19 is a combination of six plants. Molecular docking and virtual screening were used for the study. Ligands and protein target for molecular docking were prepared in Autodock Tools using PyRx 0.8 package. 3D structures of 24 phytochemicals in Vangag were downloaded from PubChem and optimized in Discovery Studio 4.5 visualizer. Nine agents currently used for management of COVID-19 were also downloaded and included in the ligand library to serve as control. Results of the binding affinities of phytochemicals in constituent plants of Vangag to SARS-CoV-2 molecular target (7BV2.pdb) were ranked from 1 to 21. Kolaviron (binding affinity -8.1 Kcal/mol) ranked 1, Ritonavir 5, Remdesivir 6, Quinine 7, Hydroxychloroquine 9, Chloroquine 18 and the least Allicin 21 (binding affinity -3.7 Kcal/mol). Phytochemicals in Vangag have good binding affinity to COVID-19 viral target proteins. Vangag also contains high concentration of zinc and other micronutrients, making it a promising formula for management of COVID-19.","Falang, K. D.; Poyi, C. O.; Kolawole, J.

Likewise, Twitter provides a platform where people can publicly share their thoughts and sentiments in the form of tweets. In this paper, we realize the importance of public data found on Twitter and focus on understanding how Filipinos react as the timeline of events occur in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic. We perform analyses in two main aspects: identification of prominent themes and its trend of usage over time. Results show that Filipinos (a) express positive emotions such as love, hope, and longing, (b) raise concerns over health and testing, and (c) share their experience as main themes of discussion on Twitter. Cross-referencing our results with previous work dealing with thematic analysis on other natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons shows that the positive and hopeful mindset is consistent amongst Filipinos. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Imperial, J.

It is widely recognized as a disease of the pulmonary system, presenting with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, a number of extra pulmonary manifestations have been described in the literature. SARS-CoV-2 is expressed in gastrointestinal (GI) epithelial cells suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in the GI tract. The most prevalent GI features of COVID-19 include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. There is limited data regarding GI bleeding in patients with COVID-19. Method: This single-centered, retrospective case series was conducted at Razi hospital in Khuzestan province southwestern Iran one of the provinces with highest prevalence and death due to COVID-19 disease.

This paper aims to explore the correlation between climatic factors and the morbidity of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, mainly by using a geographic detector and GWR model. It was found that the response of the morbidity of COVID-19 to meteorological factors in Wuhan is different at different stages. On the whole, the morbidity of COVID-19 has a strong spatial aggregation, mainly concentrated in the central area of Wuhan City. There is a positive correlation between wind speed and the spread of COVID-19, while temperature has a negative correlation. There is a positive correlation between air pressure and the number of COVID-19 cases. Rainfall is not significantly correlated with the spread of COVID-19. It is concluded that wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, and air pressure are important meteorological factors affecting the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Any two variables have greater interaction with the spatial distribution of the incidence rate of COVID-19 than any one factor alone. Those findings not only provide a new insight for the key intervention measures and the optimal allocation of health care resources accordingly but also lay a theoretical foundation for disease prevention, disease intervention and health services.","Lin, Qiaowen Ou Guoliang Wang Renyang Li Yanan Zhao Yi Dong Zijun",Sustainability,2,29

Methods We designed and conducted a data-based prospective survey exploring exercise behaviors of ACHD patients and recall of discussions around physical activity. The questionnaire was distributed to patients in outpatient clinics and inpatient wards at a tertiary ACHD centre in the UK, between October and November 2020. Results In total 125 patients completed the survey. Demographically, 60% were women, 34% were men and 4% preferred not to answer. The majority of respondents were of White British or European ethnicity (73.6%). With regard to baseline physical activity levels, only 66 (52.8%) respondents met recommended exercise targets, participating in moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week. This reduced further to 40.8% following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (p=0.03) (figure 1). Common motivations for physical activity were general fitness (53.6%), weight loss (36.0%) and mental health benefits (30.4%). Key reasons for reduced physical activity as a result of the pandemic were fear of COVID-19 (28.0%), loss of motivation (23.2%) and gym/fitness centre closure (15.2%) (figure 2). Almost two thirds (65.6%) of respondents did not recall having a discussion about exercise participation with healthcare professionals. Discussions about individualized exercise prescriptions were recalled by 8 respondents (6.4%). In total, 16% recalled being told to avoid certain exercises by their healthcare team;common responses of exercises to be avoided included high impact/contact sport and heavy weightlifting, with others told not to run, scuba dive or play golf. Conclusions Almost half of the surveyed population did not meet recommended exercise targets before the pandemic, with even fewer meeting recommendations during the first COVID- 19 pandemic lockdown. The majority of patients do not recall ever having discussions about exercise with their healthcare team. Whilst we are unable to determine whether this is due to discussions not occurring or poor patient recall, there are clear deficiencies in the provision and/or retention of health promotional information surrounding exercise. Quality improvement initiatives to improve patient awareness and involvement in physical activity may be considered two-fold. Firstly, attention should be paid to improving patient recall of advice from consultations, which could involve the provision of written aids and individualised exercise prescriptions. Secondly, healthcare professional confidence in providing exercise recommendations to the heterogenous ACHD population is an area for improvement. This may include raising awareness of common motivations for exercise in this group that could be harnessed and formal education on available guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted exercise habits in the ACHD population and despite changes in healthcare service delivery, including the shift towards tele-medicine, the benefits of exercise must be emphasized at every opportunity.","Thompson, S.; Whitehead, C.; Notley, A.; Guy, I.; Prabhakar, C.

It has seen an unparalleled spread within a short span of time, and claimed victims in many parts of the world. As the number of confirmed cases skyrockets exponentially, a recent surge of ‘bad’ behaviours such as xenophobia attacks, propagation of misinformation, and panic-buying of essential items have become increasingly commonplace. Panic and chaos reigned as the world witnessed unprecedented moves by countries to close their borders and implement strict quarantine orders in a desperate attempt to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. COVID-19 has impacted many different aspects of society, from politics and economics to the psychological well-being of citizens, and the list will continue to grow as the spread of the coronavirus persist. While it is impossible to fathom the way COVID-19 will change our usual way of life, there are prevailing concerns that the community currently faces. What are the psychological impacts of a pandemic? How do we enhance the collective resilience of the community during a pandemic? How do we cope with mental health issues during a pandemic? How do we deal with bereavement during a pandemic? How can we support healthcare workers and emergency responders during a pandemic? These are just some of many important concerns that influence the way we cope with the COVID-19 outbreak. There is therefore an urgent need to enhance our understanding and level of preparedness against Covid-19 and pandemic in general. To that end, this edited book, How to Prepare for the Next Pandemic: Behavioural Sciences Insights for Practitioners and Policymakers aims to examine the impacts pandemic have on our society from a behavioural sciences perspective, and to identify solutions that practitioners and policymakers can adopt to combat the spread of COVID-19 in this new operating environment. © 2021 by Editors.","Khader, M.; Dillon, D.; Chen, X.

Ignoring the importance of the geo-spatial granularity at which the data is collected could have significant implications on the quality of forecasts and the actionable clinical recommendations that are based on it. Objective: This paper’s primary objective is to test the hypothesis that the characteristic dynamics defining the trajectory of the pandemic in a region is lost when the data is aggregated and modeled at higher geo-spatial levels. Design: We use publicly available confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from January 1st, 2020 to August 3rd, 2020 in the United States at different geo-spatial granularities to conduct our experiments. To understand the impact of this hypothesis, the output of this study was implemented in Tampa General Hospital (TGH) to provide resource demand forecast. Results: The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the forecast confirmed cases can be 30% higher for modeling at the state-level than aggregating model results at the scale of counties or clusters of counties. Similarly, modeling at a state-level and crafting policy decisions based on them may not be effective - county-level forecasts made by partitioning state-level forecasts are 3x worse for confirmed cases and 20x worse for deaths relative to the same model at the county level. By leveraging these results, TGH was able to accurately allocate clinical resources to tackle COVID-19 cases, continue elective surgical procedures largely uninterrupted and avoid costly construction of overflow capacity in the first two epidemic waves. Conclusions and Relevance: Accurate forecasting at the county level requires hyper-local modeling with county resolution. State-level modeling does not accurately predict community spread in smaller sub-regions because state populations are not well mixed, resulting in large prediction errors. Actionable decisions such as deciding whether to cancel planned surgeries or construct overflow capacity require models with local specificity.","Gopalakrishnan, Vishrawas; Pethe, Sayali; Kefayati, Sarah; Srinivasan, Raman; Hake, Paul; Deshpande, Ajay; Liu, Xuan; Hoang, Etter; Davila, Marbelly; Bianco, Simone; Kaufman, James H.",,2,1

Possible mechanisms of influence of nanosilver particles on the coronavirus are considered. Models of nanosilver complexes with spike protein of coronavirus amino acids were constructed using computer quantum-chemical modeling. The values of electron density distribution, highest occupied molecular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and electron density distribution gradient for each constructed model are obtained. As a result of quantum chemical modeling, it was found that silver nanoparticles can interact with the following amino acids: Proline, glutamine, lysine, arginine, asparagine, histidine, glutamic and aspartic acids, tryptophan, and cysteine, which is due to the presence of additional -NH2, -NH, -SH and -COOH groups in these amino acids that are not involved in the formation of a peptide bond. The freedom of additional groups makes it possible to interact with nanosilver. Analysis of the obtained data showed that the most energy-efficient interaction is the formation of the ""tryptophan-nanosilver"" complex (E= - 5856.83 kcal/mol). Based on the findings of quantum chemical calculations, the most stable complex is the ""cysteine- nanosilver"" (Delta E = 0.16 a.u).

Although children infected less frequently and generally have a milder findings of COVID-19, the number of patients with a more severe clinical course as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is increasing significantly. However, it has not been shown exactly how biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD)s, which we frequently use in our pediatric rheumatology practice, and/or the underlying rheumatological diseases affect the clinical course of COVID-19. Objectives: Here, we aimed to reveal the outcome of COVID-19 infection in our patients with pediatric rheumatic disease and treated with bDMARDs. Methods: During the period between April 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020, the patients who received bDMARDs were evaluated at the regular outpatient clinic follow-up or by telemedicine with a maximum of 3 months interval. Clinical and demographic characteristics, COVID-19 data and outcome of these patients were retrospectively collected. Results: Out of the 436 patients treated with bDMARDs, 39 children were infected with COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed in 37 patients by RT-PCR (nasalpharyngeal swab) and in two by antibody test. Twenty-two (56.4%) patients were female (17 male, %43.6) and the median age of patients were 12.3 years (min-max: 1.2-20.9). The primary diagnosis of patients were as follows;20 juvenile idiopathic arthritis (six were systemic subtype), 12 systemic autoinflammatory diseases, three vasculitis, three chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and one Sjögren's syndrome. Prior to COVID-19 infection, 13 patients (33.3%) were using canakinumab, seven were infliximab (18%), five were adalimumab (12.8%), four were etanercept 10.2%), four were tocilizumab (10.2%), three were anakinra (7.7%), two were rituximab (5.1%), and one was tofacitinib (2.6%). Of the 39 patients, 21 had at least one COVID-19-related symptom, while 18 patients were asymptomatic. No laboratory or imaging tests was performed for asymptomatic patients and they were followed up without treatment at home isolation. Laboratory tests revealed that fourteen patients had elevated acute phase reactants, six had elevated D-dimer levels, three had lymphopenia (<1000/mm3), and three had hyperferritinemia. Hospitalization was required in 20 patients (51.3%) at median of 7-days (minmax: 3-17) and pediatric intensive care unit admission in one. Five patients developed MIS-C and one of these patients was followed up in the pediatric intensive care unit. Myocardial dysfunction was developed in this patient and he was died. The other four patients fully recovered with no remain morbidity. Conclusion: Considering the literature data and the results of our study, it is not possible to say that currently used bDMARDs worse the course of COVID-19 infection. In patients with underlying risk factors for hyperinflammation, as in one of our patients, COVID-19 may cause mortality regardless of the use of bDMARDs. Whether bDMARDs does not affect the severity of the disease, but it is still not true to say that these drugs are protective. Since cessation of bDMARDs for COVID-risk may cause exacerbation of the primary rheumatic disease, continuing with current treatments seems an appropriate approach.","Demir, F.; Ulu, K.; Çaǧlayan, Ş Coşkuner T.; Sözeri, B.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,2,1

At an aggregated level, we show that aggregate demand decreases significantly at the early stages of COVID-19 and seems to reinstate its pre-COVID trend. However, when we include the pre-existing conditions of Turkey, the 2018 currency crisis, we observe that the recovery in demand is not that strong. To highlight the underlying reasons for structural change in aggregate demand, we estimate the model with stringency index and unemployment-related search index. The estimated model indicates that containment measures and restrictions and fear of job/income loss mainly explain the overall impact of COVID-19 on aggregate demand. We also examined sectoral data to understand aggregate demand dynamics better. Only stable and delayable sector groups have reached a trend above their pre-pandemic trajectories. However, the social and work-related sectors are far from their respective pre-pandemic trend.","Kantur, Zeynep Özcan Gülserim",Central Bank Review,2,8

This study aims to address this gap by illuminating the role of proactive personality (PP) as a factor of minimizing plateau via playful work design (PWD), career adaptability (CA) and perceived work-life balance (PWLB). Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional study design was applied and structural equation modelling was used to assess the hypothesized relationships among PP, CA, PWD, perceived work design and career plateau. A total of 338 employees from public and private universities were sampled from February 2020 to July 2020. Findings: The results highlighted that CA mediated the relationship between PP and PWLB, as well as, PWD mediated the association between PP and PWLB. Further, the authors got support for both serial mediation paths i.e. PP, CA, PWLB and career plateau and PP, PWD, PWLB and career plateau. Originality/value: The findings of this study provide much needed ways to overcome career plateau in the academic sector. Moreover, the use of multiple serial paths has enhanced the underlying factors of PP and career plateau nexus. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Shabeer, S.; Nasir, N.; Nasir, S.; Fatima, T.; Farooqi, Y.

Here, we examine Emergency EP (EmEP, Cohort A) and a novel 1-day Escalateddose EP (EscEP, Cohort B) administered every 2 weeks as upfront or first-relapse therapy to minimise hospital days. Methods: Single-centre analysis in GCT pts receiving emergency and routine chemotherapy following our first National lockdown on 23 March 2020. In Cohort A, eligible pts receive EmEP E100mg/m2 , P20mg/m2 prior to EscEP within the acute setting as previously defined. In Cohort B, EscEP E500mg/m2 , P60mg/m2 is compared to standard care chemotherapy BEP or POMB-ACE. Data collection includes demographics, treatment details, clinical outcome and Covid19 complications. Results: To date, we have accrued 19 pts with a median age 32 (range 18 to 65). In Cohort A, 7 pts with symptomatic high-volume disease received a median 1 cycle EmEP, 6/7 for a new GCT diagnosis and 1/7 for a first relapse, including 2 males with IGCCCG intermediate-prognosis disease, 5 females with FIGO Stage III (n = 2) and IV (n = 3) disease. One pt required higher-level support for organ dysfunction at presentation. In Cohort B, 19 pts including 7 pts from Cohort A received a median 4 cycles EscEP: 8 males (2 seminomas, 6 nonseminomas;IGCCCG good-prognosis in 4, intermediate-prognosis in 2, poor-prognosis in 2), 11 females (1 dysgerminoma, 10 nondysgerminomas;FIGO Stage Ic in 6, III in 2, IV in 3). A majority (14/19, 74%) received EscEP for a new cancer diagnosis, 5/19 (26%) for a first relapse. Total median hospital stay: EscEP 5 days, BEP 21 days, POMB-ACE 28 days. Grade 3/4 neutropenic events: EscEP 28%, BEP 50%, POMB-ACE 43%. From April 2020, 16/16 pts were SARS-CoV-2 screened prior to each cycle: 3/19 (16%) testing positive, one prior to intubation and ventilation, 2 with asymptomatic infection. For Cohort B, at median follow-up 121 days (range 9-323 days), we have observed a complete response in 10 pts (53%), partial response in 3 pts (16%) and disease progression in 1 pt (5%). Five pts are still on treatment (26%). All pts remain alive. Conclusions: EmEP and EscEP represent safe options during the pandemic that minimise myelosuppression and total length in hospital days whilst bypassing the potential pulmonary toxicity from Bleomycin.

We used this proactive routing approach to find the optimal paths in dynamically created WMN of client nodes. The performance of proposed approach was evaluated with different architectural scenarios from 1000 nodes to 10,000 nodes WMNs with a step increase of 1000 nodes. The route costs were evaluated using integrated link cost (ILC) measure which is a function of jitter, network delay and throughput. Performance of this proposed approach was compared with seven other soft computing based approaches and two hard computing based algorithms. The proposed approach outperformed all the other 9 competing approaches. The proposed algorithm can also be used effectively in isolation wards of COVID-19 hospitals and quarantine centers where robots can be networked for communications between patients and doctors.","Aneja, R.

There is an urgent need for clinically valuable, generalizable, and parsimonious triage tools assisting the appropriate allocation of hospital resources during the pandemic. We aimed to develop and extensively validate a machine learning-based tool for accurately predicting the clinical outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: CODOP was built using modified stable iterative variable selection and linear regression with lasso regularisation. To avoid generalization problems, CODOP was trained and tested with three time-sliced and geographically distinct cohorts encompassing 40 511 blood-based analyses of COVID-19 patients from more than 110 hospitals in Spain and the USA during 2020-21. We assessed the discriminative ability of the model using the Area Under the Receiving Operative Curve (AUROC) as well as horizon and Kaplan-Meier risk stratification analyses. To reckon the fluctuating pressure levels in hospitals through the pandemic, we offer two online CODOP calculators suited for undertriage or overtriage scenarios. We challenged their generalizability and clinical utility throughout an evaluation with datasets gathered in five hospitals from three Latin American countries. Findings: CODOP uses 12 clinical parameters commonly measured at hospital admission and associated with the pathophysiology of COVID-19. CODOP reaches high discriminative ability up to nine days before clinical resolution (AUROC: 0.90-0.96, 95% CI 0.879-0.970), it is well calibrated, and it enables an effective dynamic risk stratification during hospitalization. The two CODOP online calculators predicted the clinical outcome of the majority of patients (73-100% sensitivity and 84-100% specificity) from the distinctive Latin American evaluation cohort. Interpretation: The high predictive performance of CODOP in geographically disperse patient cohorts and the easiness-of-use, strongly suggest its clinical utility as a global triage tool, particularly in resource-limited countries.","Klen, R.; Purohit, D.; Gomez-Huelgas, R.; Casas-Rojo, J.

This is the lesson we learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the risk spillover effect of the COVID-19 on Chinese energy industry using a high-dimensional and time-varying factor-augmented VAR model. The results show that the net volatility spillovers of the pandemic remain positive to all underlying energy sectors during January to June of 2020 and February to April of 2021. For the former sub-period, the volatility spillover of the COVID-19 is not only the highest, but also lasts longest for oil exploitation sector, followed by the power and gas sectors. While for the latter sub-period, the COVID-19 has relatively higher volatility spillovers to the power, coal mining and petrochemical sectors. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 has significant risk spillover effects on Chinese energy sectors, and the effects vary among different energy sub-sectors and across different periods of time.","Si, Deng-Kui Liu Yun Xu XuChuan Fang Yi",Energy Economics,2,16

Although the current state of the art involves the use of neural network language models as a post-processing step, the very large number of ontology classes to be recognized and the limited amount of gold-standard training data has impeded the creation of end-to-end systems based entirely on machine learning. Recently, Hailu et al. recast the concept recognition problem as a type of machine translation and demonstrated that sequence-to-sequence machine learning models had the potential to outperform multi-class classification approaches. Here we systematically characterize the factors that contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of several approaches to sequence-to-sequence machine learning. Results We report on our extensive studies of alternative methods and hyperparameter selections. The results not only identify the best-performing systems and parameters across a wide variety of ontologies but also illuminate about the widely varying resource requirements and hyperparameter robustness of alternative approaches. Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of such systems suggest promising avenues for future improvements as well as design choices that can increase computational efficiency with small costs in performance. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT) for span detection (as previously found) along with the Open-source Toolkit for Neural Machine Translation (OpenNMT) for concept normalization achieve state-of-the-art performance for most ontologies in CRAFT Corpus. This approach uses substantially fewer computational resources, including hardware, memory, and time than several alternative approaches. Conclusions Machine translation is a promising avenue for fully machine-learning-based concept recognition that achieves state-of-the-art results on the CRAFT Corpus, evaluated via a direct comparison to previous results from the 2019 CRAFT Shared Task. Experiments illuminating the reasons for the surprisingly good performance of sequence-to-sequence methods targeting ontology identifiers suggest that further progress may be possible by mapping to alternative target concept representations.

However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (22 nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labelled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for 89 clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method. DisCVR detected human viruses with high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (100%), and was able to detect mixed infections. Moreover, it produced results comparable to those in a published metagenomic analysis of 177 blood samples from patients in Nigeria. DisCVR has been designed as a user-friendly tool for detecting human viruses from HTS data using computers with limited RAM and processing power, and includes a graphical user interface to help users interpret and validate the output.

As vaccine trial data is released to the public, many people look to the future with hope ;with good vaccine uptake there is the opportunity to reduce the spread of infectious pandemics. Initial vaccine trials were completed with adults and were expanded to include paediatric populations delaying paediatric COVID-19 vaccine initiatives. The exclusion of children from initial vaccine trials during a pandemic is not morally justifiable and fosters distrust with the pharmaceutical and medical industries and inevitably postpones vaccinating children when there is a surplus of available vaccines. The delayed vaccination of children under twelve may have significant public health and economic consequences as there may be ongoing viral transmission in the context of reopening strategies. The safety and efficacy of these candidate vaccines in children should be assessed expeditiously so that distribution to vulnerable paediatric populations is not impacted.

Although incapable of classical lysogeny, these viruses demonstrate unexplained long-term persistence in the human gut microbiome, dominating the virome in some individuals. Here we demonstrate that rapid phase variation of alternate capsular polysaccharides plays an important role in dynamic equilibrium between phage sensitivity and resistance in B. intestinalis cultures, allowing phage and bacteria to multiply in parallel. The data also suggests the role of concomitant phage persistence mechanisms associated with delayed lysis of infected cells, such as carrier state infection. From an ecological and evolutionary standpoint this type of phage-host interaction is consistent with the Piggyback-the-Winner model, which suggests a preference towards lysogenic or other “benign” forms of phage infection when the host is stably present at high abundance.

Methods An online survey conducted among ≥18 years individuals residing in Panama using social media recruitment, from August 8-September 12, 2020, at the end of strict lockdown measures. Questions included demographics, virtual sex (sexting [sharing/receiving nude/semi-nude photos/video] and cybersex [sexual acts in front of a camera] three months before and during COVID-19-measures. Logistic regression was used to identify associations with increased use of virtual sex. Results Overall, 960 individuals participated;526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (31.1%) as cis-men, and 68 (7.1%) as non-binary/another gender;median age was 28y (IQR:23-37y). Before COVID-19-measures, 44.1% (369/837) reported sexting, 20.4% (172/842) cybersex, 46.4% (392/485) virtual sex.

The analysis is conducted to make a comparison of the financial crime and regulatory compliance patterns before and after the Covid-19 pandemic occurred. Design/methodology/approach: This paper contextualises the impact of Covid-19 on financial crime and regulatory compliance. Moreover, this paper explores different ways of conceptualising the Covid-19 impacts in terms of financial crimes and regulatory compliance patterns based on the surveys by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte. Findings: The Covid-19 pandemic has brought both challenges and opportunities to financial crime and regulatory compliance. In the aspects of financial crime patterns, this study found a reduction in physical crime whilst on the other hand increment in cybercrime. Nevertheless, this study discovered regulatory compliance not at a satisfactory stage even before the Covid-19 pandemic, let alone during the pandemic. Practical implications: This study implies that the financial institutions must work together to combat the risks of financial crimes, not only amongst the institutions but also with the regulators. Digitalisation and robust risk management need to be improved at a massive level to beat the criminals’ high fintech skills and systems. The initiatives of fund packages from the governments to assist the companies especially the small firms need to be fully used by the companies to improve regulatory compliance. Originality/value: Whilst some studies discussed the impact of Covid-19 on the economy, there are still scarce resources on the comparative analysis on the financial crime and regulatory compliance, not to mention the before and after effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In this unprecedented and turbulent situation, the need to understand and articulate the effectiveness and impact of collaborative efforts is paramount. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential nexus between nonprofit impact measurement and collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews key aspects of the NFP impact measurement and collaboration literature and discusses the potential nexus between these two concepts. NFP collaboration refers to the collaborative arrangements that involve NFPs with other NFPs and/or businesses and government. Findings: Based on a literature review, this paper argues that NFPs must acknowledge the significance of impact measurement when engaging in collaborative efforts and the mutually reinforcing relationships between the NFP impact measurement and collaboration to make a collective impact. Originality/value: Research on the nexus of NFP impact measurement and collaboration is scant, but it is urgently needed due to the COVID-19 crisis. This paper is timely to review the extant knowledge base of NFP impact measurement and collaboration and attempts to draw meaningful connections between the two concepts. The paper also has significant implications for practice as it responds to the calls for more collaboration in the New Zealand NFP sector and will be of interest to NFP leaders, managers, funders and policymakers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Yang, C.",Pacific Accounting Review,2,28

This new life order requires the consciousness of every human being. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess health consciousness and economic consciousness of the risk of being exposed to COVID-19. The hypothesis indicated that the level of economic consciousness was higher than the level of health consciousness during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The research method used was a quantitative method using surveys and it was complemented by direct interviews with respondents. RESULTS: The finding based on the economic level found that people with uncertain income were more concerned with economic consciousness than health consciousness. Besides, the societies with uncertain income, especially non-formal workers, were not so afraid of the coronavirus 19 and they did not care while contracting the virus, due to they have believed that life and death have been determined by God. Other results showed that respondents worked as small traders, medium and large entrepreneurs were also more concerned with economic consciousness rather than health consciousness, it revealed that the societies did not have regular income and they argued that COVID-19 was merely an ordinary virus.

Maximally 10-15% of the N-linked oligosaccharides on neuronal proteins have normal structure when cells are cultured in the presence of 250 micrograms/ml castanospermine; the remaining oligosaccharides are present as immature carbohydrate chains not normally found in these glycoproteins. Although cultures were treated for 2 wk with castanospermine, cells always remained viable and appeared healthy. We have analyzed several biological responses of embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons, with or without added purified populations of Schwann cells, in the presence of castanospermine. We have observed that a normal complement of mature, N- linked sugars are not required for neurite outgrowth, neuron-Schwann cell adhesion, neuron-induced Schwann cell proliferation, or ensheathment of neurites by Schwann cells. Treatment of neuronal cultures with castanospermine increases the propensity of neurites to fasciculate. Extracellular matrix deposition by Schwann cells and myelination of neurons by Schwann cells are greatly diminished in the presence of castanospermine as assayed by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, suggesting that specific N-linked oligosaccharides are required for the expression of these cellular functions.",,J Cell Biol,2,1

The potential for further pandemic surges remain; however it is imperative that elective gynaecological surgery is restored safely, ethically and in a timely manner. The risks of COVID-19 transmission and potential increased surgical morbidity must be weighed up against the patient’s ongoing symptoms and quality of life. Universal screening and testing of patients attending for routine surgery, as well as staff testing and retesting, will be fundamental to reducing the risks to both patients and staff, and avoiding the higher morbidity encountered when operating on asymptomatic infected patients. The aim of this paper is to explore pathways to safely reintroduce elective benign gynaecological surgery and the challenges that will be encountered including patient counselling and informed consent, surgical prioritisation and the screening and testing of patients and staff, as well as the logistical and ethical challenges of reintroducing benign surgery during COVID-19 times.","Odejinmi, F; Clark, TJ; Mallick, R",,2,28

Ever since the first systematic effort by Lancefield to group Streptococcus species by M protein variants, the detection and characterization of Streptococcus by different methods have been an evolving process. The ideal assay for GAS identification not only would provide quick and accurate diagnostic results but also would reveal antibiotic resistance patterns and genotype information, aiding not only in treatment but in epidemiologic assessment as well. The oligonucleotide microarray is a promising new technology which could potentially address this need. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of oligonucleotide resequencing microarrays for identifying GAS and its associated antibiotic resistance markers. We demonstrated an assay platform that combines the use of resequencing DNA microarrays with either random nucleic acid amplification or multiplex PCR for GAS detection. When detecting Streptococcus pyogenes from coded clinical samples, this approach demonstrated an excellent concordance with a more established culture method. To this end, we showed the potential of resequencing microarrays for efficient and accurate detection of GAS and its associated antibiotic resistance markers with the benefit of sequencing information from microarray analysis.","Davignon, Louis; Walter, Elizabeth A; Mueller, Kate M; Barrozo, Christopher P; Stenger, David A; Lin, Baochuan",Journal of clinical microbiology,2,24

However, the mechanism underlying cyclin D1 ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation is not yet clear. We report that cyclin D1 undergoes increased degradation in the cytoplasm during S phase in a variety of cancer cells. This is mediated by phosphorylation at Thr286 through the activity of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade and the F-box protein FBXW8, which is an E3 ligase. The majority of FBXW8 is expressed in the cytoplasm during G1 and S phase. In contrast, cyclin D1 accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and exits into the cytoplasm in S phase. Increased cyclin D1 degradation is linked to association with FBXW8 in the cytoplasm, and enhanced phosphorylation of cyclin D1 through sustained ERK1/2 signaling. Depletion of FBXW8 caused a significant accumulation of cyclin D1, as well as sequestration of CDK1 in the cytoplasm. This resulted in a severe reduction of cell proliferation. These effects could be rescued by constitutive nuclear expression of cyclin D1-T286A. Thus, FBXW8 plays an essential role in cancer cell proliferation through proteolysis of cyclin D1. It may present new opportunities to develop therapies targeting destruction of cyclin D1 or its regulator E3 ligase selectively.","Okabe, Hiroshi; Lee, Sang-Hyun; Phuchareon, Janyaporn; Albertson, Donna G; McCormick, Frank; Tetsu, Osamu",PloS one,2,16

The system's objectives were to monitor for outbreaks caused by Category A biologic agents and evaluate limits in space and time of identified outbreaks. Thirty-two acute-care hospitals were required to report their previous day's unscheduled admissions for 11 syndromes (pneumonia, hemoptysis, respiratory distress, acute neurologic illness, nontraumatic paralysis, sepsis and nontraumatic shock, fever with rash, fever of unknown cause, acute gastrointestinal illness, and possible cutaneous anthrax, and suspected illness clusters). Admissions for pneumonia, gastrointestinal illness, and sepsis were reported most frequently; admissions for fever with rash, possible cutaneous anthrax, and hemoptysis were rare. A method for determining the difference between random and systemic variation was used to identify differences of >/=3 standard deviations for each syndrome from a 6-month moving average. HASS was adapted to meet changing surveillance needs (e.g., surveillance for anthrax, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome). HASS was sensitive enough to reflect annual increases in hospital-admission rates for pneumonia during the influenza season and to confirm an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness. Follow-up of HASS neurologic-admissions reports has led to diagnosis of West Nile virus encephalitis cases. Report validation, syndrome-criteria standardization among hospitals, and expanded use of outbreak-detection algorithms will enhance the system's usefulness.","Dembek, Zygmunt F; Carley, K; Siniscalchi, A; Hadler, J",MMWR supplements,2,1

The complex anatomy of conjoined twins dictates their survival and amenability to separation, making each case different in terms of medical management, surgical planning, and patient outcomes. Thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus twins, joined from the thorax to the pelvis, are one of the rarest orientations recorded in the medical literature, and successful separation of this subset of conjoined twins has not been documented. This report presents a novel case of thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus tetrapus twins who were successfully separated at 10 months of age. The preoperative planning, operative details, and postoperative course are discussed as they relate to the reconstructive effort. METHODS Three-dimensional medical modeling was pursued early in the planning process and was used to estimate the soft-tissue requirements for reconstruction and to design custom tissue expanders. RESULTS The reconstructive effort required postponement until respiratory status was optimized. Even with elaborate preoperative planning, primary closure of the abdomen was limited because of tissue edema and other less predictable patient factors. Delayed closure of the abdominal wall was made possible with negative-pressure wound therapy and secondary flap advancements.

A disease is eliminated if it is controlled sufficiently to prevent an epidemic from occurring in a given geographical area. Control and elimination are achieved locally, but a disease can only be eradicated if it is eliminated everywhere. Eradication is plainly a more demanding goal, but it has two advantages over control. First, the economics of eradication can be very favourable when eradication not only reduces infections but also avoids the need for vaccinations in future. Indeed, when eradication is feasible, it will either pay to control it to a fairly low level or to eradicate it. This suggests that, from an economics perspective, diseases that are eliminated in high-income countries are prime candidates for future eradication efforts. Second, the incentives for countries to participate in an eradication initiative can be strong; indeed they can be even stronger than an international control programme. Moreover, high-income countries typically benefit so much that they will be willing to finance elimination in developing countries. Full financing of an eradication effort by nation-states is not always guaranteed, but it can be facilitated by a variety of means. Hence, from the perspective of economics and international relations, eradication has a number of advantages over control.

Advanced life support of patients injured by chemical or biological warfare agents requires an adequate level of personal protection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the personal protection knowledge of emergency physicians and anesthetists who would be at the frontline of the initial health response to a chemical/biological warfare agent incident. METHODS After institutional review board approval, knowledge of personal protection measures among emergency medicine (n = 28) and anesthetics (n = 47) specialty registrars in the South Thames Region of the United Kingdom was surveyed using a standardized questionnaire. Participants were asked for the recommended level of personal protection if a chemical/biological warfare agent(s) casualty required advanced life support in the designated hospital resuscitation area. RESULTS The best awareness within both groups was regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome, and fair knowledge was found regarding anthrax, plague, Ebola, and smallpox. In both groups, knowledge about personal protection requirements against chemical warfare agents was limited. Knowledge about personal protection measures for biological agents was acceptable, but was limited for chemical warfare agents.

METHODS Eleven children with atopic asthma were followed prospectively and respiratory symptoms were recorded on diary cards. A blood sample and nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) were obtained at baseline and subsequently during an exacerbation. PBMC were immunophenotyped using flow cytometry. NPW samples were examined for the presence of respiratory viruses by RT-PCR. RESULTS A virus was detected in 73% of exacerbations and none at baseline. A drop of NK cells and a marginal increase of monocytes were the only changes of cell count during the exacerbation. A significant downregulation of B7-2 on NK cells and of B7-1 on monocytes was also observed during exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS The above observations are in contrast to in vitro findings showing an upregulation of costimulatory molecules after exposure of blood cells to viruses or allergens.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in huge losses in socio-economy, culture, and human lives for which safe and effective cures are highly demanded. The main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a critical enzyme for viral propagation in host cells and, like TMPRSS2, has been exploited for treatment of the infectious disease. Numerous natural compounds abundant in common fruits have been suggested with anti-coronavirus infection in the previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV. Here we show that screening of these compounds identified tannic acid a potent inhibitor of both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and TMPRSS2.

We have studied the relationships between these two types of particles. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that they are closely related, since both large and small particles reacted equally with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for TGEV proteins. Monensin, a drug that selectively affects the Golgi complex, caused an accumulation of large annular viral particles in perinuclear elements of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. A partial reversion of the monensin blockade was obtained in both the absence and presence of cycloheximide, a drug that prevented the formation of new viral particles. After removal of monensin, the Golgi complex recovered its perinuclear location, and a decrease in the number of perinuclear large viral particles was observed. The release of small dense viral particles into secretory vesicles and the extracellular medium was also observed, as was a partial recovery of infectivity in culture supernatants. Small viral particles started to be seen between the third and the fourth Golgi cisternae of normally infected cells. All of these data strongly indicate that the large annular particles are the immature precursors of the small dense viruses, which are the infectious TGEV virions.

OBJECTIVES To investigate whether skeletonized left internal mammary artery (LIMA) mobilization contributes to the development of severe adhesions, which will affect what type of lung surgery (open or closed procedure) will be required in the future. METHODS Eight patients (mean age 73.9 years) with previous CABG surgery using a LIMA to left anterior descending (LAD) graft underwent left-sided lobectomy for operable non-small cell lung carcinoma. RESULTS The lobectomy by thoracotomy rate was 62.5% (5 patients), generally in patients with tumors in the left upper lobe or in patients post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, while the video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy rate was 37.5% (3 patients). Mean hospital stay was 8.3 days. There was no mortality or major morbidity, apart from six minor complications in four patients (50%) (air leak, atrial fibrillation, atelectasis, pneumonia). CONCLUSIONS Patients with operable non-small cell lung carcinoma following CABG surgery who need left upper lobe resection do not benefit from the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery technique due to significant adhesions between the LIMA to LAD graft and the lung. The method of preserving a small portion of the lung on the LIMA to LAD graft may help during left upper lobe resections. Adhesions in the left pleural space after LIMA mobilization appear to minimally affect left lower lobe video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.","Papiashvili, Michael; Deviri, Ehud; Bar, Ilan; Sasson, Lior",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,2,12

The aforementioned coronavirus affected 188 countries as of 8.10.2020. Despite the continually increasing number of COVID-19 cases reported to CDC, at national level, the percentage of visits to outpatient providers and emergency departments has decreased and mortality rates attributed to COVID-19 have declined compared to the previous weeks, still above the baseline. It is common knowledge that the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped societies and economies around the globe, affecting all aspects of everyday life. Public health systems as a whole have been globally affected since they had to face extraordinary demands over a long period of time, which, in turn, required rapid adjustments in the operating procedures that were already in use, in order to provide high-standard health services, while respecting patients quality of life. Over half of deaths in low-income countries are caused by communicable diseases, maternal causes, conditions arising during pregnancy and childbirth, and nutritional deficiencies. On the contrary, this percentage is less than 7% in high-income countries. Noncommunicable diseases cause 71% of deaths globally, ranging from 37% in low-income countries to 88% in high-income countries. However, in terms of absolute number of deaths, 78% of global NCD deaths occurred in low-and middle-income countries. This partially explains why recent developments in medicine were mostly focused on chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and type 2 diabetes, rather than focusing on infection and inflammation progress. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent burden it placed upon health systems to deal with infectious and non-infectious diseases in a poor environment, can become an opportunity to update the field of medical research and change the governmental policies in place that have been stagnant and/or inefficient and ill-managed. This way, health systems will be equipped with better and faster protocols and best practices in order to manage efficiently any other pandemic that might emerge in the future. In this context, Nuclear Medicine departments should reconsider and update their practices, by altering routines and workflows in order to comply with the new sanitary standards, triaging their appointments, or introducing new diagnostic methods like Tele-Medicine / Tele Nuclear Medicine and Artificial Intelligence applications. This special edition of Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine has as its main purpose to introduce and communicate those new practices and protocols/standard operating procedures, in order for the scientific community, health public institutions, affected individuals and their families to be duly informed.","Chatzipavlidou, Vasiliki",Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,2,1

Time kinetics of T-cell activation by interferon (IFN)-gamma-treated astrocytes from neonatal Lewis rats and by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) from bulk suspensions of thymus or spleen were performed. [3H]Thymidine incorporation of neuritogenic P2- and encephalitogenic myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T-cell lines declined after 48 h in culture with astrocytes. A similar suppressive effect was observed when T cells were cocultured with thymic APCs and astrocytes. This effect disappeared when astrocytes were separated by a transwell system. After 72 h of culture with astrocytes a mean of 17.5 +/- 12.4% T cells exhibited morphological signs of apoptosis. Apoptosis was identified by light microscopy, and confirmed by electron microscopy, by in situ tailing reaction and by agarose gel electrophoresis. Glucocorticosteroids and oestrogen specifically enhanced T-cell apoptosis within 8 h (69.8 +/- 23.1% and 69 +/- 17.1%, respectively) when added after 72 h to the astrocyte system, but not at earlier time points of T-cell activation or when thymic APCs were used. Glucocorticoid-mediated T-cell apoptosis was inhibited by the steroid-receptor antagonist RU 486. Pregnenolone, lipocortin-1, indomethacin and transforming growth factor-beta did not induce apoptosis in this system. The steroid effect was not associated with CD28, IL-2 receptor, or transferrin-receptor expression, which were equally upregulated on T cells activated by astrocytes or thymic APC as shown by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. We conclude that astrocytes as CNS-specific APC may render T cells susceptible for induction of apoptotic cell death. Some steroid hormones can markedly enhance this process in vitro and may augment an additional effect of a systemic corticosteroid response in vivo during recovery from autoimmune encephalomyelitis.","Gold, R; Schmied, M; Tontsch, U; Hartung, H P; Wekerle, H; Toyka, K V; Lassmann, H",Brain : a journal of neurology,2,19

Interestingly, approximately 80 % of JEV-inducible genes identified in this study are also induced by Sindbis virus, indicating activation of common host signalling pathways by these two viruses, despite their diverse life cycles. One of these, the glucocorticoid attenuated response gene 39 (GARG39, also known as IFIT2, ISG54 and MuP54) was characterized further. It was demonstrated that GARG39 protein interacts with microtubules in vitro, co-localizes with beta-tubulin in vivo and is enriched in the mitotic spindle of non-neuronal cells undergoing mitosis. While GARG39 was known for a long time as an inflammation-inducible glucocorticoid attenuated protein, its identification as a microtubule-associated protein in this study suggests a possible role for this protein in cell proliferation, virion assembly/transport and microtubule dynamics.","Saha, Sougata; Sugumar, Parthsarathy; Bhandari, Prakash; Rangarajan, Pundi N",The Journal of general virology,2,1

The aim of the present study was to explore the ability of preclinical imaging modalities to detect experimental liver metastases. Nine male Wag/Rij rats underwent a laparotomy with intraportal injection of CC531 tumor cells. On days 7, 10, and 14 after tumor induction, sequential positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired of each rat. At each time point, three rats were euthanized and the metastases in the liver were documented histologically. Topographically, the liver was divided into eight segments and the image findings were compared on a segment-by-segment basis with the histopathologic findings. Sixty-four liver segments were analyzed, 20 of which contained tumor deposits. The overall sensitivity of PET, CT, and MRI was 30%, 25%, and 20%, respectively. For the detection of tumors with a histologic diameter exceeding 1 mm (n = 8), the sensitivity of PET, CT, and MRI was 63%, 38%, and 38%, respectively. The overall specificity of PET, CT, and MRI was 98%, 100%, and 93%, respectively.

However, candidate RNA replicons (delta P1 beta gal and delta P1Luc), representing the sequence of human rhinovirus 14 virus (HRV-14) with reporter protein sequences (beta-galactosidase or luciferase, respectively) replacing most of the P1 capsid-coding region, failed to replicate in transfected H1-HeLa cells despite efficient primary cleavage of the polyprotein. To determine which P1 sequences might be required for RNA replication, HRV-14 mutants in which segments of the P1 region were removed to frame from the genome were constructed. Mutants with deletions involving the 5'proximal 1,489 nucleotides of the P1 region replicated efficiently, while those with deletions involving the 3' 1,079 nucleotides did not. Reintroduction of the 3' P1 sequence into the nonreplicating delta P1Luc construct resulted in a new candidate replicon, delta P1Luc/VP3, which replicated well and expressed luciferase efficiently. Capsid proteins provided in trans by helper virus failed to rescue the nonreplicating delta P1Luc genome but were able to package the larger-than-genome-length delta P1Luc/VP3 replicon. Thus, a 3'-distal P1 capsid-coding sequence has a previously unrecognized cis-active function related to replication of HRV-14 RNA.","McKnight, K L; Lemon, S M",Journal of virology,2,16

In the BRV-diarrheal calves, a positive correlation was found between the VN antibody titers and age of the onset of diarrhea. There were negative correlations between the VN antibody titers and duration of the diarrhea, VN antibody titers and cumulative diarrhea scores, and the VN antibody titers and duration of virus shedding.

We investigated the intracellular localization of the multifunctional nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) in mammalian cells infected with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE), an important, naturally emerging zoonotic alphavirus. VEE nsP2 localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of mammalian cells in the context of infection and also when expressed alone. Through the analysis of a series of enhanced green fluorescent protein fusions, a segment of nsP2 that completely localizes to the nucleus of mammalian cells was identified. Within this region, mutation of the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) PGKMV diminished, but did not obliterate, the ability of the protein to localize to the nucleus, suggesting that this sequence contributes to the nuclear localization of VEE nsP2. Furthermore, VEE nsP2 specifically interacted with the nuclear import protein karyopherin-alpha1 but not with karyopherin-alpha2, -3, or -4, suggesting that karyopherin-alpha1 transports nsP2 to the nucleus during infection. Additionally, a novel nuclear export signal (NES) was identified, which included residues L526 and L528 of VEE nsP2. Leptomycin B treatment resulted in nuclear accumulation of nsP2, demonstrating that nuclear export of nsP2 is mediated via the CRM1 nuclear export pathway. Disruption of either the NLS or the NES in nsP2 compromised essential viral functions. Taken together, these results establish the bidirectional transport of nsP2 across the nuclear membrane, suggesting that a critical function of nsP2 during infection involves its shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.","Montgomery, Stephanie A; Johnston, Robert E",Journal of virology,2,23

However, the precise mechanism of the RNA encapsidation process in picornaviruses remains unclear. Here we report the first identification of an RNA element critical for encapsidation in picornaviruses. The 5' end of the genome of Aichi virus, a member of the family Picornaviridae, folds into three stem-loop structures (SL-A, SL-B, and SL-C, from the most 5' end). In the previous study, we constructed a mutant, termed mut6, by exchanging the seven-nucleotide stretches of the middle part of the stem in SL-A with each other to maintain the base pairings of the stem. mut6 exhibited efficient RNA replication and translation but formed no plaques. The present study showed that in cells transfected with mut6 RNA, empty capsids were accumulated, but few virions containing RNA were formed. This means that mut6 has a severe defect in RNA encapsidation. Site-directed mutational analysis indicated that as the mutated region was narrowed, the encapsidation was improved. As a result, the mutation of the 7 bp of the middle part of the stem in SL-A was required for abolishing the plaque-forming ability. Thus, the 5'-end sequence of the Aichi virus genome was shown to play an important role in encapsidation.","Sasaki, Jun; Taniguchi, Koki",Journal of virology,2,30

Genetic complementation analyses suggest that the majority of the gene 1 products are required for viral RNA synthesis. However, there is no physical evidence supporting the association of any of these products with viral RNA synthesis. We have now performed immunofluorescent-staining studies with four polyclonal antisera to localize various MHV-A59 gene 1 products in virus-infected cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that these antisera detected proteins representing the two papain-like proteases and the 3C-like protease encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1a, the putative polymerase (p100) and a p35 encoded by ORF 1b, and their precursors. De novo-synthesized viral RNA was labeled with bromouridine triphosphate in lysolecithin-permeabilized MHV-infected cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that all of the viral proteins detected by these antisera colocalized with newly synthesized viral RNA in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region of infected cells. Several cysteine and serine protease inhibitors, i.e., E64d, leupeptin, and zinc chloride, inhibited viral RNA synthesis without affecting the localization of viral proteins, suggesting that the processing of the MHV gene 1 polyprotein is tightly associated with viral RNA synthesis. Dual labeling with antibodies specific for cytoplasmic membrane structures showed that MHV gene 1 products and RNA colocalized with the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells. However, in murine 17CL-1 cells, the viral proteins and viral RNA did not colocalize with the Golgi apparatus but, instead, partially colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results provide clear physical evidence that several MHV gene 1 products, including the proteases and the polymerase, are associated with the viral RNA replication-transcription machinery, which may localize to different membrane structures in different cell lines.","Shi, S T; Schiller, J J; Kanjanahaluethai, A; Baker, S C; Oh, J W; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,2,1

IL-10 has also been shown to enhance antitumor CD8+ T-cell responses in tumor models although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we used a series of genetic mouse models and the mouse plasmacytoma J558 model to investigate this issue. J558 tumors grew significantly faster in IL-10-/- mice than in wild type (WT) mice, but similarly in IL-10 -/- Rag2 -/- and Rag2 -/- mice. Tumors from IL-10 -/- mice contained fewer IFN-γ-producing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells than tumors from WT mice. Strikingly, depletion of total CD4+ T cells, but not CD25+ cells, resulted in tumor eradication in IL-10 -/- mice. Adoptive transfer studies revealed that CD4+ T cells from IL-10 -/- mice exhibited more potent suppression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor rejection than their WT counterparts, and IL-10-deficient tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells expressed higher levels of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitory molecules. Although IL-10-deficient CD8+ T cells are not defective in activation and initial rejection of tumors, adoptive transfer studies using IL-10-deficient P1CTL transgenic T cells that recognize the tumor rejection antigen P1A reveal that IL-10 is required for long-term persistence of CTLs and control of tumor growth. Thus, we have found that IL-10 enhances antitumor CTL responses by inhibiting highly suppressive CD4+ T cells and promoting CTL persistence.

We have developed novel TB therapeutic vaccines, HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 + IL-12 DNA vaccine (HSP65-vaccine), granulysin vaccine and killer specific secretory protein of 37kDa (Ksp37) vaccine. METHODS AND RESULTS HSP65 vaccine showed strong therapeutic effect against both MDR-TB and XDR-TB in mice. Intradermal immunization of HSP65-vaccine showed stronger therapeutic effect against TB than intramuscular or subcutaneous immunization. Furthermore, the synergistic therapeutic effect was observed when the vaccine was administrated in combination with Isoniazid (INH), which is a first line drug for chemotherapy. The combination of types of vaccines (HSP65- and granulysin- vaccines) also showed synergistic therapeutic effect. In the monkey model, granulysin-vaccine prolonged the survival period after the infection of TB and long-term survival was observed in vaccine-treated group. We examined the potential of two kinds of novel DNA vaccines (Ksp37-vaccine and granulysin-vaccine). Both vaccines augmented in vivo differentiation of CTL against TB. We measured the amount of Ksp37 protein in human serum and revealed that the level of Ksp37 protein of patients with tuberculosis was lower than that of healthy volunteers. Therefore, we established Ksp37 transgenic mice as well as granulysin transgenic mice to elucidate the function of those proteins. Both transgenic mice were resistant to TB infection. CONCLUSION These data indicate the potential of combinational therapy; the combination of two DNA vaccines or combination of DNA vaccine with antibiotic drug. Thus, it will provide a novel strategy for the treatment of MDR-TB.","Kita, Yoko; Hashimoto, Satomi; Nakajima, Toshihiro; Nakatani, Hitoshi; Nishimatsu, Shiho; Nishida, Yasuko; Kanamaru, Noriko; Kaneda, Yasuhumi; Takamori, Yasushi; McMurray, David; Tan, Esterlina V; Cang, Marjorie L; Saunderson, Paul; Dela Cruz, E C; Okada, Masaji",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2,8

From 10 institutes, we sampled 12 groups of euthymic rats at ages of 1 1/2-2 months and 1/2 year. We analyzed weight of body, spleen and thymus; antibody response and delayed-type hypersensitivity response to ovalbumin immunization; and (immuno)histopathology of spleen, lymph nodes, and lymphoid tissue along the gastrointestinal tract. In the spleen morphometric analysis was done of the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheath (using the antibody R73 recognizing the alpha beta-T-cell receptor) and of the red pulp (using the antibody ED2 recognizing red pulp macrophages). For almost all parameters tested, statistically significant differences between the groups (origin of the animals) were observed. A cluster analysis on the basis of body weight, spleen weight, and morphometric data of spleen did not yield clusters with a different composition among animals from individual groups. Based on the antibody response to ovalbumin, clustering revealed groups of ""fast-and-high"", ""slow-and-low"", and ""intermediate"" responders. The various groups differed in location within these clusters, i.e. the speed and extent of the immune response depends on the background euthymic strain. Considering the microbiological status assessed by serology, a variation was found both in post-infection state at entrance in the study, and in primo-infection associated with a rise in antibody concentrations during the study. These states showed no negative effect on anti-ovalbumin reactivity. Rather, the response in primo-infection to Rat Corona Virus, Sendai Virus, and Pneumonia Virus of Mice was the highest in animals clustered as ""fast-and high"" responders to ovalbumin.","Schuurman, H J; Bell, E B; Gärtner, K; Hedrich, H J; Hansen, A K; Kruijt, B C; de Vrey, P; Leyten, R; Maeder, S J; Moutier, R",Journal of experimental animal science,2,1

The criteria for cold/flu definition, however, are variable within and between individuals and illness is not prerequisite for a viral upper respiratory tract infection. These factors bias estimates of the incidence and prevalence of viral upper respiratory tract infections and their complications. Here we review new methodologies that can be adapted for use in future studies to refine those estimates. RECENT FINDINGS We present a theoretical basis for standardized assignment of cold/flu episodes using a minimal algorithm template that operates on a structured set of symptoms/signs. We emphasize the greater accuracy of information derived from longitudinal studies that incorporate identification algorithms and assay of nasal secretions for causal virus by polymerase chain reaction and for proinflammatory chemicals to confirm nasal inflammation. SUMMARY The methodologies and sampling strategies that we describe hold promise for better characterizing the incidence of complications for symptomatic and asymptomatic expressions of a viral upper respiratory tract infection caused by specific viruses. These data can then be used to estimate the efficacy and efficiency in a specified target population of prophylactic or intercurrent treatments to prevent the complications.","Doyle, William J; Alper, Cuneyt M",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,2,1

In the past few years, much work has been done to understand the catalytic mechanism of this target protein and to design its selective inhibitors. The protein exists as a dimer/monomer mixture in solution and the dimer was confirmed to be the active species for the enzyme reaction. Quantitative dissociation constants have been reported for the dimer by using analytic ultracentrifuge, gel filtration and enzyme assays. Though the enzyme is a cysteine protease with a chymotrypsin fold, SARS 3C-like proteinase follows the general base catalytic mechanism similar to chymotrypsin. As the enzyme can cut eleven different sites on the viral polyprotein, the substrate specificity has been studied by synthesized peptides corresponding or similar to the cleavage sites on the polyprotein. Predictive model was built for substrate structure and activity relationships and can be applied in inhibitor design. Due to the lack of potential drugs for the treatment of SARS, the discovery of inhibitors against SARS 3C-like proteinase, which can potentially be optimized as drugs appears to be highly desirable. Various groups have been working on inhibitor discovery by virtual screening, compound library screening, modification of existing compounds or natural products. High-throughput in vitro assays, auto-cleavage assays and viral replication assays have been developed for inhibition activity tests. Inhibitors with IC50 values as low as 60 nM have been reported.","Lai, Luhua; Han, Xiaofeng; Chen, Hao; Wei, Ping; Huang, Changkang; Liu, Shiyong; Fan, Keqiang; Zhou, Lu; Liu, Zhenming; Pei, Jianfeng; Liu, Ying",Current pharmaceutical design,2,26

This study aims to investigate the laparoscopic strategy for recurrent inguinal hernia repair. Laparoscopic technique was retrospectively applied to 330 patients with 352 recurrent inguinal hernias in the past 14 years. The surgical strategies were further evaluated. There were 22 cases with bilateral recurrent hernias, whereas the rest 308 cases with unilateral disorders. Patients were further categorized by previous repair approaches as high ligation, sclerotherapy, conventional suture repair, Lichtenstein repair, plug and patch repair, and preperitoneal repair. All cases were successfully repaired by laparoscopic approaches including transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) (288 cases), totally extraperitoneal (50 cases), and intraperitoneal onlay mesh (14 cases). The median operation duration was 39.5 ± 13.4 minutes. The average Visual Analog Scales score on postoperative day 1 was 2.4 ± 1.1. The median follow-up time was 36 (14-61) months. There was one case of recurrence during the follow-ups. One severe complication, i.e., bowel injury, was observed and cured, whereas other complications were as follows: 22 seroma, 8 urinary retention, 3 transient paresthesia, and 1 ileus. Laparoscopic procedures for recurrence inguinal hernia are safe and applicable. A surgeon can choose to reinforce the myopectineal orifice or only fix the hernia defect accordingly. The strategy of choosing TAPP and/or totally extraperitoneal depends on the type of previous repair, the exact anatomical position of the previous implanted mesh, and more importantly, the surgeon's experience. Moreover, the intraperitoneal onlay mesh technique can be regarded as a backup option for TAPP in certain cases.","Sun, Jing; Wang, Wenrui; Li, Jianwen; Yue, Fei; Feng, Bo; Wang, Ji; Wang, Minggang",The American surgeon,2,32

Clinical findings consisted of unilateral or bilateral ear droop, epiphora, head tilt, and recumbency in severely affected calves. Postmortem examination revealed unilateral or bilateral fibrinosuppurative to caseous exudate in the tympanic bullae. Histologically, a marked fibrinosuppurative to caseous exudate filled the tympanic air spaces. The partially ulcerated tympanic mucosa was markedly thickened with mononuclear cell infiltration and proliferation of fibrous connective tissue. Bone remodeling and periosteal hyperostosis were present in some osseous septa.

Bilateral myringotomy and tube (BMT) placement is performed due to persistent effusion with associated symptoms such as decreased hearing. With the COVID-19 pandemic and mandatory stay at home orders (MSHO), children were quarantined at home and many remained home after MSHO. We reviewed the prevalence of middle ear effusion (MEE) at the time of BMT during similar time periods in the year before, during and after MSHO in this pandemic year. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective summary of BMT cases at a single tertiary children's hospital. METHODS: All children <18 years who underwent BMT between March 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020 and between March 1, 2019 and July 1, 2019 were included. Statistical analysis included chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: A total of 778 cases were reviewed; 551 (71%) were performed pre-pandemic and 227 (29%) during onset of pandemic (N = 778). There were no significant differences in gender, age, and BMI between groups, but significantly fewer Caucasians (58% vs. 45%, p < 0.05) and more Hispanics (20% vs. 33%, p < 0.05) during-COVID. The prevalence of intraoperative effusion during-COVID was significantly lower compared to pre-COVID (65% vs. 83%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pandemic and COVID-19 MSHO were associated with significantly lower intraoperative OME prevalence. Further research may elucidate the impact of face covering, social distancing, and virtual schooling on the incidence of pediatric ROM, OME, and ENT symptoms.","Nguyen, Dang-Khoa; Jueng, Jeremy; Maul, Timothy M; Wei, Julie L",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,2,16

Inappropriate antibiotic use for pharyngitis contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. However, a small proportion of sore throats caused by group A streptococcal (GAS) infection may benefit from the provision of antibiotics. Establishing the cause of infection is therefore an important step in effective antibiotic stewardship. Point-of-care (POC) tests, where results are available within minutes, can distinguish between viral and GAS pharyngitis and can therefore guide treatment in primary healthcare settings such as community pharmacies, which are often the first point of contact with the healthcare system. In this opinion article, the evidence for the use of POC testing in the community pharmacy has been discussed. Evidence suggests that pharmacy POC testing can promote appropriate antibiotic use and reduce the need for general practitioner consultations. Challenges to implementation include cost, training and 'who prescribes', with country and regional differences presenting a particular issue. Despite these challenges, POC testing for pharyngitis has become widely available in pharmacies in some countries and may represent a strategy to contain antibiotic resistance and contribute to antimicrobial stewardship.","Essack, Sabiha; Bell, John; Burgoyne, Douglas; Tongrod, Wirat; Duerden, Martin; Sessa, Aurelio; Altiner, Attila; Shephard, Adrian",,2,16

This infection can cause mild to very severe respiratory and systemic illness mainly related with a cytokine storm. The epidemiology of COVID-19 is under continuous evolution, and studies are ongoing aiming at identifying the possible factors facilitating the diffusion of this infection. It is documented that air pollution and smoking are a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality globally, and can increase the risk of many diseases, including respiratory diseases. Overall, a linear relationship between exposure to atmospheric pollutants and diffusion of the Sars-Cov2 virus seems to exist. However, this correlation, cannot be regarded as a cause-effect relationship. The available data show that air pollution is responsible for inflammation and hyper-activation of innate immunity that are associated with the worst outcomes of covid-19 but do not allow to conclude that atmospheric particulate is responsible for increased contagion. As to smoking, nicotine activation of nicotinic receptors leads to enhanced protease activation, apoptosis and inflammatory signaling through the same pathways (Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) used by the virus increasing the inflammatory/destructive action of the virus itself. The increase in non-communicable diseases and of chronic inflammatory diseases is in line with environmental pollution, related climate changes, and with an augmented susceptibility to infectious diseases with increased contagiousness and morbidity. Restrictive measures to limit environmental pollution are needed worldwide as this represents a threat for human health.","Gallo, Manuela; Street, Maria E; Guerra, Fabiola; Fanos, Vassilios; Marcialis, Maria Antonietta",Acta Biomed,2,16

An existing ranking of these visual channels is based on how accurately participants could report the ratio between two depicted values. There is an assumption that this ranking should hold for different tasks and for different numbers of marks. However, there is little existing work testing assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict more than two values. We asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory. With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we observed how the relevant rank positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or 8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new ranking was highly inconsistent for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel choice far more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the series (e.g. more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g. small values are systematically overestimated). Recall was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with established limits on visual memory. These results show that we must move beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for ranking the quality of a visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs), timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of values (from a handful, to thousands).","McColeman, Caitlyn M.; Yang, Fumeng; Franconeri, Steven; Brady, Timothy F.",,2,33

The majority of residents have chronic illnesses and conditions and are vulnerable to infections and many share rooms and have congregate meals. There was evidence of inadequate registered nurse (RN) staffing levels and infection control procedures in many nursing homes prior to the outbreak of the virus. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of nurse staffing in California nursing homes and compare homes with and without COVID-19 residents. Study data were from both the California and Los Angeles Departments of Public Health and as well as news organizations on nursing homes reporting COVID-19 infections between March and May 4, 2020. Results indicate that nursing homes with total RN staffing levels under the recommended minimum standard (0.75 hours per resident day) had a two times greater probability of having COVID-19 resident infections. Nursing homes with lower Medicare five-star ratings on total nurse and RN staffing levels (adjusted for acuity), higher total health deficiencies, and more beds had a higher probability of having COVID-19 residents. Nursing homes with low RN and total staffing levels appear to leave residents vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. Establishing minimum staffing standards at the federal and state levels could prevent this in the future.","Harrington, Charlene; Ross, Leslie; Chapman, Susan; Halifax, Elizabeth; Spurlock, Bruce; Bakerjian, Debra",Policy Polit Nurs Pract,2,1

We analysed morbidity and mortality of viral pneumonia and evaluated the association between medical conditions, medication, vaccination and outcome specifically in patients with CHD requiring hospitalisation for viral pneumonia. METHODS: Based on data from one of Germany's largest health insurers, all cases of viral pneumonia requiring hospital admission (2005-2018) were studied. Mortality, and composites of death, transplantation, mechanical circulatory support, ventilation or extracorporeal lung support served as endpoints. RESULTS: Overall, 26 262 viral pneumonia cases occurred in 24 980 patients. Of these, 1180 cases occurred in patients with CHD. Compared with patients without CHD, mortality rate was elevated in patients with CHD. As a group, patients with CHD aged 20-59 years even exceeded mortality rates in patients without CHD aged >60 years. No mortality was observed in patients with CHD with simple defects <60 years of age without associated cardiovascular risk factors. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, age, CHD complexity, chromosomal anomalies, cardiac medication, use of immunosuppressants and absence of vaccination for influenza emerged as risk factors of adverse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We present timely data on morbidity and mortality of severe viral pneumonia requiring hospital admission in patients with CHD. Need for mechanical ventilation and risk of death in CHD increase early in life, reaching a level equivalent to non-CHD individuals >60 years of age. Our data suggest that except for patients with isolated simple defects, patients with CHD should be considered higher-risk individuals when faced with severe viral pneumonia.","Diller, Gerhard-Paul; Enders, Dominic; Lammers, Astrid E; Orwat, Stefan; Schmidt, Renate; Radke, Robert M; Gerss, Joachim; De Torres Alba, Fernando; Kaleschke, Gerrit; Bauer, Ulrike M; Marschall, Ursula; Baumgartner, Helmut",Heart,2,6

In our study, we reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on a community hospital serving an urban region, comparing the sociodemographic distribution of ICU admissions before and during the pandemic. We executed a time-sensitive analysis to see if COVID-19 ICU admissions reflect the regional sociodemographic populations and ICU admission trends before the pandemic. Sociodemographic variables included sex, race, ethnicity, and age of adult patients (ages 18 years and older) admitted to the hospital's medical and cardiac ICUs, which were converted to COVID-19 ICUs. The time period selected was 18 months, which was then dichotomized into pre-COVID-19 admissions (December 1, 2018 to March 13, 2020) and COVID-19 ICU admissions (March 14 to May 31, 2020). Variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon tests when appropriate. During the 18-month period, 1,861 patients were admitted to the aforementioned ICUs. The mean age of the patients was 62.75 (SD 15.57), with the majority of these patients being male (52.23%), White (64.43%), and non-Hispanic/Latinx (95.75%). Differences were found in racial and ethnic distribution comparing pre-COVID-19 admissions to COVID-19 admissions. Compared with pre-COVID-19 ICU admissions, we found an increase in African American versus White admissions (P = .01) and an increase in Hispanic/Latinx versus non-Hispanic/Latinx admissions (P < .01), during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first 3 months of admissions to COVID-19 ICUs, the number of admissions among Hispanic/Latinx and African American patients increased while the number of admissions among non-Hispanic/Latinx and White patient decreased, compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. These findings support development of strategies to enhance allocation of resources to bolster novel, equitable strategies to mitigate the incidence of COVID-19 in urban populations.","Galiatsatos, Panagis; Page, Kathleen R; Chatterjee, Souvik; Maygers, Joyce; Sarker, Sauradeep; Jones, Vanya; Tolson, Tina; Hill-Briggs, Felicia; Chen, Edward S; Golden, Sherita H",Health Secur,2,24

In this study, we evaluated the negative predictive value (NPV) of a home-based 7-day infection control strategy. METHODS: HCWs advised by their infection control or occupational health officer to self-isolate due to a high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure were enrolled between May and October 2020. The strategy consisted of symptom-triggered nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing from day 0 to day 7 after exposure and standardized home-based nasopharyngeal swab and saliva testing on day 7. The NPV of this strategy was calculated for (1) clinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis from day 8-14 after exposure, and for (2) asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detected by standardized nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens collected at days 9, 10, and 14 after exposure. Interim results are reported in the context of a second wave threatening this essential workforce. RESULTS: Among 30 HCWs enrolled, the mean age was 31 years (SD, ±9), and 24 (80%) were female. Moreover, 3 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by day 14 after exposure (secondary attack rate, 10.0%), and all cases were detected using the 7-day infection control strategy: the NPV for subsequent clinical COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection by day 14 was 100.0% (95% CI, 93.1%-100.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Among HCWs with high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2, a home-based 7-day infection control strategy may have a high NPV for subsequent COVID-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 detection. Ongoing data collection and data sharing are needed to improve the precision of the estimated NPV, and here we report interim results to inform infection control strategies in light of a second wave threatening this essential workforce.","Benea, Carla; Rendon, Laura; Papenburg, Jesse; Frenette, Charles; Imacoudene, Ahmed; McDonald, Emily G; Nguyen, Quoc D; Rajda, Ewa; Tran, Estelle; Vameghestahbanati, Motahareh; Benedetti, Andrea; Behr, Marcel A; Smith, Benjamin M",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,2,2

METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, TRIP, LILACS, and CENTRAL Cochrane) were searched up to Jan 2021. Clinical trials that compared the quality of root canal filling of endodontically treated primary teeth using lentulospiral with other instruments were included. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Two outcomes were considered: inadequate root canal filling (under or overfilling) and presence of voids. Conventional meta-analyses were performed using a fixed-effects model. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan5.3 at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Of the 68 potentially relevant studies, eight were selected for full-text analysis, and three were included in the systematic review. The use of syringes resulted in a lower risk of presence of voids in the root canal filling compared to the use of lentulospiral (RR: 0.62 95% CI 0.45; 0.85). However, there was no difference between lentulospiral and bi-directional spiral (RR:1.17 95% CI: 0.90; 1.51). There was no significant difference between lentulospiral and syringes (RR: 1.37 95% CI 1.00; 1.87) considering the length of the root canal filling. The use of bi-directional spiral had a higher risk of inadequate root canal filling compared to the use of lentulospiral (RR: 1.75 95% CI: 1.12; 2.74). Two studies were at ""high"", and one study at ""unclear"" risk of bias in the key domains. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient scientific evidence showing the superiority of using lentulospiral for the root canal filling in endodontically treated primary teeth.

Our results showed significant differences in the variables of risk perception, self-efficacy, and measures of belongingness among older adolescents who did or did not experience COVID-19 symptoms. In this period, adolescents experienced unprecedented disruptions in their daily lives, leading them to isolation and loneliness.

These mortality figures, alongside differential treatment of residents and staff during the pandemic, are conceptualized as a form of structural abuse. Arguments are made for the inclusion of structural abuse as a separate category of elder abuse.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is predominantly conceptual but it also draws on available secondary data, such as mortality statistics, media reports and developing research.FindingsThe lack of appropriate personal protective equipment, paucity of guidance and high mortality rate among care home staff and residents during the pandemic is indicative of social discourses that, when underpinned by ageism, reflect structural elder abuse.Research limitations/implicationsThe research is limited by its focus on a specific time period and its recency. It is also limited in not being based on primary empirical research but it remains exploratory and conceptual and provides a base for ongoing research in this area.Social implicationsIf structural elder abuse was to be included in classifications, it demands a rethink of social and health-care services and the policies and practices associated with them and reinforces the government message that safeguarding is everyone’s business.Originality/valueResearch concerning the effects and impact of COVID-19 are still in their early stages. However, the central element of originality in the paper concerns the linking of practices, policies and underlying social assumptions and structural, or societally ingrained, elder abuse.","Parker, Jonathan",The Journal of Adult Protection,2,9

We investigated public perceptions of the UK government's COVID-19 response, focusing on the relationship between trust and perceived transparency, during the first wave (April 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Anonymous survey data were collected (2020-04-06 to 2020-04-22) from 9,322 respondents, aged 20+ using an online questionnaire shared primarily through Facebook. We took an embedded-mixed-methods approach to data analysis. Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Binomial & multinomial logistic regression were used to detect associations between demographic characteristics and perceptions or opinions of the UK government's response to COVID-19. Structural topic modelling (STM), qualitative thematic coding of sub-sets of responses were then used to perform a thematic analysis of topics that were of interest to key demographic groups. RESULTS: Most respondents (95.1%) supported government enforcement of behaviour change. While 52.1% of respondents thought the government was making good decisions, differences were apparent across demographic groups, for example respondents from Scotland had lower odds of responding positively than respondents in London. Higher educational levels saw decreasing odds of having a positive opinion of the government response and decreasing household income associated with decreasing positive opinion. Of respondents who thought the government was not making good decisions 60% believed the economy was being prioritised over people and their health. Positive views on government decision-making were associated with positive views on government transparency about the COVID-19 response. Qualitative analysis about perceptions of government transparency highlighted five key themes: (1) the justification of opacity due to the condition of crisis, (2) generalised mistrust of politics, (3) concerns about the role of scientific evidence, (4) quality of government communication and (5) questions about political decision-making processes. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that trust is not homogenous across communities, and that generalised mistrust, concerns about the transparent use and communication of evidence and insights into decision-making processes can affect perceptions of the government's pandemic response. We recommend targeted community engagement, tailored to the experiences of different groups and a new focus on accountability and openness around how decisions are made in the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic.","Enria, Luisa; Waterlow, Naomi; Rogers, Nina Trivedy; Brindle, Hannah; Lal, Sham; Eggo, Rosalind M; Lees, Shelley; Roberts, Chrissy H",PLoS One,2,8

As it is an operator-dependent modality, the operator is required to be skilled in obtaining and interpreting images. Physicians who are not trained in POCUS attend courses to acquire the basics in this field. The effectiveness of such short POCUS courses on daily POCUS utilization is unknown. We sought to measure the change in POCUS utilization after practicing physicians attended short POCUS courses. METHODS: A 13-statements questionnaire was sent to physicians who attended POCUS courses conducted at the Soroka University Medical Center between the years 2014-2018. Our primary objective was to compare pre-course and post-course POCUS utilization. Secondary objectives included understanding the course graduates' perceived effect of POCUS on diagnosis, the frequency of ultrasound utilization and time to effective therapy. RESULTS: 212 residents and specialists received the questionnaire between 2014-2018; 116 responded (response rate of 54.7%). 72 (62.1%) participants were male, 64 (55.2%) were residents, 49 (42.3%) were specialists, 3 (2.5%) participants did not state their career status. 90 (77.6%) participants declared moderate use or multiple ultrasound use six months to four years from the POCUS course, compared to a rate of 'no use at all' and 'minimal use of 84.9% before the course. 98 participants [84.4% CI 77.8%, 91.0%] agree and strongly agree that a short POCUS course may improve diagnostic skills and 76.7% [CI 69.0%, 84.3%] agree and strongly agree that the POCUS course may shorten time to diagnosis and reduce morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Our short POCUS course significantly increases bedside ultrasound utilization by physicians from different fields even 4 years from course completion. Course graduates strongly agreed that incorporating POCUS into their clinical practice improves patient care. Such courses should be offered to residents and senior physicians to close the existing gap in POCUS knowledge among practicing physicians.","Tuvali, Ortal; Sadeh, Re039; em,; Kobal, Sergio; Yarza, Shaked; Golan, Yael; Fuchs, Lior",PLoS One,2,24

They are classified in different families according to structural similarities. Neutral mAPs catalyze the cleavage of neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of proteins or peptide substrates; they need one or two metallic cofactors in their active site. Information about marine invertebrate's neutral mAPs properties is scarce; available data are mainly derived from genomics and cDNA studies. The goal of this work was to characterize the biochemical properties of the neutral APs activities in eight Cuban marine invertebrate species from the Phyla Mollusca, Porifera, Echinodermata, and Cnidaria. Determination of substrate specificity, optimal pH and effects of inhibitors (1,10-phenanthroline, amastatin, and bestatin) and cobalt on activity led to the identification of distinct neutral AP-like activities, whose biochemical behaviors were similar to those of the M1 and M17 families of mAPs. Additionally, M18-like glutamyl AP activities were detected. Thus, marine invertebrates express biochemical activities likely belonging to various families of metallo-aminopeptidases.","Pascual Alonso, Isel; Rivera Méndez, Laura; Valdés-Tresanco, Mario E; Bounaadja, Lotfi; Schmitt, Marjorie; Arrebola Sánchez, Yarini; Alvarez Lajonchere, Luis; Charli, Jean-Louis; Florent, Isabelle",,2,28

Many factors diminish access to education and prevention technologies emerging to combat COVID-19. For farmers, advanced age and rural location play a part. Farmworkers encounter numerous additional barriers including language and cultural differences, socioeconomic pressures, and immigration status. The unusual persistence and multiple transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 emerging from ongoing scientific study require customization of otherwise standard prevention messaging to farmers and farmworkers to prevent infection and disease exacerbation. AgriSafe Network and Migrant Clinicians Network, both national organizations and major stakeholders in agricultural health, are on the front lines of translating science into practical prevention strategies for those providing health services to farmworkers and farmers. The partnerships pursued provide a blueprint for quickly translating emerging disease ecology to support the health of agricultural populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liebman, Amy; Roy, Natalie; Seda, Claire; Zuroweste, Ed; Roy, Chad",J Agromedicine,2,29

Identification of prognostic factors is important for prevention and early treatment. We aimed to examine whether obesity is a risk factor for the critical condition in COVID-19 patients by performing a meta-analysis. The review protocol was registered onto PROSPERO (CRD42020185980). A systematic search was performed in five scientific databases between 1 January and 11 May 2020. After selection, 24 retrospective cohort studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. We calculated pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in meta-analysis. Obesity was a significant risk factor for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in a homogenous dataset (OR = 1.21, CI: 1.002-1.46; I2 = 0.0%) as well as for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (OR = 2.05, CI: 1.16-3.64; I2 = 34.86%) in COVID-19. Comparing body mass index (BMI) classes with each other, we found that a higher BMI always carries a higher risk. Obesity may serve as a clinical predictor for adverse outcomes; therefore, the inclusion of BMI in prognostic scores and improvement of guidelines for the intensive care of patients with elevated BMI are highly recommended.","Földi, Mária; Farkas, Nelli; Kiss, Szabolcs; Zádori, Noémi; Váncsa, Szilárd; Szakó, Lajos; Dembrovszky, Fanni; Solymár, Margit; Bartalis, Eszter; Szakács, Zsolt; Hartmann, Petra; Pár, Gabriella; Eross, Bálint; Molnár, Zsolt; Hegyi, Péter; Szentesi, Andrea",Obes Rev,2,28

Secondary objectives: To investigate whether remotely delivered EMDR can improve psychological outcome following Covid-19 related critical illness, specifically Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a single centre, randomised controlled cohort feasibility trial. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will be recruited following discharge from the Intensive Care Unit at University Hospital Southampton, United Kingdom. Eligible patients will have received mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 24 hours, tested Covid-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction, will be over the age of 18 years and have the capacity to provide informed consent. Patients will be excluded if they have pre-existing cognitive impairment, pre-existing psychotic diagnosis or are not expected to survive post-hospital discharge. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Group one: patients in the control arm will receive their standard package of prescribed care, following discharge home from hospital. If they experience any adverse physical or psychological health-conditions, they will access care through the usual available channels. Group two: patients randomly allocated to the intervention arm will receive their standard package of prescribed care, following discharge home from hospital. In addition, they will be referred to the Intensive Psychological Therapies Service in Poole, United Kingdom. They will receive an online appointment within 12-weeks of discharge home from hospital. They will receive a maximum of eight, weekly sessions of EMDR, delivered by a trained psychological therapist, following the Recent Traumatic Episode Protocol (R-TEP). Appendices 1 and 2 of the attached trial protocol contain a detailed description of the R-TEP intervention, written in accordance with the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome from this trial will be feasibility. Feasibility will be determined by recruitment rates, expressed as a percentage of eligible patients approached, completion of the EMDR intervention, completion of final assessment at 6-months, incidence of attributable adverse events and protocol adherence by the psychological therapists. Secondary, exploratory outcomes will be assessed by comparison between the control and intervention groups at 6-months post-hospital discharge. Psychometric evaluation will consist of the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. In addition, we will assess health-related quality of life using the EQ5D-5L, physical activity using wrist worn activity monitors and nutritional state using the Council of Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire. RANDOMISATION: Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care using an internet-based system (ALEATM). Participants will be randomly assigned, on a 1:1 ratio, to receive either standard care (control) or the standard care plus online EMDR R-TEP (Intervention) BLINDING (MASKING): Due to the nature of the intervention, participants cannot be blinded to group allocation. 6-month patient reported outcome measures will be completed using an online, electronic case report form. Group allocation will be masked during data analysis.

Understanding the genomic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of person-to-person transmission of ANDV is crucial to designing effective interventions. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiologic information was obtained by means of patient report and from public health centers. Serologic testing, contact-tracing, and next-generation sequencing were used to identify ANDV infection as the cause of this outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and to reconstruct person-to-person transmission events. RESULTS: After a single introduction of ANDV from a rodent reservoir into the human population, transmission was driven by 3 symptomatic persons who attended crowded social events. After 18 cases were confirmed, public health officials enforced isolation of persons with confirmed cases and self-quarantine of possible contacts; these measures most likely curtailed further spread. The median reproductive number (the number of secondary cases caused by an infected person during the infectious period) was 2.12 before the control measures were enforced and decreased to 0.96 after the measures were implemented. Full genome sequencing of the ANDV strain involved in this outbreak was performed with specimens from 27 patients and showed that the strain that was present (Epuyén/18-19) was similar to the causative strain (Epilink/96) in the first known person-to-person transmission of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by ANDV, which occurred in El Bolsón, Argentina, in 1996. Clinical investigations involving patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this outbreak revealed that patients with a high viral load and liver injury were more likely than other patients to spread infection. Disease severity, genomic diversity, age, and time spent in the hospital had no clear association with secondary transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, high viral titers in combination with attendance at massive social gatherings or extensive contact among persons were associated with a higher likelihood of transmission.

RESULTS: There was limited productive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in canine NC and SARS-CoV in canine NC, SP and L with unexpectedly high ACE2 levels in canine NC and SP. Meanwhile, the canine tissues were susceptible to a wide range of human and avian influenza viruses, which matched with the abundance of both human and avian SA receptors.

We present three case studies showing that this framework expands on existing methods to comprehensively measure how a visualization design facilitates a viewer's understanding of visualizations. Although Bloom's original taxonomy suggests a strong hierarchical structure for some domains, we found few examples of dependent relationships between performance at different levels for our three case studies.

However, manually labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly labeled data. RESULTS: We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points. We measure the impact of combining large numbers of ontologies and present a case study on rapidly building classifiers for COVID-19 clinical tasks. Our framework demonstrates how a wide range of medical entity classifiers can be quickly constructed using weak supervision and without requiring manually-labeled training data.","Fries, J.

We aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on children's health, wellbeing, and access to medical care in Portugal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study through an anonymous online survey via social media. The collected data refers to a period between the 16th of March and the 17th of May 2020. RESULTS: We obtained responses to the survey on 19 745 children. Of the previously scheduled outpatient consultations, 54.2% were postponed by healthcare institutions and 21.6% of planned vaccinations were missed. Parents expressed concerns regarding psychological, social, and physical consequences for their children due to the pandemic. DISCUSSION: The observed reduction of pediatric emergency department visits and the postponement of outpatient consultations and vaccine administrations are potentially harmful for non-COVID patients. The current pandemic and the imposed social distance might have an important negative impact on the mental health of children.

We focused on conspiracy theories that did not deny the existence of COVID-19 and evaluated the extent to which they predicted a range of health protective behaviours, before and after controlling for psychological and sociodemographic characteristics associated with conspiracy theory belief. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were positively correlated with beliefs in other unrelated conspiracies and a general conspiracy mind-set, and negatively correlated with trust in government and a tendency towards analytical thinking (vs. intuitive thinking). Unexpectedly, COVID-19 conspiracy believers adhered to basic health guidelines and advanced health protective measures as strictly as non-believers. Conspiracy believers were, however, less willing to install the contact-tracing app, get tested for and vaccinated against COVID-19, and were more likely to share COVID-19 misinformation ? all of which might undermine public health initiatives. Study 3 showed conspiracy theory believers were less willing to undertake health protective behaviours that were outside of their personal control, perceiving these as having a negative balance of risks and benefits. We discuss models explaining conspiracy beliefs and health protective behaviours, and suggest practical recommendations for public health initiatives. This article is protected by copyright.

This study used the effort-reward imbalance model to investigate the association between work-stress characteristics (effort, over-commitment, reward) and mental health problems (anxiety and depression) among front-line public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 4850 valid online questionnaires were collected through a self- constructed sociodemographic questionnaire, the adapted ERI questionnaire, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between ERI factors and mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety), with reward treated as a potential moderator in such associations. RESULTS: The data showed that effort and over-commitment were positively associated with depression and anxiety, while reward was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. Development and job acceptance were the two dimensions of reward buffered the harmful effect of effort/over-commitment on depression and anxiety, whereas esteem was non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the harmful effects of effort and over-commitment on mental health among public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Such effects could be alleviated through an appropriate reward system, especially the development and job acceptance dimensions of such a system. These findings highlight the importance of establishing an emergency reward system, comprising reasonable work-allocation mechanism, bonuses and honorary titles, a continuous education system and better career-development opportunities.","Zhang, Jing; Wang, Yijing; Xu, Jingdong; You, Hua; Li, Yan; Liang, Yuan; Li, Shan; Ma, Lina; Lau, Joseph Tak-Fai; Hao, Yuantao; Chen, Shilin; Zeng, Jing; Li, Jinghua; Gu, Jing",BMC Psychol,2,21

Using Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, we showed that the N501 mutation enhances the electrostatic interactions due to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between SARS-CoV-2-T500 and ACE2-D355 near the mutation site. In addition, we observed that the electrostatic interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the wild type and the mutant are dominated by salt-bridges formed between SARS-CoV-2-K417 and ACE2-D30, SARS-CoV-2-K458, ACE2-E23, and SARS-CoV-2-R403 and ACE2-E37.

Were there ways to have avoided the trauma faced by nurses (International Council of Nurses, ICN, 2021) after the overexposure to the health care crisis?Such a grim realization has specific implications for nursing. Naturally, one cannot change the world. Similarly, nurses cannot affect all aspects of health care systems that need serious reform. But nurses can affect nursing-sensitive outcomes. Most importantly, nursing-sensitive outcomes can be used to establish criteria for safe nursing practice.

Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. METHODS: We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. FINDINGS: We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33-56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·0-14·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0-9·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8-12·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·3-11·6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·74-1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·32-2·17) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir reduces hospitalization among high-risk patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 in an outpatient setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Brazil. Recently symptomatic adults diagnosed with respiratory symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled between June 2 and September 30, 2020. The planned sample size was 1476 patients, with interim analyses planned after 500 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped after the interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 685 patients. Statistical analysis was performed in December 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (800 mg loading dose, then 400 mg daily for 9 days), lopinavir-ritonavir (loading dose of 800 mg and 200 mg, respectively, every 12 hours followed by 400 mg and 100 mg, respectively, every 12 hours for the next 9 days), or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death assessed at 90 days after randomization. COVID-19-associated hospitalization was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model. The trial included the following secondary outcomes: all-cause hospitalization, viral clearance, symptom resolution, and adverse events. Results: Of 685 participants, 632 (92.3%) self-identified as mixed-race, 377 (55.0%) were women, and the median (range) age was 53 (18-94) years. A total of 214 participants were randomized to hydroxychloroquine; 244, lopinavir-ritonavir; and 227, placebo. At first interim analysis, the data safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrollment of both hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir groups because of futility. The proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was 3.7% (8 participants) in the hydroxychloroquine group, 5.7% (14 participants) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 4.8% (11 participants) in the placebo group. We found no significant differences between interventions for COVID-19-associated hospitalization (hydroxychloroquine: hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.30-1.88]; lopinavir-ritonavir: HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.53-2.56] as well as for the secondary outcome of viral clearance through day 14 (hydroxychloroquine: odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82-1.02]; lopinavir-ritonavir: OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94-1.16]). At the end of the trial, there were 3 fatalities recorded, 1 in the placebo group and 2 in the lopinavir-ritonavir intervention group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, neither hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir-ritonavir showed any significant benefit for decreasing COVID-19-associated hospitalization or other secondary clinical outcomes. This trial suggests that expedient clinical trials can be implemented in low-income settings even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

While much of the climate change and migration discourse is invested in quantitative predictions and debates about whether migration is adaptive or maladaptive, less attention has been paid to the voices of the people moving in the context of climate change with a focus on their health and wellbeing. This qualitative research aims to amplify the voices of migrants themselves to add nuance to dominant migration narratives and to shed light on the real-life challenges migrants face in meeting their health needs in the context of climate change. METHODS: We conducted 58 semi-structured in-depth interviews with migrants purposefully selected for having moved from rural Bhola, southern Bangladesh to an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis under the philosophical underpinnings of phenomenology. Coding was conducted using NVivo Pro 12. FINDINGS: We identified two overarching themes in the thematic analysis: Firstly, we identified the theme ""A risk exchange: Exchanging climate change and health risks at origin and destination"". Rather than describing a ""net positive"" or ""net negative"" outcome in terms of migration in the context of climate change, migrants described an exchange of hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities at origin with those at destination, which challenged their capacity to adapt. This theme included several sub-themes-income and employment factors, changing food environment, shelter and water sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) conditions, and social capital. The second overarching theme was ""A changing health and healthcare environment"". This theme also included several sub-themes-changing physical and mental health status and a changing healthcare environment encompassing quality of care and barriers to accessing healthcare. Migrants described physical and mental health concerns and connected these experiences with their new environment. These two overarching themes were prevalent across the dataset, although each participant experienced and expressed them uniquely. CONCLUSION: Migrants who move in the context of climate change face a range of diverse health risks at the origin, en route, and at the destination. Migrating individuals, households, and communities undertake a risk exchange when they decide to move, which has diverse positive and negative consequences for their health and wellbeing. Along with changing health determinants is a changing healthcare environment where migrants face different choices, barriers, and quality of care. A more migrant-centric perspective as described in this paper could strengthen migration, climate, and health governance. Policymakers, urban planners, city corporations, and health practitioners should integrate the risk exchange into practice and policies.","Nayna Schwerdtle, Patricia; Baernighausen, Kate; Karim, Sayeda; Raihan, Tauheed Syed; Selim, Samiya; Baernighausen, Till; Danquah, Ina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),2,16

We examined psychological distress in four societies with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental health outcome during the pandemic. From March to July of 2020, a survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and more severe loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome but the magnitudes of these effects varied across the four regions. Objective measures of social isolation did not affect mental health. There were also notable differences in psychological outcome; Hong Kong, with very strict social distancing protocols plus ongoing political unrest, suffered the most drastic deterioration of mental health. To prepare for an impending mental health crisis, concerted efforts to reduce loneliness should be integrated into a comprehensive public health strategy.","Dean, Derek J; Tso, Ivy F; Giersch, Anne; Lee, Hyeon-Seung; Baxter, Tatiana; Griffith, Taylor; Song, Lijun; Park, Sohee",Psychiatry Res,2,6

It has been causing a huge fatality and death toll reported. Besides, a very swift transmission of viruses distributed within 213 countries, including Ethiopia. Therefore, this empirical study investigates all government and stakeholders' effects in line with identifying the current status found in Ethiopia. Methods: Qualitative approach of data collections and thematic analysis were used. Results: The outcomes indicate that COVID-19 situations gain the highest momentum by increasing alarmingly. It shows significant differences after two months since March 2020 it has reported the first case in Ethiopia. The government took several measures ranging from public health emergency response to the state of emergency. The communication strategy and state of emergency are in place to reduce the prospective risks of COVID-19. The strategy segmented the population by tailoring activities of risk communication and community engagement at all levels. The government has strongly obtained various measures like lockdown and a state of emergency. However, it was not strict and has not been heavy-handed that much. Conclusion: KAP's practices are inadequate to fight and minimize the impacts of the pandemic. Such negligence among the public and related factors undermined the preparedness and responses towards COVID-19 in Ethiopia. New cases and deaths are non-stoppable. The government is using several strategies and need to strengthen those efforts to mobilize and upbeat the KAP's of the public through different communication forms to reinforce the existing efforts and alleviate socio-cultural, political, economic factors to drive out COVID-19 among the people.

Although utilized in many real applications, the classical Hawkes process is incapable of modelling inhibitory interactions among neurons. Instead, the nonlinear Hawkes process allows for a more flexible influence pattern with excitatory or inhibitory interactions. In this paper, three sets of auxiliary latent variables (P\'{o}lya-Gamma variables, latent marked Poisson processes and sparsity variables) are augmented to make synapses connection weights in a Gaussian form, which allows for a simple iterative algorithm with analytical updates. As a result, an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived to obtain the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency performance of our algorithm on synthetic and real data.

However, both sample types need to be collected by trained professionals. Using self-collected buccal swabs as an alternative could simplify and accelerate diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: To assess self-collected buccal swab samples as an alternative method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Buccal swab samples were self-collected by 73 patients with COVID-19. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen kits. RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Env protein and human RNase P as an internal control was amplified using the TRUPCR® SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit version 2.1 and a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time Detection System. RESULT: The sensitivity of RT-qPCR from buccal swabs was 58.9% (43/73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 46.77%-70.27%) and that of RT-qPCR from saliva was 62.90% (39/62; 95% CI 49.69%-74.84%) taking positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs as the gold standard. CONCLUSION: Self-collected buccal swabs are promising alternatives to nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs for SARS CoV-2 detection.","Gaur, Ritu; Verma, Dipesh Kumar; Mohindra, Ritin; Goyal, Kapil; Gupta, Shipra; Singla, Vidhi; Sahni, Vaibhav; Ghosh, Arnab; Soni, Roop Kishor; Bhalla, Ashish; Gauba, Krishan; Singh, Mini P",J Int Med Res,2,4

As a result, most clinicians now have experience with telemedicine. Questions/Purposes: We studied factors independently associated with a clinician desiring to continue telemedicine services after the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondarily, we sought factors independently associated with clinician satisfaction with the quality of care provided through telemedicine and factors associated with telemedicine platform preference by clinicians. Methods: A large multispecialty medical group of physicians were invited to complete a survey, including demographics, telemedicine experience, satisfaction with various elements of telemedicine encounters, desired features in a telemedicine platform, personality traits, and preferences. A total of 220 complete responses were analyzed. Results: A desire to continue offering telemedicine visits after the COVID-19 pandemic was independently associated with a higher satisfaction with the quality of telemedicine care, endorsement of the ease of performing a physical examination with telemedicine, belief that adaptability is an important element of being a clinician, and less preference for in-person work meetings over virtual meetings. Higher satisfaction with the quality of telemedicine care was associated with belief that adaptability is an important element of being a clinician, clinicians who identify as being more perceiving (value flexibility) than judging (value organization), providers from relatively urban counties, and those with less preference for in-person work meetings over virtual meetings. Clinicians ranked ease of use for patients and physicians as the most important features of telemedicine platforms. Conclusions: The observed association of clinician personality and interpersonal preferences with the appeal, satisfaction, and perceived effectiveness of telemedicine merit additional study. Early implementation of telemedicine might be easiest with clinicians that take pride in their adaptability and value a technology-based workstyle.","Miner, Harrison; Fatehi, Amirreza; Ring, David; Reichenberg, Jason S",Telemed. j. e. health,2,5

The disease is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses-2 virus which enters cells by binding with the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and CD147 protein. Among COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital, hypertension, diabetes and obesity are the most common co-morbidities. A majority of COVID-19 hospitalized patients are found to have proteinuria and hematuria which is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Studies have reported high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital (10 to 43%) and intensive care unit (43-75%). These patients with AKI have much higher need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and critical care. In addition, proportion of patients with AKI who require renal replacement (RRT) therapy is greatly increased. Acute tubular injury, cytokine storm induced systemic inflammatory response, endothelial injury and dysfunction are the main mechanisms of AKI. In addition, direct viral invasion of tubules, lymphocytic infiltration and complement mediated (C5b- 9) related injury is also seen. Mortality risk among patients with AKI and those in need of RRT is greatly amplified. Appropriate timing and choice of RRT for these patients is not well defined but will need to take in account the clinical condition, anticipation of their clinical course and availability of dialysis resources. Risk of AKI and death is also increased among kidney recipients and patients with chronic kidney disease.","Goel, Narender; Jain, Deepika; Haddad, Danny B",Iran J Kidney Dis,2,26

While these studies can expedite the drug approval process, researchers must carefully design and analyze such studies in order to perform rigorous science that is reproducible and credible. This article focuses on several key design and analysis considerations that can improve the scientific rigor of non-randomized studies of off-label drugs. Areas covered: The aim of this article is to provide an overview of best approaches that should be considered for non-randomized studies on off-label drugs. We discuss these approaches in detail and use a non-randomized study by Rivera et al. in Cancer Discovery as an example of methods that have been undertaken for COVID-19. Expert opinion: While non-randomized studies are inherently biased, they may be unavoidable in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where researchers need to find an effective treatment quickly. We believe that a well-formed experimental design, high-quality data collection, and a well-thought-out statistical and data analysis plan are sufficient to produce rigorous and credible results for making an optimal decision.","Shyr, Derek; Shyr, Yu",Expert Opin Investig Drugs,2,24

In this multicenter, investigator-masked, randomized clinical trial, resident surgeons within 3 months of matriculation with minimal or no prior experience with MSICS were assigned either to simulation-based training, the Experimental Group (EG), or to conventional training, the Control Group (CG). EG residents were trained to perform scleral tunnel construction using a simulation-based curriculum (HelpMeSee Eye Surgery Simulator), while residents in the CG followed institution-specific curriculum before progressing to live surgery. Surgical videos of the first 20 attempts at tunnel construction were reviewed by masked video raters. The primary outcome was the total number of any of 9 pre-specified errors. On average, the total number of errors was 9.25 (95% CI 0-18.95) in the EG and 17.56 (95% CI 6.63-28.49) in the CG (P = 0.05); the number of major errors was 4.86 (95% CI 0.13-9.59) in the EG and 10.09 (95% CI 4.76-15.41) in the CG (P = 0.02); and the number of minor errors was 4.39 (95% CI 0-9.75) in the EG and 7.47 (95% CI 1.43-13.51) in the CG (P = 0.16).

Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection.

Compounded by the inherent vulnerabilities of women in crises, substantial complications are directly associated with increased risks of poor SRHR outcomes for displaced populations. The migration of Venezuelans, displaced due to current economic circumstances, is one of the largest in Latin America's history. This study aims to provide an overview of the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues affecting migrant Venezuelan women in the state of Roraima, Brazil. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted from 24 to 30 November 2019. Data collection covered various issues involving access to and use of SRH services by 405 migrant Venezuelan women aged 18-49 years. The Minimum Initial Service Package readiness assessment tools, available from the Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises, were used in the data collection. RESULTS: Most commonly, the women reported unmet family planning needs. Of these, a significant proportion reported being unable to obtain contraceptive methods, particularly long-acting reversible contraceptives, either due to the woman's inability to access them or their unavailability at healthcare centres. Although a significant proportion of women were largely satisfied with the attention received at the maternity hospital, both before and during childbirth, 24.0% of pregnant or postpartum women failed to receive any prenatal or postnatal care. CONCLUSION: Meeting the essential SRHR needs of migrant Venezuelan women in Roraima, Brazil is a challenge that has yet to be fully addressed. Given the size of this migrant population, the Brazilian healthcare system has failed to adapt sufficiently to meet their needs; however, problems with healthcare provision are similar for migrants and Brazilian citizens. Efforts need to be encouraged not only in governmental health sectors, but also with academic, non-governmental and international organisations, including a coordinated approach to ensure a comprehensive SRHR response. Given the current high risks associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, meeting the SRHR needs of migrant populations has become more critical than ever.","Bahamondes, L; Laporte, M; Margatho, D; de Amorim, H S F; Brasil, C; Charles, C M; Becerra, A; Hidalgo, M M",BMC Public Health,2,24

It is now widely accepted that genetically modified microorganisms, including probiotics, represent attractive vehicles for oral or nasal mucosal delivery of therapeutic molecules. Previous studies have shown that the mucosal administration of therapeutic molecules is able to induce an immune response mediated by specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies along with mucosal cell-mediated immune responses, which effectively concur to neutralize and eradicate infections. Therefore, advances in the modulation of mucosal immune responses, and in particular the use of probiotics as live delivery vectors, may encourage prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of genetically modified probiotics for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Of these, thermal inactivation is generally considered an effective and cheap method of sample preparation for downstream assays. The purpose of this study is to establish a safe inactivation method for SARS-CoV-2 without compromising the amount of amplifiable viral genome necessary for clinical diagnoses. In this study, we demonstrate the infectivity and genomic stability of SARSCoV- 2 by thermal inactivation at both 56°C and 65°C. The results substantiate that viable SARS-CoV-2 is readily inactivated when incubated at 56°C for 30 min or at 65°C for 10 min. qRT-PCR of specimens heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min or 65°C for 15 min revealed similar genomic RNA stability compared with non-heat inactivated specimens. Further, we demonstrate that 30 min of thermal inactivation at 56°C could inactivate viable viruses from clinical COVID-19 specimens without attenuating the qRT-PCR diagnostic sensitivity. Heat treatment of clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients at 56°C for 30 min or 65°C for 15 min could be a useful method for the inactivation of a highly contagious agent, SARS-CoV-2. Use of this method would reduce the potential for secondary infections in BSL2 conditions during diagnostic procedures. Importantly, infectious virus can be inactivated in clinical specimens without compromising the sensitivity of the diagnostic RT-PCR assay.","Kim, Young-Il; Casel, Mark Anthony B; Kim, Se-Mi; Kim, Seong-Gyu; Park, Su-Jin; Kim, Eun-Ha; Jeong, Hye Won; Poo, Haryoung; Choi, Young Ki",J Microbiol,2,22

The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was used to measure resilience, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) measured distress (i.e., composite of stress, anxiety and depression scales). Other factors assessed included: age, gender, being born overseas, number of children, self-assessed introversion, social, educational and economic variables, family resources, positive affect and emotional regulation, external social support, and partner social support. Hierarchical regression models and a moderation analysis were used to assess the aims. RESULTS: Of 2110 parents, 1701 (80.6%) were female. The mean age was 38 years old (SD = 7, range = 19-69). High loneliness was a key contributor to distress. The level of social support received did add significantly to distress, with greater assistance associated with lower stress and anxiety (both p < .01). Partner support significantly moderated the relationship between resilience and depression; however, this relationship is of unlikely clinical significance due to its small statistical effect. CONCLUSION: Interventions targeting resilience against distress and mental health of parents at the time of pandemics should focus on reducing loneliness while working with the constraints of imposed social isolation and might include partners. Qualitative studies are needed to understand the various useful and not useful aspects of partner's support.","Mikocka-Walus, Antonina; Stokes, Mark; Evans, Subhadra; Olive, Lisa; Westrupp, Elizabeth",J Psychosom Res,2,27

In the absence of an effective antiviral treatment, a reasonable causal approach could be constituted by the neutralization of these substances. The authors describe the clinical course of a patient with SARS-COV-2-19 interstitial pneumonia treated with the combination of an anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) agent (tocilizumab) and hemoadsorption (HA). This combination was used to abate the surge of inflammatory mediators leading to the lung damage. Blood levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured before the initiation of the treatment and in the following 3 days. At the end of the treatment, the values of IL-6 and CRP decreased from 1,040 to 415 pg/mL and from 229 to 59 mg/L, respectively. The gas exchanges and the chest imaging rapidly improved, and the patient was extubated 10 days later. The combination of tocilizumab and HA could be valuable in the treatment of SARS-COV-2-19-associated pneumonia and ARDS that are caused by the release of inflammatory mediators.","Berlot, Giorgio; Tomasini, Ariella; Roman Pognuz, Erik; Randino, Anna; Chiella, Fabrizio; La Fata, Cristina; Piva, Marco; Amato, Paola; di Maso, Vittorio; Bianco, Francesco; Gerini, Ugo; Tomietto, Paola; Trenti, Tommaso",Nephron,2,16

Epidemiologic reports indicate that severity of illness increases with age. However, the reasons behind the relative protection of children and infants are unclear. Whether the rationale is host-related or virus-dependent is important to determine since the latter could change with viral mutations. We review factors that could affect the susceptibility of children to the novel coronavirus. METHODS: We search publications indexed on PUBMED. RESULTS: Descriptions of the pathophysiology of current and previous coronavirus infections suggest several viral targets and immunomodulatory pathways affecting the severity of illness. There is limited evidence to suggest age-variability of viral cell receptors and transmembrane co-factors required for coronavirus entry and replication. However, the ensuing cytokine storm and the effect of higher melatonin in children are age-dependent and could explain decreased disease variability in children. CONCLUSION: We believe that current evidence suggests host factors can play a role in disease severity in children and thus may remain protective despite potential virus mutation in the future. However, we recognize and discuss avenues of future research that can further illuminate the reasons children are protected from severe COVID-19 illness.","Rabi, Firas A; Al Zoubi, Mazhar S; Al-Iede, Montaha Mohammed; Kasasbeh, Ghena; Badran, Eman Farouk",Acta paediatr. scand,2,15

Using a drug combination screen reliant on synthetic lethal interactions, we identified clinically relevant combination therapies for different TNBC subtypes. Two drug combinations targeting the BET family were further explored. The first, targeting BET and CXCR2, is specific for mesenchymal TNBC and induces apoptosis, whereas the second, targeting BET and the proteasome, is effective for major TNBC subtypes and triggers ferroptosis. Ferroptosis was induced at low drug doses and was associated with increased cellular iron and decreased glutathione levels, concomitant with reduced levels of GPX4 and key glutathione biosynthesis genes. Further functional studies, analysis of clinical datasets and breast cancer specimens revealed a unique vulnerability of TNBC to ferroptosis inducers, enrichment of ferroptosis gene signature, and differential expression of key proteins that increase labile iron and decrease glutathione levels. This study identified potent combination therapies for TNBC and unveiled ferroptosis as a promising therapeutic strategy.","Verma, Nandini; Vinik, Yaron; Saroha, Ashish; Nair, Nishanth Ulhas; Ruppin, Eytan; Mills, Gordon; Karn, Thomas; Dubey, Vinay; Khera, Lohit; Raj, Harsha; Maina, Flavio; Lev, Sima",Sci.

Regulatory units within an Academic Medical Center (AMC), including those part of the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) consortium, have provided support for clinicians in navigating these options prior to the pandemic. As such, they were positioned to be a resource for accessing therapies during the COVID-19 public health emergency.Methods:A small survey and a follow-on poll of the national Investigational New Drug (IND)/Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Workgroup were conducted in October and December 2020 to determine whether CTSA regulatory units assisted in facilitating access to COVID-19 therapies and the extent of pandemic-related challenges these units faced.Results:Fifteen survey and 21 poll responses were received, which provided insights into the demands placed on these regulatory support units due to the pandemic and the changes required to provide critical support during this and future crises. Key changes and lessons learned included the importance of regulatory knowledge to support the institutional response, the critical need for electronic submission capacity for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents, and the nimble reallocation of regulatory and legal resources to support patient access to investigational agents and/or medical devices during the pandemic.Conclusion:AMC- and CTSA-based regulatory units played a meaningful role in the COVID-19 pandemic but further unit modifications are needed for enabling more robust regulatory support in the future.","Gravelin, Misty Wright Jeanne Holbein M.

METHODS: Based on the information officially announced on the official website of the Health Commission of Hebei Province, epidemiological data were collected from 133 children, aged 0-18 years, who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shijiazhuang from January 2 to January 30, 2021. A statistical analysis was performed for general status, regional distribution, presence or absence of clusters, and results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests. RESULTS: Among the 133 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 65 boys and 68 girls, with a male/female ratio of 0.96:1. The youngest age of onset was 3 months and 7 days, and the mean age of onset was (9±5) years. Of all the 133 children, 90(67.7%) were the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection among their family members. Of all the children, 108(81.2%) came from the Gaocheng District in Shijiazhuang, among whom 38(28.6%) were from Xiaoguozhuang Village where the first patient with a confirmed diagnosis lived. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test at week 2 after the outbreak showed positive results in 88 children (66.2%), and only 5 children had clinical symptoms before positive SARS-CoV-2 results were obtained. Of all the 133 children, 19(14.3%) were found positive in the first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test after the outbreak, and 70(52.6%) had positive results for ≥4 times. There were 98 school students with infection, among whom 74(75.5%) were the first confirmed case in their family, and among 35 non-school students, 16(45.7%) were the first confirmed case in their family (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among the children confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shijiazhuang, there is a high proportion of children who are the first confirmed case in their family, and the children are mainly distributed in the rural areas of Gaocheng. Most of these children are students, so the prevention and control of cluster infection in schools should be taken seriously. There are often no symptoms before SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, with a low positive rate of the first nucleic acid test, which increases the difficulty of early discovery of the epidemic.","Lu, S.

The role of sex on stroke outcome has not been investigated. To objective of this paper is to describe the characteristics of a diverse cohort of acute stroke patients with COVID-19 disease and determine the role of sex on outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with acute stroke and SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between March 15 to May 15, 2020 to one of the six participating comprehensive stroke centers. Baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, workup, treatment and outcome are presented as total number and percentage or median and interquartile range. Outcome at discharge was determined by the modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS). Variables and outcomes were compared for males and females using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The study included 83 patients, 47% of which were Black, 28% Hispanics/Latinos, and 16% whites. Median age was 64 years. Approximately 89% had at least one preexisting vascular risk factor (VRF). The most common complications were respiratory failure (59%) and septic shock (34%). Compared with females, a higher proportion of males experienced severe SARS-CoV-2 symptoms requiring ICU hospitalization (73% vs. 49%; pâ¯=â¯0.04). When divided by stroke subtype, there were 77% ischemic, 19% intracerebral hemorrhage and 3% subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common ischemic stroke etiologies were cryptogenic (39%) and cardioembolic (27%). Compared with females, males had higher mortality (38% vs. 13%; pâ¯=â¯0.02) and were less likely to be discharged home (12% vs. 33%; pâ¯=â¯0.04). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, and number of VRFs, mRS was higher in males than in females (ORâ¯=â¯1.47, 95% CIâ¯=â¯1.03-2.09). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of SARS-CoV-2 stroke patients, most had clinical evidence of coronavirus infection on admission and preexisting VRFs. Severe in-hospital complications and worse outcomes after ischemic strokes were higher in males, than females.","Trifan, G; Goldenberg, F D; Caprio, F Z; Biller, J; Schneck, M; Khaja, A; Terna, T; Brorson, J; Lazaridis, C; Bulwa, Z; Alvarado Dyer, R; Saleh Velez, F G; Prabhakaran, S; Liotta, E M; Batra, A; Reish, N J; Ruland, S; Teitcher, M; Taylor, W; De la Pena, P; Conners, J J; Grewal, P K; Pinna, P; Dafer, R M; Osteraas, N D; DaSilva, I; Hall, J P; John, S; Shafi, N; Miller, K; Moustafa, B; Vargas, A; Gorelick, P B; Testai, F D",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,2,1

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Switzerland had one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe in autumn 2020. Keeping schools open provided a moderate to high exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections. Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2. Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and health related questions. PARTICIPANTS: 275 classes in 55 schools; 2603 children participated in June-July 2020 and 2552 in October-November 2020 (age range 6-16 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serology of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020, clustering of children who were seropositive within classes, and symptoms in children. RESULTS: In June-July, 74 of 2496 children with serological results were seropositive; in October-November, the number had increased to 173 of 2503. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% credible interval 1.4% to 3.6%) in the summer and 4.5% (3.2% to 6.0%) in late autumn in children who were not previously seropositive, leading to an estimated 7.8% (6.2% to 9.5%) of children who were ever seropositive. Seroprevalence varied across districts (in the autumn, 1.7-15.0%). No significant differences were found among lower, middle, and upper school levels (children aged 6-9 years, 9-13 years, and 12-16 years, respectively). Among the 2223 children who had serology tests at both testing rounds, 28/70 (40%) who were previously seropositive became seronegative, and 109/2153 (5%) who were previously seronegative became seropositive. Symptoms were reported for 22% of children who were seronegative and 29% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with a high participation rate, no children who were seropositive were found in 73 (56%) classes, one or two children were seropositive in 50 (38%) classes, and at least three children were seropositive in 7 (5%) classes. Class level explained 24% and school level 8% of variance in seropositivity in the multilevel logistic regression models. CONCLUSIONS: With schools open since August 2020 and some preventive measures in place, clustering of children who were seropositive occurred in only a few classes despite an increase in overall seroprevalence during a period of moderate to high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Uncertainty remains as to whether these findings will change with the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and dynamic levels of community transmission.

Moreover, the present study aims to add to the understanding of the role of personal resources in the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) by examining whether personal resources-such as the professionals' orientation towards patient engagement-may also strengthen the impact of job resources and mitigate the impact of job demands. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 532 healthcare professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. It adopted the Job-Demands-Resource Model to study the determinants of professional's burnout. An integrative model describing how increasing job demands experienced by this specific population are related to burnout and in particular to emotional exhaustion symptoms was developed. RESULTS: The results of the logistic regression models provided strong support for the proposed model, as both Job Demands and Resources are significant predictors (OR = 2.359 and 0.563 respectively, with p < 0.001). Moreover, healthcare professionals' orientation towards patient engagement appears as a significant moderator of this relationship, as it reduces Demands' effect (OR = 1.188) and increases Resources' effect (OR = 0.501). CONCLUSIONS: These findings integrate previous findings on the JD-R Model and suggest the relevance of personal resources and of relational factors in affecting professionals' experience of burnout.","Barello, Serena; Caruso, Rosario; Palamenghi, Lorenzo; Nania, Tiziana; Dellafiore, Federica; Bonetti, Loris; Silenzi, Andrea; Marotta, Claudia; Graffigna, Guendalina",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,2,11

This study evaluated a virtual model of care in acromegalic patients. Methods: We recruited 78 acromegalic patients, 65% female, median age 63 years. Outpatient management was remodeled to simplify access to care by (1) adoption of virtual meetings; (2) collection of blood samples at home; (3) abolishment of printed prescription and provision of electronic files directly to central pharmacy; and (4) drugs delivered to patients' home. Patients and physicians filled electronic surveys 48 h after each consultation. Results: The patients expressed satisfaction with convenience (91.1%), decreased wait time (85.1%), and saving money (79.2%) compared to face-to-face visits. Most patients felt supported by the medical team (89.1%) and kept the prescriptions updated (84.8%). The physicians reported resolutive appointments in 92.2% of cases, despite longer time to reach the patients and subsequent calls to complement missing information. Satisfaction and patient-provider relationship were maintained during the study, but the choice for virtual appointment for the next appointment fell from 78.7% to 34.8% after 6 months. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in 13% of patients, mostly mild and moderate manifestations. Conclusion: Telemedicine is a tool for medical care in underserved populations, feasible even in low-income countries. This study suggests that it is difficult to sustain exclusive remote care for more than 6 months. The method could be adopted interchangeably with in-person consultations in acromegalic patients with stable disease.","Naves, Luciana Ansaneli; Rosa, Isabella Naves; Lima, Thomas Alves de Souza; Santana, Lidiana Bandeira de; Castro, Lucas Faria de; Casulari, Luiz Augusto",Telemed. j. e. health,2,25

One of these is remdesivir, which was originally repurposed from its use against Ebola and functions by causing early RNA chain termination. We used this as justification to evaluate three molecules we had previously identified computationally with antiviral activity against Ebola and Marburg. Out of these we previously identified pyronaridine, which inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549-ACE2 cells. Herein, the in vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has now been assessed in a K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Pyronaridine treatment demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of viral load in the lungs of SARS CoV-2 infected mice. Furthermore, the pyronaridine treated group reduced lung pathology, which was also associated with significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. Notably, pyronaridine inhibited the viral PLpro activity in vitro (IC50 of 1.8 {micro}M) without any effect on Mpro, indicating a possible molecular mechanism involved in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, pyronaridine also selectively inhibits the host kinase CAMK1 (IC50 of 2.4 {micro}M). We have also generated several pyronaridine analogs to assist in understanding the structure activity relationship for PLpro inhibition. Our results indicate that pyronaridine is a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience of relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic and to derive support information for health professionals. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of three written testimonies of relatives whose family members were hospitalized with COVID-19 or other disease at intensive care unit. RESULTS: Relatives report the sudden, unexpected occurrence of the disease. ""It was there, out of nowhere, hits the heart of life, doesn't just go away, does what it wants. It is an unknown virus that we have to get to know very closely."" The ban on visiting was harsh, it made her faint. The first visit was an indescribable joy. Knowing how the family member was and that the health care professionals were taking professional and empathetic care of the sick person were the only things the relatives could hold on to. DISCUSSION: Relatives were reassured when they experienced a high level of commitment on the part of health professionals and received repeated comprehensible information by phone.

During initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic patients present with impaired type I/III IFN-mediated antiviral responses. Interestingly, IFNs regulate the cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 on epithelial and endothelial cells. As reported recently, critically ill COVID-19 patients show genetic polymorphisms in one IFN receptor gene (IFNRA2) and in a gene locus near the Janus kinase (JAK) TYK2, which is key for IFN, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 signaling, and T helper (Th) 1/Th17 cell-mediated antiviral immune responses. In the advanced stage of the disease, critically ill COVID-19 patients develop a cytokine storm where many inflammatory mediators using the JAK/STAT signaling pathway such as IL-6, IFN-Î³, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or IL-2, and chemokines result in an influx of macrophages and neutrophils damaging the lung tissue. The knowledge on the cytokine and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in severe COVID-19 disease explains the promising first results with JAK inhibitors like baricitinib, which not only dampen the inflammation but in the case of baricitinib also affect virus replication and endocytosis in target cells. Here, we summarize the current immunological associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection with cytokine signaling, the JAK/STAT pathway, and the current clinical stage of JAK inhibitors for improving severe COVID-19 disease.","Solimani, Farzan; Meier, Katharina; Ghoreschi, Kamran",Eur J Immunol,2,21

When expressed together, coronavirus M and E proteins are sufficient to facilitate budding into the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). To help elucidate budding, we ran atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Feig laboratorys refined structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein dimer and E protein pentamer. Our MD simulations consisted of M protein dimers and E protein pentamers in patches of membrane. By examining where these proteins induced membrane curvature in silico, we obtained insights around how the budding process may occur. The M protein dimers acted cooperatively to induce membrane curvature while E protein pentamers kept the membrane planar. These results could eventually help guide the development of antiviral therapeutics which inhibit coronavirus budding.","Collins, Logan Thrasher; Elkholy, Tamer; Mubin, Shafat; Hill, David; Williams, Ricky; Ezike, Kayode; Singhal, Ankush",,2,1

The dynamics of vascular damage, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of an immune cell-mediated cytokine storm remain unknown. Using a vascularized lung-on-chip model, we find that infection of alveolar epithelial cells leads to limited apical release of virions, consistent with reports of monoculture infection. However, viral RNA and proteins are rapidly detected in underlying endothelial cells, which are themselves refractory to apical infection in monocultures. Although endothelial infection is unproductive, it leads to the formation of cell clusters with low CD31 expression, a progressive loss of barrier integrity and a pro-coagulatory microenvironment. Viral RNA persists in individual cells generating an inflammatory response, which is transient in epithelial cells but persistent in endothelial cells and typified by IL-6 secretion even in the absence of immune cells. Inhibition of IL-6 signalling with tocilizumab reduces but does not prevent loss of barrier integrity. SARS-CoV-2-mediated endothelial cell damage thus occurs independently of cytokine storm.","Thacker, Vivek V; Sharma, Kunal; Dhar, Neeraj; Mancini, Gian-Filippo; Sordet-Dessimoz, Jessica; McKinney, John D",EMBO Rep,2,20

The origin of the outbreak at the animal market in Wuhan, China implies it as a case of zoonotic spillover. The study was designed to understand evolution of Betacoronaviruses and in particular diversification of SARS-CoV-2 using RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, a stable genetic marker. Phylogenetic and population stratification analyses were carried out using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, respectively. Molecular phylogeny using RdRp showed that SARS-CoV-2 isolates cluster together. Bat-CoV isolate RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoVs are observed to branch off prior to SARS-CoV-2 cluster. While SARS-CoV form a single cluster, Bat-CoVs form multiple clusters. Population-based analyses revealed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV form separate clusters with no admixture. Bat-CoVs were found to have single and mixed ancestry and clustered as four sub-populations. Population-based analyses of Betacoronaviruses using RdRp revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is a homogeneous population. SARS-CoV-2 appears to have evolved from Bat-CoV isolate RaTG13, which diversified from a common ancestor from which Pangolin-CoVs have also evolved. The admixed Bat-CoV sub-populations indicate that bats serve as reservoirs harboring virus ensembles that are responsible for zoonotic spillovers such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

The impact of these changes on glycemic control has remained unclear, especially the long-term effect. We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on glycemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational study enrolled children with type 1 diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring. Continuous glucose monitoring data were extracted from the cloud-based platform before, during and after lockdown. Demographics and lifestyle change-related information were collected from the database or questionnaires. We compared these data before, during and after lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 43 children with type 1 diabetes were recruited (20 girls; mean age 7.45 years; median diabetes duration 1.05 years). We collected 41,784 h of continuous glucose monitoring data. Although time in range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) was similar before, during and after lockdown, the median time below range <3.9 mmol/L decreased from 3.70% (interquartile range [IQR] 2.25-9.53%) before lockdown to 2.91% (IQR 1.43-5.95%) during lockdown, but reversed to 4.95% (IQR 2.11-9.42%) after lockdown (P = 0.004). Time below range <3.0 mmol/L was 0.59% (IQR 0.14-2.21%), 0.38% (IQR 0.05-1.35%) and 0.82% (IQR 0.22-1.69%), respectively (P = 0.008). The amelioration of hypoglycemia during lockdown was more prominent among those who had less time spent <3.9 mmol/L at baseline. During lockdown, individuals reduced their physical activity, received longer sleep duration and spent more time on diabetes management. In addition, they attended outpatient clinics less and turned to telemedicine more frequently. CONCLUSION: Glycemic control did not deteriorate in children and teenagers with type 1 diabetes around the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypoglycemia declined during lockdown, but reversed after lockdown, and the changes related to lifestyle might not provide a long-term effect.","Wu, Xiumei; Luo, Sihui; Zheng, Xueying; Ding, Yu; Wang, Siqi; Ling, Ping; Yue, Tong; Xu, Wen; Yan, Jinhua; Weng, Jianping",J. diabetes investig.

Pakistan is facing severe crises due to climate change and it is ranked one of the most vulnerable countries due to climate change. Adaptation to climate change is the main strategy of Pakistan to deal with climatic impacts. Implementing the GBI plays a key role in urban areas for promoting adaptive governance towards climate change. Many efforts have been initiated to manage the issue of climate change by the national, provincial, and local governments in Pakistan. The latest and notable strategy by Pakistani government was taking in the form of the Clean Green Pakistan Strategy (CGPS). However, there are multiple challenges and hurdles for effective implementation of the CGPS. On the heels of Paris Agreement 2015, the CSOs have an important role to overcome these challenges and to prepare the local communities in collaboration with local institutions especially in cities for promoting the GBI and tackling climate change effectively. This study is conducted to understand and uncover the role of the CSOs for promoting the GBI as adaptive strategy in dealing with climate change in Islamabad city of Pakistan. The study focuses to investigate and dig out the prominent initiatives of the CSOs for promoting the GBI in Pakistani governance system. It also identifies the hurdles and challenges for the CSOs in relation to promoting the GBI in Pakistan. A case study approach as research methodology is employed where semi-structured interviews were conducted with relevant actors in Islamabad city. The study finds that the CSOs are actively involved in promotion of the GBI in collaboration of Islamabad administration through plantation drive, educating school students on the GBI, arranging training programs to the local community, providing advocacy assistance and helping city government for devising policies and action plans for the GBI. The CSOs act as a representative of the community in devising the GBI policies and implementation actions at local scale through consistent engagement with local administration and local community in the city. The CSOs have emerged as a mediator in aligning intergovernmental relations for implementing the GBI as these CSOs are working with local, provincial, and federal institutions, thus they are key for all tiers of the governments. The major challenges faced by the CSOs are identified: weak linkage and cooperation among local and international organizations, limited financial resources, and weak capacity in local organizations. The role of CSOs appears in an infancy stages but it is emerging with a reasonable pace for effective adaptive governance in relation with the GBI in Pakistan.","Mumtaz, Muhammad",Journal of Cleaner Production,2,1

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of WeChat-based telehealth services on the preoperative follow-up of infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 190 infants with CHD who underwent remote follow-up via WeChat from December 2019 to May 2020 in Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. In addition, the psychological benefits of WeChat on the parents of these infants were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 190 infants were involved in this study, including 72 cases of ventricular septal defects, 42 cases of patent ductus arteriosus, 55 cases of atrial septal defects, 3 cases of tetralogy of Fallot, 2 cases of endocardial cushion defects, 12 cases of pulmonary stenosis, 2 cases of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and 2 cases of aortic arch constriction. During the follow-up period, 48 infants who received surgical indications were hospitalized in time for surgical treatment. It was recommended that 10 infants with respiratory tract infections be treated in local hospitals through the WeChat platform. We provided feeding guidance to 28 infants with dysplasia through the WeChat platform. The psychological evaluation results of parents showed that the median score and range of Self-Rating Depression Scale scores were 42 and 32-58, respectively. Nine parents (4.7%) were clinically depressed, while the majority had mild depression. The median score and range of Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores were 44 and 31-59, respectively.

MicroRNAs (miRs), small noncoding RNAs, play critical roles in cardiovascular dysfunction and related disorders. Intriguingly, there is a critical link among miR-122, cardiovascular fibrosis, sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which was recently identified as a coreceptor for SARS-CoV2 and a negative regulator of the rennin-angiotensin system. MiR-122 overexpression appears to exacerbate the angiotensin II-mediated loss of autophagy and increased inflammation, apoptosis, extracellular matrix deposition, cardiovascular fibrosis and dysfunction by modulating the SIRT6-Elabela-ACE2, LGR4-ß-catenin, TGFß-CTGF and PTEN-PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. More importantly, the inhibition of miR-122 has proautophagic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and antifibrotic effects. Clinical and experimental studies clearly demonstrate that miR-122 functions as a crucial hallmark of fibrogenesis, cardiovascular injury and dysfunction. Additionally, the miR-122 level is related to the severity of hypertension, atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, and miR-122 expression is a risk factor for these diseases. The miR-122 level has emerged as an early-warning biomarker cardiovascular fibrosis, and targeting miR-122 is a novel therapeutic approach against progression of cardiovascular dysfunction. Therefore, an increased understanding of the cardiovascular roles of miR-122 will help the development of effective interventions. This review summarizes the biogenesis of miR-122; regulatory effects and underlying mechanisms of miR-122 on cardiovascular fibrosis and related diseases; and its function as a potential specific biomarker for cardiovascular dysfunction.","Liu, Ying; Song, Jia-Wei; Lin, Jian-Yu; Miao, Ran; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",Cardiovasc Toxicol,2,20

In the present study, we sought to quantify differences in aerosol generation during common ventilation scenarios. We performed a series of 30-second ventilation experiments on porcine larynx-trachea-lung specimens. We used an optical particle sizer to quantify the number of 1- to 10-µm particles observed per 30-second period (PP30). No significant aerosols were observed with ventilation of intubated specimens (10.8 ± 2.4 PP30 vs background 9.5 ± 2.1, P = 1.0000). Simulated coughing through a tracheostomy produced 53.5 ± 25.2 PP30, significantly more than background (P = .0121) and ventilation of an intubated specimen (P = .0401). These data suggest that undisturbed ventilation and thus intubation without stimulation or coughing may be safer than believed. Coughing increases aerosol production, particularly via tracheostomy.

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is considered a mainstream procedure for treating both wound types. Soft tissue deformation stimuli are the crux of NPWT, enhancing cell proliferation and migration from peri-wound tissues which contributes to healing. We developed a dynamic stretching device (DSD) contained in a miniature incubator for applying controlled deformations to fibroblast wound assays. Prior to the stretching experiments, fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well culture plates with elastic substrata and let to reach confluency. Squashing damage was then induced at the culture centers, and the DSD was activated to deliver stretching regimes that represented common clinical NPWT protocols at two peak strain levels, 0.5% and 3%. Analyses of the normalized maximal migration rate (MMR) data for the collective cell movement revealed that for the 3% strain level, the normalized MMR of cultures subjected to a 0.1 Hz stretch frequency regime was ~ 1.4 times and statistically significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that of the cultures subjected to no-stretch (control) or to static stretch (2nd control). Correspondingly, analysis of the time to gap closure data indicated that the closure time of the wound assays subjected to the 0.1 Hz regime was ~ 30% shorter than that of the cultures subjected to the control regimes (p < 0.05). Other simulated NPWT protocols did not emerge as superior to the controls. The present method and system are a powerful platform for further revealing the mechanobiology of NPWT and for improving this technology.","Katzengold, Rona; Orlov, Alexey; Gefen, Amit",,2,16

Early reports from China have highlighted the risks associated with performing endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery in patients with SARS-CoV-2. We present a rare complication of nasoseptal flap (NSF) necrosis associated with COVID-19, further emphasizing the challenges of performing these procedures in this era. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old man underwent an extended endoscopic endonasal transplanum resection of a pituitary macroadenoma for decompression of the optic chiasm. The resulting skull base defect was repaired using a pedicled NSF. The patient developed meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak on postoperative day 13, requiring revision repair of the defect. Twelve days later, he developed persistent fever and rhinorrhea. The patient was reexplored endoscopically, and the NSF was noted to be necrotic and devitalized with evident CSF leakage. At that time, the patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Postoperatively, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and death. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of NSF necrosis in a patient with COVID-19. We postulate that the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 may have contributed to vascular pedicle thrombosis and NSF necrosis. Although the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and its effect on the nasal tissues is still being elucidated, this case highlights some challenges of performing endoscopic skull base surgery in the era of COVID-19.","Talmor, Guy; Grube, Jordon G; Eloy, Jean Anderson; Liu, James K; Hsueh, Wayne D",World Neurosurg,2,24

This action followed a Healthy Distance Sanitary action on March 23rd, 2020. The aim of both measures was to reduce community transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico by lowering the effective contact rate. Using a modification of the Kermack-McKendrick SEIR model we explore the effect of behavioral changes required to lower community transmission by introducing a time-varying contact rate, and the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to suspension of non-essential activities. Our study shows that there exists a trade-off between the proportion of the population under SEM and the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral changes needed to achieve an effective social distancing. This trade-off generates an optimum value for the proportion of the population under strict mitigation measures, significantly below 1 in some cases, that minimizes maximum COVID-19 incidence. We study the population-level impact of three key factors: the implementation of behavior change control measures, the time horizon necessary to reduce the effective contact rate and the proportion of people under SEM in combating COVID-19. Our model is fitted to the available data. The initial phase of the epidemic, from February 17th to March 23rd, 2020, is used to estimate the contact rates, infectious periods and mortality rate using both confirmed cases (by date of symptoms initiation), and daily mortality. Data on deaths after March 23rd, 2020 is used to estimate the mortality rate after the mitigation measures are implemented. Our simulations indicate that the most likely dates for maximum incidence are between late May and early June, 2020 under a scenario of high SEM compliance and low SEM abandonment rate.","Acuña-Zegarra, Manuel Adrian; Santana-Cibrian, Mario; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X",Math Biosci,2,26

The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public's health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans.

This is a systematic review in which the databases of Chocrane, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science as well as reliable journals including Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, Jama and also Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publications were searched.Out of 169 documents discovered during the literature review, 56 ones were somehow related to the association between MMR vaccine and COVID-19, of which 11 ones mentioned the association between these two, and 8 of them contained a hypothesis about this relationship. A quasi-trial study reported the positive effect of the MMR vaccine on reducing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms among those who received it. Also, a cross-sectional study showed an association between the level of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) mumps and COVID-19. Moreover, a genomic data analysis study also reported the effect of Rubella Immunoglobulin G (IgG) level on COVID-19. It seems that due to the similarity of respiratory diseases including measles, rubella, and mumps to COVID-19, MMR vaccine should be investigated more deeply to see if it is effective in order to deal with this novel disease.","Taheri Soodejani, M.; Basti, M.; Tabatabaei, S.

Following detailed in vitro characterization, we chose NM1267 as the most promising candidate showing high affinity binding to several recently described SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and strong neutralizing capacity against a patient isolate of B.1.351 (Beta). To assess if bipNb NM1267 confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo, human ACE2 transgenic mice were treated by intranasal route before infection with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. NM1267-treated mice showed significantly reduced disease progression, increased survival rates and secreted less infectious virus via their nostrils. Histopathological analyses and in situ hybridization further revealed a drastically reduced viral load and inflammatory response in lungs of NM1267-treated mice.

Given the complete shutdown of emission-resources, like traffic, factories, restaurants, and construction sites, responses to this pandemic have wrought unintended consequences in air quality. We assessed air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of PM2.5, PM10, and O3 in Xi & rsquo;an, China, and revealed the relations between air quality and potential emission resources. We gleaned pollutant concentration data of O3, PM2.5, and PM10 from five monitoring sites and identified their trending during the observed periods. We also deployed ArcGIS to interpolate points among data detected by 130 monitoring sites and obtained spatial distribution of pollution during the observed periods. Correlation analysis helped us reveal the relations between pollutants and seven sources. The results showed that during the lockdown section, the concentration of O3 rose by 100.61 %, and those of PM2.5 and PM10 dropped by 22.4 % and 20.7 %, respectively;and during the recovering section, the concentration of PM10 increased by 12.8 %. The spatial distributions also helped us identify two high-polluted areas and two risky areas where PM10 increased sharply. The correlation analysis also implied that decreasing emission sources is the key to improve air quality. Our study also suggests that coordinated control on ozone and particles should be the focus in the future, and the two high-polluted and the two risky areas require immediate administrative interference. Our study can be a valuable reference for public propaganda on green life and governments & rsquo;sustainable development strategies.

Reproductive organs of monocots produce abundant phased, small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). The 21-nt reproductive phasiRNAs triggered by miR2118 are highly enriched in pre-meiotic anthers, and have been found in multiple eudicot species, in contrast with prior reports of monocot specificity. The 24-nt reproductive phasiRNAs are triggered by miR2275, and are highly enriched during meiosis in many angiosperms. Here, we report the widespread presence of the 21-nt reproductive phasiRNA pathway in eudicots including canonical and non-canonical microRNA (miRNA) triggers of this pathway. In eudicots, these 21-nt phasiRNAs are enriched in pre-meiotic stages, a spatiotemporal distribution consistent with that of monocots and suggesting a role in anther development. Although this pathway is apparently absent in well-studied eudicot families including the Brassicaceae, Solanaceae and Fabaceae, our work in eudicots supports an earlier singular finding in spruce, a gymnosperm, indicating that the pathway of 21-nt reproductive phasiRNAs emerged in seed plants and was lost in some lineages.","Pokhrel, Suresh; Huang, Kun; Bélanger, Sébastien; Zhan, Junpeng; Caplan, Jeffrey L; Kramer, Elena M; Meyers, Blake C",Nat Commun,2,16

However, it remains unclear how Aß causes synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss. We hypothesize that one mechanism of Aß-induced synaptic injury is related to the cleavage of amyloid ß precursor protein (APP) at position D664 by caspases that release the putatively cytotoxic C31 peptide. In organotypic slice cultures derived from mice with a knock-in mutation in the APP gene (APP D664A) to inhibit caspase cleavage, Aß-induced synaptic injury is markedly reduced in two models of Aß toxicity. Loss of dendritic spines is also attenuated in mice treated with caspase inhibitors. Importantly, the time-dependent dendritic spine loss is correlated with localized activation of caspase-3 but is absent in APP D664A cultures. We propose that the APP cytosolic domain plays an essential role in Aß-induced synaptic damage in the injury pathway mediated by localized caspase activation.","Park, Goonho; Nhan, Hoang S; Tyan, Sheue-Houy; Kawakatsu, Yusuke; Zhang, Carolyn; Navarro, Mario; Koo, Edward H",Cell Rep,2,16

The focus on superintendents of colour provides important insight into the ways individuals holding the highest rank in school districts govern the instructional, facilities, fiscal, personnel, and community relations matters as they comprehensively prioritise students' academic success and social wellbeing. Given the historicity of marginalisation of people of colour, the current heightened visibility of racial discrimination waged against the Black community, and the disproportionate health risks highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus on the US superintendency is poignantly timely and necessary. Purposely grounding this article in an asset-based approach of exploring the work and lives of superintendents who are not part of the hegemonic norm – by centreing superintendents of colour and women superintendents – we employ a lesser-used tactic of emphasising underexplored leadership experiences to highlight what we can learn from and appreciate about them. In doing so, we mirror the current state of the profession and the ways society influences it. Considering recent increases in efforts to support the humane treatment of Black lives on a global scale, this article corroborates existing evidence detailing the ways educators play a pivotal role in shaping children's lives.

Regional, demographic and COVID-19 related data were captured. RESULTS: 6644 patients were included. In total 0.53% of operated patients contracted COVID-19 (n = 35). The rate of COVID-19 infection was highest during lockdown (2.11%, n = 16) and lowest after lockdown (0.16%, n = 3). Overall mean activity during lockdown was 24.44% of pre-lockdown activity with decreases in trauma, diabetic and elective foot and ankle surgery; the change in elective surgery was most marked with only 1.73% activity during lock down and 10.72% activity post lockdown as compared to pre-lockdown. There was marked regional variation in numbers of cases performed, but the proportion of decrease in cases during and after lockdown was comparable between all regions. There was also a significant difference between rates of COVID-19 and timing of peak, cumulative COVID-19 infections between regions with the highest rate noted in South East England (3.21%). The overall national peak infection rate was 1.37%, occurring during the final week of lockdown. General anaesthetic remained the most common method of anaesthesia for foot and ankle surgery, although a significant increase in regional anaesthesia was witnessed in the lock-down and post-lockdown periods. CONCLUSIONS: National surgical activity reduced significantly for all cases across the country during lockdown with only a slow subsequent increase in elective activity. The COVID-19 infection rate and peaks differed significantly across the country.","Mason, Lyndon W; Malhotra, Karan; Houchen-Wollof, Linzy; Mangwani, Jitendra",Foot ankle surg,2,24

Since its discovery in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to five continents and to this date, affected approximately 6,260,000 people. COVID-19 patients typically present with symptoms related to the respiratory system while neurological manifestations have scarcely been reported. Neurological presentations of COVID-19 infection are classified into two groups: CNS symptoms and peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms. CNS symptoms include headache, dizziness, loss of consciousness, convulsion, ataxia and acute cerebrovascular disease. The PNS symptoms consist of hypoplasia, hyposmia, hypogeusia and neuralgia. The association between COVID-19 and neurological problems needs further clarification and warrants detailed microbiological and pathological studies to better understand the virus and its impact on the brain and nervous system.","Mohseni Afshar, Z.; Babazadeh, A.; Alizadeh Khatir, A.; Mohammadnia-Afrouzi, M.; Javanian, M.; Vasigala, V.

Physiotherapy plays a crucial role in both surgical and conservative treatment of lumbar disc herniation, consequently the current COVID-19 pandemic with concomitant lockdowns has led to a shortage of physiotherapeutical care. In the light of these recent events publicly available physiotherapy tutorials may be a useful tool to address this problem. Aim: The main aim of this study was to assess the quality of online physiotherapy exercise tutorials for lumbar disc herniation. Materials & Methods: With YouTube being a widely known and used platform we screened 240 of the most viewed videos. A total of 76 videos met the inclusion criteria and were statistically analyzed. The videos were assessed using Global Quality Score, DISCERN Score and JAMA benchmark criteria and in regard to their applicability. Results: They displayed a wide range of views (44,969 to 5,448,717), likes (66 to 155,079) and dislikes (6 to 2339). The videos were assessed using Global Quality Score, DISCERN Score and JAMA benchmark criteria and in regard to their applicability. Neither the number of ""Views"", ""Likes"", nor ""Dislikes"" was found to have a significant association with any of the quality measures used in this study. Conclusion: Overall quality grade was determined as ""moderate"". Based on the data examined in this study, the use of YouTube videos as a source of therapy advice for lumbar spine disc herniation cannot be recommended universally.","Heisinger, Stephan; Huber, Dominikus; Matzner, Michael Paul; Hasenoehrl, Timothy; Palma, Stefano; Sternik, Julia; Trost, Carmen; Treiber, Michael; Crevenna, Richard; Grohs, Josef Georg",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),2,20

Healthcare professionals are an important risk group given their exposure. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of symptoms, main concerns as patients, preventive behaviours of healthcare professionals, and the different temporal outcomes associated with the negativization of PCR results. A total of 238 professionals were analysed and follow-up was conducted from 11 March to 21 April 2020 through clinical records, in-depth surveys, and telephone interviews. Symptoms, concerns, and preventive measures were documented, and temporal outcomes (start and end of symptoms, first positive PCR, and negativization of PCR) were analysed through survival analyses. A high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (especially in women and older professionals), fever, cough, and fatigue were reported. The main concern was contagion in the work and home environment. Professionals (especially men) reported low use of face masks before the pandemic. Our analysis indicates that the median times for the negativization of PCR testing to confirm the resolution of infection is 15 days after the end of symptoms, or 25 days after the first positive PCR test. Our results suggest that these times are longer for women and for professionals aged &#8805;55 years, therefore follow-up strategies should be optimized in light of both variables. This is the first study we are aware of to report factors associated with the time to negativization of PCR results. We present the first rigorous estimates of time outcomes and hope that these data can be valuable to continue feeding the prediction models that are currently being developed.

Video-assisted debriefing (VAD) adds audio-visual captures and reviews to support traditional verbal debriefing (VD), but evidence evaluating its educational effects has been mixed, with limited attention focusing on its structure development. AIMS: This study aimed to 1) investigate the effects of a three-phase VAD in enhancing nursing students' debriefing experiences and perceived stress compared to VD and 2) to explore its impact on facilitators' debriefing practices. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was adopted. The quantitative phase involved a prospective controlled trial on 145 nursing students from a university in Singapore who were randomized into the intervention cluster (n = 72) and the control cluster (n = 73). The debriefing experience scale (DES), the stress visual analogue scale (Stress VAS), and the debriefing assessment for simulation in healthcare (DASH© student version) were used as outcome measures. For the qualitative component, a purposive sample of eight facilitators evaluated their own debriefing practices using the DASH© instructor version and each completed an open-ended question survey. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Students from the intervention cluster significantly improved their debriefing experiences (p = 0.01), experienced comparable stress, and had better impressions of VAD facilitators' practices (p < 0.001) compared to those in the control cluster. Repeated VAD significantly reduced students' stress (p < 0.001). Students viewed the VAD facilitators as more effective than the VD facilitators. Three categories were derived from the qualitative comments: the act of debriefing, the crux of VAD, and debriefing for success. CONCLUSION: The three-phase VAD significantly improved nursing students' debriefing experiences without adding extra stress. It also helped to improve facilitators' practices. Future research will benefit from exploring how experts facilitate the three-phase VAD ""on the ground"" and its effect on learning transfer and cost-effectiveness.","Zhang, H; Wang, W; Goh, S H L; Wu, X V; Mörelius, E",Nurse Educ Today,2,16

Therefore, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of antiplatelet treatments on patients with COVID-19 infection. An electronic search was carried out in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Meta-analysis and statistical analyses were completed with using the RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0. A total of 9 articles representing data from 5970 participants were included in this study. The meta-analysis showed antiplatelet agents were not associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.64 to 1.50, P = 0.94;I 2 = 65%), while an adjusted analysis indicated that antiplatelet agents was not associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.40 to 1.06, P = 0.498;I 2 = 0%). The results of this study reveal that while there is no significant benefit on mortality demonstrated with the use of antiplatelet agents, the upper bound of the confidence interval suggests that there is unlikely to be a compelling risk of harm associated with this practice. The benefit and risk of the use of antiplatelet agents should be fully considered especially in the presence of thrombocytopenia status in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Y.; Ao, G.; Nasr, B.; Qi, X.",American Journal of Emergency Medicine,2,13

Although necessary to control spread of the virus and preserve personal protective equipment, this shift highlights existing disparities in access and care. Patients without the skills and tools to access telehealth services may increase their risk of exposure by seeking care in person or may delay care entirely. We know that patients need internet access, devices capable of visual communication, and the skills to use these devices to experience the full benefits of telehealth, yet we also know that disparities are present in each of these areas. Currently, federal programs have given physicians greater flexibility in providing care remotely and have expanded internet access for vulnerable patients to promote telehealth services. However, these changes are temporary and it is uncertain which will remain when the pandemic is over.

Findings were derived from a qualitative approach by conducting thirty-nine interviews at the managerial level of thirty-five independent restaurants in Cairo. During March and April 2020, open-ended interviews were performed, and then analyzed using NVivo 9.0 software. This study successfully documents the decisions and activities related to four aspects (leadership practices, managing stakeholders’ cooperation, operational procedures, and marketing the reputation) used in adapting restaurants in response to COVID-19. It also identifies the barriers to applying the mitigation measures. Though this paper concentrates on Cairo restaurants, the value of this paper lies in being the first managerial-level analytical study documenting the responses to COVID-19 in the restaurant industry. It strengthens the existing literature by highlighting COVID-19’s impact on the restaurant industry and introducing a holistic view of decisions and the actual pandemic’ adopted responses, faced difficulties, and recovery practices within the restaurant industry.

In this scenario, growing apprehension concerning legal consequences is rising among health professionals due to several ethical and legal questions. Even if medical ethicists may approve patients' prioritization protocols, hospitals and health professionals remain highly exposed to liability. The so-called smart-working may be very useful, but it may harbor potential legal harms for health personnel and patients and safety. Moreover, personal umbrella policies also often exclude liability arising out of the transmission of a communicable disease, especially a pandemic state, is declared. Under the pressure of medical associations, Italian Government political forces have very recently presented an amendment to the recently released ordinances for the COVID-19 emergency aimed to reduce medical liability. Presumably, similar epidemics or other wide-scale similar events may happen again in an unpredictable future.

We consider the preferences, comfort, and the perceived naturalness of aspects of piecewise linear paths compared to the same aspects on a smooth path. In a user study, thirty-six subjects (eighteen females) watched panoramic videos of three different paths through a simulated museum in virtual reality and responded to questionnaires regarding each path. We found that comfort had a strong effect on path preference, and that the subjective feeling of naturalness also had a strong effect on path preference, even though people consider different things as natural. We describe a categorization of the responses regarding the naturalness of the robot's motion and provide a recommendation on how this can be applied more broadly. Although immersive robotic telepresence is increasingly being used for remote education, clinical care, and to assist people with disabilities or mobility complications, the full potential of this technology is limited by issues related to user experience. Our work addresses these shortcomings and will enable the future personalization of telepresence experiences for the improvement of overall remote communication and the enhancement of the feeling of presence in a remote location.","Mimnaugh, Katherine J.; Suomalainen, Markku; Becerra, Israel; Lozano, Eliezer; Murrieta-Cid, Rafael; LaValle, Steven M.",,2,1

En este artículo se propone un análisis reflexivo que desmitifique falsos constructos acerca del bajo impacto de la pandemia por COVID-19, a través de una descripción cronológica de los diferentes eventos alrededor de la población infantil, que fueron construyendo los pilares de la infodemia en esta población, planteando tres momentos: el primero, al inicio de la pandemia, con una invisibilización de los niños ante el virus; el segundo momento de estigma bajo la figura de “super contagiadores” y el tercer momento donde se evidencia la crisis consecuencia del fracaso en la comunicación de información en este grupo poblacional. El mundo se enfrenta a la pandemia y además a la necesidad actual de una justicia comunicativa, que incluya a los niños como grupo primario de atención. Con un abordaje desde la determinación social, se plantea una nueva normalidad que incluya el empoderamiento de los niños con información real y clara para combatir, desde su corta edad, el virus de la infodemia.","Cevallos-Robalino, Doménica; Reyes-Morales, Nicolás; Rubio-Neira, Mario",Rev. panam. salud pública,2,27

We aim to describe electrolyte disturbance and explore risk factors for COVID-19 infection in patients visiting the ED. We carried out a case-control study in three hospitals in France, including adult ED inpatients (&#8805; 18 years old). A total of 594 ED case patients in whom infection with COVID-19 was confirmed, were matched to 594 non-COVID-19 ED patients (controls) from the same period, according to sex and age. Hyponatremia was defined by a sodium of less than 135 mmol/L (reference range 135-145 mmol/L), hypokalemia by a potassium of less than 3.5 mmol/L (reference range 3.5-5.0 mmol/L), and hypochloremia by a chloride of less than 95 mmol/L (reference range 98-108 mmol/L). Among both case patients and controls, the median (IQR) age was 65 years (IQR 51-76), and 44% were women. Hyponatremia was more common among case patients than among controls, as was hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Based on the results of the multivariate logistic regression, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia were associated with COVID-19 among case patients overall, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.89 [95% CI 1.24-2.89] for hyponatremia and 1.76 [95% CI 1.20-2.60] for hypokalemia. Hyponatremia and hypokalemia are independently associated with COVID-19 infection in adults visiting the ED, and could act as surrogate biomarkers for the emergency physician in suspected COVID-19 patients.","De Carvalho, Hugo; Richard, Marie Caroline; Chouihed, Tahar; Goffinet, Nicolas; Le Bastard, Quentin; Freund, Yonathan; Kratz, Antoine; Dubroux, Marine; Masson, Damien; Figueres, Lucile; Montassier, Emmanuel",Intern. emerg. med,2,20

At this critical moment, there is an urgent need to identify the eating habits of school students, in particular, who live in low-income countries, during the lockdown period. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the influence of COVID-19 on the eating habits, quality and quantity of food intake among school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 2398 primary and secondary school students aged 6-18 year old through an online questionnaire which included questions on socio-demographic, eating habits as well as quality and quantity of food intake. Students over the age of 11 years completed the questionnaire on their own, whereas for students under the age of 12 years, the students' guardians were instructed to answer the questionnaire on their behalf. A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and McNemar tests were applied to perform a comparison between general dietary habits before and during COVID-19. Also, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to compare the median scores of food quality and quantity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic based on student's sociodemographic. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in eating home-cooked foods (91.6%), avoiding ordering food from outside per week (93.3%) and buying groceries online (7.7%) (p < 0.001). There was a marked increase in the students reporting fear about food hygiene outside the home from 20.8% before COVID-19 to 72.9% during the COVID-19 period (p < 0.001). The results showed that the median score for food quality during the COVID-19 pandemic (11.0/6.0) was significantly higher than the before COVID-19 period (10.0, IQR = 8.0) (p < 0.001). The results revealed that the median score for food quantity before the COVID-19 pandemic (15.0, IQR = 5.0) was significantly higher than the during COVID-19 pandemic (14.0, IQR = 7.0) (p < 0.001). The results showed significant differences between the before and during COVID-19 period for food quality and quantity across socio-demographic variables (gender, age group, parent's highest level of education, monthly household income, and household size). During the COVID-19 pandemic, students from a high-income and a small size family had the highest score in terms of food quality and quantity among other counterparts when compared to other counterparts. CONCLUSION: Eating habits have significantly altered among school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of some good healthy habits enhanced among students, the quantity and the quality of the food was compromised. Therefore, the responsible officials at the Ministry of Education must focus on enhancing school students' awareness towards increased intake of healthy food and adopting good eating habits during the spread of pandemics and health diseases to avoid its negative effects on students.","Radwan, Afnan; Radwan, Eqbal; Radwan, Walaa",Appetite,2,1

SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus genome of around 30Kb. Using next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced at an unprecedented rate and being deposited in public repositories. For the de novo assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a myriad of assemblers is being used, although their impact on the assembly quality has not been characterized for this virus. In this study, we aim to understand the variabilities on assembly qualities due to the choice of the assemblers. RESULTS: We performed 6648 de novo assemblies of 416 SARS-CoV-2 samples using eight different assemblers with different k-mer lengths. We used Illumina paired-end sequencing reads and compared the assembly quality of those assemblers. We showed that the choice of assembler plays a significant role in reconstructing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Two metagenomic assemblers, e.g. MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes, performed better compared with others in most of the assembly quality metrics including, recovery of a larger fraction of the genome, constructing larger contigs and higher N50, NA50 values, etc. We showed that at least 09% (259/2873) of the variants present in the assemblies between MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes are unique to one of the assembly methods. CONCLUSION: Our analyses indicate the critical role of assembly methods for assembling SARS-CoV-2 genome using short reads and their impact on variant characterization. This study could help guide future studies to determine the best-suited assembler for the de novo assembly of virus genomes.","Islam, Rashedul; Raju, Rajan Saha; Tasnim, Nazia; Shihab, Istiak Hossain; Bhuiyan, Maruf Ahmed; Araf, Yusha; Islam, Tofazzal",Brief. bioinform,2,24

The lowest copy number required for virus isolation was determined to be 5.4, 6.0, and 5.7 log10 genome copies/ml sample for detecting the nsp12, E, and N genes, respectively. We further examined the correlation of genome copy number and virus isolation in different regions of the viral genome, demonstrating that culturable specimens are characterized by high copy numbers with a linear correlation observed between copy numbers of amplicons targeting structural and nonstructural regions.

Fair and equitable subject selection in clinical trials offering investigational therapies ought to be an urgent moral concern. Subject selection determines the distribution of risks and benefits, and impacts the applicability of the study results for the larger population. While Research Ethics Committees monitor fair subject selection within each trial, no standard oversight exists for subject selection across multiple trials for the same disease. Drawing on the experience of multiple clinical trials at a single academic medical centre in the USA, we posit that concurrent COVID-19 trials are liable to unfair and inequitable subject selection on account of scientific uncertainty, lack of transparency, scarcity and, lastly, structural barriers to equity compounded by implicit bias. To address the critical gap in the current literature and international regulation, we propose new ethical guidelines for research design and conduct that bolsters fair and equitable subject selection. Although the proposed guidelines are tailored to the research design and protocol of concurrent trials in the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have broader relevance to single COVID-19 trials.","Jansen, Maud O; Angelos, Peter; Schrantz, Stephen J; Donington, Jessica S; Madariaga, Maria Lucia L; Zakrison, Tanya L",J. med. ethics,2,20

In India, a large country of about 1.3 billion people, the disease was first detected on January 30, 2020, in a student returning from Wuhan. The total number of confirmed infections in India as of May 3, 2020, is more than 37,000 and is currently growing fast. OBJECTIVE: Most of the prior research and media coverage focused on the number of infections in the entire country. However, given the size and diversity of India, it is important to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, wherein the situations are quite different. In this paper, we aim to analyze data on the number of infected people in each Indian state (restricted to only those states with enough data for prediction) and predict the number of infections for that state in the next 30 days. We hope that such statewise predictions would help the state governments better channelize their limited health care resources. METHODS: Since predictions from any one model can potentially be misleading, we considered three growth models, namely, the logistic, the exponential, and the susceptible-infectious-susceptible models, and finally developed a data-driven ensemble of predictions from the logistic and the exponential models using functions of the model-free maximum daily infection rate (DIR) over the last 2 weeks (a measure of recent trend) as weights. The DIR is used to measure the success of the nationwide lockdown. We jointly interpreted the results from all models along with the recent DIR values for each state and categorized the states as severe, moderate, or controlled. RESULTS: We found that 7 states, namely, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are in the severe category. Among the remaining states, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar are in the moderate category, whereas Kerala, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, and Telangana are in the controlled category. We also tabulated actual predicted numbers from various models for each state. All the R2 values corresponding to the logistic and the exponential models are above 0.90, indicating a reasonable goodness of fit. We also provide a web application to see the forecast based on recent data that is updated regularly. CONCLUSIONS: States with nondecreasing DIR values need to immediately ramp up the preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the states with decreasing DIR can maintain the same status to see the DIR slowly become zero or negative for a consecutive 14 days to be able to declare the end of the pandemic.","Ghosh, Palash; Ghosh, Rik; Chakraborty, Bibhas",JMIR Public Health Surveill,2,16

Participants in UK Biobank, aged 40 to 69 years at study induction (2006-10), were administered a reaction time test, an indicator of information processing speed, and also had their verbal-numeric reasoning assessed. Between April 1st and September 23rd 2020 there were 388 registry-confirmed deaths (138 women) ascribed to COVID-19 in 494,932 individuals (269,602 women) with a reaction time test result, and 125 such deaths (38 women) in the subgroup of 180,198 people (97,794 women) with data on verbal-numeric reasoning. In analyses adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity, a one standard deviation slower reaction time was related to a higher rate of death from COVID-19 (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval: 1.18; 1.09, 1.28), as was a one standard deviation disadvantage on the verbal-numeric reasoning test (1.32; 1.09, 1.59).

In our study; it was aimed to investigate the value of the radiological involvement on initial CT in demonstrating the ICU transfer and mortality rate of patients Method: All PCR positive patients were included in the study, whose CT, PCR, and laboratory values were obtained simultaneously at the time of first admission. Patients were divided into 4 groups in terms of the extent of radiological lesions. These groups were compared in terms of Intensive care transfer needs and covid-related mortality rates. RESULTS: A total of 477 patients were included in the study. 90 of them were group 0 (no lung involvement), 162 were group 1 (mild lesion), 89 were group 2 (moderate lesion) and 136 were group 3 (severe lung involvement). A significant relationship was found between the extensiveness of the radiological lesion on CT and admission to intensive care and mortality rate. As the initial radiological involvement amounts increased, the rate of ICU transfer and mortality increased. The mortality rates of the groups were 0%, 3%, 12.3%, 12.5%, respectively, and the difference was significant (p<0.001). Similarly; the ICU transfer rates of the groups were 2.2%, 5.6%, 13.5% and 17.7%, respectively, and the difference was significant (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in our study, the strong relationship between the initial radiological extent assessment and the need for intensive care and mortality rates has been demonstrated , and we believe that our results will make a significant contribution to increase the success of the health system in predicting patients who may progress, helping clinicians and managing pandemics.","AydemIr, Yusuf; GÜndÜz, YasemIn; KÖroGlu, Mehmet; Karabay, OGuz; DheIr, Hamad; SengÜl, Aysun; Yaylaci, SelÇuk; KocayIGIt, Havva; Erdem, AlI Fuat; AydemIr, Özlem; GÜÇlÜ, ErtuGrul; YÜrÜmez, Yusuf",Turkish journal of medical sciences,2,1

COVID-19 vaccination was recently launched in Uganda, with prioritization to healthcare workers and high-risk individuals. In this study, we aimed to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine among persons at high risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Uganda. Methods: Between 29 March and 14 April 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional survey consecutively recruiting persons at high risk of severe COVID-19 (diabetes mellitus, HIV and cardiovascular disease) attending Kiruddu National Referral Hospital outpatient clinics. A trained research nurse administered a semi-structured questionnaire assessing demographics, COVID-19 vaccine related attitudes and acceptability. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed using STATA 16. Results: A total of 317 participants with a mean age 51.5 ± 14.1 years were recruited. Of this, 184 (60.5%) were female. Overall, 216 (70.1%) participants were willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine.

Participants who agreed (AOR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01–0.38, p = 0.003) or strongly agreed (AOR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01–0.59, p = 0.005) that they have some immunity against COVID-19 were also significantly less likely to accept the vaccine. Participants who had a history of vaccination hesitancy for their children were also significantly less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.01–0.58, p = 0.016). Conclusion: The willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in this group of high-risk individuals was comparable to the global COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate.

In the current study, we aimed to simultaneously evaluate the prospective influence of life change stress, personal COVID-19 impact, prior mental health, worry about COVID-19, state-level indicators of pandemic threat, and socio-demographic factors on mood and anxiety symptoms in November 2020 among adults and children in the US and UK. We used a longitudinal cohort study using the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) collected at 3 time points: an initial assessment in April 2020 (""April""), a reassessment 3 weeks later (""May""), and a 7-month follow-up in November 2020 (""November""). Online surveys were collected in the United States and United Kingdom by Prolific Academic, a survey recruitment service, with a final sample of 859 Adults and 780 children (collected via parent report). We found subtypes of pandemic-related life change stress in social and economic domains derived through Louvain Community Detection. We assessed recalled mood and perceived mental health prior to the pandemic; worries about COVID-19; personal and family impacts of COVID-19; and socio-demographic characteristics. Levels of mood symptoms in November 2020 measured with the circumplex model of affect. We found 3 life change stress subtypes among adults and children: Lower Social/Lower Economic (adults and children), Higher Social/Higher Economic (adults and children), Lower Social/Higher Economic (adults), and Intermediate Social/Lower Economic (children). Overall, mood symptoms decreased between April and November 2020, but shifting from lower to higher-stress subtypes between time points was associated with increasing symptoms. For both adults and children, the most informative predictors of mood symptoms in November identified by conditional random forest models were prior mood and perceived mental health, worries about COVID, and sources of life change. The relative importance of these predictors was the most prominent difference in findings between adults and children, with lifestyle changes stress regarding friendships being more predictive of mood outcomes than worries about COVID in children. In the US, objective state-level indicators of COVID-19 threat were less predictive of November mood than these other predictors. We found that in addition to the well-established influences of prior mood and worry, heterogeneous subtypes of pandemic-related stress were differentially associated with mood after the initial phase of the pandemic. Greater research on diverse patterns of pandemic experience may elucidate modifiable targets for treatment and prevention.","Nikolaidis, Aki; DeRosa, Jacob; Kass, Mirelle; Droney, Irene; Alexander, Lindsay; Martino, Adriana Di; Bromet, Evelyn; Merikangas, Kathleen; Milham, Michael; Paksarian, Diana",,2,1

OBJECTIVE: This study describes how the COVID-19 pandemic is perceived by CHWs who work in poor communities or slums in Brazil. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with a random sample of 775 CHWs operating in 368 municipalities of the 26 Brazilian states. At a confidence level of 95% , results of the survey were subject to a maximum sampling error of 4% . RESULTS: Our data indicate that the negationist agenda increases the challenges to the performance of CHWs within low-income communities, preventing the consensus on the necessity of social distancing, business closures and other measures to face the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data were collected from a convenient sample of 572 people in Vietnam (118 males, 451 females;M age =27.0 (sd = 10.0)) by a means of an online questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was constructed based on the YouGov Behavior Change questionnaire;the Fear of Coronavirus-19 Scale (FCV-19), WHOQOL-BREF, the Moral Foundation Questionnaire, and Knowledge of Covid-19. This study performed multivariate regression analysis to explore effects of moral, quality of life, knowledge and fear of Coronavirus-19 on health behaviors of participants. Result: The result showed that fear and sex factors explain 4% (R2-adj = 4%) of health behavior change in the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, there is a significant relationship between health behaviors and fear, age, gender, and occupation. Conclusion: People's health behaviors are particularly concerned during the Covid-19 pandemic. Community healthcare activities for the people should be tailored to suit different population groups such as gender, age or emotional experiences. More indepth studies are needed to find out the causes of these differences, thereby proposing practical solutions to help people practice more effective health behaviors, contributing to preventing and combating the outbreak.","Chan, H.

The current study aims to explicitly test whether regeneration policies implemented in deprived Andalusian urban places (southern Spain) moderate the use of anxiolytics and/or antidepressants, taking into consideration families' downward social mobility during the recent period of economic crisis in Spain. We designed a post intervention survey to retrospectively compare the evolution of psychotropic drug consumption in target and comparison areas. We observe a general increase in the use of anxiolytics and/or antidepressants from 2008 to 2015, specifically for people in whose families the economic crisis had the greatest impact (odds ratio = 2.18; p value < 0.001). However, better evolution is observed among residents of the target areas compared with residents of similar urban areas where this kind of polices have been not in force (odds ratio = 0.50; p value < 0.05). Therefore, urban regeneration policies might act as moderators of the risk of mental health, particularly when people are subject to the loss of individual/family resources in urban vulnerable contexts.","Zapata Moya, Ángel R; Navarro Yáñez, Clemente J",J Hous Built Environ,2,29

We explain why some universities used social media to communicate with stakeholders sooner than others. To do so, we identified the date of the first Covid-19 related tweet posted by each university in the country and used survival models to estimate the effect of university-specific characteristics on the timing of these messages. In order to confirm our results, we supplemented our analysis with a study of the introduction of coronavirus-related university webpages. We find that universities with large numbers of students are more likely to use social media and the web to speak about the pandemic sooner than institutions with fewer students. Universities with large financial resources are also more likely to tweet sooner, but they do not introduce Covid-19 webpages faster than other universities. We also find evidence of a strong process of emulation, whereby universities are more likely to post a coronavirus-related tweet or webpage if other universities have already done so.","Quiroz Flores, Alejandro; Liza, Farhana; Quteineh, Husam; Czarnecka, Barbara",PLoS One,2,33

With the development of technology, online education has been growing rapidly over the past decade. While there are several online education studies on student behavior analysis, the course concept mining, and course recommendations (Feng, Tang, and Liu 2019; Pan et al. 2017), there is little research on evaluating teachers' performance in online education. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study to understand and effectively predict teachers' performance using the subtitles of 1,085 online courses. Our model-free analysis shows that teachers' verbal cues (e.g., question strategy, emotional appealing, and hedging) and their course structure design are both significantly correlated with teachers' performance evaluation. Based on these insights, we then propose a hierarchical course BERT model to predict teachers' performance in online education. Our proposed model can capture the hierarchical structure within each course as well as the deep semantic features extracted from the course content. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves significant gain over several state-of-the-art methods. Our study provides a significant social impact in helping teachers improve their teaching style and enhance their instructional material design for more effective online teaching in the future.","Wang, Wen; Zhuang, Honglei; Zhou, Mi; Liu, Hanyu; Li, Beibei",,2,1

To accelerate our understanding of the host-pathogen response to respiratory viruses, the use of more complex in vitro systems such as normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell culture models has gained prominence as an alternative to animal models. NHBE cells were differentiated under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions to form an in vitro pseudostratified epithelium. The responses of well-differentiated (wd) NHBE cells were examined following infection with the 2009 pandemic Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strain or following challenge with the dsRNA mimic, poly(I:C). At 30 h postinfection with H1N1pdm09, the integrity of the airway epithelium was severely impaired and apical junction complex damage was exhibited by the disassembly of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) from the cell cytoskeleton. wdNHBE cells produced an innate immune response to IAV-infection with increased transcription of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the antiviral viperin but reduced expression of the mucin-encoding MUC5B, which may impair mucociliary clearance. Poly(I:C) produced similar responses to IAV, with the exception of MUC5B expression which was more than 3-fold higher than for control cells. This study demonstrates that wdNHBE cells are an appropriate ex-vivo model system to investigate the pathogenesis of respiratory viruses.","Pharo, Elizabeth A; Williams, Sinéad M; Boyd, Victoria; Sundaramoorthy, Vinod; Durr, Peter A; Baker, Michelle L",Viruses,2,6

Being in quarantine is a distinct experience where space-time duality loses its genuine meaning. Quarantine, by its very nature, is the spatialization of uncertainty in different ways, from uncertainty of being infected, of being healthy by segregating, of being in the safe zone, and of being isolated for an infinite time. Besides all these uncertainties, awareness of impossibility of keeping place of isolation pure from the ubiquitous microorganism causes this imposed seclusion to be seemed in vain. Hence, instead of panicking futilely, reflecting upon the new awareness that has emerged out of crisis will be an emancipatory path.","Valizadeh, Paria",Space Cult.,2,16

Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D­dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. CONCLUSION: We recommend the determination of D­dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started. All inpatient CoViD-19 patients should receive thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin.

Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs/aspirates from 35 patients were tested using a PCR method (Serplex® RV15 Onestep ACE Detection), detecting 15 respiratory viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, rhinovirus (RV), metapneumovirus, boccavirus and enterovirus). Results Patients were 2–24 yrs old (AVR 12 y), 13 chronically colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Lung function test for 30 subjects showed: 9 normal findings; 11 mild, 7 moderate and 3 severe lung disease. There was no significant difference regarding lung function or PA status between the subgroups of patients positive or negative for viruses.

The interaction of SP with ACE2 and these proteases results in the SARS-CoV-2 invasion and fast epidemic spread. The small molecular inhibitors are reported to limit the interaction of SP with ACE2 and other proteases. Arbidol, a membrane fusion inhibitor approved for influenza virus is currently undergoing clinical trials against COVID-19. In this context, we report some analogues of arbidol designed by scaffold morphing and structure-based designing approaches with a superior therapeutic profile.

The purpose of this study was to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information and claims seen and believed about COVID-19 early in the pandemic among U.S. adults. Then, we assessed the impact of believing such claims on engaging in personal protective actions (PPA). Methods: We used baseline data from the CHASING COVID Cohort (n = 7,070) collected March 28, 2020 to April 20, 2020 to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information as well as claims circulating on social media that had been seen and believed. We used Poisson regression to determine the association of believing certain claims with engaging in a higher number of PPA. Results: The top three trusted sources of COVID-19 information were the CDC (67.9%), the WHO (53.7%), and State Health Departments (53.0%). Several COVID-19 claims circulated on social media had been seen, e.g., that the virus was created in a laboratory (54.8%). Moreover, substantial proportions of participants indicated agreement with some of these claims. In multivariable regression, we found that belief in certain claims was associated with engaging in a higher number of PPA. For example, believing that paper masks would prevent transmission of the virus was associated with engaging in a higher number of protective actions ({beta} = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.004 - 0.046). Conclusions: Results suggest the need for public health leadership on social media platforms to combat misinformation and supports social media as a tool to further public health interventions.","Westmoreland, D.

Since its first report, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic, with over 10 million human infections and over 560,000 deaths reported worldwide at the end of June 2020. Currently, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and/or antivirals licensed against SARS-CoV-2. The high economical and health impacts of SARS-CoV-2 has placed global pressure on the scientific community to identify effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. While some compounds have been already reported to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and a handful of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for the development and standardization of assays which can be used in high through-put screening (HTS) settings to identify new antivirals and/or neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described a rapid, accurate, and highly reproducible plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay that can be quickly adapted for the identification and characterization of both neutralizing mAbs and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, our MNA is compatible with HTS settings to interrogate large and/or complex libraries of mAbs and/or antivirals to identify those with neutralizing and/or antiviral activity, respectively, against SARS-CoV-2.","Park, Jun-Gyu; Oladunni, Fatai S.; Chiem, Kevin; Ye, Chengjin; Pipenbrink, Michael; Moran, Thomas; Walter, Mark R.; Kobie, James; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",J Virol Methods,2,2

METHODS: This cross‐sectional, analytical and retrospective study included all patients aged ≥18 years (n = 502) who were hospitalised in Samsun, Turkey, for COVID‐19 and were given favipiravir from the date between 25 March 2020 and 3 June 2020. RESULTS: In total, 58.6% (n = 294) of the patients were male and 24.5% (n = 123) were between the ages of 71 and 80 years. During the first case process, the mortality rate was 19.9%, whereas the rate of those who were discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days was 37.3%. During the second case process, the mortality rate was 6.2%, and the rate of those who was discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days was 65.6%. The mean length of hospital stay was 10.61 ± 8.17 days for the first and 7.97 ± 4.16 days for the second hospitalisation; this difference was significant. Mortality risk of those who used Tocilizumab or vitamin C beside Favipiravir was higher than those who did not. The length of hospital stay was higher in patients using tocilizumab than in those who did not (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Administration of favipiravir later in the course of the disease makes it difficult to achieve the true efficacy expected from the drug and also makes it difficult for other combination drugs to contribute to survival. Favipiravir may also be effective in case of recurrence.","Oruç, Muhammet Ali; Öz, Hatice; Öztürk, Onur",Int J Clin Pract,2,24

METHODS: This comparative study included COVID-19 patients diagnosed by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based test at our hospital with mild to moderate disease. The demographic details and detailed clinical history of the patient, including history of loss of smell and taste was taken at the time of presentation. The patients were divided into 2 groups, group A: COVID-19 patients with OTD; group B: COVID-19 patients without OTD. 100 contiguous patients were recruited in each group. The COVID-19 test by RT-PCR was done and Ct value of the 3 genes: E (Envelope encoding) gene, N (Nucleocapsid encoding) gene, and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene, was used for data analysis. The Ct values of each of the three genes were compared between groups A and B. RESULTS: Group A and B did not differ significantly in terms of basic demographics. The differences in the Ct values of the 3 genes E gene, N gene and RdRp gene, of group A and B were found to be statistically significant (p = 0.005, p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: The patients with OTD had a lower Ct value at diagnosis, and hence, a higher viral load than those without OTD. The evaluation of Ct value and viral load in COVID-19 patients may help in further reducing the transmission of the virus in the community.","Jain, Avani; Pandey, A.K.; Kaur, Jasleen; Kumar, Lakshit; Singh, Mitasha; Das, Suman; Purohit, Sandeep",Am J Otolaryngol,2,1

The possible interspecies transmission of SARSr-CoVs from bats to humans has caused two severe CoV pandemics, the SARS pandemic in 2003 and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The receptor utilization of SARSr-CoV plays the key role in viral infection in determining the host range and the interspecies transmission ability of the virus. Both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor. Previous studies showed that WIV1 strain, the first living coronavirus isolated from bat using ACE2 as its receptor, is the prototype of SARS-CoV. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and WIV1 is responsible for ACE2 binding and medicates the viral entry. Comparing to human SARS-CoV, the bat WIV1 has three distinct amino acid residues (442, 472, and 487) in RBD. This study aimed at exploring whether these three residues could alter the receptor utilization of SARSr-CoVs. We replaced the three residues in SARS-CoV (BJ01 strain) S with their counterparts in WIV1 S, and then evaluated the change of their utilization of bat, civet, and human ACE2s using a lentiviral pseudovirus infection system. To further validate the S-ACE2 interactions, the binding affinity between the RBDs of these S proteins and different ACE2s were verified by flow cytometry. The results showed that the single amino acid substitution Y442S in the RBD of the SARS-CoV BJ01 spike protein enhanced its utilization of bat ACE2 and its binding affinity to bat ACE2. On the contrary, the reverse substitution in WIV1 S (S442Y) significantly attenuated the pseudovirus utilization of bat, civet and human ACE2s for cell entry, and the binding affinity was also decreased notably. These results suggest that the S442 is critical for WIV1 adapting in bats as its natural host. These findings will enhance our understanding of host adaptations and cross-species infections of coronaviruses, contributing to the prediction and prevention of coronavirus epidemics.","Li, Jin-Yan; Wang, Qiong; Liao, Ce-Heng; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xing-Yi",Virus Res,2,21

Within this retrospective cohort study, we systematically reviewed data of all 16,785 pediatric patients (<18 years admitted to our clinical center between January 2018 and June 2021). Data on SARS-CoV-2 test numbers, hospital admissions and clinical characteristics of infected patients were collected. Since January 2020, a total of 2513 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed. In total, 36 patients had a positive test result. In total, 25 out of 36 SARS-CoV-2 positive children showed at least mild clinical symptoms while 11 were asymptomatic. Most common clinical symptoms were fever (60%), cough (60%) and rhinitis (20%). In parallel with the rising slope of SARS-CoV-2 in spring and fall 2020, we observed a slight decrease in the number of patients admitted to the pediatric department while the median duration of hospital treatment and intensive care occupancy remained unchanged. This study underlines that SARS-CoV-2 infected children most frequently exhibit an asymptomatic or mild clinical course. Noteworthy, the number of hospital admissions went down during the pandemic. The health and economic consequences need to be discussed within health care society and politics.","Busch, Christine; Blickle, Maximilian; Schmidt, Beatrix; Sievers, Laura Katharina; Pfitzer, Constanze",Healthcare (Basel),2,1

METHODS: All 302 consecutive patients who were admitted to our institutions and diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and December 2020 were retrospectively assessed. Ultimately, 210 adult patients exhibiting no or mild symptoms on admission were included in the analysis. They were categorized into the stable (no oxygen needed) and worsened (oxygen needed) groups, and their characteristics and laboratory data were compared. RESULTS: Among 210 patients, 49 progressed to a severe disease stage, whereas 161 did not. The mean patient age was 52.14 years, and 126 (60.0%) patients were male. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.0 kg/m(2), and 71 patients were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2)). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that old age, overweight, diabetes mellitus (DM), and high serum ferritin levels were independent risk factors for disease progression.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a 37-item survey was distributed via email and social media in May 2020 through REDCap online software. All licensed community pharmacists in Puerto Rico (N = 1200) were invited to complete the survey. Retired community pharmacists were excluded. Analysis of frequencies and chi-square tests were performed to evaluate the willingness to test, treat and immunize for COVID-19 and their associations with sociodemographic variables. KEY FINDINGS: The survey response rate was 26% (314/1200). Subjects’ mean age was 42 (±13), 86.1% were female, and most practiced in independent community or specialty pharmacy (62%). Among respondents, 44% reported willingness to test. Top concerns for testing were family (73.4%) and self (66.8%) exposure and ability to manage the workflow (53.3%). Most participants indicated their willingness to treat (88.4%) and to administer the COVID-19 vaccine (76.1%). Study participants who worked in retail pharmacies were more willing to test for COVID-19 (50.9%, P = 0.34) and to immunize (91.2%, P < 0.001). Pharmacists ≤39 years (90.3%), those who graduate in 2000 or later (88.3%), and those with a Pharm.D. degree or higher (88.6%), were more willing to immunize (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most community pharmacists were more willing to treat and immunize, than to perform COVID-19 testing. This underscores the need for training and workflow changes to facilitate the acquisition of this new role. Local pharmacists’ associations should advocate for a safe and manageable work environment.

With population ageing, the number of people living with vision impairment is set to increase in the decades ahead. Vision impairment may negatively impact an individual's ability to safely drive. The association between vision impairment and motor vehicle crash involvement or driving participation has yet to be systematically investigated. Further, the evidence for the effectiveness of vision-related interventions aimed at decreasing crashes and driving errors has not been synthesised. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A search will be conducted for relevant studies on Medline (Ovid), EMBASE and Global Health from their inception to March 2020 without date or geographical restrictions. Two investigators will independently screen abstracts and full texts using Covidence software with conflicts resolved by a third investigator. Data extraction will be conducted on all included studies, and their quality assessed to determine the risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. Outcome measures include crash risk, driving cessation and surrogate measures of driving safety (eg, driving errors and performance). The results of this review will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guideline. Meta-analysis will be undertaken for outcomes with sufficient data and reported following the Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline. Where statistical pooling is not feasible or appropriate, narrative summaries will be presented following the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis in systematic reviews guideline.

PD-associated αSyn (αSyn(PD)) aggregates can act as proteinaceous nuclei (“seeds”) able of self-templated propagation. Since this is strikingly reminiscent to properties of proteinaceous infectious particles (prions), lessons learned from prion diseases suggest to test whether transferred αSyn(PD) can propagate and induce neurological impairments or disease in a new host. Two studies that addressed this question provided divergent results. Intracerebral (i.c.) injection of Lewy body extracts from PD patients caused cerebral αSyn pathology, as well as nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, of wild-type mice and macaques, with the mice also showing motor impairments (Recasens et al. 2014, Ann Neurol 75:351–362). In contrast, i.c. transmission of homogenates from PD brains did not stimulate, after “> 360” days post-injection (dpi), pathological αSyn conversion or clinical symptoms in transgenic TgM83(+/−) mice hemizygously expressing mutated (A53T) human αSyn (Prusiner et al. 2015, PNAS 112:E5308–E5317). To advance the assessment of possible αSyn(PD) hazards by providing further data, we examined neuropathological and clinical effects upon i.c. transmission of brain, stomach wall and muscle tissue as well as blood from PD patients in TgM83(+/−) mice up to 612 dpi. This revealed a subtle, yet distinctive stimulation of localized αSyn aggregation in the somatodendritic compartment and dystrophic neurites of individual or focally clustered cerebral neurons after challenge with brain and stomach wall homogenates. No such effect was observed with transmitted blood or homogenized muscle tissue. The detected stimulation of αSyn aggregation was not accompanied by apparent motor impairments or overt neurological disease in TgM83(+/−) mice.

The programs were successfully tested using data from advanced outbreak trajectories (Italy and Spain). The procedure was applied to data reported by Argentina. The projected total death toll will be 182 (277-182) with a peak of deaths (6(+/-2)) the 14 of April. The outbreak begins the 9th of March and end completely the 20th of May. However, already on 1st of May, 2 s (95.45%) of the deaths have occurred. The death toll arises from a number of infected individuals between 36412 and 2275. Then, they were to use to process data from several Southern Hemisphere countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Chile, Panama, Australia, Bolivia, Honduras, New Zealand, Paraguay, Guatemala, Venezuela, Uruguay, El Salvador, Jamaica, Haiti, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The trend is to show low number of total deaths compared with other disease outbreaks. A total projected number of deaths between 15148 and 9939 deaths for a total population of ca. 664 M inhabitants. The projected death toll is much lower (5-10 times) than those forecasted by the Imperial College Group (ICG) even considering the best scenario of total suppression of virus transmission. Using actual mortality rates it is possible to back calculate which number of infected individuals would produce such mortality. The calculated number of infected individuals (worst case scenario) is below 2.5 million. This is significantly lower than that calculated by ICG (> 45 millions). In most countries the outbreak will end in May or early June. The dynamics of the outbreaks seems to do not saturate the health services (hospital beds) but only Peru, Ecuador and Panama should have not enough ICU beds for grave COVID-19 patients","barbero, cesar a",,2,23

However, the fast production of COVID-19 vaccines has caused concern among the general public regarding their safety and efficacy. In particular, patients with chronic illnesses, such as celiac disease (CD), may be more fearful. Information on vaccine hesitancy plays a pivotal role in the development of an efficient vaccination campaign. In our study, we aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Italian CD patients. (2) Methods: an anonymous questionnaire was sent to CD patients followed at our tertiary referral center for CD in Milan, Italy. Patients were defined as willing, hesitant and refusing. We evaluated the reasons for hesitancy/refusal and the possible determinants, calculating crude and adjusted odds ratios [AdjORs] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]. (3) Results: the questionnaire was sent to 346 patients with a response rate of 29.8%. Twenty-six (25.2%) of the 103 respondents were hesitant, with a total refusal rate of 4.8%. The main reason was fear of adverse events related to vaccination (68.2%). Among hesitant patients, 23% declared that their opinion was influenced by their CD. The determinants positively influencing willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 were adherence to a GFD, perception of good knowledge about COVID-19 and its vaccines, and a positive attitude to previous vaccines (AdjOR 12.71, 95% CI 1.82–88.58, AdjOR 6.50, 95% CI 1.44–29.22, AdjOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.11–4.34, respectively). (4) Conclusions: CD patients should be vaccinated against COVID-19 and a specific campaign to address the determinants of hesitancy should be developed.","Costantino, Andrea; Topa, Matilde; Roncoroni, Leda; Doneda, Luisa; Lombardo, Vincenza; Stocco, Davide; Gramegna, Andrea; Costantino, Claudio; Vecchi, Maurizio; Elli, Luca",Vaccines (Basel),2,10

The aetiology is usually bacterial or viral, but malaria can cause a syndrome indistinguishable from clinical pneumonia. There is no method with high sensitivity to detect a bacterial infection in these patients and, as result, antibiotics are frequently overprescribed. Conversely, unrecognised concomitant bacterial infection in patients with malarial infections occur with omission of antibiotic therapy from patients with bacterial infections. Previously, we identified two combinations of blood proteins with 96% sensitivity and 86% specificity for detecting bacterial disease. The current project aimed to validate and improve these combinations by evaluating additional biomarkers in paediatric patients with clinical pneumonia. Our goal was to describe combinations of a limited number of proteins with high sensitivity and specificity for bacterial infection to be incorporated in future point-of-care tests. Furthermore, we seek to explore signatures to prognosticate clinical pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients (n=900) aged 2–59 months presenting with clinical pneumonia at two Gambian hospitals will be enrolled and classified according to criteria for definitive bacterial aetiology (based on microbiological tests and chest radiographs). We will measure proteins at admission using Luminex-based immunoassays in 90 children with definitive and 160 with probable bacterial aetiology, and 160 children classified according to the prognosis of their disease. Previously identified diagnostic signatures will be assessed through accuracy measures. Moreover, we will seek new diagnostic and prognostic signatures through machine learning methods, including support vector machine, penalised regression and classification trees. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from the Gambia Government/Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia Joint Ethics Committee (protocol 1616) and the institutional review board of Boston University Medical Centre (STUDY00000958). Study results will be disseminated to the staff of the study hospitals, in scientific seminars and meetings, and in publications.

Despite this, many government agencies and members of the general public may be resistant to NPI adoption. We sought to understand public attitudes and beliefs regarding various NPIs and self-reported adoption of NPIs, and explore associations between NPI performance and the baseline characteristics of respondents. We performed a cross-sectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005 respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would not reduce their personal risk of illness. Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with 30.6% and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 (OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p=0.014) and with a belief that the NPIs were not difficult to perform (OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31], p<0.0001). Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently. NPI non-adherence is associated with both outcome expectations (belief that NPIs are effective) and process expectations (belief that NPIs are not overly inconvenient); these findings have important implications for designing public health outreach efforts, where the feasibility, as well as the effectiveness, of NPIs should be stressed.","Kantor, Bella Nichole; Kantor, Jonathan",,2,24

In this study, one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays were developed to differentiate B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages. The assays were evaluated using in vitro transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R 2 =0.99), and high specificity. Using the developed rRT-PCR assays, 169 clinical specimens collected between 2010 and 2013 were then tested, resulting in the identification of 20 clinical specimens as positive for influenza B virus. Of these, 14 and 6 samples were identified as positive for the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, respectively, whereas 149 samples were negative for the influenza B virus. The rRT-PCR assays were also examined using 20 clinical isolates from 20 influenza B virus-positive specimens, revealing that there was no discrepancy between the results from the rRT-PCR assays and the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, with the exception that one clinical isolate with different antigenicity could not be discriminated by the HI test. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific assays are useful not only for diagnosing influenza viruses but also for their surveillance.","Nakauchi, Mina; Takayama, Ikuyo; Takahashi, Hitoshi; Oba, Kunihiro; Kubo, Hideyuki; Kaida, Atsushi; Tashiro, Masato; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Journal of Virological Methods,2,24

This is expected to have affected the mental health situation, including increasing risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression in the general population. Persons with prior mental health difficulties could be an especially vulnerable group, however, few studies have tested this empirically considering preexisting mental health difficulties. We examine the association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and anxiety/depression during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a longitudinal community sample. METHODS: A longitudinal follow-up during lockdown (data collection March–June 2020) was implemented among participants of the TEMPO cohort. Prior knowledge of anxiety/depression was included from prior waves of data collection. Generalized estimation equations models were used to estimate the association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown among 662 mid-aged individuals. RESULTS: Individuals with symptoms of anxiety/depression measured prior to lockdown had 6.73 higher odds [95% CI = 4.45–10.17] of symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown. Additionally, the likelihood of symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown was elevated among women (OR = 2.07 [95% CI = 1.32–3.25]), subjects with low household income (OR = 2.28 [1.29–4.01]) and persons who reported being lonely (OR = 3.94 [95% CI = 2.47–6.28]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study underlines the role of preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression as a vulnerability factor of anxiety/depression during lockdown. Interventions focusing on individuals with mental health difficulties as well as people feeling lonely should be considered, to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-19), is a multi-system inflammatory disease with many of COVID-19-positive patients requiring intensive medical care due to multi-organ failures. Biomarkers to reliably predict the patient’s clinical cause of the virus infection, ideally, to be applied in point of care testing or through routine diagnostic approaches, are highly needed. We aimed to probe if routinely assessed clinical lab values can predict the severity of the COVID-19 course. Therefore, we have retrospectively analyzed on admission laboratory findings in 224 consecutive patients from four hospitals and show that systemic immune inflammation index (SII) is a potent marker for predicting the requirement for invasive ventilator support and for worse clinical outcome of the infected patient. Patients’ survival and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection could reliably be predicted at admission by calculating the systemic inflammatory index of individual blood values. We advocate this approach to be a feasible and easy-to-implement assay that may be particularly useful to improve patient management during high influx crisis.

This scoping review aimed to examine the effectiveness of intermediate care including transitional care interventions for middle-aged and older adults on function, healthcare utilisation, and costs. DESIGN: A scoping review of the literature was conducted including studies published between 2002 and 2019 with a transitional care and/or intermediate care intervention for adults aged ≥ 50. Searches were performed in CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Open Grey and PubMed databases. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were employed for data synthesis. RESULTS: In all, 133 studies were included. Interventions were grouped under four models of care: (a) Hospital-based transitional care (n = 8), (b) Transitional care delivered at discharge and up to 30 days after discharge (n = 70), (c) Intermediate care at home (n = 41), and (d) Intermediate care delivered in a community hospital, care home or post-acute facility (n = 14). While these models were associated with a reduced hospital stay, this was not universal. Intermediate including transitional care services combined with telephone follow-up and coaching support were reported to reduce short and long-term hospital re-admissions. Evidence for improved ADL function was strongest for intermediate care delivered by an interdisciplinary team with rehabilitation at home. Study design and types of interventions were markedly heterogenous, limiting comparability. CONCLUSIONS: Although many studies report that intermediate care including transitional care models reduce hospital utilisation, results were mixed. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of these services on function, institutionalisation, emergency department attendances, or on cost-effectiveness.

This study reviewed the current laws and regulations, government reports and policy documents, and existing literature on zoonotic disease preparedness and prevention across the forestry, agriculture, and public health authorities in China, to articulate the current landscape of potential risks, existing mandates, and gaps. A total of 55 known zoonotic diseases (59 pathogens) are routinely monitored under a multi-sectoral system among humans and domestic and wild animals in China. These diseases have been detected in wild mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish or other aquatic animals, the majority of which are transmitted between humans and animals via direct or indirect contact and vectors. However, this current monitoring system covers a limited scope of disease threats and animal host species, warranting expanded review for sources of disease and pathogen with zoonotic potential. In addition, the governance of wild animal protection and utilization and limited knowledge about wild animal trade value chains present challenges for zoonotic disease risk assessment and monitoring, and affect the completeness of mandates and enforcement. A coordinated and collaborative mechanism among different departments is required for the effective monitoring and management of disease emergence and transmission risks in the animal value chains. Moreover, pathogen surveillance among wild animal hosts and human populations outside of the routine monitoring system will fill the data gaps and improve our understanding of future emerging zoonotic threats to achieve disease prevention. The findings and recommendations will advance One Health collaboration across government and non-government stakeholders to optimize monitoring and surveillance, risk management, and emergency responses to known and novel zoonotic threats, and support COVID-19 recovery efforts.","Li, Hongying; Chen, Yufei; Machalaba, Catherine C.; Tang, Hao; Chmura, Aleksei A.; Fielder, Mark D.; Daszak, Peter",One Health,2,30

Studies show the need for contextually relevant, granular understandings of specific aspects of student mental health and well-being. METHODS: A survey was conducted at two time points – at the beginning and end of the academic year – at a large, urban university in South Africa. The Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, the Flourishing Scale, and the Fragility of Happiness Scale were used in the testing of undergraduate students from a variety of scientific disciplines. Two separate comparisons were made, based on the baseline data (n = 551) and the follow-up data (n = 281). In Comparison 1 (baseline, n = 443; follow-up, n = 173), two independent, biographically (very) similar groups were compared. Comparison 2 (n = 108) compared the results from the baseline and follow-up of the same group of students who completed the instruments at both time points. RESULTS: Results indicate a significant decline in mental health and well-being for both groups (independent and dependent) over the course of the academic year. Both follow-up groups were found to have lower psychological, emotional and social well-being, psychological flourishing, and reduced mental health, in comparison with the baseline groups. CONCLUSIONS: The statistically significant decreases in the mental health and well-being of participants in this study indicate the need for substantive interventions to support student mental health and well-being.

However, venous thromboembolism (VTE) appears to be a common complication among patients with COVID-19 even with adequate anticoagulation during hospitalization. VTE may confer a poor outcome on its own or may exacerbate other common complications such as ARDS or cardiac injury. There are several diagnostic dilemmas with regards confirming VTE among patients with COVID-19 as there is a move to reduce the transfer of patients for angiographic studies or even venous Doppler ultrasonography because of the high transmissibility SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: The general recommendations included working remotely when feasible, implementation of screening/safety and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines, social distancing, regular cleaning of treatment environment, and testing for high-risk patients/procedures. All teaching conferences, tumor boards, and weekly chart rounds were conducted using a virtual platform. Additionally, specific recommendations were given to each section to ensure proper patient treatments. The impact of these measures, especially adaptability and resilience, were evaluated through specific questionnaire surveys. Results: These comprehensive COVID-19-related measures resulted in most staff expressing a consistent level of satisfaction in regard to personal safety, maintaining a safe work environment, continuing quality patient care, and continuing educational activities during the pandemic. There was a significant reduction in patient treatments and on-site patient visits with an appreciable increase in the number of telemedicine e-visits. Conclusions: Survey results demonstrated substantial adaptability and resilience, including in the rapid recovery of departmental activities during the reactivation phase. In the event of a future public health emergency, the measures implemented may be adopted with good outcomes by radiation oncology departments across the globe.","Das, Indra J.; Kalapurakal, John A.; Strauss, Jonathan B.; Zawislak, Brian R.; Gopalakrishnan, Mahesh; Bajaj, Amishi; Mittal, Bharat B.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2,26

We used indirect standardisation (using Italy as the reference) to compute SMRs and considered 16 indicators of health and social well-being, health system capacity and COVID-19 response. The highest SMRs were in Belgium, the UK and Spain in the first wave (1.20–1.84) and in Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia in the subsequent waves (2.50–2.69). Human Development Index (HDI), life expectancy, urbanisation and healthcare expenditure had positive correlations with SMR in the first wave (rho=0.30–0.46), but negative correlations (rho=−0.67 to −0.47) in the subsequent waves. Retail/recreation mobility and transit mobility were negatively correlated with SMR in the first wave, while transit mobility was inversely correlated with SMR in the subsequent waves. The first wave hit most hard countries with high HDI, high life expectancy, high urbanisation, high health expenditures and high tourism. This pattern may reflect higher early community seeding and circulation of the virus. Conversely, in the subsequent waves, this pattern was completely inversed: countries with more resources and better health status did better than eastern European countries. While major SMR differences existed across countries in the first wave, these differences largely dissipated by 23 June 2021, with few exceptions.","Villani, Leonardo; Pastorino, Roberta; Ricciardi, Walter; Ioannidis, John; Boccia, Stefania",BMJ Glob Health,2,17

Here, we describe clinical, laboratory, and histological findings of two pediatric cases with almost exclusive kidney involvement by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A 10-year-old girl with IgA vasculitis nephritis underwent kidney biopsy, showing diffuse and segmental mesangial-proliferative glomerulonephritis, and steroid therapy was initiated. After the worsening of the clinical picture, including an atypical skin rash, she was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The re-evaluation of initial biopsy showed cytoplasmatic blebs and virus-like particles in tubular cells at electron microscopy. Despite SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the intensification of immunosuppression, no improvement was observed. A second kidney biopsy showed a crescentic glomerulonephritis with sclerosis, while virus-like particles were no longer evident. The second patient was a 12-year-old girl with a 3-week history of weakness and weight loss. Rhinitis was reported the month before. No medications were being taken. Blood and urine analysis revealed elevated serum creatinine, hypouricemia, low molecular weight proteinuria, and glycosuria. A high SARS-CoV-2-IgG titre was detected. Kidney biopsy showed acute tubular-interstitial nephritis. Steroid therapy was started with a complete resolution of kidney involvement. CONCLUSION: We can speculate that in both cases SARS-CoV-2 played a major role as inflammatory trigger of the kidney damage. Therefore, we suggest investigating the potential kidney damage by SARS-CoV-2 in children. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can be included among infectious agents responsible for pediatric acute tubular interstitial nephritis.","Serafinelli, Jessica; Mastrangelo, Antonio; Morello, William; Cerioni, Valeria Fanny; Salim, Adib; Nebuloni, Manuela; Montini, Giovanni",Pediatr Nephrol,2,1

A cross-sectional study via an internet questionnaire was utilized to elucidate changes in compliance to protective behavior among the Israeli population (n = 1120), after the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Comparison was made between individuals who were previously infected with the virus, those who received one dose of inoculation with the vaccine, and individuals that were neither infected or vaccinated. The study results indicate that those who were previously infected with the COVID-19 virus were less careful about mask wearing (18.8%) and social distancing (29.7%), as compared to the other examined groups (regarding mask wearing, 8.2% and 11.6% respectively, and with regard to social distancing 12.8% and 19.2%), and may require targeted risk communication campaigns to address this population. Furthermore, the study revealed that those that were non-Jewish (as compared to Jewish study counterparts) or that were older (19+) were more vigilant in their protective behavior (29.6% vs. 11.2% respectively for social distancing and 29.6% vs. 11.1% respectively for mask wearing).

Although there are very few studies describing the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with prostate cancer, these patients are likely to be more susceptible to COVID-19 than healthy people because of their immunosuppressed state. However, there is no evidence that prostate cancer is a risk factor for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the Wanfang database, the China Science Journal Citation Report (VIP database), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for studies related to the topic. We designed a standardized data extraction sheet and used Epidata software 3.1 for data extraction. In accordance with the Cochrane 5.1.0 standard, both a quality assessment and a risk assessment were carried out for the research meeting the inclusion criteria. The data were analyzed using Revman 5.3 and Stata 13.0 software. RESULTS: The study integrated existing research findings and a meta-analysis of the data to investigate the prevalence of prostate cancer in males infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the adverse clinical outcomes in male patients with or without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of this research may provide a basis for judging if prostate cancer is a risk factor for males infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the findings can effectively help to prevent COVID-19 in patients with prostate cancer.

We report an outbreak of COVID-19 in three LTCFs of the Geriatric Health Centres of Graz, Austria lasting from 22nd March to 14th April, 2020. Aim: The objectives of our study were: (1) to elucidate contributing factors and transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2, (2) to analyse symptoms of COVID-19 in the residents and health care workers. Methods: We carried out a retrospective outbreak analysis. Findings: 36/277 residents of 3 LTCFs were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Only a quarter of COVID-19 cases among residents had fever ≥ 38.1°C and 19% suffered from cough. 6/36 residents remained asymptomatic. Hospitalization rate was 58% in residents. Overall, 33% (12/36) residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 died. 19/214 health care workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Universal rt-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 of all residents and health care workers as well as infection control measures contributed to ending the outbreaks. Conclusion: Delayed recognition of possible COVID-19 cases due to either mild symptoms or symptoms that were perceived as atypical early in the pandemic contributed to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in LTCFs. This emphasizes the importance of low-threshold testing in LTCF residents.","Zollner-Schwetz, Ines; König, Elisabeth; Krause, Robert; Pux, Christian; Laubreiter, Lisa; Schippinger, Walter",Am J Infect Control,2,1

L(pro) exists as two forms, Lab and Lb, due to translation being initiated from two different start codons separated by 84 nucleotides. L(pro) self-cleaves from the nascent viral polyprotein precursor as the first mature viral protein. In addition to its role as a viral proteinase, L(pro) also has the ability to antagonize host antiviral effects. To promote FMDV replication, L(pro) can suppress host antiviral responses by three different mechanisms: (1) cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 γ (eIF4G) to shut off host protein synthesis; (2) inhibition of host innate immune responses through restriction of interferon-α/β production; and (3) L(pro) can also act as a deubiquitinase and catalyze deubiquitination of innate immune signaling molecules.

One limitation to the evaluation of potential therapies and vaccines to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and ameliorate disease is the lack of susceptible small animals in large numbers.

Here, we transduced replication-defective adenoviruses encoding human ACE2 via intranasal administration into BALB/c mice and established receptor expression in lung tissues. hACE2-transduced mice were productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this resulted in high viral titers in the lung, lung pathology, and weight loss. Passive transfer of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody reduced viral burden in the lung and mitigated inflammation and weight loss.

The project focuses on changing the traditional linear value chain of plastics to a sustainable, biodegradable based one. Plastic mixtures contain five of the top six fossil-based recalcitrant plastics [polyethylene (PE), polyurethane (PUR), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS)], along with upcoming bioplastics polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and polylactate (PLA) will be used as feedstock for microbial transformations. Consecutive controlled enzymatic and microbial degradation of mechanically pre-treated plastics wastes combined with subsequent microbial conversion to polymers and value-added chemicals by mixed cultures. Known plastic-degrading enzymes will be optimised by integrated protein engineering to achieve high specific binding capacities, stability, and catalytic efficacy towards a broad spectrum of plastic polymers under high salt and temperature conditions. Another focus lies in the search and isolation of novel enzymes active on recalcitrant polymers. MIX-UP will formulate enzyme cocktails tailored to specific waste streams and strives to enhance enzyme production significantly. In vivo and in vitro application of these cocktails enable stable, self-sustaining microbiomes to convert the released plastic monomers selectively into value-added products, key building blocks, and biomass. Any remaining material recalcitrant to the enzymatic activities will be recirculated into the process by physicochemical treatment.

This is partly ascribed to diminished CD8(+) T‐cell responses a result of aging. The phenotypical diversity of the CD8(+) T‐cell population has made it difficult to identify the impact of aging on CD8(+) T‐cell subsets associated with diminished CD8(+) T‐cell responses. Here we identify a novel human CD8(+) T‐cell subset characterized by expression of Killer‐cell Immunoglobulin‐like Receptors (KIR(+)) and CD45RA (RA(+)). These KIR(+)RA(+) T cells accumulated with age in the blood of healthy individuals (20–82 years of age, n = 50), expressed high levels of aging‐related markers of T‐cell regulation, and were functionally capable of suppressing proliferation of other CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, KIR(+)RA(+) T cells were a major T‐cell subset becoming activated in older adults suffering from an acute respiratory viral infection (n = 36), including coronavirus and influenza virus infection. In addition, older adults with influenza A infection showed that higher activation status of their KIR(+)RA(+) T cells associated with longer duration of respiratory symptoms. Together, our data indicate that KIR(+)RA(+) T cells are a unique human T‐cell subset with regulatory properties that may explain susceptibility to viral respiratory disease at old age.","Pieren, Daan K.

Lung injury causes systemic inflammation, which disrupts gut barrier integrity, increasing the permeability to gut microbes and their products. This exacerbates inflammation, resulting in positive feedback. We aimed to test whether severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with markers of disrupted gut permeability. We applied a multi-omic systems biology approach to analyze plasma samples from COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. We investigated the potential links between plasma markers of gut barrier integrity, microbial translocation, systemic inflammation, metabolome, lipidome, and glycome, and COVID-19 severity. We found that severe COVID-19 is associated with high levels of markers of tight junction permeability and translocation of bacterial and fungal products into the blood. These markers of disrupted intestinal barrier integrity and microbial translocation correlate strongly with higher levels of markers of systemic inflammation and immune activation, lower levels of markers of intestinal function, disrupted plasma metabolome and glycome, and higher mortality rate. Our study highlights an underappreciated factor with significant clinical implications, disruption in gut functions, as a potential force that may contribute to COVID-19 severity.","Giron, Leila B.; Dweep, Harsh; Yin, Xiangfan; Wang, Han; Damra, Mohammad; Goldman, Aaron R.; Gorman, Nicole; Palmer, Clovis S.; Tang, Hsin-Yao; Shaikh, Maliha W.; Forsyth, Christopher B.; Balk, Robert A.; Zilberstein, Netanel F.; Liu, Qin; Kossenkov, Andrew; Keshavarzian, Ali; Landay, Alan; Abdel-Mohsen, Mohamed",Front Immunol,2,32

We seek to determine the association between exposure to ACEI, ARB, and CCB and outcomes in those admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 841 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the University of Chicago Medical Center between March 25 and June 22, 2020. Out of these 841, 453 patients had a personal history of hypertension. For the first part, we evaluated primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and ICU admission in hospitalized COVID-19 patients based on their exposure to particular medications regardless of a personal history of hypertension and compared them with those who were not on these medications. For the second part, we evaluated the aforementioned outcomes in 453 patients with a personal history of hypertension based on their medication exposure. Secondary outcomes of length of stay, readmission rate, and new-onset dialysis requirement were also compared across the study groups. RESULTS: Out of 841 patients, 111 (13.19%) were on ACEI/ARB (median age: 66.1, SD 15.4; 52.25% females) and 730 (86.80%) were not on them (median age: 56.6, SD 20.3; 50.14% females), while 277 (32.93%) used CCB (median age: 64.6, SD 15.2; 57.04% females) and 564 (67.06%) did not use CCB (median age: 54.6, SD 21.2; 47.16% females). After adjusting for demographics and covariates, neither ACEI/ARB nor CCB exposure was associated with any effect on mortality, but ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with 42% reduction in risk of ICU admissions (OR 0.58, 95% CI [0.35, 0.95], p value 0.03). In addition, combined use of ACEI/ARB and CCB was associated with statistically significant (45%) reduction in ICU admission (OR 0.55, 95% CI [0.32, 0.94], p value 0.029). Out of 453 patients with a personal history of hypertension, 85 (18.76%) were taking ACEI/ARB (median age 65, SD 15.6; 56.47% females) and 368 (81.24%) were not on ACEI/ARB (median age 62.8, SD 16.4; 54.89% females), while 208 (45.92%) out of 453 were on CCB (median age 65; SD 14.8; 60.1% females) and 245 (54.08%) were not on CCB (median age 61.7, SD 17.3; 51.02% females). In the fully adjusted model in this group, ACEI use was associated with 71% reduction in in-house mortality (OR 0.29, 95% CI [0.09, 0.93], p value 0.03). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Among all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection, exposure to ACEI/ARB, as well as combined exposure to ACEI/ARB and CCB, were associated with reduced incidence of ICU admissions. In those admitted patients who had a personal history of hypertension, there was a trend towards reduced in-hospital mortality in those exposed to ACEI.","Choksi, Tatvam T.; Zhang, Hui; Chen, Thomas; Malhotra, Nikhil",Am J Nephrol,2,16

Our RNA targets include representative bacterial riboswitches that naturally bind with nanomolar affinity and high specificity to cellular metabolites of low molecular weight. Based on counter‐screens against five DNAs and five proteins, we can show that RNA can be specifically targeted. To demonstrate the quality of the initial fragment library that has been designed for easy follow‐up chemistry, we further show how to increase binding affinity from an initial fragment hit by chemistry that links the identified fragment to the intercalator acridine.

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Methods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a “lockdown” was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the lockdown to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Findings: We found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only. Interpretation: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.","Jarvis, Christopher I; Van Zandvoort, Kevin; Gimma, Amy; Prem, Kiesha; Klepac, Petra; Rubin, G James; Edmunds, W John",,2,16

Our interdisciplinary team of applied Human Factors (HF), ethnography, and IPC experts assisted one Unit, normally serving general surgical and orthopedic patients, as it rapidly converted to deliver COVID-19-specific care. This paper describes the conversion experience of the Unit, and outlines broader lessons for other acute care teams faced with similar issues. METHODS: We deployed walkthroughs, simulations, and ethnography to identify important safety gaps in care delivery processes on the Unit. These interventions were undertaken using interdisciplinary theories of implementation that combined systems-level HF perspectives, ethnographic approaches, and individual-level IPC perspectives. Timely recommendations were developed and delivered to Unit staff for feedback and implementation. RESULTS: We describe three interventions on the Unit: 1) the de-cluttering and re-organization of personal protective equipment (PPE); 2) the reconfiguring of designated ‘dirty’ tray tables and supplies; and 3) the redesign of handling pathways for ‘dirty’ linens and laundry. Each of these interventions was implemented to varying degrees, but all contributed to discussions of safety and IPC implementation that extended beyond the Unit and into the operations of the broader hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging our team’s interdisciplinary expertise and blended approaches to implementation, the interventions assisted in the Unit’s rapid conversion towards providing COVID-19-specific care. The deployment and implementation of the interventions highlight the potential of collaboration between HF, ethnography, and IPC experts to support frontline healthcare delivery under pandemic conditions in an effort to minimize nosocomial transmission potential in the acute healthcare setting.","Fadaak, Raad; Davies, Jan M.; Blaak, Marlot Johanna; Conly, John; Haslock, Joanne; Kenny, Ashley; Pinto, Nicole; Leslie, Myles",PLoS One,2,8

In addition it can be noticed that this dip was followed by a birth rebound a few months later. However having made this observation, Bertillon did not explore it further. Since that time the phenomenon was not revisited in spite of the fact that in the meanwhile there have been several new cases of massive death spikes. The aim here is to analyze these new cases to get a better understanding of this death–birth coupling phenomenon. The largest death spikes occurred in the wake of more recent influenza pandemics in 1918 and 1920, others were triggered by the 1923 earthquakes in Tokyo and the Twin Tower attack on September 11, 2001. We shall see that the first of these events indeed produced an extra dip in births whereas the 9/11 event did not. This disparity highlights the pivotal role of collateral sufferers. In the last section it is shown how the present coupling leads to predictions; it can explain in a unified way effects which so far have been studied separately, as for instance the impact on birth rates of heat waves. Thus, it appears that behind the apparent randomness of birth rate fluctuations there are in fact hidden explanatory factors.","Richmond, Peter; Roehner, Bertrand M.",Physica A,2,4

Accordingly, characteristics of households in a region have been shown to relate to transmission heterogeneity of the virus. We introduce a stochastic epidemiological model to examine the impact of the household size distribution in a region on the transmission dynamics. We choose parameters to re[fl]ect incidence in two health regions of the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate the impact of distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution the only different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause signi[fi]cant differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions drive distinct dynamics that match reported cases. Furthermore, our model suggests that offering individuals a place to isolate outside their household can speed the decline in cases, and does so more effectively where there are more larger households.","Liu, P.; McQuarrie, L.; Song, Y.; Colijn, C.",,2,14

Antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) provide a promising alternative for this purpose. MethodsWe assessed the analytical and clinical performance of the Ag-RDT Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test (Abbott), using RT-qPCR as a reference test. The clinical performance was assessed using nasopharyngeal swabs, collected in routine practice for case confirmation and contact tracing, and nasal mid-turbinate swabs, collected in preventive screenings of asymptomatic individuals. Fresh samples were analysed by RT-q-PCR, stored at -80 {degrees}C, and analysed using the Ag-RDT according to the manufacturer instructions. FindingsThe Ag-RDT had a limit of detection of 6{middle dot}5x105 copies/reaction. The clinical performance was assessed on 1,406 frozen swabs with a PCR result available: 951 (67{middle dot}7%) positive and 455 (32{middle dot}4%) negative. The Ag-RDT identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 872 of 951 PCR-positive samples (91{middle dot}7%; 95% CI 89{middle dot}8-93{middle dot}4 and ruled out its presence in 450 of 455 PCR-negative samples (specificity 98{middle dot}9%; 95% CI 97{middle dot}5- 99{middle dot}6). Sensitivity increased in samples with lower Ct values (Ct <25, 98{middle dot}2%; Ct<30, 94{middle dot}9%) and was higher among symptomatic cases (92{middle dot}6%) and their contacts (94{middle dot}2%) than among asymptomatic individuals (79{middle dot}5%). In the setting of asymptomatic screening, sensitivity also increased with lower Ct values (Ct <25, 100%; Ct<30, 98{middle dot}6%). Assuming a pre-test probability of 5%, the negative and positive predictive values were 99{middle dot}6% (99{middle dot}5 - 99{middle dot}6) and 81{middle dot}5% (65{middle dot}0 - 93{middle dot}2), respectively. InterpretationThe Panbio COVID-19 Ag-RDT has high sensitivity for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs of both, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The diagnostic performance of the test is particularly good in samples with viral loads associated with high risk of viral transmission (Ct <25), which show high positive and negative predictive values even when assuming a prevalence as low as 5%.

We found five studies that showed the accuracy of point-of-care tests in identifying SARS-CoV-2 antigens for confirmation of clinically suspected COVID-19. We found high variability in the diagnostic accuracy of Ag-RDT. Most tests showed high specificity (i.e., 99% or higher), whereas sensitivity ranged from 11% to 92%; only one test reported sensitivity higher than 60%. We found no studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test. We found no studies that assessed the performance of Ag-RDT for population-level screening of asymptomatic individuals. Added value of this studyOur analysis provides information regarding the diagnostic accuracy of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test when tested on 1,406 frozen samples of nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs collected in routine practice for diagnostic confirmation of symptomatic individuals with suspected COVID-19 or contacts exposed to a positive case, and preventive screenings of unexposed asymptomatic individuals. Compared with RT-qPCR as reference test, the Ag-RDT showed a sensitivity and specificity of 91{middle dot}7% and 98{middle dot}9%. Test sensitivity increased in samples with viral load associated with high risk of transmission (Ct <25), reaching more than 98%, regardless of the presence of symptoms. Implications of all the available evidenceAvailable evidence show variability in the diagnostic performance of marketed Ag-RDT. Our results provide substantial evidence that the point-of-care Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test can accurately identify SARS-CoV-2 antigens in people with suspected clinical COVID-19 as well as in asymptomatic people with high viral load and therefore, associated with higher risk of transmission. This finding represents a potentially useful advance for mass screening of asymptomatic people at the point-of-care.","Mitja, Oriol",,2,10

Early reports proposed that anosmia could be the first or even the only symptom of COVID-19 infection, prompting calls for self-isolation in affected patients. METHODS: In the present article, we review the COVID-19 anosmia literature and try to answer the following two questions: first, why is COVID-19 infection responsible for such a high incidence of anosmia? Second, in patients with more severe forms is anosmia really less prevalent and why? RESULTS: In terms of the etiology of olfactory dysfunction, several hypotheses were proposed at the outset of the pandemic; that olfactory cleft inflammation and obstruction caused a localized conductive loss, that there was injury to the sustentacular supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium or, given the known neurotropic potential of coronavirus, that the virus could invade and damage the olfactory bulb. Olfactory cleft obstruction may contribute to the olfactory dysfunction in some patients, perhaps most likely in those that show very early resolution, it cannot account for the loss in all patients. Moreover, disordered regrowth and a predominance of immature neurons have been shown to be associated with parosmia, which is a common finding amongst patients with Covid-related anosmia. A central mechanism therefore certainly seems to be consistent with the group of patients with more prolonged olfactory deficits. Sustentacular cells showing ACE-2 immunohistochemical expression 200 to 700 times greater than nasal or tracheal epithelia seem to be the main SARS-CoV-2 gateway. As the pathophysiology of COVID-19 anosmia seems to be better understood, the question of why patients with a moderate to severe form of COVID-19 infection have less olfactory involvement remains unresolved. Different potential explanations are discussed in this review. CONCLUSIONS: The last 5 months have benefited from great international collaborative research, first highlighting and then proving the value of loss of smell and taste as a symptom of COVID-19. Adoption of loss of smell into the case definition by international public health bodies will facilitate control of disease transmission.","Saussez, Sven; Lechien, Jerome R.; Hopkins, Claire",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,2,21

MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes are the reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 load [as measured by cyclic threshold (CT) value of RT-PCR] from the baseline to that of seventh day of the treatment, prevention of progression of asymptomatic to symptomatic state (clinical symptoms like fever, cough and breathlessness) and changes in the immunity markers [Interleukins (IL) 6, IL10, IL2, Interferon gamma (IFNγ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha]. Clinical assessment of COVID-19 as per standard Siddha system of medicine principles and the occurrence of adverse effects will be documented as secondary outcomes. RANDOMISATION: The assignment to the study or control group will be allocated in equal numbers through randomization using random number generation in Microsoft Excel by a statistician who is not involved in the trial. The allocation scheme will be made by an independent statistician using a sealed envelope. The participants will be allocated immediately after the eligibility assessment and informed consent procedures. BLINDING (MASKING): This study is unblinded. The investigators will be blinded to data analysis, which will be carried out by a statistician who is not involved in the trial. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Sample size could not be calculated, as there is no prior trial on KSK. This trial will be a pilot trial. Hence, we intend to recruit 60 participants in total using a 1:1 allocation ratio, with 30 participants randomised into each arm. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 2.0 dated 16(th) May 2020.

This study examined the associations among solo dining, self-determined solitude, and depression in university students. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted on 372 university students. The results show that students who live alone, those in poor health, and those with more frequent solo dining experiences had higher depression scores than others. Whereas satisfaction with solo dining was high when voluntary solitude was high, female students displayed higher depression scores when they had low self-determined solitude or high non-self-determined solitude, and when they had a higher frequency of eating lunch alone, compared to their male counterparts. University undergraduates who live and dine alone, owing to non-self-determined solitude, are highly vulnerable to mental health problems, including depression. Hence, interventions that foster social connectedness and entail the identification of factors accounting for students’ non-self-determined solitude should be developed.","Jang, Sunjoo; Lee, Haeyoung; Choi, Seunghye",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2,1

These hotlines mostly offered a single-use service with short session times and allowed callers to retain anonymity. They functioned as a psychological counseling service for stress experienced in the COVID-19 public health emergency. Hotline psychological counselors must meet special competency requirements. The selection and evaluation tools for recruiting hotline counselors need to be developed. Materials and Methods: The initial scale of competence for psychological hotline counselors was formed by expert evaluation based on theoretical constructs and by using the Delphi method. A link to the questionnaire was sent to a WeChat group of counselors from 36 major psychological hotlines in China in two stages. The questionnaire consisted of questions to elicit basic demographic information and the initial competence scale. In the first phase, 343 valid samples were used to perform exploratory factor analysis. In the second phase, 334 valid samples were used to perform confirmatory factor analysis. The status of the competence of psychological hotline counselors was also analyzed. Results: The factor structure of the Psychological Hotline Counselor Competence Scale was verified and defined in terms of skills, attitude, and knowledge. The results of exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis showed that the scale has good reliability and validity (χ(2)/df = 1.758, GFI = 0.86, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.96, NFI = 0.91, NNFI = 0.95). The McDonald’s omega for each factor was calculated (ω(F)(1) = 0.927, 95%CI [0.914, 0.940]; ω(F)(2) = 0.958, 95%CI [0.951, 0.965]; ω(F)(3) = 0.954, 95%CI [0.945, 0.961]). Meanwhile, it was found that the psychological hotline counselors’ self-assessed competence had a high average score (n = 334). Conclusion: The Competence Scale for Psychological Hotline Counselors for Major Public Emergencies developed in this study has good reliability and validity, and can be a reliable tool for organizing psychological assistance and screening hotline psychological counselors during public emergencies in the future.","You, Linyu; Jia, Xiaoming; Ding, Yaping; An, Qin; Li, Bo",Front Psychol,2,21

METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire was administered online to 1058 university students, representing 4 different colleges. The questionnaire included demographic data and 20 questions related to the knowledge and attitudes of respondents about possible use of the convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID-19 infection and its donation. Comparative analyses were made using the Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests and the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Significant relationships were found between dependent variables (level of knowledge and intensity of attitude) and gender, age, and student’s college affiliation. There was no statistically significant correlation between dependent variables and respondents’ social background and religious commitment. Studied young adults show a satisfactory knowledge relating to the therapeutic and preventive properties of the COVID-19 convalescent plasma. They also express a sufficient intensity of positive attitude towards CP donation. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the need for appropriate health promotional campaigns and educational programs aimed at popularization of CP donation in the general public, which would increase the chances of involving more patients recovered from COVID-19 disease.","Perenc, Lidia; Pęczkowski, Ryszard",J Blood Med,2,14

Analysis results indicate that the replacement of NC with the carboxyl-terminal half of the SARS-CoV N resulted in the production of wild type (wt)-level virus-like particles (VLPs) with the density of a wt HIV-1 particle. When co-expressed with SARS-CoV N, chimeras containing the N carboxyl-terminal half sequence efficiently packaged N. However, the same was not true for the chimera bearing the N amino-terminal half sequence, despite its production of substantial amounts of VLPs. According to further analysis, HIV-1 NC replacement with N residues 2–213, 215–421, or 234–421 resulted in efficient VLP production at levels comparable to that of wt HIV-1, but replacement with residues 215–359, 302–421, 2–168, or 2–86 failed to restore VLP production to wild-type levels. The results suggest that the domain conferring the ability to direct VLP assembly and release in SARS-CoV N is largely contained between residues 168 and 421.","Wang, Shui-Mei; Chang, Yu-Fen; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur; Wang, Chin-Tien",J Biomed Sci,2,8

Large randomized clinical trials that aimed to test four repurposed drugs, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon beta 1a, and remdesivir, have shown that these compounds lack an impact on the COVID-19 course. Although the phase III COVID-19 vaccine trial results are encouraging, the search for effective COVID-19 therapeutics should not stop. Recently, plitidepsin (aplidin) demonstrated highly effective preclinical activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Limited data are available to quantify and track SARS-CoV-2 antigen burden in respiratory samples from different populations. METHODS: We developed the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay (MSAA) with smartphone readout, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 pg/mL (10.6 fmol/L) nucleocapsid (N) antigen or 4000 copies/mL inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. We developed a computer vision and machine learning-based automatic microbubble image classifier to accurately identify positives and negatives, and quantified and tracked antigen dynamics in ICU COVID inpatients and immunocompromised COVID patients. RESULTS: Compared to qualitative RT-PCR methods, the MSAA demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 92-99%) and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 97% (95% CI, 94-100%) in a clinical validation study with 372 residual clinical NP swabs. In immunocompetent individuals, the antigen positivity rate in swabs decreased as days-after-symptom-onset increased, despite persistent nucleic acid positivity. Antigen was detected for longer and variable periods of time in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies. Total microbubble volume, a quantitative marker of antigen burden, correlated inversely with Ct values and days-after-symptom-onset. Viral sequence variations were detected in patients with long duration of high antigen burden. CONCLUSIONS: The MSAA enables sensitive and specific detection of acute infections, quantification and tracking of antigen burden, and may serve as a screening method in longitudinal studies to identify patients who are likely experiencing active rounds of ongoing replication and warrant close viral sequence monitoring.","Chen, Hui; Li, Zhao; Feng, Sheng; Richard-Greenblatt, Melissa; Hutson, Emily; Andrianus, Stefen; Glaser, Laurel J; Rodino, Kyle G; Qian, Jianing; Jayaraman, Dinesh; Collman, Ronald G; Glascock, Abigail; Bushman, Frederic D; Lee, Jae Seung; Cherry, Sara; Fausto, Alejandra; Weiss, Susan R; Koo, Hyun; Corby, Patricia M; Oceguera, Alfonso; O’Doherty, Una; Garfall, Alfred L; Vogl, Dan T; Stadtmauer, Edward A; Wang, Ping",Clin Chem,2,24

We correlated positively reacting peptides with the in vitro SARS-CoV neutralizing activity of the samples. We found that convalescent sera with high neutralizing activity recognized exclusively only a limited number of peptides on the membranes. This suggests that antibodies against the epitopes represented by these peptides could be responsible for much of the SARS-CoV neutralizing activity.

We investigated whether early intubation is associated with the survival of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This multicenter, retrospective, observational study was done on 47 adult COVID-19 patients with ARDS who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Daegu, Korea between February 17 and April 23, 2020. Clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality were compared between the early intubation and initially non-intubated groups, and between the early and late intubation groups, respectively. Of the 47 patients studied, 23 (48.9%) were intubated on the day of meeting ARDS criteria (early intubation), while 24 (51.1%) were not initially intubated. Eight patients were never intubated during the in-hospital course. Median follow-up duration was 46 days, and 21 patients (44.7%) died in the hospital. No significant difference in in-hospital mortality rate was noted between the early group and initially non-intubated groups (56.5% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.110). Furthermore, the risk of in-hospital death in the early intubation group was not significantly different compared to the initially non-intubated group on multivariate adjusted analysis (p = 0.385). Results were similar between early and late intubation in the subgroup analysis of 39 patients treated with mechanical ventilation. In conclusion, in this study of critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS, early intubation was not associated with improved survival.

Using the method, we estimate that risks for a 90-day period at the median daily summertime U.S. county confirmed COVID-19 case incidence of 10.8 per 100,000 and pre-pandemic contact rates range from 0.4 to 8.9 per 100,000 for the four deciles of age between 20 and 60 years. The corresponding 90-day period risk of hospitalization ranges from 13.7 to 69.2 per 100,000. Assuming a non-household secondary infection risk of 4% and pre-pandemic contact rates, the share of transmissions attributable to household settings ranges from 73% to 78%. These estimates are sensitive to the parameter assumptions; nevertheless, they are comparable to the COVID-19 hospitalization and fatality rates observed over the time period. We conclude that individual risk of hospitalization and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection is calculable from publicly available data sources. Access to publicly reported infection incidence data by setting and other exposure characteristics along with setting specific estimates of secondary infection risk would allow for more precise individual risk estimation.","Bhatia, Rajiv; Klausner, Jeffrey",PLoS One,2,16

Tests for positive selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes, highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species. Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA molecules. Methods Here we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code. Results We recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. Thermodynamic modeling of RNA stability and structure, however, indicates that RNA secondary structure within both genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome differs from those of RaTG13, the reconstructed common ancestor, and Pan-CoV-GD (Guangdong). These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription, translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to the viral life cycle.","Berrio, Alejandro; Gartner, Valerie; Wray, Gregory A",bioRxiv,2,24

Objective: To estimate the associations between demographic factors and social behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test. Methods: In September 2020, we randomly sampled Indiana University Bloomington (IUB) undergraduate students. Participants completed a cross-sectional, online survey about demographics, SARS-CoV-2 testing history, relationship status, and risk behaviors. Additionally, during a subsequent appointment, participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a fingerstick procedure and SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit.

For example, public health messages may focus on “fighting” the disease, attempting to rouse people to action by instilling a sense of urgency. In contrast, change‐focused metaphors may foster growth mindsets and self‐efficacy—cornerstones of well‐being and action. We randomly assigned participants to read one of two articles—either an article about coronavirus that focused on fighting the war or an article that highlighted the possibility of change. In Study 1 (N = 426), participants who read the war, relative to the change, message reported lower growth mindsets and self‐efficacy and these in turn, predicted lower well‐being and weaker intentions to engage in health behaviours. In Study 2, (N = 702), we sought to replicate findings and included a no treatment control.

However, excessive tidal volumes and inadequate lung recruitment may contribute to mortality by causing ventilator-induced lung injury. This bench-to-bedside review presents the scientific rationale for using adjuncts to mechanical ventilation aimed at optimizing lung recruitment and preventing the deleterious consequences of reduced tidal volume. To enhance CO(2 )elimination when tidal volume is reduced, the following are possible: first, ventilator respiratory frequency can be increased without necessarily generating intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure; second, instrumental dead space can be reduced by replacing the heat and moisture exchanger with a conventional humidifier; and third, expiratory washout can be used for replacing the CO(2)-laden gas present at end expiration in the instrumental dead space by a fresh gas (this method is still experimental). For optimizing lung recruitment and preventing lung derecruitment there are the following possibilities: first, recruitment manoeuvres may be performed in the most hypoxaemic patients before implementing the preset positive end-expiratory pressure or after episodes of accidental lung derecruitment; second, the patient can be turned to the prone position; third, closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning is to be preferred to open endotracheal suctioning.","Rouby, Jean-Jacques; Lu, Qin",Crit Care,2,20

Recently, social distancing measures were implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to decrease transmissible infectious diseases, creating an opportune setting to study the role of infection on the pathogenesis of intussusception on a population level. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of social distancing on intussusception. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed air contrast enemas and pylorus ultrasounds performed between March 2010 and March 2021 to identify cases of ileocolic intussusception and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), using the latter as a negative control. The study time frame was divided into two periods: pre-pandemic (March 2010–February 2020) and pandemic (April 2020–March 2021). The number of cases that occurred in these two time periods were compared using the Poisson regression model. RESULTS: Of the 407 cases of idiopathic ileocolic intussusception identified, 396 occurred in the pre-pandemic time period (mean = 39.6 per 12-month period) and 11 occurred in the 12-month pandemic time period. The mean monthly number of intussusceptions showed a decline of 72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49–85%) between the pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods (3.3 vs. 0.9 monthly cases; P < 0.001). In contrast, the mean monthly number of HPS did not differ significantly (P = 0.19). CONCLUSION: Social distancing—imposed to curb the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic—resulted in a significant decline in ileocolic intussusception, lending strong support to the theory that infection is the dominant cause of intussusception.","Handa, Atsuhiko; Callahan, Michael J.; Kawai, Kosuke; Tsai, Andy",Pediatr Radiol,2,19

Innovative technological solutions could help deal with this increasing demand. Using digital patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to identify patients who need a face-to-face (FTF) appointment is a potential approach. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of digital PROM questionnaires to enable remote symptom monitoring for patients undergoing cancer treatment and their ability to highlight the requirement for an FTF appointment. METHODS: This study was performed at a tertiary oncology center between December 2018 and February 2019. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were adapted into patient-friendly language to form the basis of treatment-specific digital questionnaires covering specific cancer drugs and radiotherapy treatments. These treatment-specific digital PROM questionnaires were scored by both patients and their clinicians during FTF appointments. Patients and clinicians did not see each other’s scored PROMs. Agreement between patients and clinicians was assessed using descriptive statistics. Patient and staff feedback was also obtained. RESULTS: In total, 90 patients participated in the study across 10 different treatment pathways. By comparing paired patient and clinician responses, the sensitivity of the patient-completed questionnaires in correctly highlighting the need for FTF review was 94% (44/47), and all patients with severe or grade 3+ symptoms were identified (6/6, 100%). Patient-completed PROMs appropriately revealed that 29% (26/90) of the participating patients did not need FTF review based on their symptoms alone. Certain oncological treatment pathways, such as immunotherapy, were found to have a larger proportion of patients with minimal symptoms than others, such as conventional chemotherapy. Patient and staff feedback showed high approval of digital PROMs and their potential for use in remote monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Digital PROM questionnaires can feasibly highlight the need for FTF review in oncology clinics for treatment. Their use with specific treatments could safely reduce the requirement for FTF care, and future work should evaluate their application in the remote monitoring of patients.","Sivanandan, Mayuran Ananth; Sharma, Catherine; Bullard, Pippa; Christian, Judith",JMIR Form Res,2,21

We developed Survey Mate, an extension of Google Assistant, and conducted two studies to analyze the reliability and validity of data collected through this medium. In the first study, we assessed validated procrastination and shyness scales as well as social desirability indicators for both the virtual assistant and an online questionnaire. The results revealed comparable internal consistency and construct and criterion validity. In the second study, five social psychological experiments, which have been successfully replicated by the Many Labs projects, were successfully reproduced using a virtual assistant for data collection. Comparable effects were observed for users of both smartphones and smart speakers. Our findings point to the applicability of virtual assistants in data collection independent of the device used. While we identify some limitations, including data privacy concerns and a tendency toward more socially desirable responses, we found that virtual assistants could allow the recruitment of participants who are hard to reach with established data collection techniques, such as people with visual impairment, dyslexia, or lower education. This new medium could also be suitable for recruiting samples from non-Western countries because of its wide availability and easily adaptable language settings. It could also support an increase in the generalizability of theories in the future.","Sprengholz, Philipp; Betsch, Cornelia",Behav Res Methods,2,33

Among the residents, all but one (19/20) were regularly vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. In mid-February 2021, a non-vaccinated staff member of the nursing home was diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following the outbreak investigation, a total of 70% (14/20) of residents aged 77–100 years were found positive.

The trade in products generates virtual water flow, as does the flow of people. The flow of international tourists will inevitably lead to the transfer and exchange of water resources embedded in the virtual form. This study takes China’s inbound tourism flow as the research object, from the perspective of the water footprint, in order to explore virtual water “exports” to the world. Based on kernel density estimation and ArcGIS spatial analysis, spatial-temporal evolution and structural difference were investigated. Virtual water “exports” showed an increasing trend. The kernel density estimation curves basically exhibited a “single peak” feature which indicated that virtual water “exports” from tourism were not significantly polarized in China. In terms of spatial evolution, this varied greatly at the provincial and regional level and Guangdong was always in the high value area. The south displayed greater values than the north, but this difference in provinces narrowed over the years. The water footprint of food was the largest, more specifically, the green component of this water footprint. Promoting a reasonable diet, reducing food waste, improving agricultural production technology, reducing the frequency of changing hotel supplies, and encouraging the use of new energy helped to reduce the water footprint. Virtual water trade in the service sector provides a new idea for helping to mitigate the global water crisis, in addition to virtual water flow for agricultural products.","Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Jin-he; Tian, Qing",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2,1

Here we propose a strategy to reduce model bias when only part of a new structure is known: after the MR search, structure determination of the unknown part of the new structure can be facilitated by cross-crystal averaging of the known part of the new structure with the search model. This strategy dramatically improves electron density in the unknown part of the new structure. It has enabled us to determine the structures of two coronavirus receptor-binding domains each complexed with their receptor at moderate resolutions. In a test case, it also enabled automated model building when over 50% of an antigen-antibody complex was absent. These results suggest that this averaging strategy can be routinely used after MR to enhance the interpretability of electron density associated with missing model.","Li, Weikai; Li, Fang",Structure,2,23

Methods: The study team used a simultaneous exploratory mixed-methods design to investigate the primary objective. Thirty-one pregnant and postpartum women participated in phone interviews and were invited to complete an online survey which included validated mental health and well-being measures. Results: Approximately 12% of the sample reported high depressive symptomatology and 60% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Forty percent of the sample reported being lonely. The primary themes related to stress were uncertainty surrounding perinatal care, exposure risk for both mother and baby, inconsistent messaging from information sources and lack of support networks. Participants identified various sources of resilience, including the use of virtual communication platforms, engaging in self-care behaviors (eg, adequate sleep, physical activity, and healthy eating), partner emotional support, being outdoors, gratitude, and adhering to structures and routines.

The resource need estimates based on projections for COVID‐19 identified a shortfall of medical professionals to care for patients while maintaining 55% of the workforce for regular healthcare across the atolls. The findings show that while the policy of lockdown bought time to increase hospital beds and devices, the country was unable to increase the healthcare workforce. Furthermore, as the lockdown eased, the exponential increase of cases took Maldives to the global one per capita incidence. Despite this, with cautious planning and use of resources, the country has so far managed to maintain low mortality from COVID‐19.

Here, we report a crystal structure of EV71 3D(pol) elongation complex (EC) at 1.8 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the 5′-end guanosine of the downstream RNA template interacts with a fingers domain pocket, with the base sandwiched by H44 and R277 side chains through hydrophobic stacking interactions, and these interactions are still maintained after one in-crystal translocation event induced by nucleotide incorporation, implying that the pocket could regulate the functional properties of the polymerase by interacting with RNA. When mutated, residue R277 showed an impact on virus proliferation in virological studies with residue H44 having a synergistic effect. In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding, EC stability, but not polymerase catalytic rate (k(cat)) and apparent NTP affinity (K(M,NTP)).

For each rumor, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief.

Built on statistical data of electricity generation and consumption released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC), we calculate he nationwide electricity related CO(2) emission changes in regional, economic-sectoral and technological dimensions during January–April 2020, when the strictest lock-down measures were taken in China and compare the results with the same months of the year prior. Our results show that both east and central China power grids witnessed drastic reduction (15.0% and 13.8%) in electricity-generation caused CO(2) emissions; and the biggest falls of provincial-scale electricity-generation CO(2) emission took place in Hubei (27.3%). Among China’s electricity production mix, coal remains the biggest CO(2) emitter and contributed 95.7% of the overall nationwide reduction. The most significant decline of the nationwide consumptive-electricity carbon footprint was by 10.1% in February, with the secondary economic sector the biggest contributor.","Zhao, Mingyue; Niu, Yuqing; Tian, Lei; Liu, Yizhi; Zhai, Qiang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2,30

The modified metabolic profiles were associated to an altered amino acid catabolism in hypoxic conditions. Noteworthy, three α-hydroxyl acids of amino acid origin increased with disease severity and correlated with altered oxygen saturation levels and clinical markers of lung damage. We hypothesize that the enzymatic conversion of α-keto-acids to α- hydroxyl-acids helps to maintain NAD recycling in patients with altered oxygen levels, highlighting the potential relevance of amino acid supplementation during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Páez-Franco, José C.; Torres-Ruiz, Jiram; Sosa-Hernández, Víctor A.; Cervantes-Díaz, Rodrigo; Romero-Ramírez, Sandra; Pérez-Fragoso, Alfredo; Meza-Sánchez, David E.; Germán-Acacio, Juan Manuel; Maravillas-Montero, José L.; Mejía-Domínguez, Nancy R.; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo; Ulloa-Aguirre, Alfredo; Gómez-Martín, Diana; Llorente, Luis",Sci Rep,2,16

The present longitudinal study aimed to investigate whether the association between addictive Facebook use and suicide-related outcomes is mediated by RNT. Data of 191 German Facebook users (M(age) = 26.17, SD(age) = 6.63) were assessed at two measurement time points over a one-year period (first measurement = T1, second measurement = T2) via online surveys. The significant positive association between addictive Facebook use (T1) and suicide-related outcomes (T2) was significantly mediated by RNT (T1). In contrast, a check test that included RNT (T1) as predictor and addictive Facebook use (T1) as mediator revealed no significant mediation effect. The current results demonstrate that if addictive Facebook use leads to RNT suicide ideation and attempts become likely. Therefore, RNT and addictive Facebook use should be taken into account when assessing individuals for risk of suicide.","Brailovskaia, Julia; Margraf, Jürgen; Teismann, Tobias",Curr Psychol,2,22

This lack of progress is due in part to a series of misconceptions over the years: that osteoarthritis is an inevitable consequence of ageing, that damaged articular cartilage cannot heal itself, and that osteoarthritis is driven by synovial inflammation similar to that seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Molecular interrogation of disease through ex-vivo tissue analysis, in-vitro studies, and preclinical models have radically reshaped the knowledge landscape. Inflammation in osteoarthritis appears to be distinct from that seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Recent randomised controlled trials, using treatments repurposed from rheumatoid arthritis, have largely been unsuccessful. Genome-wide studies point to defects in repair pathways, which accords well with recent promise using growth factor therapies or Wnt pathway antagonism. Nerve growth factor has emerged as a robust target in osteoarthritis pain in phase 2–3 trials. These studies, both positive and negative, align well with those in preclinical surgical models of osteoarthritis, indicating that pathogenic mechanisms identified in mice can lead researchers to valid human targets. Several novel candidate pathways are emerging from preclinical studies that offer hope of future translational impact.

Global analysis of the combined results showed that truncation of C-terminus from 306 to 300 had no appreciable effect on the quaternary structure, and the enzyme remained catalytically active. However, further deletion of Gln-299 or Arg-298 drastically decreased the enzyme activity to 1–2% of wild type (WT), and the major form was a monomeric one.

Based on the statistics reported by John Hopkins University, 4.7M people worldwide and 84,054 people in China have been confirmed positive and infected with COVID-19, as of 18 May 2020. Motivated by the previous studies which show that the exposures to air pollutants may increase the risk of influenza infection, our study examines if such exposures will also affect Covid-19 infection. To the best of our understanding, we are the first group in the world to rigorously explore the effects of outdoor air pollutant concentrations, meteorological conditions and their interactions, and lockdown interventions, on Covid-19 infection in China. Since the number of confirmed cases is likely to be under-reported due to the lack of testing capacity, the change in confirmed case definition, and the undiscovered and unreported asymptotic cases, we use the rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases instead as our dependent variable. Even if the number of reported infections is under-reported, the rate of change will still accurately reflect the relative change in infection, provided that the trend of under-reporting remains the same. In addition, the rate of change in daily infection cases can be distorted by the government imposed public health interventions, including the lockdown policy, inter-city and intra-city mobility, and the change in testing capacity and case definition. Hence, the effects of the lockdown policy and the inter-city and intra-city mobility, and the change in testing capacity and case definition are all taken into account in our statistical modelling. Furthermore, we adopt the generalized linear regression models covering both the Negative Binomial Regression and the Poisson Regression. These two regression models, when combined with different time-lags (to reflect the COVID-19 incubation period and delay due to official confirmation) in air pollutant exposure (PM2.5), are used to fit the COVID-19 infection model. Our statistical study has shown that higher PM2.5 concentration is significantly correlated with a higher rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases in Wuhan, China (p < 0.05). We also determine that a higher dew point interacting with a higher PM2.5 concentration is correlated with a higher rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases, while a higher UV index and a higher PM2.5 concentration are correlated with a lower rate of change. Furthermore, we find that PM2.5 concentration eight days ago has the strongest predictive power for COVID-19 Infection. Our study bears significance to the understanding of the effect of air pollutant (PM2.5) on COVID-19 infection, the interaction effects of both the air pollutant concentration (PM2.5) and the meteorological conditions on the rate of change in infection, as well as the insights into whether lockdown should have an effect on COVID-19 infection.","Han, Y.; Lam, J.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey amongst orthopaedic trainees to explore PPE practice in 19 hospitals caring for hip fracture patients in the North West of England. RESULTS: During the second wave of the pandemic, 14/19 (74%) hospitals experienced an outbreak of COVID-19 amongst staff or patients on the orthopaedic wards. An FFP3 respirator mask was used by doctors in only 6/19 (32%) hospitals when seeing patients with COVID-19 and a cough and in 5/19 (26%) hospitals when seeing asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. A COVID-19 outbreak was reported in 11/13 (85%) orthopaedic units where staff wore fluid resistant surgical masks compared to 3/6 (50%) units using an FFP3 respirator mask (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.74–3.89) when caring for symptomatic patients with COVID-19. Similarly, a COVID-19 outbreak was reported in more orthopaedic units caring for asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 where staff wore fluid resistant surgical masks (12/14 (86%)) as compared to an FFP3 respirator mask (2/5 (40%)) (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.72–6.4). CONCLUSION: Urgent re-evaluation of PPE use is required to reduce nosocomial spread of COVID-19, amongst highly vulnerable patients with hip fracture.","Mastan, S.; Malik, R. A.; Charalambous, C.

They are typically transmitted via respiratory droplets. We investigated rates of invasive disease due to these pathogens during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Laboratories in 26 countries across six continents submitted data on cases of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae and N meningitidis from 1 January 2018 to 31 May 2020. Weekly cases in 2020 vs 2018-2019 were compared. Streptococcus agalactiae data were collected from nine laboratories for comparison to a non-respiratory pathogen. The stringency of COVID-19 containment measures was quantified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Changes in population movements were assessed by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. Interrupted time series modelling quantified changes in rates of invasive disease in 2020 relative to when containment measures were imposed. Findings All countries experienced a significant, sustained reduction in invasive diseases due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae and N meningitidis, but not S agalactiae, in early 2020, which coincided with the introduction of COVID-19 containment measures in each country. Similar impacts were observed across most countries despite differing stringency in COVID-19 control policies. There was no evidence of a specific effect due to enforced school closures. Interpretation The introduction of COVID-19 containment policies and public information campaigns likely reduced transmission of these bacterial respiratory pathogens, leading to a significant reduction in life-threatening invasive diseases in many countries worldwide.","Brueggemann, A.

The seriousness of the disease has led many healthcare professionals plagued by stigma as well as discrimination. In this study, depressive symptomatology, levels of anxiety, and related psychosocial and occupational factors experienced by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID -19 were investigated. METHODS: A total of 512 healthcare professionals were surveyed using an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10, and psychosocial and occupational factors predictive of depression and anxiety were included in the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression determined the factors associated with the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. RESULTS: Results showed that elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were experienced by 53.3% and 51.3%, respectively, of the participants. No differences in the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were found between those who were exposed and non-exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients. Having a fear of being infected with COVID-19 and spreading it among family members were associated with increased risk of depression. Among those exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients, poor occupational safety (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.25–3.39), stigmatization (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.29–3.72), and heavy workload (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.53–3.92) were associated with increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms, whilst poor self-confidence (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.56–4.09) and heavy workload (OR = 1.94. 95% CI 1.22–3.12) were associated with increased risk of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of being infected and distress caused by fear of spreading it among family members, stigmatization, poor self-confidence, poor occupational safety and heavy workload are vital risk factors that need to be considered in future psychological support services designed for the healthcare professionals in unprecedented outbreaks like COVID-19.

At least 19% of New York’s and 17% of Sydney’s population are immunosuppressed. The highest smallpox infection rates were in persons 0–19 years of age, but the highest death rates were in those >45 years of age. Because of the low level of residual vaccine immunity, immunosuppression was more influential than vaccination on death and infection rates in our model. Despite widespread smallpox vaccination until 1980 in New York, smallpox outbreak severity appeared worse in New York than in Sydney. Immunosuppression is highly prevalent and should be considered in future smallpox outbreak models because excluding this factor probably underestimates death and infection rates.","MacIntyre, C.

METHODS: Participants (Australia: N = 495, 50.1% women; US: N = 701, 48.9% women) completed HAPA social cognition constructs at an initial time‐point (T1), and one week later (T2) self‐reported their social distancing behavior. RESULTS: Single‐indicator structural equation models that excluded and included past behavior exhibited adequate fit with the data. Intention and action control were significant predictors of social distancing behavior in both samples, and intention predicted action and coping planning in the US sample. Self‐efficacy and action control were significant predictors of intention in both samples, with attitudes predicting intention in the Australia sample and risk perceptions predicting intention in the US sample. Significant indirect effects of social cognition constructs through intentions were observed. Inclusion of past behavior attenuated model effects. Multigroup analysis revealed no differences in model fit across samples, suggesting that observed variations in the parameter estimates were relatively trivial.

Its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), appears to be capable of infecting different mammalian species. Recent detections of this virus in pet, zoo, wild, and farm animals have compelled inquiry regarding the zoonotic (animal-to-human) and reverse zoonotic (human-to-animal) transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of COVID-19 pandemic evolving into a panzootic. It is important to monitor the global spread of disease and to assess the significance of genomic changes to support prevention and control efforts during a pandemic. An understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology provides opportunities to prevent the risk of repeated re-infection of humans and requires a robust One Health-based investigation.

We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed methods design. This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves: between August 2019-March 2020 and during the first six weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.062). Adults were two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.016; 95% CI [1.14, 3.49]). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms among adults with histories of childhood trauma during the first six weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources in South Africa.","Kim, Andrew Wooyoung; Nyengerai, Tawanda; Mendenhall, Emily",medRxiv,2,1

This approach has confirmed the growing body of data showing a wide role for the nucleolus in eukaryotic cell biology beyond ribosome generation into many areas of cell function from regulation of the cell cycle, modulation of the cell stress response to innate immune responses. This has been reflected in the growing body of evidence that viruses specifically target the nucleolus by sequestering cellular nucleolar proteins or by targeting viral proteins to the nucleolus in order to maximise viral replication. This review covers those key areas and looks at the latest approaches using high‐throughput quantitative proteomics of the nucleolus in virus infected cells to gain an insight into the role of this fascinating compartment in viral infection.","Hiscox, Julian A.; Whitehouse, Adrian; Matthews, David A.",Proteomics,2,16

In the northern and southern hemispheres, outbreaks occur mainly in the respective winter seasons. Influenza vaccination is available but only partially effective. In the absence of a vaccine, in winter, novel coronavirus COVID-19 will also circulate in parallel with seasonal influenza. Thus far it appears that with the current strains of these two viruses, the clinical outcome of co-infection is not significantly worse than infection with COVID-19 alone. However, several strains of influenza circulate, including strains still to come. Similarly, COVID-19 has several strains, with probably more to come. This paper discusses these issues and estimates ideal minimum influenza vaccination coverage based on an estimated influenza Basic Reproduction Number (R0) of 0.9–2.1 so as to obtain herd immunity or approach it. There is a strong argument for attempting near universal population coverage with the annual influenza vaccine leading up to next winter.","Grech, Victor; Borg, Michael",Early Hum Dev,2,33

While the anti-microbiological properties of nitric oxide-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) such as peroxynitrite, are known, the mechanism of these effects are as yet poorly studied. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, was first identified during 2002-2003. Mortality in SARS patients ranges from between 6 to 55%. We have previously shown that nitric oxide inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in vitro by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we have further investigated the mechanism of the inhibition process of nitric oxide against SARS-CoV. We found that peroxynitrite, an intermediate product of nitric oxide in solution formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide, has no effect on the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, suggesting that the inhibition is either directly effected by NO or a derivative other than peroxynitrite. Most interestingly, we found that NO inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV by two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, NO or its derivatives cause a reduction in the palmitoylation of nascently expressed spike (S) protein which affects the fusion between the S protein and its cognate receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Secondly, NO or its derivatives cause a reduction in viral RNA production in the early steps of viral replication, and this could possibly be due to an effect on one or both of the cysteine proteases encoded in Orf1a of SARS-CoV.","Åkerström, Sara; Gunalan, Vithiagaran; Keng, Choong Tat; Tan, Yee-Joo; Mirazimi, Ali",Virology,2,13

Using cell models of feline calicivirus (FCV), we demonstrated that IOP treatment was capable of exhibiting anti-FCV strain F9 activity in cell-based assays and also showed low cytotoxicity. Investigation of the mechanism of action of the compound revealed that IOP treatment induces its inhibitory actions directly on virus particles through blocking viral binding/absorpting. The inhibitory activity against other FCV isolates from China was also identified. More importantly, we found that IOP exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity against the feline herpesvirus 1, feline influenza virus H3N2 and H5N6, feline panleukopenia virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus that can contribute to respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in cats.

In recent months, the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based antibody tests has gained a lot of attention. These tests can potentially be used to assess SARS-COV-2 immunity status in individuals (e.g., essential health care personnel). They can also be used as a screening tool to identify people that had COVID-19 asymptomatically, thus getting a better estimate of the true spread of the disease, gain important insights on disease severity, and to better evaluate the effectiveness of policy measures implemented to combat the pandemic. But the usefulness of these tests depends not only on the quality of the test but also, critically, on how far disease has already spread in the population. For example, when only very few people in a population are infected, a positive test result has a high chance of being a false positive. As a consequence, the spread of the disease in a population as well as individuals’ immunity status may be systematically misinterpreted. SARS-COV-2 infection rates vary greatly across both time and space. In many places, the infection rates are very low but can quickly skyrocket when the virus spreads unchecked. Here, we present two tools, natural frequency trees and positive and negative predictive value graphs, that allow one to assess the usefulness of antibody testing for a specific context at a glance. These tools should be used to support individual doctor-patient consultation for assessing individual immunity status as well as to inform policy discussions on testing initiatives.","Keller, Niklas; Jenny, Mirjam A.",MDM Policy Pract,2,1

Proportional hazards models with competing risks were used to estimate time to recovery adjusted for age and gender. FINDINGS: In analyses 2904 cases were followed for recovery (median follow-up time 16 days, range 1-122, IQR 11-24).There were 2572 (88.6%) who reported resolution of symptoms (262/2572 were also hospitalised), 224 (7.8%) had not recovered at last contact (28/224 were also hospitalised), 51 (1.8%) died of COVID-19, and 57 (2.0%) were hospitalised without a documented recovery date.

RESULTS: A total of 163 patients were included, of whom 33 died and 29 of them were positive for the COVID-19 PCR test. We obtained as possible factors to conform the Mortality Risk Score age> 75 years ((adjusted OR = 12,347, 95% CI: 4,138-36,845 p = 0.001), total leukocytes> 11,000 cells / mm(3) (adjusted OR = 2,649, 95% CI: 0.879-7.981 p = 0.083), glucose> 126 mg / dL (adjusted OR = 3.716, 95% CI: 1.24711.074 p = 0.018) and creatinine> 1.1 mg / dL (adjusted OR = 2.566, 95% CI: 0.8897.403, p = 0.081) This score was called COVEB (COVID, Age, Basic analytical profile) with an AUC 0.874 (95% CI: 0.816-0.933, p <0.001; Cut-off point = 1 (sensitivity = 89.66 % (95% CI: 72.6% -97.8%), specificity = 75.59% (95% CI: 67.2% -82.8%).

In this study, N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI)-functionalized CuFe(2)O(4) magnetic nanomaterial (ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4)) with high catalytic activity was synthesized by virtue of a solvothermal and post-functionalization method. ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) showed outstanding CL properties, superior to ABEI-CuFe(2)O(4) in liquid phase. This reveals that the immobilization of ABEI on the surface of CuFe(2)O(4) exhibits unique heterogeneous catalytic property. The catalytic ability of CuFe(2)O(4) was better than that of CoFe(2)O(4), ZnFe(2)O(4), MnFe(2)O(4), and NiFe(2)O(4). It is suggested that the peroxide-like activity as well as Cu(2+) and Cu(0) enriched on the surface of ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) opened up a dual route for synergistic catalysis of H(2)O(2). ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) also demonstrated good superparamagnetism and magnetic separation could be carried out in 2 min, which is advantageous for the separation and purification of ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) during the synthetic procedures and bioassays. Owing to the sensitive response of ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) to H(2)O(2), an enzyme-free sensor was developed for the detection of H(2)O(2) with a wide linear range over 5 orders of magnitude of H(2)O(2) concentrations and a low detection limit of 5.6 nM. The as-developed sensor is sensitive, stable, and convenient. This work provides a new family member of nanomaterials with good magnetism and CL activity as well as good stability.

By 24 March 2020, over 440,000 cases and almost 20,000 deaths had been reported worldwide. In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces. These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear. Methods: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity. Results: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharp fall in transmissibility. In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement. A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak. At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission. Conclusions: Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree.

Earlier reports have suggested that COVID-19 agents can be present in the fecal and sewage samples and thus it can be a good indication of the pandemic extent in a community. However, no such studies have been reported in the Indian context so far. Since, several factors like local population physiology, the climatic conditions, sewage composition, and processing of samples could possibly affect the detection of the viral genome, it becomes absolutely necessary to check for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving different localities of Jaipur city, which has been under red zone (pandemic hotspots) since early April 2020. Samples from different local municipal WWTPs and hospital wastewater samples were collected and wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) studies for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were carried out using the RT-PCR technique to confirm the presence of different COVID-19 target genes namely S gene, E gene, ORF1ab gene, RdRp gene and N gene in the viral load of wastewater samples. In the present study, the untreated wastewater samples from the municipal WWTPs and hospital wastewater samples showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome, which was correlated with the increased number of COVID-19 positive patients from the concerned areas, as per reported in the publically available health data. This is the first study that investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in wastewater, at higher ambient temperature (above 40{degrees}C), further validating WBE as a potential tool in predicting and mitigating outbreaks.","Arora, S.; Nag, A.; Sethi, J.; Rajvanshi, J.; Saxena, S.; Shrivastava, S.

Objective: Present study evaluated the possible socio-economic and health related factors (and their temporal consistency) determining the disease burden of COVID-19. Design: A retrospective analysis for identifying associations of COVID-19 burden. Setting: Data on COVID-19 statistics (number of cases, tests and deaths per million) was extracted from the website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ on 10th April and 12th May. Variables obtained to estimate the possible determinants for COVID-19 burden included economic- gross domestic product; socio-demographic- Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs indicators related to health systems, percentage Chinese diaspora; and COVID-19 trajectory- date of first case in each country, days between first reported case and 10th April, days between 100th and 1000th case, and government response stringency index (GRSI). Main outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 burden was modeled using economic and socio-demographic determinants. Consistency of inferences for two time points at three levels of increasing statistical rigor using (i) Spearman correlations, (ii) Bayesian probabilistic graphical model, and (iii) counterfactual impact was evaluated. Results: Countries economy (reflected by GDP), mainly through the testing rates, was the major and temporally consistent determinant of COVID-19 burden in the model. Reproduction number of COVID-19 was lower where mortality due to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) was higher, thus strengthening the hygiene hypothesis. There was no association between vaccination status or tuberculosis incidence and COVID burden, refuting the claims over BCG vaccination as a possible factor against COVID-19 trajectory. Conclusion and Relevance: Countries economy, through testing power, was the major determinant of COVID-19 burden. There was weak evidence for hygiene hypothesis as a protective factor against COVID-19.","Sethi, T.; Kedia, S.; Awasthi, R.; Lodha, R.; Ahuja, V.",,2,23

Many cases were subsequently reported in other cities, which has aroused strong reverberations on the Internet and social media around the world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the reaction of global Internet users to the outbreak of COVID-19 by evaluating the possibility of using Internet monitoring as an instrument in handling communicable diseases and responding to public health emergencies. METHODS: The disease-related data were retrieved from China’s National Health Commission (CNHC) and World Health Organization (WHO) from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Daily Google Trends (GT) and daily Baidu Attention Index (BAI) for the keyword “Coronavirus” were collected from their official websites. Rumors which occurred in the course of this outbreak were mined from Chinese National Platform to Refute Rumors (CNPRR) and Tencent Platform to Refute Rumors (TPRR). Kendall’s Tau-B rank test was applied to check the bivariate correlation among the two indexes mentioned above, epidemic trends, and rumors. RESULTS: After the outbreak of COVID-19, both daily BAI and daily GT increased rapidly and remained at a high level, this process lasted about 10 days. When major events occurred, daily BAI, daily GT, and the number of rumors simultaneously reached new peaks. Our study indicates that these indexes and rumors are statistically related to disease-related indicators. Information symmetry was also found to help significantly eliminate the false news and to prevent rumors from spreading across social media through the epidemic outbreak. CONCLUSION: Compared to traditional methods, Internet monitoring could be particularly efficient and economical in the prevention and control of epidemic and rumors by reflecting public attention and attitude, especially in the early period of an outbreak.","Xie, Tiantian; Tan, Tao; Li, Jun",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,2,26

To identify therapeutic targets relevant to COVID-19, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, deriving genetic instruments based on transcriptomic and proteomic data for 1,263 actionable proteins that are targeted by approved drugs or in clinical phase of drug development. Using summary statistics from the Host Genetics Initiative and the Million Veteran Program, we studied 7,554 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and >1 million controls. We found significant Mendelian randomization results for three proteins (ACE2: P=1.6x10^-6, IFNAR2: P=9.8x10^-11, and IL-10RB: P=1.9x10^-14) using cis-eQTL genetic instruments that also had strong evidence for colocalization with COVID-19 hospitalization. To disentangle the shared eQTL signal for IL10RB and IFNAR2, we conducted phenome-wide association scans and pathway enrichment analysis, which suggested that IFNAR2 is more likely to play a role in COVID-19 hospitalization.

During vaccination, naked or vehicle loaded mRNA vaccines efficiently express tumor antigens in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), facilitate APC activation and innate/adaptive immune stimulation. mRNA cancer vaccine precedes other conventional vaccine platforms due to high potency, safe administration, rapid development potentials, and cost-effective manufacturing. However, mRNA vaccine applications have been limited by instability, innate immunogenicity, and inefficient in vivo delivery. Appropriate mRNA structure modifications (i.e., codon optimizations, nucleotide modifications, self-amplifying mRNAs, etc.) and formulation methods (i.e., lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymers, peptides, etc.) have been investigated to overcome these issues. Tuning the administration routes and co-delivery of multiple mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) have further boosted the host anti-tumor immunity and increased the likelihood of tumor cell eradication. With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of LNP-loaded mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 and the promising therapeutic outcomes of mRNA cancer vaccines achieved in several clinical trials against multiple aggressive solid tumors, we envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future. This review provides a detailed overview of the recent progress and existing challenges of mRNA cancer vaccines and future considerations of applying mRNA vaccine for cancer immunotherapies.","Miao, Lei; Zhang, Yu; Huang, Leaf",Mol Cancer,2,16

In the field of neurology, telemedicine has been used in emergency settings for acute stroke management between spoke and hub hospital networks, where good outcomes have been achieved. However, data on the use of telemedicine in non-stroke acute neurological conditions accessing the emergency department (ED) are currently missing. METHODS AND ANALYSES: This is an interventional, open-label trial on the use of teleconsultation in the ED for neurological diseases other than stroke. The study aims to develop a remote consultancy system (TeleNeurological Evaluation and Support, TeleNS) for patients with acute neurological symptoms referred to hospital facilities without a 24-hour availability of a neurologist consultant (spoke hospitals). The study population will include 100 ED patients referred to two spoke hospitals in 6 months, who will be asked to perform teleconsultation instead of inperson visits. As a control group, retrospectively available data from patients admitted to the ED of spoke hospitals during the same time period over the last 2 years will be evaluated. The primary objective is to assess whether a TeleNS for the ED guarantees a faster but qualitatively non-inferior diagnostic/therapeutic work-up if compared with inperson examination, assuring the availability of all the necessary examinations and treatments with consistent time-saving. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was designed following the national guidelines on clinical investigation on telemedicine provided by the Italian Ministry of Health and according to the Standard Protocol Items for Randomized Trials statement guidelines. This research protocol was approved by Comitato Etico Area Vasta Emilia Nord in September 2020 (number/identification: 942/2020/DISP/AOUMO SIRER ID 805) and was written without patient involvement.

METHODS: Established patients at New York University Langone Health with IMID (n=51) receiving the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination were assessed at baseline and after second immunisation. Healthy subjects served as controls (n=26). IgG antibody responses to the spike protein were analysed for humoral response. Cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was further analysed using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry. A second independent, validation cohort of controls (n=182) and patients with IMID (n=31) from Erlangen, Germany, were also analysed for humoral immune response. RESULTS: Although healthy subjects (n=208) and patients with IMID on biologic treatments (mostly on tumour necrosis factor blockers, n=37) demonstrate robust antibody responses (over 90%), those patients with IMID on background methotrexate (n=45) achieve an adequate response in only 62.2% of cases. Similarly, patients with IMID on methotrexate do not demonstrate an increase in CD8+ T-cell activation after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: In two independent cohorts of patients with IMID, methotrexate, a widely used immunomodulator for the treatment of several IMIDs, adversely affected humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Although precise cut-offs for immunogenicity that correlate with vaccine efficacy are yet to be established, our findings suggest that different strategies may need to be explored in patients with IMID taking methotrexate to increase the chances of immunisation efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 as has been demonstrated for augmenting immunogenicity to other viral vaccines.","Haberman, Rebecca H; Herati, Ramin; Simon, David; Samanovic, Marie; Blank, Rebecca B; Tuen, Michael; Koralov, Sergei B; Atreya, Raja; Tascilar, Koray; Allen, Joseph R; Castillo, Rochelle; Cornelius, Amber R; Rackoff, Paula; Solomon, Gary; Adhikari, Samrachana; Azar, Natalie; Rosenthal, Pamela; Izmirly, Peter; Samuels, Jonathan; Golden, Brian; Reddy, Soumya M; Neurath, Markus F; Abramson, Steven B; Schett, Georg; Mulligan, Mark J; Scher, Jose U",Ann Rheum Dis,2,10
