Currently, organs are not being transplanted from donors who are SARS-CoV-2 positive. It remains unclear as to how to differentiate active from recovered patients. We report our recent experience of a 3-month-old deceased organ donor who died as the result of an anoxic brain injury after a cardiopulmonary arrest (presumed sudden infant death syndrome). The child was born to a mother presumed to have coronavirus disease 2019. The donor tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin A antibodies.

The study aims at assessing the performance of the multiplex D-tek COVIDOT 5 IgG assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (N, S1+S2, S1, S2 and RBD). METHODS: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 218 samples obtained from 46 rRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n=118) collected before the COVID-19 pandemic with a potential cross-reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay were included in the specificity analysis. RESULTS: A gradual dynamic trend since symptom onset was observed for all IgG antibodies. Sensitivities before day 14 were suboptimal. At &#8805;21 days, sensitivities reached 100% (93.4-100%) for N, S1+S2, S2 and RBD-directed IgG and 96.3% (87.3-99.6%) for S1-directed IgG. In 42 out of 46 patients (91.3%), all five antibodies were detected at &#8805;14 days. The four remaining patients had between 2 and 4 positive antibodies at their respective maximal follow-up period. The specificity was 100 % for S1+S2, S2 and RBD, 98.3% for N and 92.4% (86.0-96.5%) for S1-directed IgG. The combined use of antigens increases the early sensitivity whilst enforcing high specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivities at &#8805;21 days and specificities were excellent, especially for N, S1+S2, S2 and RBD-directed IgG. Caution is however required when interpreting single S1-directed reactivities. Using a multiplex assay complies with the orthogonal testing algorithm of the CDC and allows a better and critical interpretation of the serological status of a patient.","Favresse, Julien; Brauner, Jonathan; Bodart, Nicolas; Vigneron, Alain; Roisin, Sandrine; Melchionda, Sabrina; Douxfils, Jonathan; Ocmant, Annick",Clin. chem. lab. med,954,24

While safe vaccines were developed, tested and approved at an extraordinary pace, concerns were raised regarding the public's response in accepting the vaccine on the population level. Israel was among the first countries to roll out a massive national campaign for COVID-19 vaccination, positioning Israel as the global lead in vaccine uptake. Priority for vaccination was given to high-risk groups: older and middle-age adults, healthcare workers, senior home residents and caregivers, people with chronic conditions, followed by teachers and soldiers. Contributing to the success of the operation thus far has been a systems approach beyond nationwide accessibility: building public trust through an integrated and familiar health system, a familiar technology (vaccine), transparency regarding vaccine safety information, culturally appropriate messages in digital and offline media, acknowledging diverse health literacy needs, and active participation and role-modeling by political/religious opinion leaders. Vaccine resistance and hesitancy may be encountered as the campaign progresses, and younger groups targeted.

The groups differed least for physical functioning and most for emotional/mental health. The hospitalized group had the greatest limitation in role due to emotional issues. All groups had significantly lower social functioning scores than the general population. Linear regression showed lower HRQoL domain score in role limitations due to emotional issues adjusted for age, race, and gender for the hospitalized group.

It appears to work in tandem with vitamin D, a secosteroid pro-hormone which reportedly acts as a negative regulatory factor of the RAS [3-6]. A dysfunction (e.g. over-reactivity) of RAS, together with hypovitaminosis D, is likely associated with some of the various renal, cardiac, vascular and immune outcomes that might be observed in COVID-19 patients, including the cytokine storm (i.e. unopposed hyperactive immune reaction generating both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and consequent lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome [1, 7]. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9], the causative agent of COVID-19, has been described to interfere with the RAS [2] by interacting -via its spike (S) glycoprotein- with the metallopeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9, 10] that is expressed at the surface of epithelial cells from blood vessels, lung, kidney (renal tubules), intestine, and heart, as well as on cerebral neurons and immune monocytes/macrophages [11-13]. The main SARS-CoV-2-related COVID-19 symptoms/diseases reported hitherto are hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis (coagulopathy), diarrhea, glaucoma, anosmia, ageusia, skin lesions (dermatitis), autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system, and damages to various organs such as the lung, heart, kidney, and testicle [1, 2, 14]. All these diffuse COVID-19 disorders are likely linked to an over-reaction of RAS in SARS-CoV-2-infected persons. Such a RAS imbalance would be also favored by hypovitaminosis D [2-7, 11]. Since RAS appears to be central in COVID-19 symptoms/diseases, selective targeting of key component(s) of this system might be appropriate to treat RAS-dependent disorders. COVID-19 Disorders: 'Renin-Angiotensin' System (RAS) & Counter-regulatory RAS In the RAS pathway [1, 15], Renin (kidney) cleaves Angiotensinogen (liver) to give Angiotensin I (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFHL). The latter is cleaved by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) to produce Angiotensin II (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPF), which is the substrate of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and key player of the RAS. The cellular targets of Angiotensin II are the vasoconstrictor type 1 (AT1R) and vasodilatator type 2 (AT2R) Angiotensin II receptors (AT1R is expressed at the surface of monocytes/macrophages and T-cells indicating that RAS acts on innate immunity in host). When cleaved by ACE2, Angiotensin II gives Angiotensin 1-7 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHP), targeting the vasodilatator proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MasR). Angiotensin 1-7 can be further transformed to Alamandine (i.e. peptide ARVYIHP) by an aspartate decarboxylase. Alamandine would bind to the vasodilatator Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member D (MRGD) thus promoting most of the Angiotensin 1-7-like effects. Angiotensin II can produce Angiotensin A (i.e. peptide ARVYIHPF) via an aspartate decarboxylase, and Alamandine via an additional ACE2 cleavage. ACE2 can also cleave Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin 1-9 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFH), which targets AT2R. In the RAS pathway were finally evidenced the related Angiotensin III (i.e. peptide RVYIHPF) and Angiotensin IV (i.e. peptide VYIHPF) variants targeting the AT1R and vasodilatator AT4R, respectively. From the known molecular functioning of the RAS, Angiotensins I and II (aside Angiotensin III) are playing central roles in the activity of RAS and associated pathologies, including COVID-19 [2, 10]. Interestingly, it appears that a 'counter-regulatory' RAS does exist to modulate system homeostasis; it relies on Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A, and Angiotensin IV, which are targeting the MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R vasodilatator receptors, respectively. These peptides were found to exhibit cardioprotective, vasoactive (anti-hypertensive), anti-hypertrophic and/or anti-inflammatory potentials [15]. Such naturally-produced molecules of the RAS are expected to counteract the SARS-CoV-2-induced over-activation of RAS and reverse, to some extent, the associated COVID-19 diseases. CONCLUDING REMARKS A recent report suggests that RAS inhibitors may act on the severity of viral infection and mortality of COVID-19 patients [14]. Whether or not RAS blockers would be beneficial to COVID-19 cases is still controversial. The RAS inhibitors likely prevent the cytokine storm as RAS is reported to control the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [1, 7]. It appears that COVID-19 disorders of SARS-CoV-2-infected humans depend on the RAS over-reacted by the (ACE2-dependent) viral infection and vitamin D deficiency. The track for a possible COVID-19 treatment would be to target RAS using specific candidate chemotherapeutic drugs. The proposed molecules are (so far) ACE inhibitors (to prevent the production of Angiotensin II from Angiotensin I), and blockers/antagonists of AT1R such as Losartan and derivatives. Recombinant ACE2 (under clinical trials) is also considered as a decoy for the recognition and competitive binding to the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10]. We support the use of natural candidate peptide drugs that belong to the 'counter-regulatory' RAS, i.e. Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A and/or Angiotensin IV to treat COVID-19 disorders. The targeted receptors would thus be MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R.

The objective of this study was to examine mental health symptoms among US adults in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in late March 2020 with a national sample of 963 US adults using an online research platform. Participants self-reported state of residence, psychosocial characteristics, and levels of anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive function, and fatigue in the context of COVID-19 using validated patient-reported outcomes scales in the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System measures. We used analysis of variance and multivariate linear regression to evaluate correlates of mental health symptoms. RESULTS: Overall, participants reported high levels of anxiety (mean [SD], 57.2 [9.3]) and depression (mean [SD], 54.2 [9.5]). Levels of anger, anxiety, cognitive function, depression, and fatigue were significantly higher among the Millennial Generation and Generation X (vs Baby Boomers), those with not enough or enough (vs more than enough) financial resources, females vs males), those with self-reported disability (vs no self-reported disability), and those with inadequate (vs adequate) health literacy. In adjusted models, being in Generation X and the Millennial Generation (vs Baby Boomer), having not enough or enough vs more than enough) financial resources, and having inadequate (vs adequate) health literacy were most strongly correlated with worse mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that mental health symptoms during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were prevalent nationally, regardless of state of residence and especially among young, psychosocially vulnerable groups.","Reading Turchioe, Meghan; Grossman, Lisa V; Myers, Annie C; Pathak, Jyotishman; Creber, Ruth Masterson",Public Health Rep,954,1

In the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which is considered to exert cellular responses to counteract the activation of the RAS primarily through a receptor, Mas, in multiple organs including skeletal muscle. Previous studies have provided abundant evidence suggesting that Ang 1-7 modulates multiple signalling pathways leading to protection from pathological muscle remodelling and muscle insulin resistance. In contrast, there is relatively little evidence to support the protective role of ACE2 in skeletal muscle. The potential contribution of endogenous ACE2 to the regulation of Ang 1-7-mediated protection of these muscle pathologies is discussed in this review. Recent studies have suggested that ACE2 protects against ageing-associated muscle wasting (sarcopenia) through its function to modulate molecules outside of the RAS. Thus, the potential association of sarcopenia with ACE2 and the associated molecules outside of RAS is also presented herein. Further, we introduce the transcriptional regulation of muscle ACE2 by drugs or exercise, and briefly discuss the potential role of ACE2 in the development of COVID-19.","Yamamoto, Koichi; Takeshita, Hikari; Rakugi, Hiromi",Clin Sci (Lond),954,30

Of the 15-20% patients that develop pulmonary symptoms, a sub-set develops an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rapidly progressing into a critical condition. Marked elevation of cytokines/chemokines is observed with elevation of additional markers of inflammation, coagulation, and organ damage such as CRP, D-dimer, LDH, Ferritin and Troponin-I. This hyperinflammation leads to worsening of oxygen saturation due to pulmonary infiltration and exudation, organ damage, and dysfunction of coagulation pathway and may lead to multi-organ failure. AREAS COVERED: The role of anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibodies such as Itolizumab, in cytokine storm. EXPERT OPINION: Itolizumab, an anti-CD6 humanized IgG1 mAb, binds to domain-1 of CD-6 that is responsible for priming, activation, and differentiation of T-cells. Itolizumab significantly reduces T-cell proliferation along with substantial downregulation of the production of cytokines/chemokines. Approved for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013 it is currently being studied for addressing COVID-19 related cytokine storm and its complications.

This review discussed the pathways for the virus invasion into the nervous system and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the immune responses and cytokine storm induction after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also discussed. Although some neurological symptoms are mild and disappear after recovery from infection, some severe neurological complications contribute to the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the insight into the cause of SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm in context with neurological complications will formulate the novel management of the disease and further identify new therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","Chong, Zhao-Zhong; Souayah, Nizar",Curr. med. chem,954,21

To date, however, no effective treatments or enough vaccines for COVID-19 are available. The roles of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike protein in the treatment of COVID-19 are major areas of research. In this study, we explored the potential of ACE2 and spike protein as targets for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed clinical data, genetic data, and receptor binding capability. Clinical data revealed that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities related to an abnormal renin-angiotensin system exhibited more early symptoms and poorer prognoses. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 progression is still not clear. Furthermore, if ACE2 is not a good targetable protein, it would not be applicable across a wide range of populations. The spike-S1 receptor-binding domain that interacts with ACE2 showed various amino acid mutations based on sequence analysis. We identified two spike-S1 point mutations (V354F and V470A) by receptor-ligand docking and binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These variants enhanced the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 receptors and were potentially associated with increased infectivity. Importantly, the number of patients infected with the V354F and V470A mutants has increased with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These results suggest that ACE2 and spike-S1 are likely not ideal targets for the design of peptide drugs to treat COVID-19 in different populations.","Shu, Chuan-Jun Huang Xuan Tang Hui-Hao Mo Ding-Ding Zhou Jian-Wei Deng Cheng",Zoological Research,954,3

Although vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed at a record-breaking pace, the majority of those that are licensed or currently registered in clinical trials are formulated as an injectable product, requiring a tightly regulated cold-chain infrastructure, and primarily inducing systemic immune responses.Areas covered: Here, we shed light on the status of inhaled vaccines against viral pathogens, providing background to the role of the mucosal immune system and elucidating what factors determine an inhalable vaccine's efficacy. We also discuss whether the development of an inhalable powder vaccine formulation against SARS-CoV-2 could be feasible. The review was conducted using relevant studies from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar.Expert opinion: We believe that the scope of vaccine research should be broadened toward inhalable dry powder formulations since dry vaccines bear several advantages. Firstly, their dry state can tremendously increase vaccine stability and shelf-life. Secondly, they can be inhaled using disposable inhalers, omitting the need for trained health-care personnel and, therefore, facilitating mass-vaccination campaigns. Thirdly, inhalable vaccines may provide improved protection since they can induce an IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.","Heida, Rick; Hinrichs, Wouter Lj; Frijlink, Henderik W",Expert rev. vaccines (Online),954,1
