1451,1451,1451,Comparative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Three Immunization Strategies in Controlling Disease Outbreaks in Realistic Social Networks,14.04086,3.4598958,2014-05-02,"The high incidence of emerging infectious diseases has highlighted the importance of effective immunization strategies, especially the stochastic algorithms based on local available network information. Present stochastic strategies are mainly evaluated based on classical network models, such as scale-free networks and small-world networks, and thus are insufficient. Three frequently referred stochastic immunization strategies—acquaintance immunization, community-bridge immunization, and ring vaccination—were analyzed in this work. The optimal immunization ratios for acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization strategies were investigated, and the effectiveness of these three strategies in controlling the spreading of epidemics were analyzed based on realistic social contact networks. The results show all the strategies have decreased the coverage of the epidemics compared to baseline scenario (no control measures). However the effectiveness of acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization are very limited, with acquaintance immunization slightly outperforming community-bridge immunization. Ring vaccination significantly outperforms acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization, and the sensitivity analysis shows it could be applied to controlling the epidemics with a wide infectivity spectrum. The effectiveness of several classical stochastic immunization strategies was evaluated based on realistic contact networks for the first time in this study. These results could have important significance for epidemic control research and practice.","Xu, Zhijing; Zu, Zhenghu; Zheng, Tao; Zhang, Wendou; Xu, Qing; Liu, Jinjie",PLoS One,296,17

Metabolomics studies involve sophisticated analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and generate large amounts of high-dimensional and complex experimental data. Open source processing and analysis tools are of major interest in light of innovative, open and reproducible science. The scientific community has developed a wide range of open source software, providing freely available advanced processing and analysis approaches. The programming and statistics environment R has emerged as one of the most popular environments to process and analyse Metabolomics datasets. A major benefit of such an environment is the possibility of connecting different tools into more complex workflows. Combining reusable data processing R scripts with the experimental data thus allows for open, reproducible research. This review provides an extensive overview of existing packages in R for different steps in a typical computational metabolomics workflow, including data processing, biostatistics, metabolite annotation and identification, and biochemical network and pathway analysis. Multifunctional workflows, possible user interfaces and integration into workflow management systems are also reviewed. In total, this review summarises more than two hundred metabolomics specific packages primarily available on CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub.","Stanstrup, Jan; Broeckling, Corey D.; Helmus, Rick; Hoffmann, Nils; Mathé, Ewy; Naake, Thomas; Nicolotti, Luca; Peters, Kristian; Rainer, Johannes; Salek, Reza M.; Schulze, Tobias; Schymanski, Emma L.; Stravs, Michael A.; Thévenot, Etienne A.; Treutler, Hendrik; Weber, Ralf J.

The object of learning in both is the economic principle of changes in price as a function of changes in the relative magnitude of changes in demand and supply. The patterns of variation and invariance, defining the conditions compared were built into pedagogical tools (text, graphs, and worksheets). The first study is the latest in a series of studies aiming to test the fundamental conjecture of the Variation Theory of Learning that new meanings are acquired from experiencing differences against a background of sameness, rather than experiencing sameness against a background of differences. The study compares the learning outcomes under conditions consistent with the basic conjecture with the learning outcomes under conditions not consistent with the theory. The results support the conjecture. The second study shows, however, that the conditions that are consistent with the theory cannot be decided unless the learners’ pre-requisites for the task in question are taken into consideration. One set of the pedagogical tools was found to be highly effective for learners with a better initial grasp of the object of learning, while another set was found to be equally effective for learners with a weaker initial grasp of the object of learning. The two sets were equally ineffective when used for the “wrong” group of learners.","Pang, Ming Fai; Marton, Ference",Instr Sci,296,1

The causative agent is confined to certain isolates of influenza A virus subtypes H5 and H7. Due to the potential of direct transfer of avian influenza to humans, continued research into rapid diagnostic tests for influenza is therefore necessary. A nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) method was developed to detect a portion of the haemagglutinin gene of avian influenza A virus subtypes H5 and H7 irrespective of lineage. A further NASBA assay, based on the matrix gene, was able to detect examples of all known subtypes (H1–H15) of avian influenza virus. The entire nucleic acid isolation, amplification, and detection procedure was completed within 6 h. The dynamic range of the three AIV assays was five to seven orders of magnitude. The assays were sensitive and highly specific, with no cross-reactivity to phylogenetically or clinically relevant viruses. The results of the three AIV NASBA assays correlated with those obtained by viral culture in embryonated fowl’s eggs.","Lau, Lok-Ting; Banks, Jill; Aherne, Rebecca; Brown, Ian H.; Dillon, Natalie; Collins, Richard A.; Chan, Ka-Yun; Fung, Yin-Wan Wendy; Xing, Jun; Yu, Albert C.H.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,296,1

The mean number of children in the DCCs was 223; the diarrhea rate during the first 12 months was 2.62 episodes per child-year. Rotavirus accounted for approximately 10% of the total episodes of diarrhea in the pediatric clinic and DCC populations, but 50% during the winter months. The occurrence of RV in the DCCs paralleled that seen in the pediatric clinic. The annual rate of RV infection in DCCs was 0.55 episodes per child-year, with diarrhea occurring in only 40% of the episodes (0.22 episodes per child-year). There were 45 diarrhea outbreaks in DCCs, for a mean of 3.8 per center per year; nine of these outbreaks were associated with RV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA genome patterns of RV strains from eight of these outbreaks showed that in seven outbreaks a single strain was identified in children in that DCC, whereas multiple strains were identified simultaneously in the community. The age distributions of symptomatic and asymptomatic RV infections in DCC study children were not significantly different. In symptomatic RV-infected children in DCCs, 42% had RV identified in stool specimens within 2 days before diarrhea occurred. Thirty-eight DCC children had more than one episode of RV infection, but only five had two symptomatic RV infections. Diarrhea caused by RV is common in children in DCCs, often occurs in outbreaks due to the same strain, and parallels disease in the community; asymptomatic RV infection is also common in children in DCCs.","Bartlett, Alfred V.; Reves, Randall R.; Pickering, Larry K.",J Pediatr,296,1

Alignment of the CrPV protein sequence with those of picornavirus and calicivirus capsid proteins demonstrated that the sequenced portion of the insect picornavirus genome encodes the C‐terminal part of VP3 and the entire VP1. Thus CrPV seems to have a genome organization distinct from that of other picornaviruses but closely resembling that of caliciviruses, with the capsid proteins encoded in the 3′ part of the genome. On the other hand, the tentative phylogenetic trees generated from the VP3 alignment revealed grouping of CrPV with hepatitis A virus, a true picornavirus, not with caliciviruses. Thus CrPV may be a picornavirus with a calicivirus‐like genome organization. Different options for CrPV genome expression are discussed.","Koonin, Eugene V.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.",FEBS Lett,296,1

This issue is addressed here by proposing a new numerical procedure to reduce the number of transport equations to be solved. This new problem reduction scheme (PRS) uses a predictor‐corrector approach, which “predicts” the transport of a set of non‐indicator species using results from a set of indicator species before “correcting” the non‐indicator concentrations using a mass balance error measure. The full chemical transport model is described along with experimental validation. The PRS is then presented together with an investigation, based on a 16‐species reaction‐advection‐diffusion problem, which determines the range of applicability of different orders of the PRS. The results of a further study are presented, in which a set of PRS simulations is compared with those from full model predictions. The application of the scheme to the intermediate‐sized problems considered in the present study showed reductions of up to 82% in CPU time, with good levels of accuracy maintained.","Freeman, Brubeck Lee; Cleall, Peter John; Jefferson, Anthony Duncan",Int J Numer Methods Eng,296,1

Then problem of optimizing sentinel surveillance in networks is to identify the nodes to probe such that an emerging disease outbreak can be discovered early or reliably. Whether the emphasis should be on early or reliable detection depends on the scenario in question. We investigate three objective measures from the literature quantifying the performance of nodes in sentinel surveillance: the time to detection or extinction, the time to detection, and the frequency of detection. As a basis for the comparison, we use the susceptible-infectious-recovered model on static and temporal networks of human contacts. We show that, for some regions of parameter space, the three objective measures can rank the nodes very differently. This means sentinel surveillance is a class of problems, and solutions need to chose an objective measure for the particular scenario in question. As opposed to other problems in network epidemiology, we draw similar conclusions from the static and temporal networks. Furthermore, we do not find one type of network structure that predicts the objective measures, i.e., that depends both on the data set and the SIR parameter values.","Holme, Petter",,296,1

Here, we used NanoLuc, a small and extremely bright luciferase protein, to develop an HIV-1 bioluminescent reporter virus that simplifies functional measurement of virus particle production. RESULTS: The reporter virus encodes a Gag protein containing NanoLuc inserted between the matrix (MA) and capsid (CA) domains of Gag, thereby generating virus particles that package high levels of the NanoLuc reporter. We observe that inserting the NanoLuc protein within HIV-1 Gag has minimal impact on Gag expression and virus particle release. We show that the reporter virus recapitulates inhibition of HIV-1 particle release by Gag mutations, the restriction factor tetherin, and the small-molecule inhibitor amphotericin-B methyl ester. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that this vector will provide a simple and rapid tool for functional studies of virus particle assembly and release and high-throughput screening for cellular factors and small molecules that promote or inhibit HIV-1 particle production.","Kirui, James; Freed, Eric O.",Retrovirology,296,1

Losses of the type 2 component due to adsorption to the glass ampule occurred with the purified vaccine preparation. This problem was solved by changing the diluent, and the vaccine was submitted for evaluation in clinical trials at Johns Hopkins (Baltimore, Md.). Phase 2 of the development was to standardize production of IPV from MRC-5 (human diploid) cells on microcarriers and otherwise follow the Rijks Instituut's method. Results of experimental trivalent vaccine production and testing showed that the number of effective doses harvested from MRC-5 cell cultures compared favorably with vaccine derived from monkey kidney. The yields could be further increased with stearyl tyrosine as adjuvant. Large-scale production using 200-liter fermenters is in progress. Poliovirus particles of various densities in cesium chloride can be found in any IPV preparation and give rise to different immunogenic responses.

The present study was conducted to develop high-yielding rice lines with tolerance to drought and submergence by introgressing Sub1 into a rice line with drought yield QTL (qDTY; QTL = quantitative trait loci) viz. qDTY(3).(1) and qDTY(12).(1) using marker-assisted breeding. We report here the effect of different combinations of Sub1 and qDTY on morpho-physiological, agronomical traits and yield under reproductive stage drought stress (RS) and non-stress (NS) conditions. Lines with outstanding performance in RS and NS trials were also evaluated in vegetative stage submergence stress (VS) trial to assess the tolerance level. The QTL class analysis revealed Sub1 + qDTY(3).(1) as the best QTL combination affecting the measured traits in RS trial followed by Sub1 + qDTY(12).(1). The effects of single Sub1, qDTY(3).(1) and qDTY(12).(1) were not as superior as when the QTLs are combined, suggesting the positive interaction of Sub1 and qDTY. Best performing lines selected from the RS and NS trials recorded yield advantage up to 4453.69 kg ha(−1) and 6954 kg ha(−1) over the parents, respectively. The lines were also found having great tolerance to submergence ranging from 80% to 100%, contributed by a lower percentage of shoot elongation and reduction of chlorophyll content after 14 days of VS. These lines could provide yield sustainability to farmers in regions impacted with drought and submergence while serving as important genetic materials for future breeding programs.","Mohd Ikmal, Asmuni; Noraziyah, Abd Aziz Shamsudin; Wickneswari, Ratnam",Plants (Basel),296,1

HPV E6, E7 are two main papillomavirus oncoproteins, closely relate to the function of HPV immortalization, cell transformation, and carcinogenesis. L1 is the major capsid protein, can reflect the replication status of the virus in cells and the progression of cervical lesions. The purpose of this study is to reveal the prevalence of HPV 39 and the genetic polymorphisms of HPV39 based on E6, E7 and L1 gene in southwest China. METHODS: Cell samples were collected by cervical scraped for HPV detecting and typing, and HPV39 positive samples were selected out. Important E6, E7 and L1 genes of HPV39 were sequenced and analyzed for the study of HPV39 genetic polymorphisms. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by Maximum-likelihood and Kimura 2-parameters methods in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 6.0. The selection pressures of E6, E7 and L1 genes were estimated by Datamonkey web server. The secondary and three-dimensional structure of HPV39 E6, E7 proteins were created by sopma server and SWISS-MODEL software. RESULTS: 344 HPV39 positive samples were selected from 5718 HPV positive cell samples. Among HPV39 E6-E7 sequences, 20 single nucleotide mutations were detected, including 10 non-synonymous and 10 synonymous mutations; 26 single nucleotide mutations were detected in HPV39 L1 sequences, including 7 non-synonymous and 19 synonymous mutations respectively. 11 novel variants of HPV39 E6-E7 (5 in E6 and 6 in E7) and 14 novel variants of HPV39 L1 were identified in this study. A-branch was the most frequent HPV39 lineage in southwest China during our investigation. Selective pressure analysis showed that codon sites 26, 87, 151 in E6 and 75, 180, 222, 272, 284, 346, 356 in L1 were positively selected sites, as well as codon sites 45, 138, 309, 381 were negative selection sites in L1 gene, E7 has neither positive selection sites nor negative selection sites. A certain degree of secondary and three-dimensional structure dislocation was existed due to the non-synonymous mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Amino acid substitution affected the secondary and three-dimensional structure of HPV39, and resulting in the differences of carcinogenic potential and biological functions as well as the immune response due to the antigen epitopes difference, the antigen epitopes with stronger adaptability in Southwest will be screened out based on the above research results for the later vaccine development. And gene polymorphism of HPV39 in Southwest China may improve the effectiveness of clinical test and vaccine design, specifically for women in Southwest China.","He, Jiaoyu; Li, Tianjun; Wang, Youliang; Song, Zhilin; Li, Qiufu; Liu, Yiran; Cui, Yanru; Ma, Siyu; Deng, Junhang; Wei, Xia; Ding, Xianping",Virol J,296,1

METHODS: This longitudinal study assessed 250 participants at 1 year after the earthquake; 162 (64.8%) were followed up at 7 years. Emotional distress was assessed with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) at both time points. We assessed ProQOL, including compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress, and earthquake exposure at 1 year. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to test longitudinal changes in emotional distress. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to examine the effect of earthquake exposure and ProQOL. RESULTS: The positive screening rate of emotional distress (SRQ ≥ 8) was 37.6 and 15.4% at one and 7 years, respectively. Emotional distress scores declined over time (p < 0.001). Earthquake exposure and ProQOL predicted one-year (ps < 0.05) but not seven-year emotional distress, whereas burnout predicted both one-year (p = 0.018) and seven-year (p = 0.047) emotional distress.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the burden of respiratory morbidity in terms of ventilator dependence (VD) days and length of stay in neurotrauma ICU (NICU) and hospital, and to determine mortality in patients with traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) in a low middle-income country (LMIC). SETTING: Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. METHODS: A total of 135 patients admitted with CSCI in the NICU between January 2017 to December 2018 were screened. Information regarding age, gender, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale (AIS), level of injury, duration of VD, length of NICU, hospital stay, and outcome in terms of mortality or discharge from the hospital were obtained from the medical records. RESULTS: A total of 106 CSCI patients were analyzed. The mean (SD) age of patients was 40 (±16) years and male: female ratio was 5:1. The duration of VD, duration of NICU, and hospital stay was a median of 8 days (IQR 1127), 6 days (IQR 1118), and 15 days (IQR 3127) respectively. Mortality was 19% (20/106). The mortality was significantly associated with poorer AIS score, VD, and duration of ICU and hospital stay. All patients were discharged to home only after they became ventilator-free. CONCLUSIONS: The ventilator burden, hospital stay, and mortality are high in patients with CSCI in LMICs. Poor AIS scores, prolonged VD, ICU and hospital stay are associated with mortality.

We developed a minimally invasive methodology for isolation of neonatal basal cells from nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirates and performed functional analysis in organotypic cultures to address this issue. We show that preterm NP progenitors have a markedly distinct molecular signature of abnormal proliferation and mitochondria quality control compared to term progenitors. Preterm progenitors had lower oxygen consumption at baseline and were unable to ramp up consumption to the levels of term cells when challenged. Although they formed a mucociliary epithelium, ciliary function tended to decline in premature cells as they differentiated, compared to term cells. Together, these differences suggested increased sensitivity of preterm progenitors to environmental stressors under non-homeostatic conditions.","Shui, Jessica E.; Wang, Wei; Liu, Helu; Stepanova, Anna; Liao, Grace; Qian, Jun; Ai, Xingbin; Ten, Vadim; Lu, Jining; Cardoso, Wellington V.",Sci Rep,296,1

The indirect effect of age group on emotional responses and conflict strategies through visual fixation on conflict scenes was also examined. Utilizing eye tracking, the visual attention of younger and older workers while watching two hypothetical workplace task conflict videos was recorded and compared. The participants were also asked to imagine how they would respond if they were the main actor in the vignettes. A total of 94 working adults, including 48 younger workers and 46 older workers, participated in the eye tracking experiment. Older workers reported fewer negative and more positive emotions than their younger counterparts after watching the conflict videos, particularly those on the non-intergenerational conflict. Younger workers used more dominating in the intergenerational conflict than in the non-intergenerational conflict; such discrepancy between conflict types was relatively small in older workers. Compared with younger workers, older workers fixated significantly less on the coworker during the intergenerational conflict scenes. A significant indirect effect of age group through visual fixation on the coworker was observed for positive emotions and avoiding. Results revealed that older workers may regulate their emotional reactions and conflict strategies to workplace conflicts by reducing their attention to negative stimuli.","Yeung, Dannii Y.; Isaacowitz, Derek M.; Lam, Winnie W.

We describe how we used MT as an entertaining forum where audiences learn about research, and where researchers learn about how the public views research. Methods: Drama scripts depicting community interaction with different aspects of research were developed iteratively with research staff, a theatre company and community members. Six fortnightly theatre outreaches per site over two months, attracting a total of 1454 audience members were held in Mida, a rural village 30 km north of Kilifi; and in Mtwapa, a peri-urban town 45 km to the south. Audiences were presented with dramatized health research-related dilemmas and subsequently invited to enact their responses. Evaluation comprised, notes and observations from meetings, rehearsals and outreaches, transcripts from a review workshop with repeat audience members (n=21), a reflection meeting with KWTRP engagement staff (n=12), and a group discussion with the theatre company (n=9). Discussions were recorded, transcribed, translated to English and analysed using thematic approach. Results: Despite being costly in terms of time and expense, we argue that MT in public spaces can assist audience members to navigate ‘border-crossings’ between everyday contexts and scientific/research concepts. This can enable audiences to share their views and concerns and enact their responses to research-related dilemmas. Conclusions: While reporting on MT’s successes, drawing from literature on rumours, we acknowledge the limitations of individual engagement activities in providing long-term solutions to address alternative interpretations and rumours about research, in the context of local and global inequities.

The emergent spatial and temporal patterns of adaptation, observed as changes in cellular connectivity and tissue remodeling by cells, underpin neuroplasticity, muscle memory, immunological imprinting, and sentience itself, in diverse physiological systems from brain to bone. Connectomics addresses the direct connectivity of cells and cells’ adaptation to dynamic environments through manufacture of extracellular matrix, forming tissues and architectures comprising interacting organs and systems of organisms. There is imperative to understand the physical renderings of cellular experience throughout life, from the time of emergence, to growth, adaptation and aging-associated degeneration of tissues. Here we address this need through development of technological approaches that incorporate cross length scale (nm to m) structural data, acquired via multibeam scanning electron microscopy, with machine learning and information transfer using network modeling approaches. This pilot case study uses cutting edge imaging methods for nano- to meso-scale study of cellular inhabitants within human hip tissue resected during the normal course of hip replacement surgery. We discuss the technical approach and workflow and identify the resulting opportunities as well as pitfalls to avoid, delineating a path for cellular connectomics studies in diverse tissue/organ environments and their interactions within organisms and across species. Finally, we discuss the implications of the outlined approach for neuromechanics and the control of physical behavior and neuromuscular training.","Knothe Tate, Melissa L.; Srikantha, Abhilash; Wojek, Christian; Zeidler, Dirk",Front Physiol,296,1

METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized, before-after and cohort studies that implemented a clinical decision support system for hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury between 1990 and 2019. The studies must describe their impact on care processes, patient-related outcomes, or hospital length of stay. The clinical decision support system included both electronic alerts and care bundles. RESULTS: We identified seven studies involving 32,846 participants. Clinical decision support system implementation significantly reduced mortality (OR 0.86; 95 % CI, 0.75–0.99; p = 0.040, I(2) = 65.3 %; n = 5 studies; N = 30,791 participants) and increased the proportion of acute kidney injury recognition (OR 3.12; 95 % CI, 2.37–4.10; p < 0.001, I(2) = 77.1 %; n = 2 studies; N = 25,121 participants), and investigations (OR 3.07; 95 % CI, 2.91–3.24; p < 0.001, I(2) = 0.0 %; n = 2 studies; N = 25,121 participants).

Based on excellent transmission-blocking activities of the PbPH (PBANKA_0417200) and PbSOP26 (PBANKA_1457700) antigens in Plasmodium berghei, their orthologs in P. vivax, PVX_098655 (PvPH) and PVX_101120 (PvSOP26), were selected for the evaluation of their potential as TBVs. METHODS: Fragments of PvPH (amino acids 22–304) and PvSOP26 (amino acids 30–272) were expressed in the yeast expression system. The recombinant proteins were used to immunize mice to obtain antisera. The transmission-reducing activities of these antisera were evaluated using the direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA) using Anopheles dirus mosquitoes and P. vivax clinical isolates. RESULTS: The recombinant proteins PvPH and PvSOP26 induced robust antibody responses in mice. The DMFA showed that the anti-PvSOP26 sera significantly reduced oocyst densities by 92.0 and 84.1% in two parasite isolates, respectively, whereas the anti-PvPH sera did not show evident transmission-reducing activity. The variation in the DMFA results was unlikely due to the genetic polymorphisms of the two genes since their respective sequences were identical in the clinical P. vivax isolates. CONCLUSION: PvSOP26 could be a promising TBV candidate for P. vivax, which warrants further evaluation.

GMAS was developed and validated among Urdu-speaking patients with chronic diseases. However, validated tool in Nepalese language to measure medication adherence among chronic illness patients currently does not exist. AIM: To translate, culturally adapt, and validate the English version of GMAS into the Nepalese language to measure medication adherence among chronic illness patients. METHODS: The study was conducted among patients with chronic diseases in both hospital and community pharmacies of Nepal. The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Good Practice Guideline for linguistic translation and cultural adaptation was used to translate and culturally adapt the English version of GMAS into the Nepalese version. The translated version was validated amongst patients with chronic diseases in Nepal. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out using principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Test–retest reliability and internal consistency were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 220 (53.6% females, and 51.4% of 51 to 70 aged patients) patients with chronic diseases participated in the study. The majority of patients took two medications (27.3%) from six months to five and half years (68.2%). Kaiser Meyer Olkin was found to be 0.83. A principal axis factor analysis was conducted on the 3 items of GMAS without and with orthogonal rotation (varimax). The scree plot showed an inflexion on the third item that meant three components were present. The overall Cronbach’s alpha value of the full-phase study was 0.82. CONCLUSION: The General Medication Adherence Scale was successfully translated into the Nepalese language, culturally adapted, and validated amongst chronic diseases patients of Nepal. Therefore, the GMAS-Nepalese version can be used to evaluate medication adherence among Nepalese-speaking patients with chronic disease.","Shrestha, Rajeev; Sapkota, Binaya; Khatiwada, Asmita Priyadarshini; Shrestha, Sunil; Khanal, Saval; KC, Bhuvan; Paudyal, Vibhu",Patient Prefer Adherence,296,1

Using a national surveillance system, we describe the epidemiology of IC adults hospitalized with influenza. METHODS: We analyzed data on adults (aged ≥18 years) hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2011–2012 through 2014–2015 seasons and reported to CDC’s Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET). We defined IC patients as having ≥1 of the following: HIV, AIDS, cancer, stem cell or organ transplantation, non-steroid immunosuppressive therapy, immunoglobulin deficiency, asplenia, and other rare conditions. We compared IC and non-IC patients using χ(2) or Fisher’s exact tests and t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Among 35,348 adults hospitalized over four seasons, 3,633 (10%) were IC. The most common IC conditions were cancer (44%), non-steroid immunosuppressive therapy (44%), and HIV (17%). IC patients were younger than non-IC patients (mean 61 ± 17 vs. 67 ± 20 years; P < 0.01). IC patients were more likely to have underlying renal disease (27% vs. 18%) and liver disease (7% vs. 3%) and less likely to have most other chronic underlying conditions including obesity (18% vs. 23%), cardiovascular disease (40% vs. 47%), and chronic lung disease (35% vs. 41%; P < 0.01 for all). IC patients were more likely to have received influenza vaccination (53% vs. 46%; P < 0.01). Among cases with symptom data (2014–2015), IC patients were more likely to present with fever (68% vs. 61%; P < 0.01) but respiratory distress was similar (53% vs. 54%; P = 0.3). Overall, the majority of IC and non-IC patients received antivirals (87% vs. 85%; P < 0.01). IC patients had a longer duration of hospitalization (median (IQR) 4 (2–6) vs. 3 (2–6) days; P < 0.01) and were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia (34 vs. 31%; P < 0.01) and to require intensive care (18% vs. 16%; P = 0.01). Death during hospitalization occurred in 135 (3.7%) IC and 945 (3.0%) non-IC patients (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Among adults hospitalized with influenza, IC patients had worse outcomes including a longer duration of hospitalization and higher probability of pneumonia and intensive care unit admission, and increased all-cause mortality, although these results are not adjusted for potential confounders.

It represents the most important airway defensive reflex and one of the main symptoms of respiratory disease. During coughing and sneezing, particles of mucus can be expelled for a distance of up to 9 m [1]. Various pathogens, if present, may therefore, infect nearby people and animals, contributing to massive dissemination of airborne infections. In addition to using various protective measures, down-regulation of coughing plays a substantial role in preventing dissemination of respiratory infections. For example, about 80 % of passengers on a 3-h airplane trip may be infected by the cough of an individual carrying the flu virus. These newly infected passengers then disseminate the viral infection at their destinations worldwide.","Tomori, Zoltan; Donic, Viliam",Noninvasive Ventilation in High-Risk Infections and Mass Casualty Events,296,1

Viral hepatitis B (HBV) affects an estimated 360 million people, whereas hepatitis C affects 123 million people worldwide, and last but not least, at current, India has an HIV/AIDS population of approximately 2.4 million people and more than 30 million in whole world and now it has become a reason for 1.8 million death globally; thus, millions of people still struggle for their lives. The progress in medical science has made it possible in overcoming the various fatal diseases such as small pox, chicken pox, dengue, etc., but human immunodeficiency viruses, influenza, and hepatitis virus have renewed challenge surprisingly. The obstacles and challenges in therapy include existence of antibiotic resistance strains of common organisms due to overuse of antibiotics, lack of vaccines, adverse drug reaction, and last but not least the susceptibility concerns. Emergence of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics has shown some promises to take challenges. The discovery of human genome project has opened new vistas to understand the behaviors of genetic makeup in development and progression of diseases and treatment in various viral diseases. Current and previous decade have been engaged in making repositories of polymorphisms (SNPs) of various genes including drug-metabolizing enzymes, receptors, inflammatory cells related with immunity, and antigen-presenting cells, along with the prediction of risks. The genetic makeup alone is most likely an adequate way to handle the therapeutic decision-making process for previous regimen failure. With the introduction of new antiviral therapeutic agents, a significant improvement in progression and overall survival has been achieved, but these drugs have shown several adverse responses in some individuals, so the success is not up to the expectations. Research and acquisition of new knowledge of pharmacogenomics may help in overcoming the prevailing burden of viral diseases. So it will definitely help in selecting the most effective therapeutic agents, effective doses, and drug response for the individuals. Thus, it will be able to transform the laboratory research into the clinical bench side and will also help in understanding the pathogenesis of viral diseases with drug action, so the patients will be managed more properly and finally become able to fulfill the promise of the future.","Dwivedi, Shailendra; Yadav, Suraj Singh; Singh, Manish Kumar; Shukla, Shailja; Khattri, Sanjay; Pant, Kamlesh Kumar",Omics for Personalized Medicine,296,1

Recent studies have shown that using face masks is correlated to an individual’s age and gender, where females and older adults are more likely to wear a mask than males or youths. There are only a few studies quantifying the impact of using face masks to slow the spread of an epidemic at the population level, and even fewer studies that model their impact in a population where the use of face masks depends upon the age and gender of the population. We use a state-of-the-art agent-based simulation to model the use of face masks and quantify their impact on three levels of an influenza epidemic and compare different mitigation scenarios. These scenarios involve changing the demographics of mask usage, the adoption of mask usage in relation to a perceived threat level, and the combination of masks with other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing and social distancing. Our results shows that face masks alone have limited impact on the spread of influenza. However, when face masks are combined with other interventions such as hand sanitizer, they can be more effective. We also observe that monitoring social internet systems can be a useful technique to measure compliance. We conclude that educating the public on the effectiveness of masks to increase compliance can reduce morbidity and mortality.","Mniszewski, Susan M.; Del Valle, Sara Y.; Priedhorsky, Reid; Hyman, James M.; Hickman, Kyle S.",Theories and Simulations of Complex Social Systems,296,1

However, this point requires some explanatory work if it is to have more than a very general application to the work of these public health professionals. For these professionals might ask with some justification why they should treat seriously argument forms that have been deemed to be logically inadequate by generations of philosophers. They might also wonder if philosophical discussion of reasoning has anything but the most abstract lessons for scientists who are charged with containing infectious diseases. In this chapter, I undertake this explanatory work by arguing that philosophical contributions on reasoning and argument are not only relevant to epidemiology, but that they also represent the very best prospect for investigators of addressing some of the criticisms of epidemiology that have been raised in recent years.

Darwin is hailed as one of the greatest scientist who put forth the theory of gradual evolution and branching of all life forms. Unfortunately, then fossil records were incomplete to produce evidence of human evolution. For 200 years paleobiologists were looking for any evidence of a transitional fossil to showcase the evolution of monkeys, apes and human. The story of Ida began in 1983 when she was collected from Messel pit in Germany by an unknown collector, and displayed in his home for 20 years before deciding to sell. The fossil Ida was preserved in nature for ages in the Germany’s Messel pit, a crater rich in Eocene Epoch fossils. Ida lived when major changes were taking place on earth, the dinosaurs had become extinct, the Himalayas were forming and a range of mammals thrived in vast jungles all over the world. Prof. Jørn Hurum of the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, Norway bought the fossil for 1 million USD, assembled top international team of experts, studied the fossil secretly for 2 years, and satisfied themselves as to the genuineness of the fossil. Finally Prof. Jørn Hurum announced the discovery of 47 million years old fossil — a link in the evolution of monkeys, apes and man. He named the fossil “Ida” and her scientific name is Darwinius masillae (named in honor of Charles Darwin’s bicentenary). Ida will remain for long a subject of intense research and discussion almost throughout the world.

However, the transmissibility of shigellosis remains unclear. METHODS: We used the dataset of shigellosis cases reported between January 2005 and December 2017, from Hubei Province, China. A mathematical model was developed based on the natural history and the transmission mechanism of the disease. By fitting the data using the model, transmission relative rate from person to person (b) and from reservoir to person (b(w)), and the effective reproduction number (R(eff)) were estimated. To simulate the contribution of b and b(w) during the transmission, we performed a “knock-out” simulation in four scenarios: A) b = 0 and b(w) = 0; B) b = 0; C) b(w) = 0; D) control (no intervention). RESULTS: A total of 130,770 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei province, among which 13 cases were dead. The median annual incidence was 19.96 per 100,000 persons (range: 5.99 per 100,000 persons – 29.47 per 100,000 persons) with a decreased trend (trend χ(2) = 25,470.27, P < 0.001). The mean values of b and b(w) were 0.0898 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0851–0.0946) and 1.1264 × 10(− 9) (95% CI: 4.1123 × 10(− 10)–1.8416 × 10(− 9)), respectively. The “knock-out” simulation showed that the number of cases simulated by scenario A was almost the same as scenario B, and scenario C was almost the same as scenario D. The mean value of R(eff) of shigellosis was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.13–1.25) and decreased slightly with a Linear model until it decreased to an epidemic threshold of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.65–1.34) in 2029. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of shigellosis is still in high level. The transmissibility of the disease is low in Hubei Province. The transmission would be interrupted in the year of 2029.","Chen, Qi; Rui, Jia; Hu, Qingqing; Peng, Ying; Zhang, Hao; Zhao, Zeyu; Tong, Yeqing; Wu, Yang; Su, Yanhua; Zhao, Benhua; Guan, Xuhua; Chen, Tianmu",BMC Infect Dis,296,1

In this article I identify this new obligation as the ‘duty to report’, and examine competing accounts on the degree to which states appreciate this new obligation are considered by examining state behaviour during the H5N1 human infectious outbreaks in East Asia (since 2004). The article examines reporting behaviour for H5N1 human infectious cases in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam from 2004 to 2010. The findings lend strong support to the claim that East Asian states have come to accept and comply with the duty to report infectious disease outbreaks and that the assertions of sovereignty in response to global health governance frameworks have not systematically inhibited reporting compliance.","Davies, Sara E",,296,22

A CSF analysis provides a general index of neurologic health, and it often provides evidence of the presence of disease. Similar to a complete blood count, CSF analysis has reasonable sensitivity but low specificity. The possible alterations of CSF are relatively limited compared to the varieties of neurologic diseases that exist. Additionally, the type and degree of CSF abnormality seems to be related as much to the location of disease as to the cause or the severity of the lesion; meningeal and paraventricular diseases generally produce greater abnormalities than deep parenchymal diseases. Previous therapy may affect the type, degree, and duration of CSF abnormalities as well. The CSF abnormalities identified upon analysis are also dependent on the CSF collection site with respect to lesion location. CSF analysis only occasionally provides a specific diagnosis.","Bailey, Cleta Sue; Vernau, William",Clinical Biochemistry of Domestic Animals,296,1

This requires careful effort in extracting relevant knowledge from HIN. However, existing models in this setting have the following shortcomings. Mainly, they are not end-to-end, which puts the burden on the system to first learn similarity or commuting matrix offline using some manually selected meta-paths before we train for the top-N recommendation objective. Further, they do not attentively extract user-specific information from HIN, which is essential for personalization. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end neural network model – GAMMA (Graph and Multi-view Memory Attention mechanism). We aim to replace the offline meta-path based similarity or commuting matrix computation with a graph attention mechanism. Besides, with different semantics of items in HIN, we propose a multi-view memory attention mechanism to learn more profound user-specific item views. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for top-N recommendation setting.","Vijaikumar, M.; Shevade, Shirish; Narasimha Murty, M.",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,296,1

From perspectives of content analysis and label decision, there are two major difficulties. One is content confusion that the case descriptions of some charges are almost identical. The other is dynamic label number that the numbers of labels (label number) of different cases may be different. In this paper, we propose a relation learning hierarchical framework for multi-label charge prediction with two models, i.e., dynamic merging attention (DMA) and number learning network (NLN). Specially, DMA can improve the charge prediction performance by dynamically learning the similarity relation between a fact and external knowledge (provisions) and the difference relation between different provisions, which alleviates the phenomenon of content confusion. NLN mitigates the dynamic label number by learning the co-occurring relation between labels. Moreover, we put the two models into a unified framework to enhance their effects. Conducted on a public large real-world law dataset, experimental results demonstrate that our framework with DMA and NLN outperforms well-known baselines by more than 3%–23%.","Duan, Wei; Li, Lin; Yu, Yi",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,296,1

Adversarial examples often exhibit black-box attacking transferability, which allows that adversarial examples crafted for one model can fool another model. However, existing black-box attack methods require samples from the training data distribution to improve the transferability of adversarial examples across different models. Because of the data dependence, fooling ability of adversarial perturbations is only applicable when training data are accessible. In this paper, we present a data-free method for crafting adversarial perturbations that can fool a target model without any knowledge about the training data distribution. In the practical setting of black-box attack scenario where attackers do not have access to target models and training data, our method achieves high fooling rates on target models and outperforms other universal adversarial perturbation methods. Our method empirically shows that current deep learning models are still at a risk even when the attackers do not have access to training data.","Huan, Zhaoxin; Wang, Yulong; Zhang, Xiaolu; Shang, Lin; Fu, Chilin; Zhou, Jun",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,296,1

Learning such tasks requires both efficient exploitation and exploration to reduce the sample complexity. One line of research called self-imitation learning is recently proposed, which encourages the agent to do more exploitation by imitating past good trajectories. Exploration bonuses, however, is another line of research which enhances exploration by producing intrinsic reward when the agent visits novel states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework Explore-then-Exploit (EE), which interleaves self-imitation learning with an exploration bonus to strengthen the effect of these two algorithms. In the exploring stage, with the aid of intrinsic reward, the agent tends to explore unseen states and occasionally collect high rewarding experiences, while in the self-imitating stage, the agent learns to consistently reproduce such experiences and thus provides a better starting point for subsequent stages. Our result shows that EE achieves superior or comparable performance on variants of MuJoCo environments with episodic reward settings.","Kang, Chun-Yao; Chen, Ming-Syan",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,296,1

Hypotheses Generation) is a systematic knowledge discovery process that elicit novel inferences about previously unknown scientific knowledge by rationally connecting complementary and non-interactive literature. Prompt identification of such novel knowledge is beneficial not only for researchers but also for various other stakeholders such as universities, funding bodies and academic publishers. Almost all the prior LBD research suffer from two major limitations. Firstly, the over-reliance of domain-dependent resources which restrict the models’ applicability to certain domains/problems. In this regard, we propose a generalisable LBD model that supports both cross-domain and cross-lingual knowledge discovery. The second persistent research deficiency is the mere focus of static snapshot of the corpus (i.e. ignoring the temporal evolution of topics) to detect the new knowledge. However, the knowledge in scientific literature changes dynamically and thus relying merely on static snapshot limits the model’s ability in capturing semantically meaningful connections. As a result, we propose a novel temporal model that captures semantic change of topics using diachronic word embeddings to unravel more accurate connections. The model was evaluated using the largest available literature repository to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed cues towards recommending novel knowledge.

Some COVID-19 patients might carry the burden of clinical trial involvement even though their trial cannot be completed as researchers are competing for patients. A shortage of medicines can occur when existing drugs are diverted for clinical trials. Research ethics committees are overburdened with multiple applications. A multitude of trials can also overstretch medical staff and risk neglecting non-COVID-19 patients. And finally, conflicting conclusions from a multitude of heterogeneous trials might lead to delays in public health decisions about life-saving issues. These challenges are made worse by the unpredictable evolution of epidemics, the active involvement of political decision-makers in scientific issues and the pressure of social media globally.

Early predictive identification of patients with potentially worse outcome is important in the emergency department (ED). Similarly as with bacterial infection, influenza can cause sepsis. This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria and the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score as prognostic predictors for ED patients with influenza. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study investigated data that was retrieved from a hospital-based research database. Adult ED patients (age ≥ 18 at admission) with laboratory-proven influenza from 2010 to 2016 were included for data analysis. The initial SIRS and qSOFA scores were both collected. The primary outcome was the utility of each score in the prediction of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: For the study period, 3561 patients met the study inclusion criteria. The overall in-hospital mortality was 2.7% (95 patients). When the qSOFA scores were 0, 1, 2, and 3, the percentages of in-hospital mortality were 0.6, 7.2, 15.9, and 25%, respectively. Accordingly, the odds ratios (ORs) were 7.72, 11.92, and 22.46, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity was 24 and 96.2%, respectively, when the qSOFA score was ≥2. However, the SIRS criteria showed no significant associations with the primary outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.864, which is significantly higher than that with SIRS, where the AUC was 0.786 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The qSOFA score potentially is a useful prognostic predictor for influenza and could be applied in the ED as a risk stratification tool. However, qSOFA may not be a good screening tool for triage because of its poor sensitivity. The SIRS criteria showed poor predictive performance in influenza for mortality as an outcome. Further research is needed to determine the role of these predictive tools in influenza and in other viral infections.","Chu, Sheng-En; Seak, Chen-June; Su, Tse-Hsuan; Chaou, Chung-Hsien; Tseng, Hsiao-Jung; Li, Chih-Huang",BMC Infect Dis,296,5

However, the new round competition is developing with unprecedented uncertainties. The fierce competition between China and the U.S. has already expanded from trade to high-tech protection, regional strategies, and two development models supported by different values. The fact of more intertwined geopolitics and technology reflects the underlying intensified competition between China and the U.S. and exacerbates the direct competition between the two powers for control over the rules, norms, and institutions that will govern international relations in the decades to come. This paper discusses whether the competition will slip into a vicious conflict between the two sides or even possibly two blocs that hold differentiated ideologies, political values, and remarkably different economic models.","Wu, Xiangning",China Int Strategy Rev.,296,1

While having a great expressive power, RPN suffer two limitations: (1) they do not include more general features for transitions like reset arcs, transfer arcs, etc. (2) the initial marking associated with the recursive “call” only depends on the calling transition and not on the current marking of the caller. Here we introduce Dynamic Recursive Petri nets (DRPN) which address these issues. We show that the standard extensions of Petri nets for which decidability of the coverability problem is preserved are particular cases of DPRN. Then we establish that w.r.t. coverability languages, DRPN are strictly more expressive than RPN. Finally we prove that the coverability problem is still decidable for DRPN.","Haddad, Serge; Khmelnitsky, Igor",Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,296,1

Among the viral infections, influenza viruses have worldwide spread with major effects on health of societies. Change in antigenic structures of influenza viruses is associated with the lack of effective treatments. Therefore, the use of herbal medicine as alternative choice can be used for management of flu and cold. The flowers of Sambucus nigra or black elders have been approved by commission E for cold, and flu. Although, elders are used in different herbal formulates, but there is no comprehensive study. The subject of this review article was to summarize the efficacy of black elder in treatment of cold and flu. For preparing this manuscript, the electronic resources, books, and thesis were searched by key words of Sambucus, elder, cold, flu, and viral infections. The results of investigations exhibited that there are four clinical trials for elder berries, which it reduced the cold duration and severity (fever, pain, congestion, cough), while there is no clinical trial for elder flower on common cold and flu in spite of its approval by commission E. So, evaluating the efficacy of elder flowers in comparison with its berries and standard treatment on patients with viral respiratory infections should be the subject of large clinical studies.","Mahboubi, Mohaddese",ADV TRADIT MED (ADTM),296,1

The knowledge transfer mainly depends on task relationships. Most of existing multi-task learning methods guide learning processes based on predefined task relationships. However, the associated relationships have not been fully exploited in these methods. Replacing predefined task relationships with the adaptively learned ones may lead to superior performance as it can avoid the misguiding of improper pre-definition. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Task Relation Attention Networks to adaptively model the task relationships and dynamically control the positive and negative knowledge transfer for different samples in multi-task learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments on various datasets are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art multi-task learning baselines.","Ma, Tao; Tan, Ying",Data Mining and Big Data,296,1

This paper combines the random forest-recursive feature elimination algorithm and lasso regression for joint feature selection, puts forward a PM(2.5) concentration prediction model based on GAM. Firstly, the original data is standardized in the data input layer. Secondly, features were selected with RF-RFE and lasso regression algorithm in the feature selection layer. Meanwhile, weighted average method fused the two feature subsets to obtain the final subset, RF-lasso-T. Finally, the generalized additive models (GAM) is used to predict PM(2.5) concentration on the RF-lasso-T. Simulated experiments show that feature selection allows GAM model to run more efficiently. The deviance explained by the model reaches 91.5%, which is higher than only using a subset of RF-RFE. This model also reveals the influence of various factors on PM(2.5), which provides the decision-making basis for haze control.","Wu, Tingxian; Zhao, Ziru; Wei, Haoxiang; Peng, Yan",Data Mining and Big Data,296,1

SIB 1.0 is efficient to converge to optimal solution but its particle size is fixed and pre-defined, while SIB 2.0 allows particle size changes during the procedure but it takes longer time to converge. This paper introduces a two-step SIB method that combines the advantages of two SIB methods. The first step via SIB 2.0 serves as a preliminary study to determine the optimal particle size and the second step via SIB 1.0 serves as a follow-up study to obtain the optimal solution. This method is applied to the search of optimal minimum energy design and the result outperforms the results from both SIB 1.0 and SIB 2.0.","Phoa, Frederick Kin Hing; Tsai, Tzu-Chieh",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,296,1

Today, about 34.3% (Cabinet Office Government of Japan 2010) of Japanese households keep some kind of pet. It is evident from the multiple social surveys that a strong attachment to pets has emerged since the mid-1990s. On 11 March 2011, the Tohoku region in Japan was struck by a large earthquake and the tsunami that followed. This was the largest earthquake on record in Japan. The Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant was seriously damaged and released radiation which continues to be an ongoing issue for those living in that part of Japan. The serious damage to humans and other animals caused by the tsunami and the radioactive contamination is outlined. The author provides an overview of the study and shows research questions. Then, she reviews the relevant literature, noting that most of the studies are set in a Western context and pointing to the contributions that might be made by considering how one highly developed Asian society has responded to the plight of pet owners following a major disaster.

Secondly, equilibria-based properties provide a means to analyse games in which competing or collaborating players are driven by distinct objectives. Thirdly, a real-time extension of (turn-based) stochastic games facilitates verification and strategy synthesis for systems where timing is a crucial aspect. This paper describes the advances made in the tool’s modelling language, property specification language and model checking engines in order to implement this new functionality. We also summarise the performance and scalability of the tool, and describe a selection of case studies, ranging from security protocols to robot coordination, which highlight the benefits of the new features.","Kwiatkowska, Marta; Norman, Gethin; Parker, David; Santos, Gabriel",Computer Aided Verification,296,1

The first therapeutic agents approved by regulatory authorities for MF, these drugs attenuate the overactive JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling universally present in these patients, translating into major clinical benefits in terms of spleen shrinkage and symptom improvement. These, in turn, confer a survival advantage on patients with advanced disease, demonstrated in the case of ruxolitinib, for which long-term follow-up data are available. However, JAK inhibitors do not improve cytopenias in most patients, have relatively modest effects on bone marrow fibrosis and driver mutation allele burden, and clinical resistance eventually develops. Furthermore, they do not modify the risk of transformation to blast phase; indeed, their mechanism of action may be more anti-inflammatory than truly disease-modifying. This has spurred interest in rational combinations of JAK inhibitors with other agents that may improve cytopenias and drugs that could potentially modify the natural history of MF. Newer JAK inhibitors that are distinguished from ruxolitinib and fedratinib by their ability to improve anemia (eg, momelotinib) or safety and efficacy in severely thrombocytopenic patients (eg, pacritinib) are in phase 3 clinical trials. There is also interest in developing inhibitors that are highly selective for mutant JAK2, as well as “type II” JAK2 inhibitors. Overall, although current JAK inhibitors have limitations, they will likely continue to form the backbone of MF therapy for the foreseeable future.","Bose, Prithviraj; Verstovsek, Srdan",Hemasphere,296,16

Less religious than preceding generations, they tend instead to draw their values and purpose from consumer, cultural, and employment affinities. They also rely on their connectivity, digital or otherwise, for the ability to make an impact in the direction of social change they deem necessary. Yet they are less connected than previous generations to some of the most fundamental means that support change, especially faith, family, and institutional leadership. To have a hand in shaping their generational desire for change, religious educators can design curricula to achieve not just traditional student learning outcomes, but social impact outcomes, too. Toward this end, the article proposes that religious educators approach students of religious education as engaged practitioners of change on a contemporaneous basis as well as in anticipation of their future agency. Doing so would instantiate teaching for social impact as a particular form of the praxis already prevalent in religious education. The article explores this potential through a survey of the cause–concerns and desires of young adults in Australia and the United States; a conceptual analysis of the engaged practice that is grounded in studium, or the zeal for coherence; and a description of what it might look like for religious education to integrate social impact outcomes into curricular considerations on the basis of such studium.","Sandberg, Kevin",j,296,1

The choice of strategies is based on applying optimization and decision-making methods to select the most appropriate cable network design considering criteria established by the problem definition. However, this definition is itself a decision problem that has not received analysis in the literature. In particular, one of the most important questions is the necessity to define an expansion strategy. The first alternative (expansion) is to design a network to serve consumers with Internet demand equal to or greater than the predefined one to expand the network annually to serve consumers that reach the predefined Internet speed. The second alternative (oversizing) is to design a network to serve consumers with future Internet demand (after 5 years) at or above that the predefined one. Considering this, the objective of this research is to define the most advantageous strategy of expansion planning to attend a 5 years forecasted Internet demand, considering: (1) the possibility of utilizing a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network technology; (2) the application of the minimal Steiner tree and Dijkstra algorithms in planning procedures; (3) the influence of economic and technological factors on the demand forecast; (4) the aggressive, moderate, and conservative scenarios in decision-making. The results show that the over-dimensioning strategy reduces network investment by between 30 and 41%, but that this reduction does not always lead to a market investment ratio higher than that observed in the expansion strategy.","Libório, Matheus Pereira; Ekel, Petr Iakovlevitch; Lyrio, Renata de Mello; Bernardes, Patrícia; Soares, Gustavo Luís; Machado-Coelho, Thiago Melo",J Netw Syst Manage,296,33

This study was implemented to identify risk factors for sepsis by CR- and carbapenem-susceptible (CS) GNB in intensive care unit (ICU) patients to improve management strategies for CR-GNB sepsis. METHODS: We developed a case-case-control study from a prospective cohort of patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis-2 or sepsis-3 criteria in which blood and other sample cultures were collected and antimicrobial therapy was instituted, in an adult clinical-surgical ICU, at tertiary public hospital in Rio de Janeiro, from August 2015 through March 2017. RESULTS: Among the total of 629 ICU admissions followed by 7797 patient-days, after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria we identified 184 patients who developed recurrent or single hospital-acquired sepsis. More than 90% of all evaluable cases of sepsis and 87% of control group fulfilled the modified sepsis-3 definition. Non-fermenting bacilli and ventilator-associated pneumonia predominated as etiology and source of CR-GNB sepsis. While Enterobacteriaceae and intra-abdominal surgical site plus urinary-tract infections prevailed in CS-GNB than CR-GNB sepsis. Carbapenemase production was estimated in 76% of CR-GNB isolates. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed previous infection (mostly hospital-acquired bacterial infection or sepsis) (OR = 4.28; 95% CI 1.77–10.35), mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.21; 95% CI 1.17–15.18), carbapenem use (OR = 3.42; 95% CI 1.37–8.52) and length of hospital stay (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.05) as independent risk factors for sepsis by CR-GNB. While ICU readmission (OR = 6.92; 95% CI 1.72–27.78) and nosocomial diarrhea (OR = 5.32; 95% CI 1.07–26.45) were factors associated with CS-GNB sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation of recurrent and not only bacteremic episodes of sepsis was the differential of this study. The results are in agreement with the basic information in the literature. This may help improve management strategies and future studies on sepsis by CR-GNB.","Lima, Elisangela M.; Cid, Patrícia A.; Beck, Debora S.; Pinheiro, Luiz Henrique Z.; Tonhá, João Pedro S.; Alves, Marcio Z.

There have been reports of Kawasaki like disease in children. However, in adults there are very few reports of non-cutaneous vasculitis. Here we report the case of an adult male presenting with an inflammatory aortitis associated with COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old Caucasian male with a background of cholecystectomy and rotator cuff repair presented to hospital in May 2020 with a 3-month history of feeling generally unwell, weight loss and worsening thoraco-lumbar back pain. Prior to the onset of these symptoms he had had a 2-week illness in March 2020 clinically consistent with COVID-19 infection comprising fevers, hot sweats, dry cough, and chest tightness for which he had not sought medical attention. He had no recent travel history. Physical examination was unremarkable. On admission, COVID-19 tests revealed evidence of prior infection with negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test but positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Blood tests revealed a marked inflammatory state with a C- reactive protein of 122mg/L, plasmas viscosity of 2.76, Ferritin 777ug/L, Interleukin-6 of 25 ng/L and normocytic anaemia with a Haemoglobin of 77g/L. Immunology tests were negative for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-glomerular basement antibodies, HLA-B27, anti-citrullinated protein antibody, rheumatoid factor, and nuclear antibodies, with normal IgG 4 subclasses. Microbiology workup showed negative blood cultures, syphilis screen and Hepatitis B and C serology. Temporal artery ultrasound was unremarkable. Troponin-T, pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal. CT thorax abdomen pelvis revealed inflammatory change surrounding the aortic arch extending all the way down the aorta in keeping with a florid inflammatory aortitis with no aneurysms seen. Rapid resolution of symptoms was seen with commencement of Prednisolone 40mg once daily, with normalisation of CRP one week later and subsequent normalisation of haemoglobin and plasma viscosity. A repeat CT aorta 2 weeks after commencement of prednisolone demonstrated a reduction in the thickness of the inflammatory rind over the aorta from 6mm to 2mm. The patient now continues a reducing regime of prednisolone and remains in clinical remission. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: In children, Kawasaki like disease associated with COVID-19 is well described and can result in coronary artery inflammation and aneurysm. In adults, COVID-19 associated cutaneous vasculitis is well recognised however there are only a small number of case reports of organ specific vasculitis including the central nervous system, retina, and small bowel. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of aortitis associated with COVID-19 infection in an adult patient. The mechanisms underlying the development of COVID-19 associated vasculitis are not established but may be secondary to endothelial inflammation. Findings from a histological case series suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect endothelial cells directly, possibly via endothelial ACE2 receptors, leading to inflammation in the endothelium. Another postulated mechanism is that endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation is caused by the cytokine storm that can be seen in some patients with COVID-19 infection. Our patient responded very well to corticosteroid treatment. However, in case of a relapse his cytokine profile could be helpful in directing further therapeutic options. IL-6 levels were elevated in our patient. Studies show that IL-6 appears to play a dominant role in the cytokine storm. In a report of 150 patients IL-6 was found to be significantly higher in the group with severe disease and possibly predictive of mortality. The IL-6 antagonist, Tocilizumab, has also been used with promising results. The first report of its use was in China in 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients with significant improvements. Since this first report, further clinical trials are underway investigating the efficacy and tolerability of IL-6 antagonists in patients with COVID-19 disease. Expanding our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated vasculitis is a critical area for future research to identify other immune targets for novel/ existing therapeutic agents. Case report - Key learning points: 1. Vasculitis including aortitis can be a complication of COVID-19 infection. 2. Endothelial cell inflammation is likely to play key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated vasculitis. 3. In addition to corticosteroids, other immune-modulating drugs presently used in rheumatology may be effective therapeutic agents.","Zou, Yun; Vasta, Bhavisha",Rheumatol Adv Pract,296,1

To this end, there have been few works proposed to diagnose COVID-19 by using CXR-based methods. However, they have limited performance as they ignore the spatial relationships between the region of interests (ROIs) in CXR images, which could identify the likely regions of COVID-19’s effect in the human lungs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based deep learning model using the attention module with VGG-16. By using the attention module, we capture the spatial relationship between the ROIs in CXR images. In the meantime, by using an appropriate convolution layer (4th pooling layer) of the VGG-16 model in addition to the attention module, we design a novel deep learning model to perform fine-tuning in the classification process. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct extensive experiments by using three COVID-19 CXR image datasets. The experiment and analysis demonstrate the stable and promising performance of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The promising classification performance of our proposed method indicates that it is suitable for CXR image classification in COVID-19 diagnosis.","Sitaula, Chiranjibi; Hossain, Mohammad Belayet",Appl Intell,296,5

However, hospital care is often of poor quality and large-scale change is needed to improve outcomes. However, achieving large scale change in health systems remains challenging. To set the scene we first characterise the problems of hospital newborn units (NBU) in Kenya. We then combine our understanding of theory and context with reflection on our own position as an embedded research group with no formal authority to help us propose a feasible intervention strategy linked to in initial programme theory. We explain this programme theory and suggest how within a multi-level clinical professional network leaders at the ward or mid-level of hospital hierarchies are key potential change agents. In support of our programme theory we briefly outline and seek to integrate key ideas drawn from a wider set of theories. We propose how an intervention might be developed and employed in a phased approach to create the ownership, relationships and momentum that will be needed to achieve change at scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of such a strategy for our research design that is based on a prospective, in-depth case study that includes quantitative and qualitative data collection linked to specific sub-studies.

The results of the DCC-GARCH model identify an important effect of the launch of Bitcoin futures. During the stability period, the overarching implications of the results are that there is a persistence of correlation between cryptocurrencies in high positive value and low dynamic conditional correlations between cryptocurrencies and financial assets. Also, we find that Bitcoin and gold are considered hedges for the US investors before the coronavirus crisis. Our results show that cryptocurrencies may offer diversification benefits for investors and are diversifiers during the stability period. At the beginning of 2020, we observe that the conditional correlation increased between cryptocurrencies, stock indexes, and oil which confirm the effect of the coronavirus contagion between them.

During the COVID-19. outbreak, several questions were raised about the risks for the pediatric population. Pediatric patients appeared to be relatively safe, with only minor symptoms and a quick recovery. However, there have been reports of a relationship between COVID 19 and a Kawasaki-like inflammatory disease in this population. Kawasaki’s disease (KD) is a rheumatological vasculitis prevalent in childhood characterized mainly by diffuse inflammation of the arteries associated with skin rash, changes in the mucosa and its main complication is coronary aneurysms. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed in the PubMED database using the keywords “Kawasaki disease”, “COVID-19” and “Pediatrics”. The selected filters were “Case reports”, “Multicenter study”, “Clinical Study”, “Observational study”, “Human” and “English”. A total of 18 articles were seleted. RESULTS: There seems to be a convergence between the literature published so far, pointing to a greater propensity for pediatric patients infected with Sars-Cov-2 to develop KD. The number of patients with KD symptoms seen at a specific center increased from 2 to 17 in 11 days (MOREIRA, 2020). In a sample space of 21 patients diagnosed with KD, 91% had previous contact with SARS-CoV-2 (TOUBIANA, 2020) whereas other studies point to a 30-fold increase in the prevalence of KD since the beginning of 2020 (VERDONI, 2020). There is already an established relationship between DK and HCoV-NH, describing that 4.5% of patients with this infection develop KD. Therefore, it was suggested that infection with another Coronavirus strain could have a similar relationship. CONCLUSION: Despite the relationship described between pediatric patients infected with COVID-19 being more likely to develop KD, further studies are needed to prove a statistical relationship between both condition.

Very few studies assessed the relationship between maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and critical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between MEP and critical outcomes. METHODS: This work was a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational study of adult patients who required mechanical ventilation for ≥ 24 h in an 18-bed ICU. MEP was assessed before extubation after a successful, spontaneous breathing trial. The relationships between MEP and extubation failure, and short-term (30 days) mortality, were investigated. Univariate logistic regressions were computed to investigate the relationship between MEP values and critical outcomes. Two multivariate analyses, with and without maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), both adjusted using principal component analysis, were undertaken. Unadjusted and adjusted ROC curves were computed to compare the respective ability of MEP, MIP and the combination of both measures to discriminate patients with and without extubation failure or premature death. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four patients were included. Median age was 66 years (IQR 18) and median mechanical ventilation duration was 7 days (IQR 6). Extubation failure rate was 15% (18/124 patients) and the rate for 30-day mortality was 11% (14/124 patient). Higher MEP values were significantly associated with a lower risk of extubation failure in the univariate analysis [OR 0.96 95% CI (0.93–0.98)], but not with short-term mortality. MEP was independently linked with extubation failure when MIP was not included in the multivariate model, but not when it was included, despite limited collinearity between these variables. This study was not able to differentiate the respective abilities of MEP, MIP, and their combination to discriminate patients with extubation failure or premature death (adjusted AUC for the combination of MEP and MIP: 0.825 and 0.650 for extubation failure and premature death, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: MEP is related to extubation failure. But, the results did not support its use as a substitute for MIP, since the relationship between MEP and critical outcomes was no longer significant when MIP was included. The use of MIP and MEP measurements combined did not reach higher discriminative capacities for critical outcomes that MEP or MIP alone.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm, post-marketing study included 67 patients undergoing cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of TFNT00 across five Indian sites. Postoperative outcomes were assessed at 3 months after second eye surgery. Effectiveness outcomes included: mean binocular and monocular visual acuity (VA) at distance (4 m), intermediate (60 cm), and near (40 cm); binocular defocus curve; manifest refraction; and subjective symptom questionnaire evaluation. Safety outcomes included the rate of ocular adverse events and mesopic contrast sensitivity. RESULTS: Mean binocular and monocular distance-corrected and uncorrected VAs of 0.1 logMAR or better (approximately 20/25 Snellen) were achieved at distance, intermediate, and near. Overall, ≥70% of patients achieved binocular 0.1 logMAR vision or better across all distances. TFNT00 maintained a mean VA of 0.1 logMAR or better at the defocus range of +0.5 diopters (D) to –2.5 D (200 cm to 40 cm). The subjective symptom questionnaire-assessed frequency of halo visual disturbances was low at Month 3; halos were reported “none of the time” to “only some of the time” in 86.6% of patients. The large majority of patients (98.5%) were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their near, intermediate, and distance vision at Month 3, and ≥94.0% of patients reported spectacle independence for tasks at all distances. The adverse event rate was low; no patients discontinued due to an adverse event. CONCLUSION: TFNT00 provided a continuous range of vision of 20/25 or better for distance to near and performed effectively at an intermediate functional distance of 60 cm, resulting in high levels of spectacle independence and patient satisfaction. TFNT00 demonstrated a good safety profile and a low post-operative frequency of halo visual disturbances.","Ramamurthy, Dandapani; Vasavada, Abhay; Padmanabhan, Prema; Reddy, Jagadesh C; Shetty, Naren; Dey, Arindam; Sudhir, Rachapalle Reddi",Clin Ophthalmol,296,11

Not only life-threatening events but also potentially critical situations such as routine intubations warrant debriefings. Debriefing scripts promote a structured approach and allow even inexperienced moderators to navigate all relevant aspects. In addition to areas of challenge, debriefings should also explore and reinforce positive performance to facilitate learning from success. Debriefers should discuss not only obvious observable accomplishments, but also motivations behind key behaviors. This strategy promotes needs-based learning and focuses on solutions.

Comparing the Perspectives of Japanese and Swedish Researchers,14.158896,3.1382346,2021-02-22,"The SARS-CoV-2 infections continue to increase in Namibia and globally. Assessing and mapping the COVID-19 risk zones and modeling the response of COVID-19 using different scenarios are very vital to help decision-makers to estimate the immediate number of resources needed and plan for future interventions of COVID-19 in the area of interest. This study is aimed to identify and map COVID-19 risk zones and to model future COVID-19 response of Namibia using geospatial technologies. Population density, current COVID-19 infections, and spatial interaction index were used as proxy data to identify the different COVID-19 risk zones of Namibia. COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) V1.1.5 tool was used to model future COVID-19 responses with mobility restrictions. Weights were assigned for each thematic layer and thematic layer classes using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool. Suitably ArcGIS overlay analysis was conducted to produce risk zones. Current COVID-19 infection and spatial mobility index were found to be the dominant and sensitive factors for risk zoning in Namibia. Six different COVID-19 risk zones were identified in the study area, namely highest, higher, high, low, lower, and lowest. Modeling result revealed that mobility reduction by 30% within the country had a notable effect on controlling COVID-19 spread: a flattening of the peak number of cases and delay to the peak number. The research output could help policy-makers to estimate the immediate number of resources needed and plan for future interventions of COVID-19 in Namibia, especially to assess the potential positive effects of mobility restriction.","Bushira, Kedir Mohammed; Ongala, Jacob Otieno",Trans Indian Natl,296,1

While this is often true, silos-dominant administrative systems may still find ways to overcome or prevent incoherence in government. The problem is not so much with the structure of silos but with the lack of effective coordination mechanisms between them. Therefore, it is important to identify what mechanisms may enable silos to work successfully with each other and under what conditions, so that there will be no need to pursue a total breakdown of silos, which can be politically and administratively costly. Using Hong Kong examples, we distinguish three different types of coordination and examine their effects on silos: informal or semi-formal coordination where administrative elites and professionals use quid pro quos to overcome coordination problems; formal coordination where political expectations, directions and monitoring may mitigate problems; and remedial policy-making where failure is addressed. The Hong Kong case reveals that effective changes may be made by strengthening existing coordinating mechanisms and extending them to the implementation level in a silos-dominant system. Radical reforms may improve coordination but they run the risk of political instability and service disruption.","Scott, Ian; Gong, Ting",GPPG,296,1

Collaborative assisting and autonomous systems are still in the research phase, with a focus on ultrasound image processing and force adaptation strategies. However, missing key factors are clinical studies and appropriate safety strategies. Future research will likely focus on artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality to improve image understanding and ergonomics. SUMMARY: A review on robotic ultrasound systems is presented in which first technical specifications are outlined. Hereafter, the literature of the past five years is subdivided into teleoperation, collaborative assistance, or autonomous systems based on LORA.

To demonstrate Stiegler’s applicability to education studies, I shall address the issue of character amnesia (提筆忘字, tibiwangzi in Chinese, literally “pick up pen, forget the character”), a relatively recent phenomenon experienced in China and Japan, which is concerned with the loss of the ability to write and remember Chinese ideograms. I shall use tibiwangzi as a striking and heuristic example to explain the growing crisis in literacy, that is the crisis in the ability to read and write. Tibiwangzi is a Stieglerian issue of vital importance. In this light, my focus will be on language learning and literacy and I shall couch my analysis regarding this in terms of both Stiegler’s thoughts on tertiary, exteriorized memory and the neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf’s concern with the neurological and cognitive effects of reading. I intend to focus on the apparent rupture or disruption between traditional writing systems (alphabetic writing) and digital technologies and argue that a pharmacological understanding of technology and therefore a consideration of Stiegler’s work in the light of neuroscience, memory and digital technologies, is necessary as it can spark timely and critical research into the perceived crisis of literacy.

Further genetic analysis revealed that this agent clustered with ATCC 35246, a S. zooepidemicus strain associated with high mortality outbreaks in swine herds of China originally reported in 1977. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is absolutely critical for controlling and limiting further spread of this emerging disease of swine. Currently available diagnostic methods including bacteriological examination and PCR assays do not distinguish between the virulent strains and avirulent commensal strains of S. zooepidemicus, which is critical given that this pathogen is a normal inhabitant of the swine respiratory tract. Based on comparative analyses of whole genome sequences of the virulent isolates and avirulent sequences, we identified a region in the SzM gene that is highly conserved and restricted to virulent S. zooepidemicus strains. We developed and validated a novel probe-based real-time PCR targeting the conserved region of SzM. The assay was highly sensitive and specific to the virulent swine isolates of Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. No cross reactivity was observed with avirulent S. zooepidemicus isolates as well as other streptococcal species and a panel of porcine respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens. The PCR efficiency of the assay was 96.64 % and was able to detect as little as 20 fg of the bacterial DNA. We then validated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the new PCR assay using a panel of clinical samples (n = 57) and found that the assay has 100% sensitivity and specificity as compared to bacteriological culture method. In summary, the PCR assay will be an extremely valuable tool for the rapid accurate detection of virulent swine S. zooepidemicus isolates and directly from clinical samples.","Kuchipudi, Suresh V.; Surendran Nair, Meera; Yon, Michele; Gontu, Abhinay; Nissly, Ruth H.; Barry, Rhiannon; Greenawalt, Denver; Pierre, Traci; Li, Lingling; Thirumalapura, Nagaraja; Tewari, Deepanker; Jayarao, Bhushan",Front Vet Sci,296,25

Among the Canidae, the raccoon dog’s adventurous nature, omnivorous behavior, and high variability of intracellular pathogens make it ideal to study selection on MHC class I in a non-model canid species. Here, we examined allelic diversity and evolutionary patterns of MHC class I genes in the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). We identified 48 novel MHC class I alleles from 31 raccoon dogs from Japan and Russia. Some alleles were geographically restricted, whereas others were widely distributed across the species’ range. The rate of non-synonymous substitutions was greater than that of synonymous substitutions for both exon 2 and exon 3 encoding α1 and α2 domains, respectively, in the α chain of the MHC class I protein. Positively selected sites at the amino acid level were evident in both the α1 and α2 domains, and a recombination breakpoint was found in exon 3. Bayesian phylogenetic trees showed no evidence of trans-species polymorphism (TSP) with alleles from carnivoran species in other families but did detect TSP between raccoon dogs and the domestic dog, Canis familiaris, indicative of long-term balancing selection in canids. Our results indicate that the extensive allelic diversity of MHC class I in Japanese and Russian raccoon dogs has been influenced and maintained by pathogen-driven positive selection, recombination, and long-term balancing selection.

Objective physiologic markers of opioid withdrawal in the newborn remain elusive. Optimal treatment strategies for improving short-term clinical outcomes and promoting healthy neurobehavioral development have yet to be defined. This dual-site randomized controlled trial (NCT02801331) is designed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) for reducing withdrawal symptoms, pharmacological treatment, and length of hospitalization, and for improving developmental outcomes in opioid-exposed neonates. Hospitalized newborns (n = 230) receiving standard clinical care for prenatal opioid exposure will be randomly assigned within 48-hours of birth to a crib with either: 1) Intervention (SVS) mattress: specially-constructed SVS crib mattress that delivers gentle vibrations (30–60 Hz, ~12 μm RMS surface displacement) at 3-hr intervals; or 2) Control mattress (treatment as usual; TAU): non-oscillating hospital-crib mattress. Infants will be studied throughout their hospitalization and post discharge to 14-months of age. The study will compare clinical measures (i.e., withdrawal scores, cumulative dose and duration of medications, velocity of weight gain) and characteristic progression of physiologic activity (i.e., limb movement, cardio-respiratory, temperature, blood-oxygenation) throughout hospitalization between opioid-exposed infants who receive SVS and those who receive TAU. Developmental outcomes (i.e., physical, social, emotional and cognitive) within the first year of life will be evaluated between the two study groups.

To bridge this gap, the paper aims at analyzing the demand for VR, the experience in virtual reality and readiness of Master’s degree engineering students for taking courses with immersion into virtual reality, using the example of intercultural communication courses. The authors analyzed recent publications in research journals and conference proceedings on the use of VR tools in higher education paying special attention to engineering curricula. The authors also conducted a survey among 87 MSc students focusing on the degree to which students are familiar with VR and ready to study through immersion into VR. The overall analysis of the survey results revealed that the students have a limited experience of using VR in any applications but most of them are ready for this experience in education. Based on these interpretations of the survey results, the authors made an attempt to develop a draft course to introduce elements of VR into EFL teaching for engineering students.

Third, the traditional interaction between teacher, student and content are made more complicated by the introduction of technology. The application of new tools related to the student, teacher, content, technology, software, and communication results in the improvement of teaching methods in online learning. When new tools are applied and there is an improvement in the results in online education, the student, teacher, and educational institutions benefit from it. Emotion plays an important role in the knowledge, acquisition, and decision process of an individual. Consequently, they directly influence perception, learning process, and the way people communicate. There is also significant evidence that rational learning in humans is dependent on emotions.

To reduce the problem, we have proposed a new programming material only using a numeric keypad and a mobile toy robot. In this paper, we show the architecture of our programming environment. And we had experimental classes, which were focused on the ease of use it for both visually impaired and sighted students. As a result, visually impaired students were able to obtain the programming skill within 15 min at maximum from their first touch of the robot. On the other hands, sighted students spent only 5 min to use the robot.","Kimuro, Yoshihiko; Ienaga, Takafumi; Okimoto, Seiji",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,296,16

Advanced IT technology, industrial engineering, and management know-how will be combined to improve all areas of manufacturing. Improving productivity is the most important goal for a factory. However, this is only part of the overall goal of corporate management. Corporate management pursues a greater goal of optimizing all of the company’s resources to reduce losses, increase profits and achieve sustainable growth. All companies should achieve smart factories to prevent unnecessary waste of time and resources and maximize profits by increasing productivity. This paper deals with the integration effect of the major fundamental system, including the Manufacturing Execution System that operates production, and the method of measuring it. When integrating core systems to maximize successful inventory management and revenue, a method of assessing them is required. Here it would be appropriate to have an evaluation method in which scores are given and calculated differently depending on the results and functional priorities obtained by the system. This approach will help solve the problem of which systems each company will use and integrate when introducing smart factories.","Kho, Jeong Seog; Jeong, Jongpil",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,296,7

In modern communities are complex communities; therefore, there are complex processes based on strongly different topics: urban planning, socio-economic dynamics, the need to preserve cultural heritage, safety, and natural hazard effects. In last years, a significant change in point of view seems necessary. In particular, the seismic risk mitigation (and more generally, the natural risks mitigation) must become one of the main topic in urban planning and governance of communities. it is to be highlighted that in past earthquekas higher consequences and losses have been generally caused in the medium and long term by the low or lack of resilience of the communities. However, in recent years, the concrete application of the concept of the resilience have taken on a key role in seismic risk studies. In particular, the resilience assessment of the housing stock, both qualitatively and quantitatively can be considered the core of the problem. In this study, based on the concept of resilience a change in urban planning and emergency management tools is defined. A case study is considered to show a first application. The improvement of the resilience of the investigated town is defined on several strategies and then it is quantified.","Vona, Marco",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,296,1

European institutions strongly promote participatory processes and have developed a regulatory framework as well as guidelines and tools for successful and effective public engagement in transport planning. In this context, a variety of EU funded projects have been set up where territorial partners cooperate with universities and research centers in developing a sustainable mobility project and related public engagement strategies. This paper digs into the history and the current state of stakeholder involvement in transport projects, discussing through a broad literature analysis the theoretical evolution of the concept, controversies, drivers for phases and tools for effective engagement practices. Through the examples of the experience within European projects SMILE and SMART COMMUTING, this paper explores the role that academic institutions can play in engagement processes and possible contributions in terms of technical expertise and know-how transfer. Intermediate results from the projects’ engagement efforts seem to validate the European Commission’s belief that planned, continuous, open and interactive involvement of Universities may bring to better, shared and desirable decisions, consistently with findings from recent literature.","Bruzzone, Francesco; Nocera, Silvio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,296,16

In particular, it investigates to what extent the sub-traits of the Five Factor Model has an empirically quantifiable correlation with the Basic Emotions (Anger, Anxiety, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise). If links between these personality traits and the basic emotions can be found, then this would enable an emotional-state-to-personality-trait mapping. In this study, 38 participants answered a Big Five Aspects Scale (BFAS) questionnaire and then watched 12 emotionally provocative film clips along with answering 12 short emotional Likert-scales on their emotional experiences during each film clip. The results showed that (i) four of the seven Basic Emotions outright significantly correlated, while two emotions (Fear and Disgust) approached statistical significance, with at least one of the personality traits and (ii) significant correlations between personality traits and basic emotions could only be identified at the sub-trait level, demonstrating the value in adopting a higher-resolution personality model. The results supports the long-term goal of this research, which is the enabling of state-to-trait inferences. A method for analysing and visualising such a mapping, that differentiates mappings based on the direction and magnitude of the effect size was also developed. The study contributes a blueprint towards utilising Affective Computing methodology to automatically map these phenomena.","Donovan, Ryan; Johnson, Aoife; deRoiste, Aine; O’Reilly, Ruairi",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,296,1

This call to expand intellectual and empathic horizons seeks examples of ethical praxis and ideas that could inspire sustainable oriented actions. It is also argued that reflexivity can help to uncover vices and misconceptions that have hampered societies, broken economic systems, and destroyed environments. The call for this pragmatic and contemplative approach is also a plea for a review of the basic meanings of technology, interrogating its senses, forms, and purposes.

Controversies around the origins and implications of the Anthropocene mirror those around those of globalization—are they ancient or modern phenomena, are they sustainable or leading us into disaster? Mobilizing ideas on the “silent qualifiers” of globalization (generic, capitalist, and alternative globalizations) I argue that it is fruitful to theorize generic, capitalist, and alternative Anthropocenes. With the mantra of endless growth integral to the survival of both global capitalism and the state system, it seems obvious that these systems are incompatible with planetary survival in the long term, necessitating an engagement with the emerging degrowth movement. Given the failure of governments and corporations to seriously engage with the risks of the Anthropocene, smaller democratically organized communities at different geographic and socio-political scales offer prospects for simpler less ecologically destructive living.

In order to train our neural networks, we exploit a dataset containing 115 privacy policies defined by US companies. An evaluation shows that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art by 5% over comparable and previously-reported F1 values. In addition, our method is completely reproducible since we provide open access to all resources.

The ‘territorialized’ model of circular economy is the ‘circular city’ model, which puts its centre with its suburbs, its historical centre with the port, and the consolidated city with the suburban territory in virtuous relationships. This chapter focuses on the multidimensional benefits of the circular economy and circular city model from an evaluation perspective, identifying an analytical list of indicators emerging from operational practice and the scientific literature. A multidimensional and multicriteria assessment method is used in the metropolitan city of Naples, Italy, to support the planning process for development of the port area from the perspective of the circular economy and circular city model. The originality of this assessment consists, on the one hand, in assuming evaluation criteria emerging from the strategy of the European Green Deal and, on the other hand, in focusing on the integration of the indicators proposed by the World Health Organization related to the Health Impact Assessment in a perspective that integrates environmental, economic and social impacts assessments.","Girard, Luigi Fusco",A Broad View of Regional Science,296,16

Bringing in the SDGs adds value given that there are three SDGs (SDGs 8, 12 and 14) that make specific reference to tourism. Furthermore, COVID-19 negatively impacted many SDGs leading to governments, civic and private organisations revising budgets to channel resources towards “flattening” both the COVID-19 and economic curves. Understanding the global tourism value chains assists in opening up the complex tourism space and to systematically document COVID-19 impacts along with the industries within the value chain nodes.

This chapter will discuss key pedagogic strategies which need to be introduced. These include the need to combine both socialisation and education in the SRE/RI classroom; to foster a constructivist approach to teaching about the religion rather than an essentialist approach; to draw on the techniques of experiential and informal education; and to ensure reflective rather than an instrumental teaching and learning pedagogy, including the implementation of the interpretative approach as delineated by Robert Jackson. This will ensure that SRE/RI creates bricoleur teachers who draw on critical religious pedagogy, encouraging students to ask questions, express doubts and through a process of questioning and exploration pass through the threshold of liminality to have a transformative experience (Meyer and Land in Overcoming barriers to student understanding: threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge, Routledge, London and New York, 2006; Cousin in Planet 17:1–2, 2006; and Rymarz in J Adult Theological Educ 13:163–170, 2016). As well, there needs to be a higher level of transparency and accountability through clear and accessible curriculum statements, teacher accreditation and basic, mandatory professional development to enable this transition from a didactic, essentialist approach, criticised in academic studies, to a constructivist approach. We shall argue that SRE/RI teachers see their role as a vocation but if they can be assisted to incorporate these key elements of current educational thinking into their teaching and learning, SRE/RI classes will address current criticisms and be much more effective.","Gross, Zehavit; Rutland, Suzanne D.",Special Religious Education in Australia and its Value to Contemporary Society,296,1

Recently, dexamethasone (DMs), a corticosteroid medication has a wide therapeutic application including against SARS-CoV-2. DMs has been found useful in controlling the damaging effect of cytokines as well as it’s over production in various critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 but some drawbacks of DMs were also reported in literatures. The complex chemical synthesis of DMs has generated abundant amounts of waste products that affect the yield of DMs along with its cost. Hence, to tackle the above explained issues of DMs, analogues of DMs have been required to synthesis by the green approach. So that it will be non-hazardous toward the body and easily available to mankind. Green synthesis of DMs analogue scaffold contains ionic liquid (IL) as both solvent and catalyst but a number of studies show that the extraction of IL from synthesis reaction is quite a difficult process. Hence, a supportive catalyst is required for easy extraction of IL from reaction mixture. Magnetic bio-char (MBC) and magnetic nano particles (MNP) are considered as promising candidates for the supportive catalyst with IL as they can easily extract from synthesis reaction via magnetic separation method.

Moreover, MBC-IL and MNP-IL are efficient to load numerous drugs and using in drug delivery system. Therefore, the present investigation provides an effective means to develop a cost-effective, non-hazardous biocompatible, and reusable catalyst with green principle approach for the synthesis of DMs as they are useful for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and similar types of disease.","Singhal, Kavita; Kumar, Ajay",The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Green Societies,296,13

To reduce this underutilization, we need to implement ways to maximize clothing use. Artificially intelligent decision support may help users make better purchase decisions as well as daily dressing decisions. However, learning relationships between user and garment features is challenging due to the sparsity of data and the lack of validated expert models. One way to bridge this gap and inform clothing recommender system development is to understand how professional stylists choose outfits that maximize clothing use and satisfaction of clients. The purpose of this study was to understand how professional stylists make outfit and garment decisions for clients. This study used a qualitative approach to collect data from 12 professional stylists with varying areas of specialization on their decision-making process. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings show client features, garment features and the consultation process as the main factors in decision making. Consequently these factors could be integrated in design of recommender systems that increase consumers’ clothing utilization.","Dahunsi, Bolanle O.; Dunne, Lucy E.",Recommender Systems in Fashion and Retail,296,13

One obvious way would be for greater equality of incomes to be sought through fairer distribution. But, as I have argued (pp. 59–60), the institutions for redistribution, especially in the Anglophone countries, have become part of the problem, because they divide the working class, and coerce those who claim means-tested income subsidies.

The focus is on those who left India from the 1940s until recent times. This period has seen a significant change, both in the increasing numbers of non-white migrants arriving in New Zealand, and in the ways they are regarded. Immigration policies over this time give a sense of this change and are outlined in some depth. Two significant themes from the research were identity, particularly of being ‘not quite white’, and of misidentification. The discussion draws on whiteness studies scholarship to shed light on Anglo-Indian experiences and examine how whiteness plays out in New Zealand.","Andrews, Robyn",Anglo-Indian Identity,296,1

However, little is known about individual formulas for school subjects and their performance compared to that of existing universal readability formulas. Our goal is to study the impact of the subject both in terms of model quality and on the importance of individual features. We trained 4 linear regression models: an individual formula for each of 3 school subjects (Biology, Literature, and Social Studies) and a universal formula for all the 3 subjects. The dataset was created of schoolbook texts, randomly sampled into pseudo-texts of size 500 sentences. It was split into train and test sets in the ratio of 75 to 25. As for the features, previous papers on Russian readability do not provide proper feature selection. So we suggested a set of 32 features that are possibly relevant to text difficulty in Russian. For every model, features were selected from this set based on their importance. The results obtained show that all the one-subject formulas outperform the universal model and previously developed readability formulas. Experiments with other sample sizes (200 and 900 sentences per sample) prove these results. This is because feature importances vary significantly among the subjects. Suggested readability models might be beneficial for school education for evaluating text relevance for learners and adjusting those texts to target difficulty levels.","Isaeva, Ulyana; Sorokin, Alexey","Recent Trends in Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts",296,1

Equally, finance relies on other people’s money to obtain positive economic outcomes. The financial business has also become more transactional than relational and has always been prone to market failures. On top of that, the natural risks that are proper in financial activities are transferred in the markets by moving liability from hand to hand until it turns out to be too late. Bearing in mind these unique features, is there such a thing as ethics in finance? Can we talk about ethical financial institutions? If there is and we can, is this a subject matter that can be dealt with by establishing general standards of behavior aimed at being applied to all people and institutions involved? Establishing rules of conduct has been the role of regulators. Moreover, subjecting public and private institutions to monitoring and sanctioning noncompliance with such rules has been the role of states. Then, what is the purpose of financial ethics? The complex decisions people and institutions must make every day while managing other people’s money and financial assets need an approach compatible with the purpose of such businesses. Thus, it appears that relying on traditional ethics in the financial markets to correct improper behavior seems to be a dreamer’s desire rather than a real solution. Therefore, this chapter proposes some ideas that could contribute to the construction of an adequate ethical approach to the provision of financial services in a globalized financial world.","Baquero-Herrera, Mauricio Humberto",Handbook on Ethics in Finance,296,1

Due to the high prevalence of the disease, early detection and rapid isolation of patients are the vital points for controlling the outbreak. The purpose of this study was to determine the correct location of chest CT scan in the diagnosis of COVID-19. MAIN TEXT: The current study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. 2959 papers were found in all national and international databases. The study has been reported based on the PRISMA checklist. All analyses were done by CMA Ver. 2 software. The statistical analysis results show that the GGO observation level in the available shape was 46% in CT scan results, and the consolidation observation level in the general form was 33% in CT scan results. Pleural effusion was 7%, and linear opacity observation level was 24% in CT scan results in the general form. The CT scan test sensitivity level was gained 94.7%, and PCR test sensitivity level was achieved as 94.8%. This level was 89% in the early stage. CONCLUSION: The chest CT has about 24% higher diagnostic sensitivity than the PCR test, in the early stage. GGO revealed a declining process and also indicates that GGO is an early symptom of the disease in CT scan. Linear opacity is the reason behind the initial dyspnea in coronavirus suffering patients referring to the medical centers. The extra-pulmonary lesions increase in the last stage of the disease that makes the patient’s worse.

The purpose of this article is to review the medicinal plants with potential to be used as complementary therapies against COVID-19. Bibliographic information was searched in several databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PROTA, ResearchGate and GLOBEinMED), to retrieve relevant papers on (1) plants used to manage common symptoms of COVID-19, (2) plant secondary metabolites with confirmed inhibitory effects on COVID-19 and (3) plants exhibiting pharmacological activities of relevance for COVID-19 management. A total of 230 species was recorded as potential source of ingredients for the fight against the 2019 novel corona virus. Of these species, 30 contain confirmed antiCOVID-19 secondary metabolites, 90 are used traditionally to manage at least 3 common symptoms of COVID-19, 10 have immunostimulant activity, 52 have anti-inflamatory activity, 14 have antiviral properties and 78 species are documented as used to treat malaria. A PCA analysis showing cluster formatting among the recorded species indicates 4 groups of species and an array of possibility of using individual species or a combination of species for their complementary effects. The authors argue that Cameroonian medicinal plants can be of potential contribution to the fight against COVID-19.

Technology plays a key role but the considerations to design online learning environments that meaningfully engage students are complex. This exploratory, qualitative study attempted to elicit eight mathematics teachers’ considerations and perspectives in designing online home-based learning lessons for the engagement of elementary and secondary students. Data were gathered through interviews. Ground-up thematic analyses were conducted. The following implications are derived—(1) student engagement in online learning context is paramount to their learning, (2) there is no one software application for all the learning activities, (3) teacher professional development is necessary to keep them up-to-date, (4) online social networking platforms may be necessary for students’ discussion beyond official online lesson time, and (5) students need to be inculcated with more self-directed skills and habits for learning in online and face-to-face contexts. This study gathers evidence-informed considerations for teachers to design lessons and engage students meaningfully in a unique, online HBL environment. While this is an exploratory study, future studies can inform this area of work by including more teachers across subjects, grades, schools, and geographical contexts.

There are 275.6 million smartphones in the US. Diabetes affects 34.2 million people and 88 million have prediabetes. Diabetes is a risk factor for COVID-19 and affects longterm health of the survivors. Other risk factors for COVID-19, include race and gender. There are also linguistic barriers to care in Diabetes and COVID-19. Both diabetes and COVID-19 have higher risks associated with race and ethnicity. With the pandemic, the US government, Google and Facebook, in March 2020, provided emergency grants for COVID-19 and dissemination of public education. Did the Diabetes apps meet this moment of public health crisis?. Purpose: Do Diabetes Apps provide information about COVID-19 and its risk factors? Methods: Using the search term “diabetes,” the top ten most downloaded android and iOS apps were assessed in the Google Play Store/Apple App Store, respectively. Inclusion criteria: 1) Android: Downloads > 100,000; iOS: Reviews > 300, star rating >4. Apple App store does not provide download information. 2) Free; 3) Ability to track health data: HbA1C, FBS; 4) Language Accessibility via in-app language settings. Results: In the Google Play Store(DROID), the top ten apps in descending order were: 1) mySugr, 2) Onetouch Reveal, 3) OneDrop Diabetes Management, 4) Diabetes: M, 5) Health2Sync - Diabetes Care, 6) Diabetes, 7) Ontrack Diabetes, 8) Blood Glucose Tracker, 9) Glucose Buddy Diabetes Tracker, and 10) Diabetes Connect.

The subsequent redistribution of surgical house officers to accommodate this in a single centre has possibly negatively impacted on the effective discharge notification of acute surgical patients. METHODS: Discharge summaries of all patients discharged from a Surgical Assessment Unit were collected and analysed, to identify the date of completion and grade of responsible clinician. Data collection was carried out over three weeks before the initiation of lockdown measures and continued for a further three weeks during the peak of the Coronavirus pandemic with a three-week interventional period in between. RESULTS: In the initial audit, 36.2% of the 246 patients had delayed discharge summaries with an average of 7 days to complete. On re-evaluation, 45.3% of the 223 patients had delayed discharge summaries, with an average of 12 days to complete. A survey conducted post-re-audit identified that the most common reason for this was due to time constraints. CONCLUSIONS: The reallocation of surgical staff has affected communication between primary and secondary care.

This work looks to evaluate the experience and opinions of key stakeholders who took part in the process and use this to improve follow up in the future. METHOD: 3 Focus groups following the same semi structured format discussed key considerations in follow up in general, telephone follow up, key aspects in its delivery and how this could benefit the service provided to patients. The focus groups involved Juniors (registrar level doctors), Consultants and support staff (clinical and non-clinical). RESULTS: Several themes and subthemes were identified. Key points were that patients were universally in favour of telephone consultations; they find them convenient and enjoy not attending the hospital. All clinicians agreed that although Covid-19 lead us to review New patients via telephone this increased workload as they needed to attend later for an examination and felt it did not provide safe care. CONCLUSIONS: There is certainly an increasing role for telephone follow ups in the wake of Covid-19 which can benefit ongoing patient care and aid in managing the departments follow up capacity. Further work is needed to review this.","Keates, N; Mclaren, O; Perkins, C; Finnie, C; Williams, R",Br J Surg,296,16

To date, there is no information to assess if there are differences in epidemiological, demographical, and clinical characteristics between infected and non-infected IBD patients. METHODS: Case-control study in IBD patients with COVID-19 (cases) compared to IBD without COVID-19 (controls) in the period March-July/2020 within the ENEIDA registry (promoted by GETECCU and with more than 60.000 IBD patients included). Cases were matched 1:2 by age (±5y), type of disease (CD/UC), gender, and centre. All controls were selected from only one investigator blind to other clinical characteristics of the patients to avoid selection bias. RESULTS: 496 cases and 964 controls from 63 Spanish centres were included. No differences were found within the basal characteristics including CD location, CD behaviour, extraintestinal manifestations, family history of IBD or smoking habits. Cases had ≥ 1 comorbidities (cases:43%vs. controls:36%, p=0.01) and occupational risk (cases:27% vs. controls:10.6%, p<0.0001) in a higher proportion. Strict lockdown but not sick leave nor telecommuting was the only measure demonstrating protection against COVID-19 (cases:49% vs. controls:70%, p<0.0001). There were no differences in the use of systemic steroids (p=0.19), immunosuppressants (p=0.54) or biologics (p=0.25) between cases and controls. Cases were more often treated with aminosalicylates (45% vs.34%, p=0.022). Having ≥ 1 comorbidities (OR:1.4, 95%CI: 1–1.8), occupational risk (OR:2.05, 95%CI:1.5–2.9) and the use of aminosalicylates (OR:1.4, 95%CI: 1–1.8) were risk factors for COVID-19. On the other hand, the strict lockdown was a protective factor (OR:0.36, CI:0.27–0.48). CONCLUSION: Comorbidities and epidemiological risk factors are the most relevant aspects for the risk of COVID-19 in IBD patients. This risk of COVID-19 seems to be increased by aminosalicylates but not by immunosuppressants or biologics. The attitude regarding treating IBD patients with aminosalicylates during the COVID-19 pandemic deserves a deeper analysis.

In addition to systemic inflammation, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, a catabolic metabolism, gonadal or thyroid dysfunction, musculoskeletal dysfunction and inactivity as well as vitamin D deficiency contribute to an increased risk of fragility fractures. Iatrogenic causes of osteoporosis are long-term use of inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids (GC). Inhalative GC application in asthma is often indicated in childhood and adolescence, but interstitial lung diseases such as chronic organizing pneumonia, COPD, sarcoid or rheumatic diseases with lung involvement are also treated with inhalative or oral GC. In patients with cystic fibrosis, malabsorption in the context of pancreatic insufficiency, hypogonadism and chronic inflammation with increased bone resorption lead to a decrease in bone structure. After lung transplantation, immunosuppression with GC is a risk factor. The underlying pneumological diseases lead to a change in the trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture and to a reduction in osteological formation and resorption markers. Hypercapnia, acidosis and vitamin D deficiency can accelerate this process and thus increase the individual risk of osteoporotic fragility fractures. A bone mineral density measurement with a T‑Score < –2.5 is a threshold value for the diagnosis of osteoporosis; in contrast the vast majority of all osteoporotic fractures occur with a T‑Score > –2.5. A history of low-trauma fracture indicates osteological therapy. All antiresorptive or anabolic drugs approved in Austria for the treatment of osteoporosis are also indicated for pneumological patients with an increased fragility fracture risk of bone fractures in accordance with the national reimbursement criteria.","Muschitz, Christian; Zwick, Ralf Harun; Haschka, Judith; Dimai, Hans Peter; Rauner, Martina; Amrein, Karin; Wakolbinger, Robert; Jaksch, Peter; Eber, Ernst; Pietschmann, Peter",Wien Klin Wochenschr,296,1

The brain is a central target of Al toxicity, being highly susceptible to oxidative damage. Therefore, recognition of drugs or natural products that guard against Al-mediated neuronal cell death is a powerful strategy for prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. This work aimed to explore the potential of a leaf extract from Harrisonia abyssinica to modulate the neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological activities induced experimentally by Al in vivo. Rats subjected to Al treatment displayed a reduction in learning and memory performance in a passive avoidance test accompanied by a decrease in the hippocampal monoamine and glutamate levels in addition to suppression of Bcl2 expression. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1β), apoptotic markers (caspase-3 and expression of Bax) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) levels were elevated along with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, histological changes and marked deposition of amyloid β plaques in the hippocampus region of the brain tissues being observed in Al-treated animals. Concomitant administration of the high dose of H. abyssinica (200 mg/kg b.w.) restored nearly normal levels of all parameters measured, rather than the low dose (100 mg/kg b.w.), an effect that was comparable to the reference drug (rivastigmine). Molecular docking revealed the appropriate potential of the extract components to block the active site of AChE and ERK2. In conclusion, H. abyssinica leaf extract conferred neuroprotection against Al-induced neurotoxic effects, most likely due to its high phenolic and flavonoid content.","Anwar, Hend Mohamed; Georgy, Gehan S.; Hamad, Sherin Ramadan; Badr, Wafaa K.; El Raey, Mohamed A.; Abdelfattah, Mohamed A.

There were no current guidelines or clear direction on the use of antivirals or other agents on treating Covid‐19 for this new virus, and escalating death rates in the underserved community became disturbing. The early studies consisted of studying Chloroquine (CQ) or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without Azithromycin (AZ), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LV/RV) and other HIV Protease Inhibitors; Remdesivir (RDV) looked promising; however, it was still in clinical trial phases. COVID‐19 causes individuals to suffer from respiratory distress, organ failure, hypotension, lactic acidosis, oliguria, and other acute blood disorders due to various pathogens and conditions. This massive infection triggers an immune response which vasoactivates chemicals, such as cytokines, dilate the blood vessels and increase capillary permeability, causing vascular fluid to shift to the interstitium. The immune system extends signaling molecules (cytokines) that recruit immune cells to the infection site as part of an inflammatory response. In a desperate attempt to save lives, Valtrex (VX) was used to treat COVID‐19 as an off‐label use to stop viral replication, stop inflammation, and promote recovery time for patients sent home with viral pneumonia due to COVID 19 that were Short of breath and who were symptomatic. VX is not without bothersome side‐effects: it must be used with caution in persons with kidney disease and in people 60 years and older. To treat the pneumonia with a combination approach, amoxicillin (AMX) with clavulanate(CLV) was used twice a day for five days. In addition, Diflucan 150 mg was used to halt the overproduction of yeast caused by using antibiotics. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, and print repositories on trials: for CQ HCQ with or without AZ, LV/RV, Protease Inhibitors, and RDV in COVID‐19 or SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, until May 2020. The patients were given consent for off‐label use of the treatment. The patients involved in the study were between the ages of 25 to 49. They had documented positive test results for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Radiologic studies were done as well as a complete blood count and a chemistry level. RESULTS: There were ten people treated with VX, AMX, and Diflucan((DFN). All the participants recovered. One participant had to receive supplemental oxygen and saline nebulizer treatments at home for one due to shortness of breath a month. The comparison group used high doses of probiotics 100 billion cells and ginger shots twice a day. The people who used VX, AMX, and DFN reported recovery from the symptoms of fever, coughing, and SOB in 24‐48 hours. However, the patients that used the alternative medications reported symptom improvement around day 5 ‐7. In conclusion, there is an insufficient confirmation regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of VX in patients with COVID‐19. Its use should be considered preliminary, requiring ethical approval and clinical trial oversight. VX can potentially be used in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of Covid‐19 that are sent home and asked to self‐quarantine who are symptomatic but requires additional study.","Vowel, Patricia; Tulp, Orien; Einstein, George",FASEB J,296,1

Therefore, the present narrative review aims to offer an overview of the state of the art in terms of the psychological treatment modalities of cancer patients, from the diagnosis to the post-surgery period. A total of 67 articles were collected and analyzed, in relation to (1) psychological constructs employed in the oncological field, (2) intervention models and (3) quality of life and well-being measurement and evaluation tools. We described these articles, differentiating between those focusing on the role of (1) the patient, (2) the caregiver, (3) the patient–caregiver dyad and (4) healthcare professional roles. The oncological diagnosis and its repercussions in the lives of the patient and caregiver were explored and critical aspects that emerged from the literature were highlighted. In conclusion, the analysis allowed some considerations about the need to define research protocols and useful management strategies for increasing the overall health of patients with cancer diagnoses and the people who surround them.","Turchi, Gian Piero; Dalla Riva, Marta Silvia; Orrù, Luisa; Pinto, Eleonora",Behav Sci (Basel),296,17

In this scenario, physical and rehabilitative medicine (PRM) physicians prescribe a patient-tailored rehabilitation plan, including spinal orthoses. However, there is a high heterogeneity in the clinical indications of spinal orthoses. Thus, the aim of this survey was to investigate common clinical practice in terms of the prescription of spinal orthoses. This nationwide cross-sectional survey recruited Italian PRM physicians commonly involved in the management of patients with VFFs. One hundred twenty-six PRM physicians completed the survey. The results showed that most PRM physicians prescribe spinal orthoses in outpatients suffering from VFFs (n = 106; 83.9%). The most prescribed spinal orthosis for acute VFF patients was the three-point rigid orthosis (n = 64; 50.8%), followed by the semirigid thoraco-lumbar orthosis (n: 20; 15.9%). However, most PRM physicians prescribed dynamic orthoses in outpatients with chronic VFFs (n = 66; 52.4%). Albeit that a correct management of VFFs is mandatory to improve pain and reduce disability, our findings highlighted uncertainty in the type of spinal orthosis prescription in both the acute and chronic VFF phase. Therefore, high-quality research trials are warranted to provide clear recommendations for the correct clinical management of VFF.","de Sire, Alessandro; Ammendolia, Antonio; Gimigliano, Alessandra; Tiberi, Roberto; Cisari, Carlo; Invernizzi, Marco",Healthcare (Basel),296,1

Covariates included demographic ones (age, gender) as well as self-reported questionnaire-obtained ones (satisfaction with ones’ smile prior treatment, the experience of previous orthodontic therapy). The primary outcome was compliance: Based on patients’ consistent use of the mobile application for self-report and aligner wear time of ≥22 h, patients were classified as fully compliant, fairly compliant, or poorly compliant. Chi-square test was used to compare compliance in different subgroups.

Genome sequencing techniques assure comprehensive mapping of human genetics; however, understanding of gene functional interactions, specifically of time/age-dependent modifications, remain challenging. The age of the genome is defined by the sum of individual (inherited) and acquired genomic traits, based on internal and external factors that impact ontogenesis from the moment of egg fertilization and embryonic development. The biological part of genomic age opens a new perspective for intervention. The discovery of single cell-based mechanisms for genetic change indicates the possibility of influencing aging and associated disease burden, as well as metabolism. Cell populations with transformed genetic background were shown to serve as the origin of common diseases during extended life expectancy (superaging). Consequently, age-related cell transformation leads to cancer and cell degeneration (senescence). This article aims to describe current advances in the genomic mechanisms of senescence and its role in the spatiotemporal spread of epithelial clones and cell evolution.","Kitakaze, Masatoshi; Chijimatsu, Ryota; Vecchione, Andrea; Kitagawa, Toru; Doki, Yuichiro; Eguchi, Hidetoshi; Ishii, Hideshi",Int J Mol Sci,296,1

Here we discuss how oxidative stress may be implicated in the aetiology of schizophrenia and examine how current understanding relates associations with symptoms, potentially via lipid peroxidation induced neuronal damage. We argue that oxidative stress may be a good target for future pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia and suggest a multi-step model of illness progression with oxidative stress involved at each stage.","Murray, Alex J.; Rogers, Jack C.; Katshu, Mohammad Zia Ul Haq; Liddle, Peter F.; Upthegrove, Rachel",Front Psychiatry,296,1

Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey of anxiety and depression in patients with physical diseases, who were suspected of depression and anxiety based on their clinical performance by their physicians and PHQ ≧ 8, from various clinical departments of 57 general hospitals in China. Data regarding demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics were collected. Social and psychological factors and the severity of anxiety or depression were collected through self-rating scales. Finally, we used multivariate logistic regression to identify the factors associated with anxiety and depression in patients with physical diseases. Results: A total of 2,105 (84.6%) valid and completed questionnaires were returned. The proportion of anxiety, depression, combined depression and anxiety, either anxiety or depression among the patients with physical diseases from all clinical departments was 63.3, 75.1, 57.1, and 81.2% respectively. Further regression analysis indicated that gender, monthly income, specific physical diseases, personality traits, social supports and life negative events were related factors of both anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Anxiety and depression were common in patients with physical diseases, with a high proportion of co-morbidity of anxiety and depression. Females, patients with cancer, poor social support and negative life events reported more severe anxiety and depression. The results may help to understand the present situation of anxiety and depression in general hospitals in china, and identify the patients with high risk of depression and anxiety.","Yang, Wanlin; Xiao, Ling; Yuan, Zhiyong; Huang, Huan; Xiang, Yilei; Liu, Zhongchun; Nan, Cai; Wang, Huiling; Wang, Gaohua",Front Psychiatry,296,1

However, laboratory tests to measure neutralizing antibodies varied among clinical trials and have not been standardized. In this study, we attempted to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of a cell-based assay to detect neutralizing antibodies and to determine the detection threshold to predict treatment efficacy. Application of the secreted type of NanoLuc and AAV receptor-expressing cells reduced the multiplicity of infection (MOI) for AAV transduction and improved the sensitivity to detect neutralizing antibodies with a low coefficient of variation, whereas the detection threshold could not be improved by the reduction of MOI to <100. After human immunoglobulin administration into mice at various doses, treatment with high-dose AAV8 vector enabled evasion of the inhibitory effect of neutralizing antibodies. Conversely, gene transduction was slightly influenced in the mice treated with low-dose AAV8 vector, even when neutralizing antibodies were determined to be negative in the assay. In conclusion, we developed a reliable and sensitive cell-based assay to measure neutralizing antibodies against AAV and found that the appropriate MOI to detect marginal neutralizing antibodies was 100. Other factors, including noninhibitory antibodies, marginally influence in vivo transduction at low vector doses.","Baatartsogt, Nemekhbayar; Kashiwakura, Yuji; Hayakawa, Morisada; Kamoshita, Nobuhiko; Hiramoto, Takafumi; Mizukami, Hiroaki; Ohmori, Tsukasa",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,296,1

Investigations aimed at diagnosing this disorder are expensive and time-consuming and can eventually inconclusive. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic yield of next generation sequencing in patients with atypical CP (ACP). Methods: Patient eligibility criteria included impaired motor function with onset at birth or within the first year of life, and one or more of the following conditions: severe intellectual disability, positive family history, brain imaging findings not typical for cerebral palsy, abnormal neurometabolic profile, intractable seizure, normal neuroimaging despite severe psychomotor disability, after pediatric neurologist assessment including neuroimaging and biochemical-metabolic study offered for genetic study. Results: Exome sequencing was done for 66 patients which revealed pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variants of unknown significance in 36.2, 9, and 43.9%, respectively. We also found 10 new mutations and were able to suggest specific and personalized treatments for nine patients.

FMRP binds mRNA and represses general translation in the brain. Transcriptome analysis of the Fmr1-deficient mouse hippocampus reveals widespread dysregulation of alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. Many of these aberrant splicing changes coincide with those found in post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) as well as in mouse models of intellectual disability such as PTEN hamartoma syndrome (PHTS) and Rett Syndrome (RTT). These splicing changes could result from chromatin modifications (e.g., in FXS, RTT) and/or splicing factor alterations (e.g., PTEN, autism). Based on the identities of the RNAs that are mis-spliced in these disorders, it may be that they are at least partly responsible for some shared pathophysiological conditions. The convergence of splicing aberrations among these autism spectrum disorders might be crucial to understanding their underlying cognitive impairments.","Shah, Sneha; Richter, Joel D.",Front Psychiatry,296,17

Despite its prevalence among women of reproductive age, the pathology of the disease has not yet been elucidated and only symptomatic treatment is available. Endometriosis has high latency and diagnostic methods are both limited and invasive. AIM OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to summarise minimally invasive or non-invasive diagnostic methods for endometriosis and their diagnostic efficiencies. Furthermore, we discuss the identification and diagnostic potential of novel disease biomarkers of microbial or glycan origin. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Great efforts have been made to develop minimally invasive or non-invasive diagnostic methods in endometriosis. The problem with most potential biomarker candidates is that they have high accuracy only in cases of severe disease. Therefore, it is necessary to examine other potential biomarkers more closely. Associations between gastrointestinal and genital tract microbial health and endometriosis have been identified. For instance, irritable bowel syndrome is more common in women with endometriosis, and hormonal imbalance has a negative impact on the microbiome of both the genital tract and the gastrointestinal system. Further interrogation of these associations may have potential diagnostic significance and may identify novel therapeutic avenues. Glycomics may also be a potent source of biomarkers of endometriosis, with a number of glyco-biomarkers already approved by the FDA. Endometriosis-associated microbial and glycomic profiles may represent viable targets for development of innovative diagnostics in this debilitating disease.","Kovács, Zsuzsanna; Glover, Louise; Reidy, Fiona; MacSharry, John; Saldova, Radka",J Adv Res,296,1

The present paper attempts to systematically review the existing literature to understand and explore the linkages of COVID-19 with environment and proposes conceptual frameworks to underline this nexus. Our study indicates a critical role of meteorological factors, ambient air pollutants and wastewater in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) transmission-spread dynamics. The study also focuses on the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on the regional and global environment. Most of the indirect environmental effects of COVID-19 were attributed to global human confinement that resulted from the implementation of the pandemic containment measures. This worldwide anthropogenic ‘pause’ sent ripples to all environmental compartments and presented a unique test bed to identify anthropogenic impacts on the earth’s natural systems. The review further addresses emerging sustainability challenges in the new normal and their potential solutions. The situation warrants critical attention to the environment-COVID-19 nexus and innovative sustainable practices to address the ramifications of short- and long-term environmental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To implement these and other efforts, new institutions will need to be established on a national and international level. This paper sketches a blueprint of such institutions, and conducts in-depth investigations of three key components of any future AI governance institutions, exploring benefits and associated drawbacks: (1) “purpose”, relating to the institution’s overall goals and scope of work or mandate; (2) “geography”, relating to questions of participation and the reach of jurisdiction; and (3) “capacity”, the infrastructural and human make-up of the institution. Subsequently, the paper highlights noteworthy aspects of various institutional roles specifically around questions of institutional purpose, and frames what these could look like in practice, by placing these debates in a European context and proposing different iterations of a European AI Agency. Finally, conclusions and future research directions are proposed.","Stix, Charlotte",AI Ethics,296,3

This study aimed to report our clinical experience with EV71-related AHF, as well as to discuss its pathogenesis and relationship to Takotsubo syndrome (TTS). Methods: A total 27 children with EV71-related AHF between 1998 and 2018 were studied. The TTS diagnosis was based on the International Takotsubo Diagnostic Criteria. Results: Acute heart failure-related early death occurred in 10 (37%) of the patients. Sinus tachycardia, systemic hypertension, and pulmonary edema in 100, 85, and 81% of the patients, respectively, preceded AHF. Cardiac biomarkers were significantly increased in most patients. The main echocardiographic findings included transient and reversible left ventricular (LV) regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) with apical ballooning. High concentrations of catecholamines either preceded or coexisted with AHF. Myocardial pathology revealed no evidence of myocarditis, which was consistent with catecholamine-induced cardiotoxic damage. Patients with EV71-related AHF who had received close monitoring of their cardiac function, along with early intervention involving extracorporeal life support (ECLS), had a higher survival rate (82 vs. 30%, p = 0.013) and better neurological outcomes (59 vs. 0%, p = 0.003). Conclusion: EV 71-related AHF was preceded by brain stem encephalitis-related hypercatecholaminemia, which resulted in a high mortality rate. Careful monitoring is merited so that any life-threatening cardiogenic shock may be appropriately treated. In view of the similarities in their clinical manifestations, natural course direction, pathological findings, and possible mechanisms, TTS and EV71-related AHF may represent the same syndrome. Therefore, we suggest that EV71-related AHF could constitute a direct causal link to catecholamine-induced secondary TTS.","Jan, Sheng-Ling; Fu, Yun-Ching; Chi, Ching-Shiang; Lee, Hsiu-Fen; Huang, Fang-Liang; Wang, Chung-Chi; Wei, Hao-Ji; Lin, Ming-Chih; Chen, Po-Yen; Hwang, Betau",Front Cardiovasc Med,296,24

Competition law and policy have therefore remained highly relevant during this period in both developed and developing countries. Current common challenges faced are raised by the increased digitalization of the economy and the dominance of digital platforms, especially considering the number and market share of micro and Small and Medium Sized enterprises (SMEs), the most seriously affected by the pandemic lockdown measures. Several jurisdictions and international organizations are equipping themselves with new legislation and instruments to address these challenges, namely supporting SMEs fair access to digital markets and promoting competitive public procurement, but less experienced and resource-constrained authorities of developing countries must prioritize otherwise. Competition advocacy is now more than ever a priority for them so that the economic recovery packages preserver open, fair, and equitable markets. International cooperation, bringing together developed and developing countries authorities, provides a crucial framework of support especially at this time.

This is a powerful and important perspective from which to investigate the processes and consequences of social group memberships, one which has been overlooked by most neuroscientific research. In particular, neurofeminism, a field of critical neuroscience that challenges neuroscientific assumptions, methods and interpretations of data that reinforce sexism, has ignored intersectionality to date. In contrast, research in the field of psychology has been engaging with intersectionality for more than a decade. In reflecting on how intersectionality has advanced feminist research in psychology, this paper provides a critical analysis of potential novel research avenues for neurofeminism. We identify three main research themes guided by intersectionality. The first theme involves research centered on understanding the socio-structural causes of health inequalities experienced by individuals with intersecting marginalized social identities; the second concerns research addressing the psychological processing of social group memberships that underlies the enactment of systemic discriminatory practices; and the third theme comprises intersectionality research that aims to challenge psychological epistemology. Drawing parallels between the fields of psychology and neuroscience, we explore the potential benefits and risks of advancing an intersectionality-informed neurofeminism.","Duchesne, Annie; Kaiser Trujillo, Anelis",Front Hum Neurosci,296,24

However, the field needs to better understand if a change in care delivery from in-person to telehealth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will yield durable patient engagement and health outcomes for patients with obesity. The objective of this study was to examine the association of mode of healthcare utilization (telehealth versus in-person) and sociodemographic factors among patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from a university outpatient obesity medicine clinic and a community bariatric surgery practice. Patients completed an online survey (1 June 2020-24 September 2020) to assess changes in healthcare utilization modality during subsequent changes in infection rates in the geographic area. Logistic regression analysis examined the association of mode of healthcare utilization and key sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS A total of 583 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2 years (standard deviation 13.0), mean body mass index 40.2 (standard deviation 6.7), 49.2% non-Hispanic white, 28.7% non-Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity, 33.1% completed bariatric surgery) were included. Adjusted logistic regression models showed older age was inversely associated with telehealth use (adjusted odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.98) and non-Hispanic black were more likely to use telehealth compared to non-Hispanic white (adjusted odds ratio = 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.81). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting access to healthcare among patients with obesity. Telehealth is an emerging modality that can maintain healthcare access during the pandemic, but utilization varies by age and ethnicity in this high-risk population.","Almandoz, Jaime P; Xie, Luyu; Schellinger, Jeffrey N; Mathew, M Sunil; Edwards, Khary; Ofori, Ashley; Kukreja, Sachin; Schneider, Benjamin; Messiah, Sarah E",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,296,1

METHODS A total of 8,940 adolescents (45.77% males; Mean age=15.31±0.018 years old) and their parents (24.34% males; Mean age=40.78±0.60 years old) from Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, participated in the survey and completed several questionnaires online. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Family Adaptability Cohesion Scale, Second Edition, Chinese version (FACES II-CV) to evaluate depressive symptoms and family cohesion and family adaptability from the perception of parents and adolescents. RESULTS Results indicated significant differences between adolescents' and parents' perspectives of family functions. Significant negative correlations exist between depressive symptoms and family cohesion and family adaptability from the perspectives of both adolescents and parents. In addition, regression models with demographic characteristics adjusted showed that the perceived family cohesion and adaptability of parents and adolescents and the agreements between them could be predicted by their depressive symptoms. LIMITATION Cross-sectional study and limited population-wide are limitations. CONCLUSION Detecting the depressive symptoms of adolescents and parents earlier and promptly providing family intervention are of great significance to promote their perceptions of family cohesion and adaptability, which contribute to the mental health development of adolescents and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Mengxue; Li, Lili; Wu, Feng; Cao, Yang; Zhang, Huanrui; Li, Xin; Zou, Jie; Guo, Zhongwu; Kong, Lingtao",Journal of affective disorders,296,2

Using random-effects models, estrogen replacement therapy showed an increase in bone mineral density [weighted mean change from baseline 0.09 g/cm2 (0.04-0.14)] that differed by type of estrogen but not route of administration. Oral estrogen replacement therapy showed a higher increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when compared to transdermal [weighted mean difference 9.33 mg/dl (4.82-13.85)] with no significant effect on other lipid fractions. The current evidence suggests possible benefit of estrogen replacement therapy on bone mineral density and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whether this improvement translates into changes in patient important outcomes (cardiovascular events or fractures) remains uncertain. Larger randomized clinical trials with direct comparisons on patient important outcomes are necessary.","Cintron, Dahima; Rodriguez-Gutierrez, Rene; Serrano, Valentina; Latortue-Albino, Paula; Erwin, Patricia J; Murad, Mohammad Hassan",Endocrine,296,1

We explored whether NIRS might be a more easy applicable proxy to [15O]H2O positron emission tomography (PET) for detecting CBF changes during hemodialysis. Furthermore, we compared potential determinants of rSO2 and CBF. In 12 patients aged ≥ 65 years, NIRS and PET were performed simultaneously: before (T1), early after start (T2), and at the end of hemodialysis (T3). Between T1 and T3, the relative change in frontal rSO2 (ΔrSO2) was -8 ± 9% ( P = 0.001) and -5 ± 11% ( P = 0.08), whereas the relative change in frontal gray matter CBF (ΔCBF) was -11 ± 18% ( P = 0.009) and -12 ± 16% ( P = 0.007) for the left and right hemisphere, respectively. ΔrSO2 and ΔCBF were weakly correlated for the left (ρ 0.31, P = 0.4), and moderately correlated for the right (ρ 0.69, P = 0.03) hemisphere. The Bland-Altman plot suggested underestimation of ΔCBF by NIRS. Divergent associations of pH, pCO2 and arterial oxygen content with rSO2 were found compared to corresponding associations with CBF. In conclusion, NIRS could be a proxy to PET to detect intradialytic CBF changes, although NIRS and PET capture different physiological parameters of the brain.","Polinder-Bos, Harmke A; Elting, Jan Willem J; Aries, Marcel Jh; García, David Vállez; Willemsen, Antoon Tm; van Laar, Peter J; Kuipers, Johanna; Krijnen, Wim P; Slart, Riemer Hja; Luurtsema, Gert; Westerhuis, Ralf; Gansevoort, Ron T; Gaillard, Carlo Ajm; Franssen, Casper Fm",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,296,4

The present study was conducted with an aim to assess the acute postoperative pain experiences, its interference with ADLs, emotions, sleep, IPR and satisfaction with pain management among patients who had undergone elective surgeries. Methods In this observational study, 200 postoperative adult patients; who had undergone elective surgery were interviewed using American Pain Society's Patient Outcome and Satisfaction Survey Questionnaire. Pain perception and interference of pain with ADLs, emotions, sleep, and IPR was measured on 0-10 numerical scale and satisfaction on 6 point Likert scale, i.e., very satisfied to very dissatisfied. Results There was high incidence (82.5%) of acute postoperative pain experience and mean score for worst episodes of pain was significantly high, i.e., 7.6 ± 1.5, which had significant interference with ADLs (5.6 ± 2.1), sleep (3.6 ± 1.7), and emotions (3.6 ± 1.6). Majority of patients reported that pain was assessed only once (17%) or twice (48.5%) in each shift. Despite of poor pain control, a large number of patients were satisfied with overall pain treatment (69%), and response of physicians (81%) and nurses (62%) for their pain complaints. Acute pain score was directly associated with the duration of postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.001). Conclusion Acute postoperative pain was inadequately assessed and undertreated but still a large number of participants were satisfied with acute postoperative pain management probably because patients expects that pain is inevitable after surgery. Postoperative pain had significant interference with ADLs, emotions and sleep of patients, which may affect postoperative comfort and recovery.","Sharma, Suresh K; Thakur, Kalpana; Mudgal, Shiv K; Payal, Yashwant S",Indian journal of anaesthesia,296,19

We aimed to determine presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO), thrombus length, infarction diameter, and occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation in AIS patients with preceding DOAC as compared to VKA therapy. METHODS Using a prospectively collected cohort of AIS patients, we performed univariate and multivariable regression analyses regarding imaging outcomes. Additionally, we provide a sensitivity analysis for the subgroup of patients with confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation. RESULTS We included AIS in patients with preceding DOAC (N = 75) and VKA (N = 61) therapy, median age 79 (IQR 70-83), 39% female. Presence of any LVO between DOAC and VKA patients (29.3% versus 37.7%, P = 0.361), and target LVO for endovascular therapy (26.7% versus 27.9%, P = 1.0) was equal with a similar occlusion pattern. DOAC as compared to VKA were associated with a similar rate of target LVO for EVT (aOR 0.835, 95% CI 0.368-1.898). The presence of multiple lesions and characteristics of the thrombus were similar in DOAC and VKA patients. Acute ischemic lesion diameter in real world patients was equal in patients taking DOAC as compared to VKA. Lesion diameter in VKA patients (median 13 mm, IQR 6-26 versus median 20 mm, IQR 7-36, P = 0.001), but not DOAC patients was smaller in the setting of confirmed therapeutic VKA. The frequency of radiological hemorrhagic transformation and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in OAC patients was low. Sensitivity analysis considering only patients with confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation did not change any of the results. CONCLUSION Preceding DOAC treatment showed equal rates of LVO and infarct size as compared to VKA in AIS patients. This study adds to the knowledge of imaging findings in AIS patients with preceding anticoagulation.","Meinel, Thomas Raphael; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Gralla, Jan; Seiffge, David J; Auer, Elias; Frey, Sebastién; El-Koussy, Marwan; Arnold, Marcel; Fischer, Urs; Göldlin, Martina; Jung, Simon; Hakim, Arsany",BMC neurology,296,1

The mainly airborne pathogen has led to large numbers of deaths, principally in elderly and vulnerable segments of the population. Protective vaccines have recently become available, but it is not yet clear whether and when population-wide immunity will be achieved. The existence of evidence for the protective effect of masks covering the mouth and nose is a topic of public debate. METHODS A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed. Data from the German Robert Koch Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also taken into account. RESULTS When talking, as many as 20 000 droplets ranging in size from 20 to 500 μM are released every second. According to PCR tests, the amount of virus exhaled is highest immediately before the onset of symptoms. No randomized trials have been conducted on the effect of masks covering the mouth and nose. A meta-analysis of 29 studies on infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS revealed that type N-95 masks (corresponding approximately to FFP-2), surgical masks, or similar multilayer cotton masks can greatly reduce the infection risk for the wearers (RR 0.34 [0.26; 0.45], with moderate heterogeneity [I2 = 48%]). Model experiments and case reports suggest that masks covering the mouth and nose afford considerable protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne diseases by reducing release of and exposure to potentially infectious droplets; in addition, infections that do occur take a milder course. A limitation of the studies analyzed is that in most cases, this effect cannot be viewed in isolation from the protective impact of other measures (distancing, hygiene precautions). CONCLUSION It can plausibly be assumed that consistent use of masks covering the mouth and nose can play an important role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Hemmer, Christoph Josef; Hufert, Frank; Siewert, Stefan; Reisinger, Emil",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,296,26

To do so, we analyse the constructs of fitness for purpose and fitness for use across healthcare systems and in practice based on the literature, expert opinion and user experience. METHODS A multiphase qualitative study was undertaken. Phases included a literature review, a first round of one-on-one interviews with a panel of academics and thought leaders in the field (n=16), and a second round of interviews with real-world users of performance indicators (n=16). Thematic analysis was conducted between phases in order to triangulate findings in a stepwise process. RESULTS Common uses of healthcare performance indicators were differentiated within micro-meso-macro contexts of healthcare systems. Each purpose of use signals different decision-making tasks, and in effect information needs. An indicator's fitness for use can be appraised by three clusters of considerations: methodological, contextual and managerial. Methodological considerations gauge an indicator's perceived importance, engagement potential, interpretability, standardisation, feasibility of remedial actions, alignment to care models and sensitivity to change. Information infrastructure, system governance, workforce capacity and learning culture were found as enabling contextual considerations. Managerial considerations influencing an indicator's use in practice were found to span the selection of indicators, data collection, analysis, display of results and delivery of information to decision-makers. CONCLUSION The actionability of a healthcare performance indicator should be appraised by its alignment with the intended purpose of use beyond aggregate healthcare system levels, in combination with the extent to which methodological, contextual and managerial fitness for use considerations are met. Striking a better balance between the importance weighted to an indicator's statistical merits and emphasis put to its fitness for purpose and use is needed for indicators that are ultimately actionable for quality of care-related decision-making.","Barbazza, Erica; Klazinga, Niek S; Kringos, Dionne S",BMJ quality & safety,296,1

We sought to examine the literature in a systematic review manner on the outcomes of using ECMO postcardiac surgery. METHODS A comprehensive electronic literature search was done to identify all the articles that have discussed the use of ECMO postcardiac surgery. The keywords and medical subject headings terms were used to identify the relevant articles. Studies have been screened according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS The identified studies have been summarized in each relevant section of this study. Cardiogenic shock postcardiac surgery can benefit from ECMO to varying degrees and the survival for this; otherwise, fatal condition has been shown to be improving through the use of ECMO. However, the decision and timing to initiate ECMO therapy remains selective and is dependent on a range of factors such as patient factor, clinician's judgment, meaning there is no consistent and solid ground regarding the timing of ECMO initiation. CONCLUSION Current evidence suggests that the circulatory support provided by ECMO improves survival rates for postcardiac surgery cardiogenic shock patients who are refractory to inotropic management, without such ECMO support patient mortality rates would be much greater.","Harahwa, Tinotenda; Chor, Cheryl Yan Ting; Harky, Amer",Journal of cardiac surgery,296,27

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 137 client-owned equine neonates (< 30 days old) with a history of colic or signs of colic within 1 hour after hospital admission examined between 2000 and 2010. PROCEDURES Signalment, history, results of physical examination, laboratory data, ancillary diagnostic tests, details of treatment, primary diagnosis, concurrent diseases and short-term survival rate were obtained from the medical records. Long-term follow-up information was obtained through phone survey. RESULTS 137 neonates with colic were included. The majority (122 [89%]) of neonates were managed medically. The 3 most common diagnoses associated with colic were enterocolitis (37 [27%]), meconium-associated colic (27 [20%]), and transient medical colic (26 [19%]). The most common reason for surgery was small intestinal strangulating obstruction, and these neonates were more likely to have severe, continuous pain and were less responsive to analgesics. Concurrent diseases were common (87 [64%]) but did not significantly impact survival rate. Short-term survival rate was not significantly different between medically (75%) and surgically (73%) managed neonates. Long-term survival rate was excellent (66/71 [93%]) for horses that survived to hospital discharge. Most neonates surviving to maturity were used as intended (49/59 [83%]). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Most neonates examined for signs of colic can be managed medically. Short-term survival rate in medically and surgically treated neonates was good. Long-term survival rate of foals discharged from the hospital was excellent, with most achieving intended use.","Mackinnon, Melissa C; Southwood, Louise L; Burke, Megan J; Palmer, Jonathan E",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,296,16

Strategies to mitigate the effect of placebo responses have focused on modifying study design with variable success. Identifying and excluding or controlling for individuals with a high likelihood of responding to placebo may improve clinical trial efficiency and avoid unnecessary medication trials. METHODS Participants included those assigned to the placebo arm (n = 141) of the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures for Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial. The elastic net was used to evaluate 283 baseline clinical, behavioral, imaging, and electrophysiological variables to identify the most robust yet parsimonious features that predicted depression severity at the end of the double-blind 8-week trial. Variables retained in at least 50% of the 100 imputed data sets were used in a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to simultaneously predict the probabilities of response and remission. RESULTS Lower baseline depression severity, younger age, absence of melancholic features or history of physical abuse, less anxious arousal, less anhedonia, less neuroticism, and higher average theta current density in the rostral anterior cingulate predicted a higher likelihood of improvement with placebo. The Bayesian model predicted remission and response with an actionable degree of accuracy (both AUC > 0.73). An interactive calculator was developed predicting the likelihood of placebo response at the individual level. CONCLUSION Easy-to-measure clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological assessments can be used to identify placebo responders with a high degree of accuracy.

We aimed to assess whether sequential noninvasive ventilation (NIV) could facilitate early extubation postoperatively after a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure among aTAAD patients. METHODS Beginning in December 2016, we transitioned our weaning strategy from repeated SBT until success (phase 1) to extubation concomitant with sequential NIV (phase 2) for subjects who failed their first SBT. The primary outcomes were re-intubation rate, duration of invasive ventilation, and total duration of ventilation. RESULTS During the study period, 78 subjects with aTAAD failed their first postoperative SBT (38 subjects in phase 1 and 40 subjects in phase 2). Subjects extubated with sequential NIV had shorter median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of invasive ventilation of 39.5 (30.8-57.8) h vs 89.5 (64-112) h (P < .001) and median (IQR) length of ICU stay of 6 (4.0-7.8) d vs 7.5 (5.8-9.0) d (P = .030). There were no significant differences between the 2 phases with regard to rates of re-intubation (7.5% vs 7.89%, P = .95), tracheostomy (2.5% vs 5.26%, P = .53), and in-hospital mortality (2.5% vs 2.63%, P = .97).

Current prevention policies consist of hand hygiene and social distancing. Emergencies overloaded health services and shocked the logistics chains in many countries, especially Italy and China. Having more than a quarter of its population being elderly, Japan is at high risk for COVID-19 induced morbidity and mortality. This situation cancelled schedules of all routine group exercise activities for the seniors in Japan. While the outbreak is ongoing, staying at home is safe. However, successive days of being house-ridden and limited movement can lead to excessive physical inactivity. Some elderly who are not moving much can lose a significant amount of muscle strength, flexibility and aerobic capacity. It can accelerate the frailty and dependency of the seniors, and subsequently, claiming of care and health services. Moreover, existing and new evidences showed that physical activity can promote antiviral immunity. An alternative to usual group exercise activities is crucial to keep seniors active without affecting social distancing. While staying at home for long, functional exercises maintaining basic level of physical activity and movements are urgently required to be introduced to the seniors in Tokyo and around the world to prevent functional decline. Home exercise is a practical option. Therefore, we made a home-version of the functional training exercise video with different sets of 10-minutes exercise for 7 days a week.

CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. This study aimed to retrospectively analyze abnormal lung changes following initial computed tomography (CT) among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Yunnan, and to evaluate the effectiveness of a chest CT-based model for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS One hundred and nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody who exhibited abnormal findings on initial CT were retrospectively analyzed. Thereafter, changes in the number, distribution, shape, and density of the lesions were observed. Further, the epidemiological, clinical, and CT imaging findings (+/-) were correlated. Following univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for significant factors, and models were established to evaluate the diagnostic ability of CT for COVID-19. RESULTS Our results showed significant differences between patients with COVID-19 in epidemiological history (first, second, and third generation), clinical type (moderate, severe, and critical), and abnormal CT imaging characteristics (+/-) (P<0.05). Moreover, significant differences in abnormal CT imaging characteristics, including region, extent, and focus, were observed between the first generation and the other generations (P<0.05).

We have shown that fresh human platelets (Plts) and platelet extracellular vesicles mitigate vascular leak in murine models of injury. Here, we investigate the potential of freeze-dried platelets (FDPlts) to attenuate pulmonary vascular permeability, decrease inflammation and promote clotting in a murine model of HS. METHODS Human FDPlts were characterized utilizing in vitro assays of platelet marker expression, aggregation, coagulation and endothelial cell permeability. An intravital model of vascular injury in the mouse cremaster muscle was used to assess the ability of FDPlts to incorporate into clots. Mice subjected to controlled hemorrhage for 90 minutes were 1) lactated Ringer's solution (LR), 2) FDPlts, 3) fresh human Plts, 4) murine whole blood (WB) and 5) shams (only instrumented). HS mouse endpoints included coagulation, pulmonary vascular permeability and lung injury. RESULTS FDPlts expressed platelet specific markers and retained functionality similar to fresh Plts. In in vitro assays of platelet aggregation differences were noted. In vivo, FDPlts and Plts were found to incorporate into clots in post capillary venules in the mouse cremaster. HS mice resuscitated with LR displayed increased pulmonary vascular permeability compared to sham (sham, 686.6±359.7; shock+LR, 2637±954.7; p=0.001), treatment with FDPlts or WB attenuated permeability compared to shock: (shock+FDPlts, 1328±462.6; p=0.05), and (shock+WB, 1024±370.5; p=0.0108). However, Plts (Day 1-3) did not attenuate vascular leak in HS mice compared to shock (shock+Plts, 3601±1581; p=0.33). CONCLUSIONS FDPlts contribute to clot formation similar to fresh human Plts. FDPlts also attenuated vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo. Mouse WB resuscitation but not fresh Plts attenuated vascular permeability after HS. These data suggest that the effect of FDPlts may be a suitable alternative to fresh Plts in modulating hemostasis and the endotheliopathy associated with injury.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleeve gastrectomy with ileal transposition (SGIT), a new procedure, is as effective as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) to induce glucose control on an obese rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS Twenty eight obese diabetic Zucker rats, weighing 571 ± 151 g were assigned into three procedures: SGIT (n = 11), RYGB (n = 7), and sham operation (n = 10). Animals were followed, evaluating weekly weight increase and food intake. We performed an insulin tolerance test after 8 weeks and measured serum peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY 3-36) and ghrelin levels. RESULTS Nine weeks after surgery, sham-operated animals increased their body weight by 24%. In far contrast, SGIT and RYGB rats weighed 21% and 18% less than sham animals, respectively (sham, 884 ± 15 g; SGIT, 720 ± 19 g; RYGB, 754 ± 14 g; p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between SGIT and RYGB. Cumulative food intake in SGIT and RYGB procedures decreased by 29.6% and 32.9%, respectively (sham, 576.3 ± 33 g; SGIT, 405.8 ± 10 g; RYGB, 386.4 ± 21 g; p < 0.001). No differences were found between SGIT and RYGB rats. Sixty minutes after oral gavage, PYY levels were increased by 185% and 74% in SGIT and RYGB, respectively (sham, 63.4 ± 2.1 pg/ml; SGIT, 192.7 ± 17 pg/ml; RYGB, 117.7 ± 4.8 pg/ml; p < 0.001). Glucose tolerance was improved after SGIT and RYGB surgery demonstrated by area under the curve analysis (sham, 27,090 ± 1,424; SGIT, 17,704 ± 1,288 mg/dl; p < 0.018; RYGB, 16,212 ± 2,522; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION SGIT proved to be as effective as RYGB on obese diabetic rats as a weight loss procedure.

71543,71543,71543,Challenges in completing a successful vasectomy reversal.,14.187273,3.0510576,2021-04-18,"BACKGROUND The component separation technique (CST) was developed to improve the integrity of abdominal wall reconstruction for large, complex hernias. Open CST necessitates large subcutaneous skin flaps and, therefore, is associated with significant ischemic wound complications. The minimally invasive or endoscopic component separation technique (MICST) has been suggested in preliminary studies to reduce wound complication rates post-operatively. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature comparing open versus endoscopic component separation and performed a meta-analysis of controlled studies. METHODS A comprehensive search of electronic databases was completed. All English, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparison study, and case series were included. All comparison studies included in the meta-analysis were assessed independently by two reviewers for methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools. RESULTS 63 primary studies (3,055 patients) were identified; 7 controlled studies and 56 case series. The total wound complication rate was lower for MICST (20.6 %) compared to Open CST (34.6 %). MICST compared to open CST was shown to have lower rates of superficial infections (3.5 vs 8.9 %), skin dehiscence (5.3 vs 8.2 %), necrosis (2.1 vs 6.8 %), hematoma/seroma formation (4.6 vs 7.4 %), fistula tract formation (0.4 vs 1.0 %), fascial dehiscence (0.0 vs 0.4 %), and mortality (0.4 vs 0.6 %.) The open component CST did have lower rates of intra-abdominal abscess formation (3.8 vs 4.6 %) and recurrence rates (11.1 vs 15.1 %). The meta-analysis included 7 non-randomized controlled studies (387 patients). A similar suggestive overall trend was found favoring MICST, although most types of wound complications did not show to significance. MICST was associated with a significantly decreased rate of fascial dehiscence and was shown to be significantly shorter procedure. CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta-analysis comparing MICST to open CST suggests MICST is associated with decreased overall post-operative wound complication rates. Further prospective studies are needed to verify these findings.","Switzer, Noah J; Dykstra, Mark A; Gill, Richdeep S; Lim, Stephanie; Lester, Erica; de Gara, Christopher; Shi, Xinzhe; Birch, Daniel W; Karmali, Shahzeer",Surgical endoscopy,296,16

Seizure unpredictability and complications, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), may cause high parental stress and increased anxiety. Nocturnal supervision with seizure detection devices may lower SUDEP risk and decrease parental burden of seizure monitoring, but little is known about their added value in family homes. METHODS We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with parents of children with refractory epilepsy participating in the PROMISE trial (NCT03909984) to explore the value of seizure detection in the daily care of their child. Children were aged 4-16 years, treated at a tertiary epilepsy center, had at least one nocturnal major motor seizure per week, and used a wearable seizure detection device (NightWatch) for two months at home. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS Twenty three parents of nineteen children with refractory epilepsy were interviewed. All parents expressed their fear of missing a large seizure and the possible consequences of not intervening in time. Some parents felt the threat of child loss during every seizure, while others thought about it from time to time. The fear could fluctuate over time, mainly associated with fluctuations of seizure frequency. Most parents described how they developed a protective behavior, driven by this fear. The way parents handled the care of their child and experienced the burden of care influenced their perceptions on the added value of NightWatch. The experienced value of NightWatch depended on the amount of assurance it could offer to reduce their fear and the associated protective behavior as well as their resilience to handle the potential extra burden of care, due to false alarms or technical problems. CONCLUSION Healthcare professionals and device companies should be aware of parental protective behavior and the high parental burden of care and develop tailored strategies to optimize seizure detection device care.","van Westrhenen, Anouk; de Lange, Wendela F M; Hagebeuk, Eveline E O; Lazeron, Richard H C; Thijs, Roland D; Kars, Marijke C",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,296,20

Despite this large body of research, few studies have attempted to evaluate racial discrimination as a casual factor of worse health among racial minority groups. The current study utilized nationally representative data to estimate the causal effect of racial discrimination on cardiovascular disease (CVD), self-rated physical health (SRH), body mass index (BMI), depression disorder, and substance use disorder. In addition, we examined whether the effect of racial discrimination on health was moderated by socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, marital status, geographic location, and health insurance coverage). METHODS Data were from the combined National Survey of American Life and the National Latino and Asian American Study. We applied a propensity score weighting approach to estimate the differences between individuals who reported ever (N = 4358) or never (N = 1836) experiencing racial discrimination on a list of health outcomes (e.g., CVD, SRH, BMI, depression disorder, and substance use disorder). RESULTS Participants who reported ever experiencing racial discrimination were about 5 % higher CVD risk, had 0.12 points lower SRH, a 3 % higher probability of a depression disorder, and a 2 % higher probability of a substance use disorder. Moderation effects by race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and health insurance coverage were found. CONCLUSION Our study represents one of the first attempts to apply a propensity score weighting approach to causally link racial discrimination to worse health for racial minority individuals. This study adds to a larger body of research documenting the negative association between racial discrimination and health.","Chen, Shanting; Mallory, Allen B",Social science & medicine,296,5

The tools of economics can help us understand these problems. Because cancer in children is relatively infrequent and the role of pediatric radiotherapy (RT) is limited, there are a small number of cases of children requiring RT in the US compared to the number of radiation oncology trainees. This creates a paucity of necessary clinical training material. Proton RT, rather than photon RT, is being recommended in many situations when RT is indicated in children. Cost, however, is a significant concern. The arguments for and against proton RT continue and a consensus on this matter has not emerged.","Halperin, Edward C",Pediatric blood & cancer,296,16

The experience of moral distress in nurses might be magnified during the current Covid-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE To explore causes of moral distress in nurses caring for Covid-19 patients and identify strategies to enhance their moral resiliency. RESEARCH DESIGN A qualitative study using a qualitative content analysis of focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. We purposively sampled 31 nurses caring for Covid-19 patients in the acute care units within large academic medical systems in Maryland and New York City during April to June 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS We obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. RESULTS We identified themes and sub-themes representative of major causes of moral distress in nurses caring Covid-19 patients. These included (a) lack of knowledge and uncertainty regarding how to treat a new illness; (b) being overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of the Covid-19 illness; (c) fear of exposure to the virus leading to suboptimal care; (d) adopting a team model of nursing care that caused intra-professional tensions and miscommunications; (e) policies to reduce viral transmission (visitation policy and PPE policy) that prevented nurses to assume their caring role; (f) practicing within crisis standards of care; and (g) dealing with medical resource scarcity. Participants discussed their coping mechanisms and suggested future strategies. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION Our study affirms new causes of moral distress related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Institutions need to develop a supportive ethical climate that can restore nurses' moral resiliency. Such a climate should include non-hierarchical interdisciplinary spaces where all providers can meet together as moral peers to discuss their experiences.","Silverman, Henry J; Kheirbek, Raya Elfadel; Moscou-Jackson, Gyasi; Day, Jenni",Nursing ethics,296,6

RECENT FINDINGS The diagnosis of IE is challenging because of the highly variable clinical presentations, especially in the case of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). FDG PET/CT has been shown to play an important role for the diagnosis of PVE as a major Duke criterion. Whether FDG PET/CT could play a similar role in patients with suspected native valve endocarditis (NVE) is less well established. It is increasingly recognized that IE is a multisystem disorder, and identification of extra-cardiac manifestations on whole-body FDG PET/CT impacts management and prognosis of patients with IE. Finally, FDG PET/CT provides incremental prognostic value over other clinical and para-clinical parameters, enabling prediction of in-hospital mortality, IE recurrence, hospitalization, and new onset heart failure and embolic events. FDG PET/CT plays a key role in the investigation of patients with suspected IE, enabling detection of valvular infection and extra-cardiac manifestations of the infection which has important prognostic implications.","Pelletier-Galarneau, Matthieu; Abikhzer, Gad; Harel, Francois; Dilsizian, Vasken",Current cardiology reports,296,1

Previous studies and industry practice often treat turnover and retention as similar concepts, assuming that low turnover and high retention are synonymous. The study addressed the question of whether turnover and retention rates differ and if so, what do those differences mean for nursing home practice, policy, and research. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study examines facility-level factors associated with CNA retention and turnover rates using 2015 data from the Ohio Biennial Survey of Long-Term Care Facilities, Ohio Medicaid Cost Reports, Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Report, and the Area Health Resource File. Using bivariate tests and regression analysis, we compare rates and the factors associated with retention and turnover. RESULTS The mean facility annual retention rate was 64% and the mean annual turnover rate was 55%. As expected, there was a statistically significant and negative correlation between the rates (r = -0.26). However, some facilities had both high retention and high turnover and some had low rates for both measures. Not all the variables that are associated with turnover are also associated with retention. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS CNA retention is not simply the absence of CNA turnover. Given the differences, nursing homes may need to use strategies and policies designed to target a particular stability measure.","Kennedy, Katherine A; Applebaum, Robert; Bowblis, John R",The Gerontologist,296,19

METHODS All study subjects were diagnosed with incarcerated obturator hernia, preoperatively and TEP was performed as for TEP groin hernia repair. The incarcerated intestine was retracted into the peritoneal cavity with the hernia sac. The obturator foramen was then covered with a rectangular mesh (9 × 13 cm), which also covered the internal inguinal ring, Hesselbach's triangle, and the femoral ring. Non-ischemia of the incarcerated bowel was confirmed laparoscopically. In patients undergoing laparotomy, the obturator foramen was closed by continuous sutures, and no prosthesis was used. We recorded the length of hospital stay, operative time, amount of intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative complications. RESULTS Twenty-two patients underwent obturator hernia repair in our hospital between January 2000 and December 2012, of whom 10 were treated with laparotomy and the remaining 12 via TEP. Three patients undergoing TEP were converted to laparotomy. The operation time was significantly longer in the conversion group compared with either the laparotomy or the TEP groups. There was no difference between the laparotomy and TEP groups regarding intraoperative bleeding. Patients who underwent TEP without conversion had a significantly shorter hospital stay than those who underwent laparotomy or required conversion. CONCLUSIONS TEP provides a suitable approach for incarcerated obturator hernia repair, with favorable results regarding hospital stay. TEP is a feasible, minimally invasive technique for the repair of incarcerated obturator hernias.","Karashima, R; Kimura, M; Taura, N; Shimokawa, Y; Nishimura, T; Baba, H",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,296,1

Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed the records of 222 colorectal cancer patients with 330 CRLM who underwent RFA (268 tumors in 178 patients) or SBRT (62 tumors in 44 patients) between 2007 and 2014. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox models were used by adjusting with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Results The median follow-up duration was 30.5 months. The median tumor size was significantly smaller in the RFA group than in the SBRT group (1.5 cm vs 2.3 cm; p<0.001). In IPTW-adjusted analysis, difference in treatment modality was not associated with significant differences in 1-year and 3-year recurrence-free survival (35% vs 43%, 22% vs 23%; p=0.198), overall survival (96% vs 91%, 58% vs 56%; p=0.508), and freedom from local progression (FFLP; 90% vs 72%, 78% vs 60%; p=0.106). Significant interaction effect between the treatment modality and tumor size was observed for FFLP (p=0.001). In IPTW-adjusted subgroup analysis of patients with tumor size >2 cm, the SBRT group had a higher FFLP compared with the RFA group (HR, 0.153; p<0.001). Conclusion SBRT and RFA showed similar local control in the treatment of patients with CRLM. Tumor size was an independent prognostic factor for local control and SBRT may be preferred for larger tumors.","Yu, Jesang; Kim, Dong Hwan; Lee, Jungbok; Shin, Yong Moon; Kim, Jong Hoon; Yoon, Sang Min; Jung, Jinhong; Kim, Jin Cheon; Yu, Chang Sik; Lim, Seok-Byung; Park, In Ja; Kim, Tae Won; Hong, Yong Sang; Kim, Sun Young; Kim, Jeong Eun; Park, Jin-Hong; Kim, So Yeon",Cancer research and treatment,296,1

Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted relevant data such as TCM syndromes, and evaluated the quality of the literature according to the quality assessment tool recommended by the JBI Evidence-Based Health Care Center. Stata 14.0 software was used to perform a single-group Meta-analysis of TCM syndromes. RESULTS Thirteen cross-sectional studies and 5 case series studies were included, with a total of 2 139 patients. The analysis of the cross-sectional studies showed that the risk bias was higher in the identification, control and accuracy of the confounding factors, and the description of the reliability and validity of the outcome indicators was unclear. The analysis of the case series studies showed that the overall risk bias was small, but there was a lack of a comprehensive description of the assessment when selecting patients. A total of 33 TCM syndromes of COVID-19 were sorted out by combining the TCM syndromes with the same disease position and pathogenic syndrome in the included 18 literatures, and there were 10 types of TCM syndromes of which the number of occurrences was ≥ 50, the incidence rate was ≥ 10%, and had statistical significance [indicated that 95% confidence interval (95%CI) didn't cross the meaningless line 0], including cold dampness syndrome (469 cases, incidence rate was 28.2%, 95%CI was 5.9%-50.6%), damp heat syndrome (247 cases, incidence rate was 32.1%, 95%CI was 10.7%-53.6%), epidemic closed lung syndrome (228 cases, incidence rate was 28.9%, 95%CI was 12.5%-45.2%), pulmonary and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (202 cases, incidence rate was 22.1%, 95%CI was 9.5%-34.7%), dampness stagnation lung syndrome (180 cases, incidence rate was 41.2%, 95%CI was 18.4%-64.1%), dampness obstructing lung and spleen syndrome (81 cases, incidence rate was 56.3%, 95%CI was 48.1%-64.4%), evil heat syndrome lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%), dampness-blocking lung and stomach syndrome (70 cases, incidence rate was 13.4%, 95%CI was 10.4%-16.3%), heat poisoning lung closure syndrome (55 cases, incidence rate was 16.9%, 95%CI was 8.3%-25.5%), and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). Subgroup analysis showed that there were 6 types of TCM syndromes that met the above conditions in cross-sectional studies, namely cold and damp lung syndrome (200 cases, incidence rate was 20.9%, 95%CI was 12.6%-29.2%), damp heat syndrome (221 cases, incidence rate was 41.8%, 95%CI was 9.4%-74.2%), dampness-disease lung syndrome (120 cases, incidence rate was 41.4%, 95%CI was 8.6%-74.3%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (115 cases, incidence rate was 19.2%, 95%CI was 6.8%-31.7%), heat-fever lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%) and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). There were 3 kinds of TCM syndromes in case series studies, which were virus closed lung syndrome (133 cases, incidence rate was 44.0%, 95%CI was 24.5%-63.4%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (87 cases, incidence rate was 38.7%, 95%CI was 32.3%-45.0%), and dampness and depression lung syndrome (60 cases, incidence rate was 40.6%, 95%CI was 29.3%-52.0%).

The underlying pathogenesis of hepatitis B-related glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN) involves immune complexes, which can be isolated from kidney tissues. Clearance of HBV antigenemia improves renal impairment and proteinuria in HBV-GN patients.Areas covered: In this review, we present our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of HBV-GN. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs), and the main pharmaceutical treatment for hepatis B.Expert opinion: Currently, antiviral agents are the main HBV-GN therapeutic agents. Although no randomized controlled clinical trials have compared the efficacy of interferon (IFN) and NA, we suggest IFN treatment for pediatric patients (IFN-α in patients ≥1 year; pegIFN-α in patients ≥3 years) considering treatment duration and absence of resistance. Novel NAs have brought about promising treatment options involving high efficacy viral suppression and low resistance rates. NAs with a high barrier to resistance (e.g. entecavir) are recommended as first-line therapy of HBV-GN. Immunosuppression monotherapy, such as corticosteroids, is of little benefit and potentially harmful to HBV-GN patients due to the possibility of viral reactivation.","Liu, Yanjun; Shi, Cuicui; Fan, Jiangao; Wang, Baocan; Li, Guangming",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,296,15

To date there has not been a comparison between open and laparoscopic operations using the OS-MRS. OBJECTIVE To determine whether there are differences in mortality risk between open and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) using the OS-MRS. SETTING Three university-affiliated hospitals. METHODS The 90-day mortality of 2467 consecutive patients who had primary open (1574) or laparoscopic (893) RYGB performed by one surgeon was determined. Univariate and multivariate analysis using 5 OS-MRS risk factors including body mass index (BMI) gender, age>45, presence of hypertension and preoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk was performed in each group. Each patient was placed in 1 of 3 OS-MRS risk classes based on the number of risks: A (0-1), B (2-3), and C (4-5). RESULTS Preoperative BMI and DVT risk factors were significantly greater in the open group (OG). Preoperative age was significantly greater in the laparoscopic group (LG). There were significantly more class B and C patients in LG. Ninety-day mortality rates for OG and LG patients were 1.0% and .9%, respectively. Pulmonary embolism was the most common cause of death. All deaths in LG occurred during first 4 years of that experience. Mortality rate by class was A = .1%; B = 1.5%; C = 2.3%. The difference in mortality between class B and C patients was not significant. Univariate analysis in the OG indicated that BMI, age, gender, and DVT risk were significant predictors of mortality. In the LG only BMI and DVT were significant predictors of death. Presence of hypertension was not a significant predictor in either group. Multivariate analysis excluding hypertension found that age was predictive of mortality in the OG while BMI (P = .057) and gender (P = .065) approached statistical significance. Conversely, only BMI was predictive of mortality in the LG with age approaching significance (P = .058). In multivariate analysis DVT risk was not predictive of mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS There are significant differences in the predictive value of the OS-MRS between open and laparoscopic RYGB. Although laparoscopic patients were significantly older versus the open patients, age was not predictive of mortality after laparoscopic RYGB. BMI trended toward increased mortality risk in both groups. Changes in technique and protocol likely contributed toward no mortality during the last 6 years of our laparoscopic experience.","Brolin, Robert E; Cody, Ronald P; Marcella, Stephen W",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,296,1

Both PHARMASCREEN and CARS screening models successfully identified at-risk individuals despite differences in healthcare systems, infrastructure, and scope of practice. Comparing pharmacists' experiences of screening delivery in different health systems will help to understand key contextual factors that affect future implementation. OBJECTIVE To explore and compare the views and experiences of pharmacists participating in the UAE PHARMACSCREEN trial, with those of community pharmacists who participated in the Australian CARS trial. METHODS In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with pharmacists who delivered the screening programs in Australia (n = 10) and UAE (n = 12) to explore their views and experiences. The interview guide was similar in both studies to ensure consistency and comparability of collected data. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed. RESULTS Two common themes emerged: pharmacists' experiences with the screening program, and barriers and facilitators to service delivery. Both groups held very positive views about the screening intervention, particularly referencing the professional satisfaction it generated and broad participant satisfaction with pharmacy-based screening. Despite country and health system differences, pharmacists reported many similar barriers (e.g., staffing levels, pharmacy coordination) and enablers (e.g., implementation support, adequate staffing, point-of-care tests, no cost to patient) to implementation. The context for screening delivery emerged as a key theme for UAE interviews only, where issues such as local population needs, regulatory factors, pharmacist roles and expectations, and training needs were quite prominent. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacists' positive experiences with the screening programs is a testimony to the strong emerging evidence supporting pharmacists-delivered screening. Despite differences in health care systems, similar enablers and barriers were identified. The adaptation and successful implementation of international screening models requires a country-specific adaptation process.","Alzubaidi, Hamzah; Namara, Kevin Mc; Saidawi, Ward; Hasan, Sanah; Krass, Ines",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,296,1

This was a retrospective study of 62 individuals < 18 years old who had nasopharyngeal aspirates collected for virus identification in a tertiary university hospital in south Brazil between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2014. All 62 nasopharingeal aspirates were analyzed using both assay methods. The main outcome to be measured was the difference in the proportion of test samples returning a positive virus detection result between the IF and the RT-PCR. The McNemar test was used for data analysis and the results showed that the RT-PCR and the IF methods produced 55 (88.7%) and 17 (27.4%) virus-positive samples, respectively (p < 0.001). The most prevalent virus was rhinovirus (45.5% of the RT-PCR positive samples). The RT-PCR method increased the detection rates of human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and parainfluenza 3 virus. The RT-PCR and IF had concordant results in 19 samples (30.6%) and discordant results in 43 samples (69.4%). It is concluded that in comparison to the Oxoid IMAGEN® IF method, the CLART® PneumoVir multiplex RT-PCR method had a greater potential to contribute to the clinical management of hospitalized children due its greater ability in detecting respiratory viruses than the IF method.","Ferreira, Isabel Cristina Schutz; Alegretti, Ana Paula; De Paris, Fernanda; Paiva, Rodrigo Minuto; Chakr, Valentina Coutinho Baldoto Gava",Journal of virological methods,296,28
90849,90849,90849,Seeking inspiration at the end of a turbulent year.,14.128387,3.5228665,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND The optimal long-term antithrombotic regimen for patients after successful catheter-based atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is not well defined. Presently, practice variation exists, and the benefits of oral anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy across the entire spectrum of stroke risk profile remain undefined in the postablation population. To date, there are no randomized trials to inform clinicians on this therapeutic question. OBJECTIVE The objective was to assess whether rivaroxaban is superior to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in reducing the risk of clinically overt stroke, systemic embolism, or covert stroke among patients without apparent recurrent atrial arrhythmias for at least 1 year after their most recent AF ablation procedure. METHODS/DESIGN A prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial with blinded assessment of outcomes is under way (NCT02168829). Atrial fibrillation patients with at least 1 stroke risk factor (as defined by the CHA2DS2-VASc score) and without known atrial arrhythmia recurrences for at least 12 months after ablation are randomized to rivaroxaban 15 mg or ASA 75-160 mg daily. The primary outcome is a composite of clinically overt stroke, systemic embolism, and covert stroke based on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes include major bleeding outcomes, intracranial hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, neuropsychological testing, quality of life, and an economic analysis. Subjects will be followed for 3 years. The estimated overall sample size is 1,572 subjects (786 per arm). DISCUSSION The OCEAN trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial evaluating 2 antithrombotic treatment strategies for patients with risk factors for stroke after apparently successful AF ablation. We hypothesize that rivaroxaban will reduce the occurrence of clinically overt stroke, systemic embolism, and covert stroke when compared with ASA alone.","Verma, Atul; Ha, Andrew C T; Kirchhof, Paulus; Hindricks, Gerhard; Healey, Jeff S; Hill, Michael D; Sharma, Mukul; Wyse, D George; Champagne, Jean; Essebag, Vidal; Wells, George; Gupta, Dhiraj; Heidbuchel, Hein; Sanders, Prashanthan; Birnie, David H",American heart journal,296,16

The small sample and limited genomic characterizations have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3' end. ORF8 also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human viruses. The evolutionary history of HCoV-229E likely shares important characteristics with that of the recently emerged highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.","Corman, Victor Max; Baldwin, Heather J; Tateno, Adriana Fumie; Zerbinati, Rodrigo Melim; Annan, Augustina; Owusu, Michael; Nkrumah, Evans Ewald; Maganga, Gael Darren; Oppong, Samuel; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Vallo, Peter; da Silva Filho, Luiz Vicente Ribeiro Ferreira; Leroy, Eric M; Thiel, Volker; van der Hoek, Lia; Poon, Leo L M; Tschapka, Marco; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",Journal of virology,296,31

Using a smartphone, which emits a 453 nm blue light, can worsen the quality of sleep. AIMS To study the skin changes caused by poor sleep quality induced by smartphone usage. METHODS The participants were 22 Korean women aged 20-39 years, with no sleep problems and a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of <5. The participants used a smartphone for 2 h before normal sleep hours. The measurement points were as follows: after a good sleep (D0), after bad sleep day 1 (D1), after bad sleep day 3 (D3), and after bad sleep day 7 (D7). The sleep time, wake-up time, shallow sleep rate, and sleeping time duration were recorded using a smartwatch. RESULTS The quality of their sleep deteriorated. The average time of falling asleep extended to 2 a.m., which was about 34 min later. Additionally, their skin moisture content decreased, and sebum content increased. Skin desquamation was increased, and skin gloss, transparency, and elasticity decreased mainly on the skin surface. CONCLUSIONS Sleep quality decreases with smartphone usage among people who do not usually use their smartphones before going to sleep and do not have any sleep problems. The results showed significant changes in skin optics and surface properties when the quality of sleep was degraded for 7 days.","Jang, Sue Im; Jung, Yuchul; Lee, Myeongryeol; Kim, Jinsol; Kim, Beom Joon; Suh, Byung-Fhy; Kim, Eunjoo",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,296,1

However, some preparations of (99m)Tc-sestamibi contain excess impurities (>6%). To understand the origin of these impurities, we investigated the effect of sodium nitrate on the RCP of sestamibi preparations by testing eluates from 3 commercially available (99m)Tc generators. METHODS The sestamibi kits (Stamicis) were reconstituted with (99m)Tc eluate from nitrate-containing wet-column (NCWC), nitrate-free wet-column (NFWC), and nitrate-free dry-column (NFDC) generators. Sodium nitrate was 0.05 mg/mL in eluates from the NCWC generators. The RCP was determined using aluminum oxide sheets as the stationary phase and absolute ethanol as the mobile phase. Succimer, tetrofosmin, oxidronate, exametazine, albumin nanocolloid, and soluble albumin were also tested for their RCP values with eluates from the 3 different (99m)Tc generators. RESULTS The RCP assessment of (99m)Tc-sestamibi was performed on 127 Stamicis preparations. Significantly lower RCP values were found for Stamicis kits prepared with the NCWC generator than for Stamicis prepared with the NFWC (P < 0.0001) and NFDC (P < 0.0001) generators. The number of Stamicis preparations with an RCP under 94% was greater with the NCWC generator (32 of 53 kits) than with the NFDC (2 of 51 kits) or NFWC (0 of 23 kits) generator. Furthermore, the addition of a 0.05 mg/mL concentration of nitrate in NFWC generator eluates significantly decreased the RCP of the Stamicis preparation. In the absence of nitrate in (99m)Tc eluate, no difference was observed between the RCP values of Stamicis kits prepared with the NFWC and NFDC generators. The (99m)Tc impurities generated by nitrates did not modify the quality of myocardial imaging (normal heart-to-lung ratio, 2.2), probably because these impurities are not in the heart field of view. No other tested (99m)Tc-radiopharmaceutical interfered with nitrates. CONCLUSION We recommend using nitrate-free generator eluates in (99m)Tc-sestamibi preparations to improve the product quality and prevent unnecessary exposure of the patient to radiation.","Métayé, Thierry; Rosenberg, Thierry; Guilhot, Joëlle; Bouin-Pineau, Marie-Hélène; Perdrisot, Rémy",Journal of nuclear medicine technology,296,31

However, the screening methodologies, including docking, often fails to identify the most effective compound, which could be a ligand for the target protein. To solve that, here we have integrated meta-dynamics, an enhanced sampling molecular simulation method, with all-atom molecular dynamics to determine a specific compound that could target the main protease of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). This combined computational approach uses the enhanced sampling to explore the free energy surface associated with the protein's binding site (including the ligand) in an explicit solvent. We have implemented this method to find new chemical entities that exhibit high specificity of binding to the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) present in the SARS-CoV-2 and segregated to the most strongly bound ligands based on free energy and scoring functions (defined and implemented) from a set of 17 ligands which were prescreened for synthesizability and druggability. Additionally, we have compared these 17 ligands' affinities against controls, N3 and 13b α-ketoamide inhibitors, for which experimental crystal structures are available. Based on our results and analysis from the combined molecular simulation approach, we could identify the best compound which could be further taken as a potential candidate for experimental validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Braided intracranial stents, including flow diverters (FDs) and low-profile braided intracranial stents (LPBSs) may provide additional advantages, due to their flow-diverting properties. Areas covered: The use of FDs in off-label, distal intracranial locations has been increasing with promising outcomes and has given rise to the LPBS, which has less flow-diverting properties, allowing for easier use in distal branching sites through 0.017' microcatheters. These devices have shifted the interest from the aneurysm's sac filling to the regional remodeling through the effect of flow diversion. The purpose of this article is to discuss their functionality, safety, performance, and perspectives through a critical review of important publications of the last 11.5 years (January 2007 to July 2018) on the use of these devices at and beyond the circle of Willis. Expert opinion: FDs modify the regional anatomy thus careful pre-procedural consideration of the regional hemodynamic equilibrium is mandatory, as well as effective antiplatelet regimen. LPBSs provide moderate flow-diversion effect, which may be an advantage, especially for very distal and small aneurysms.","Iosif, Christina; Biondi, Alessandra",Expert review of medical devices,296,17

However, there are currently few publications that provide information on this issue. We pooled the information available on the safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis, with and without disease-modifying therapy. DEVELOPMENT The study consisted in a literature search focused on the types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the current status of their approval, and the data available on the safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis, including the new COVID-19 vaccines. Based on this search, the document has been designed taking into account current evidence and expert recommendations. There are no data on the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, evidence does exist to suggest that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are as safe in these patients as in other individuals. Some therapies with immunosuppressants might reduce the effectiveness of these vaccines and require the scheduling of their administration, preferably before the start of treatment if possible. CONCLUSION The data available make it possible to recommend mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis. In patients on fingolimod, cladribine, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab, vaccination prior to the initiation of medication administration would be recommendable whenever possible.","Costa Frossard-França, L; García-Domínguez, J M; Moreno-Torres, I; Fortún, J; Villar, L M; Meca-Lallana, V",Revista de neurologia,296,31

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of flexion of the ICA on the morphology of aneurysms and outcome of endovascular treatment. Between 2003 and 2018, we treated 643 cases of unruptured paraclinoid aneurysms with endovascular therapy in our institution. Of those cases, aneurysms projecting laterally on preoperative angiography were defined as LPA. The degree of bending of the ICA (ICA angle) was measured and statistically analyzed in relation to the aneurysm characteristics and the occlusion status after treatment. In all, 43 aneurysms were identified. ICA angle was positively correlated with the maximum dome size of the aneurysm (P <0.01) and the aspect ratio (P <0.01), and negatively correlated with the volume coil embolization ratio (P <0.01). Complete occlusion (CO) was achieved in 23 cases (53.5%) immediately after treatment, and in 35 cases (81.4%) at follow-up. The mean ICA angle in the incomplete occlusion group was significantly larger than in the CO group (P = 0.01). Larger ICA angle resulted in recurrence, whereas smaller ICA angle was more likely to obtain progressive thrombosis (P = 0.02). Endovascular treatment for LPA was safe and effective. The degree of flexion of the ICA may contribute to the level of hemodynamic stress on the aneurysm, its morphology, and the embolization effect.","Sugiyama, Natsuki; Fujii, Takashi; Yatomi, Kenji; Teranishi, Kosuke; Oishi, Hidenori; Arai, Hajime",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,296,26

METHODS The present international multicenter cross-sectional study performed by the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression (GSRD) investigated socio-demographic and clinical patterns of relationship status in a real-world sample of 1410 adult in- and outpatients with MDD as primary diagnosis. RESULTS While 49.9% of all MDD patients were partnered, 25.4% were separated, and 24.8% were single. Single relationship status was linked to younger mean age, earlier mean age of onset, and current suicidal risk. Being separated was related to older mean age, unemployment, greater symptom severity, current suicidal risk, and add-on treatment strategies. Partnered relationship status was associated with less frequent current suicidal risk. LIMITATIONS The retrospective assessment of treatment response that was exclusively based on psychopharmacotherapeutic strategies should be critically considered and weighed while interpreting the present results providing novel insights into the complex interaction of relationship status with the clinical phenotype of MDD. CONCLUSIONS Although MDD patients living in relationships do not seem to be omitted from the evolution of MDD, they may be spared from chronicity and suicidality. Hence, being aware of the current relationship status might support clinicians in the diagnostic and therapeutic process towards optimized management of such challenging clinical phenomena and their negative consequences.","Bartova, Lucie; Dold, Markus; Fugger, Gernot; Kautzky, Alexander; Mitschek, Marleen Margret Mignon; Weidenauer, Ana; Handschuh, Patricia Anna; Frey, Richard; Mandelli, Laura; Zohar, Joseph; Mendlewicz, Julien; Souery, Daniel; Montgomery, Stuart; Fabbri, Chiara; Serretti, Alessandro; Kasper, Siegfried",Journal of affective disorders,296,1

Few randomized trials have compared disease-free survival outcomes for surgical approaches. Objective To investigate whether total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) is equivalent to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) in women with treatment-naive endometrial cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants The Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium (LACE) trial was a multinational, randomized equivalence trial conducted between October 7, 2005, and June 30, 2010, in which 27 surgeons from 20 tertiary gynecological cancer centers in Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong randomized 760 women with stage I endometrioid endometrial cancer to either TLH or TAH. Follow-up ended on March 3, 2016. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to undergo TAH (n = 353) or TLH (n = 407). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was disease-free survival, which was measured as the interval between surgery and the date of first recurrence, including disease progression or the development of a new primary cancer or death assessed at 4.5 years after randomization. The prespecified equivalence margin was 7% or less. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of endometrial cancer and overall survival. Results Patients were followed up for a median of 4.5 years. Of 760 patients who were randomized (mean age, 63 years), 679 (89%) completed the trial. At 4.5 years of follow-up, disease-free survival was 81.3% in the TAH group and 81.6% in the TLH group. The disease-free survival rate difference was 0.3% (favoring TLH; 95% CI, -5.5% to 6.1%; P = .007), meeting criteria for equivalence. There was no statistically significant between-group difference in recurrence of endometrial cancer (28/353 in TAH group [7.9%] vs 33/407 in TLH group [8.1%]; risk difference, 0.2% [95% CI, -3.7% to 4.0%]; P = .93) or in overall survival (24/353 in TAH group [6.8%] vs 30/407 in TLH group [7.4%]; risk difference, 0.6% [95% CI, -3.0% to 4.2%]; P = .76). Conclusions and Relevance Among women with stage I endometrial cancer, the use of total abdominal hysterectomy compared with total laparoscopic hysterectomy resulted in equivalent disease-free survival at 4.5 years and no difference in overall survival. These findings support the use of laparoscopic hysterectomy for women with stage I endometrial cancer.

OBJECTIVES This article presents methodological guidelines for just-in-time qualitative research based on our current, pandemic-relevant research. METHODS The processes followed while conducting two longitudinal, online qualitative studies addressing the lived experience and response to the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Methodological challenges faced were then identified, and specific design and implementation guidelines were developed. The ways in which these guidelines can be applied to conduct just-in-time research during the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises were further delineated using examples from our pandemic-relevant research. RESULTS Six guidelines were identified: (a) capitalize on fast track review and reporting processes; (b) prioritize accessibility during sample specification and selection; (c) optimize recruitment and retention strategies; (d) maximize current and future data use through strategic research design; (e) tailor data collection to participants' characteristics, preferences, and priorities; and (f) incorporate timeline mapping of personal and contemporaneous phenomena. DISCUSSION Public health measures taken to slow disease spread during the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises may slow the pace of research and make its implementation all the more challenging. However, just-in-time qualitative research advances our understanding of the human experience and response to the COVID-19 and major public health crises. It also complements existing behavioral theory and research. The guidelines presented may assist researchers to initiate necessary qualitative research more rapidly, with fewer logistic challenges, and with methodological rigor. They may also help expand research on groups experiencing collateral effects of the pandemic and major public health crisis. Lastly, the guidelines may support the development of more robust data for alternate analysis at a later date.","Jairath, Nalini N; Benetato, Bonnie B; O'Brien, Sandra L; Griffin Agazio, Janice B",Nursing research,296,24

AREAS COVERED The results of nocebo effects in RCTs placebo groups, measured in terms of adverse events (AEs) and dropouts, will be presented as an explicative framework for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are the only RCTs routinely conducted during the pandemic. Information about efficacy and safety of different vaccines, represent a fertile ground for nocebo phenomena. Individual and contextual factors will be emphasized in order to understand the presence of a refusal of immunization associated with a specific vaccine considered less effective and safe. Critical aspects and some guidelines will be presented in order to counteract nocebo effects and to improve adherence to drug treatments and the vaccination campaign. EXPERT OPINION The nocebo effect could explain the presence of a strong resistance in European countries to immunization with a vaccine perceived as less effective, compared to others. Increased awareness of the nocebo effect would be relevant as it could lead to a greater participation in the vaccination campaign and in protecting individuals against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Amanzio, Martina; Cipriani, Giuseppina Elena; Bartoli, And Massimo",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,296,16

Many regions have struggled to adapt to disruptions to health care practice and use systems that effectively manage the demand for services. METHODS This was a cohort study using electronic health records at a health care system in northeast Ohio that examined the effectiveness of the first 5 weeks of a 24/7 physician-staffed COVID-19 hotline including social care referrals for patients required to self-isolate. We describe clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics (age, sex race/ethnicity, smoking status, insurance status), and visit disposition. We use logistic regression to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, visit disposition and subsequent emergency department use, hospitalization, and SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing. PARTICIPANTS In 5 weeks, 10,112 patients called the hotline (callers). Of these, 4213 (42%) were referred for a physician telehealth visit (telehealth patients). Mean age of callers was 42 years; 67% were female, 51% white, and 46% were on Medicaid/uninsured. RESULTS Common caller concerns included cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Most telehealth patients (79%) were advised to self-isolate at home, 14% were determined to be unlikely to have COVID-19, 3% were advised to seek emergency care, and 4% had miscellaneous other dispositions. A total of 287 patients (7%) had a subsequent emergency department visit, and 44 (1%) were hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the callers, 482 (5%) had a COVID-19 test reported, with 69 (14%) testing positive. Among patients advised to stay at home, 83% had no further face-to-face visits. In multivariable results, only a physician recommendation to seek emergency care was associated with emergency department use (odds ratio = 4.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.37-16.39, P = .014). Only older age was associated with having a positive test result. Patients with social needs and interest in receiving help were offered services to meet their needs including food deliveries (n = 92), behavioral health telephone visits (n = 49), and faith-based comfort calls from pastoral care personnel (n = 37). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Robust, physician-directed telehealth services can meet a wide range of clinical and social needs during the acute phase of a pandemic, conserving scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and testing supplies and preventing the spread of infections to patients and health care workers.","Margolius, David; Hennekes, Mary; Yao, Jimmy; Einstadter, Douglas; Gunzler, Douglas; Chehade, Nabil; Sehgal, Ashwini R; Tarabichi, Yasir; Perzynski, Adam T",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,296,1

METHODS Twenty-five patients with ELI (20 men, five women; mean age 80 years; range, 64-96 years) underwent embolization of abdominal ELI (23 proximal, 2 distal endoleaks) after EVAR. All patients were unsuitable for standard endovascular methods for treatment of ELI. The average aneurysm sac size before embolization was 8.2 cm (range, 5.3-12.9 cm). The average time between EVAR and endoleak diagnosis was 685 days (range, 1-4220 days) and from endoleak diagnosis to embolization was 27 days (range, 2-94 days). Onyx (ev3 Endovascular, Inc, Plymouth, Minn) alone or with detachable coils was used for embolization. RESULTS A total of 27 embolization procedures were performed, with two patients having undergone a repeat procedure. Onyx alone was used in 16 cases and Onyx and coils were used in 11. Immediate technical success with complete isolation of the endoleak on completion angiography was achieved in all procedures. Six procedural complications occurred: three puncture site hematomas and three cases of non-target Onyx embolization. None of the complications had long term sequelae. During the follow-up period (average, 311 days; range, 1-1357 days), seven patients (28%) developed endoleak recurrence, and two underwent a second embolization procedure. Of these, one has had no further endoleak recurrence, but the other developed a recurrent endoleak and died of sac rupture. Two of the other five cases of endoleak recurrence were successfully managed by other procedures, one had a persistent endoleak despite aortic cuff placement, and the other two were deemed unsuitable for further intervention. Three of the four patients with persistent endoleaks died of sac rupture. At the average follow-up time of 311 days, freedom from endoleak recurrence was 80%, and freedom from sac growth was 85%. CONCLUSIONS Transcatheter embolization of ELI offers a safe, feasible, and sustainable treatment option for patients who are unsuitable for standard methods of ELI treatment. Additional coil embolization before Onyx injection may result in better outcome.","Ameli-Renani, Seyed; Pavlidis, Vyzantios; Morgan, Robert A",Journal of vascular surgery,296,31

The rapid shift to telehealth necessitated by the pandemic has also created a need for socially distanced education and precepting. This article presents teleprecepting as a modality for clinical opportunities and connecting students to previously limited experiences, such as training in small specialties, in rural areas, and with interdisciplinary teams. Precepting NP students using telehealth follows similar principles as in-person teaching, but some modifications and additional considerations are needed to transition to the virtual environment. At a time when many NPs have swiftly adapted to telehealth in practice, this article will offer a brief ""how-to"" for teleprecepting. Prior to COVID-19, teleprecepting was piloted with less than 2% of NP students in the school's pilot teleprecepting project. Seven months after the initial surge of cases and restrictions, 72% of students (n = 151) in the family nurse practitioner, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, and pediatric nurse practitioner specialties had transitioned to teleprecepting. This project was implemented rapidly during the pandemic, and thus, evaluations comparing competency outcomes and experiences of students and preceptors are still in process. Additionally, feasibility of this educational model may change as telehealth regulations continue to evolve. COVID-19 poses challenges for both patient care and clinical training of NP students across specialties. With some adaptation, clinical placements can be transitioned to the virtual environment of telehealth. Future studies should examine student competencies based on teleprecepting experiences and preceptor training to support teleprecepting roles.","Johnson, Deborah; Gatewood, Elizabeth; Ling, Amanda; Kuo, Angel Chen",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,296,23

Currently no consensus exists regarding the ideal location for this unique aesthetic unit of the abdomen. To their interest, the authors noted that the intraoperative distance from the pubic symphysis to midumbilical stalk measured 15 cm for several consecutive patients. They believe the umbilicopubic distance is another clinically useful and reliable anatomic landmark for the plastic surgeon relocating the umbilicus during an abdominoplasty. METHODS A retrospective chart review analysis was performed for 40 consecutive patients who underwent abdominoplasty or panniculectomy between July 2009 and May 2010 at the authors' institution. The intraoperative measurement of the umbilicopubic distance (pubic symphysis to midumbilical stalk) was available for 32 of these patients. The average umbilicopubic distance was calculated. Two separate graphs were generated to evaluate the relationship of the umbilicopubic distance to the patients' height and body mass index (BMI). The data were saved and analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel. RESULTS In the study population, the average intraoperative umbilicopubic distance was found to be 15.05 cm. The results validate the mean umbilicopubic distance of 15.04 cm reported by Dubou and colleagues in 1978. For patients whose stature fell between 145 and 178 cm, the umbilicopubic distance was consistently 15 cm. A tendency toward a higher umbilicus was noted as the patients became taller. The BMI did not seem to influence the location of the umbilicus as measured intraoperatively. CONCLUSION Translocation of the umbilicus to 15 cm from the pubic symphysis in patients with a stature of 145-178 cm is another clinically useful, safe, and expeditious method for relocation of the umbilicus during an abdominoplasty.","Rodriguez-Feliz, J R; Makhijani, Sumeet; Przybyla, Adrian; Hill, David; Chao, Jerome",Aesthetic plastic surgery,296,29

Some surgeons prefer to use large circular staplers during suturing to minimize risks for anastomotic stricture and gastric stasis after surgery. The effect of stapler size on anastomotic complications has not been validated. METHODS This study was conducted with 1,031 patients who underwent gastrectomy and Billroth I reconstruction at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, between January 2007 and October 2008. Patients were assigned to group A (384 patients) or group B (647 patients) depending on the size of the circular stapler that the surgeon selected for mechanical anastomosis. A 25 mm circular stapler was used for patients in group A, and a 28 or 29 mm circular stapler was used for patients in group B. Postoperative complications were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The incidence of complications (e.g., gastric stasis, anastomotic stricture, and bleeding) did not differ significantly between groups. Age greater than 60 years was the only significant risk factor for anastomotic complications identified in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS Stapler size was unrelated to complications, such as stricture and gastric stasis. Age was the only significant risk factor for anastomotic complications after gastroduodenostomy.","Kim, Dae Hoon; Oh, Cheong Ah; Oh, Seung Jong; Choi, Min Gew; Noh, Jae Hyung; Sohn, Tae Sung; Bae, Jae Moon; Kim, Sung",World journal of surgery,296,24

Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies.","Dhar, Debojyoti; Mohanty, Abhishek",Virus research,296,1

To examine SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) epidemiology and risk factors among Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff in the United States.Methods. We calculated the SARS-CoV-2 case rate among 37 640 BOP staff from March 12 to June 17, 2020, using payroll and COVID-19-specific data. We compared occupational factors among staff with and without known SARS-CoV-2 using multiple logistic regression, controlling for demographic characteristics. We calculated relative risk among staff in stand-alone institutions versus complexes (> 1 institution).Results. SARS-CoV-2 was reported by 665 staff across 59.8% of institutions, a case rate of 1766.6 per 100 000. Working in dorm-style housing and in detention centers were strong risk factors, whereas cell-based housing was protective; these effects were erased in complexes. Occupational category was not associated with SARS-CoV-2.Conclusions. SARS-CoV-2 infection was more likely among staff working in institutions where physical distancing and limiting exposure to a consistent set of staff and inmates are challenging.Public Health Implications. Mitigation strategies-including augmented staff testing, entry and exit testing among inmates, limiting staff interactions across complexes, and increasing physical distancing by reducing occupancy in dorm-style housing-may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections among correctional staff.

However, their success is restricted and there is a need to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we show that natural killer cell granule protein 7 (NKG7) is a regulator of lymphocyte granule exocytosis and downstream inflammation in a broad range of diseases. NKG7 expressed by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells played key roles in promoting inflammation during visceral leishmaniasis and malaria-two important parasitic diseases. Additionally, NKG7 expressed by natural killer cells was critical for controlling cancer initiation, growth and metastasis. NKG7 function in natural killer and CD8+ T cells was linked with their ability to regulate the translocation of CD107a to the cell surface and kill cellular targets, while NKG7 also had a major impact on CD4+ T cell activation following infection. Thus, we report a novel therapeutic target expressed on a range of immune cells with functions in different immune responses.","Ng, Susanna S; De Labastida Rivera, Fabian; Yan, Juming; Corvino, Dillon; Das, Indrajit; Zhang, Ping; Kuns, Rachel; Chauhan, Shashi Bhushan; Hou, Jiajie; Li, Xian-Yang; Frame, Teija C M; McEnroe, Benjamin A; Moore, Eilish; Na, Jinrui; Engel, Jessica A; Soon, Megan S F; Singh, Bhawana; Kueh, Andrew J; Herold, Marco J; Montes de Oca, Marcela; Singh, Siddharth Sankar; Bunn, Patrick T; Aguilera, Amy Roman; Casey, Mika; Braun, Matthias; Ghazanfari, Nazanin; Wani, Shivangi; Wang, Yulin; Amante, Fiona H; Edwards, Chelsea L; Haque, Ashraful; Dougall, William C; Singh, Om Prakash; Baxter, Alan G; Teng, Michele W L; Loukas, Alex; Daly, Norelle L; Cloonan, Nicole; Degli-Esposti, Mariapia A; Uzonna, Jude; Heath, William R; Bald, Tobias; Tey, Siok-Keen; Nakamura, Kyohei; Hill, Geoffrey R; Kumar, Rajiv; Sundar, Shyam; Smyth, Mark J; Engwerda, Christian R",Nature immunology,296,31

At present, whether COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function in patients with COVID-19. METHODS Clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed for 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without a history of thyroid disease who underwent thyroid function testing during their course of COVID-19 infection and after recovery. They were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, between January and March 2020. Healthy participants who underwent routine physical checkups and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients with a similar degree of severity during the same period were included in the study as the control group. Thyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were analyzed and compared between the COVID-19 and control groups. RESULTS TSH lower than the normal range was present in 56% (28/50) of the patients with COVID-19. The levels of TSH and serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) of the patients with COVID-19 were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The more severe the COVID-19, the lower the TSH and TT3 levels were, with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The degree of the decreases in TSH and TT3 levels was positive correlated with the severity of the disease. The total thyroxine (TT4) level of the patients with COVID-19 was not significantly different from the control group. All the patients did not receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy. After recovery, no significant differences in TSH, TT3, TT4, free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were found between the COVID-19 and control groups. CONCLUSIONS The changes in serum TSH and TT3 may be important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19.","Chen, Min; Zhou, Weibin; Xu, Weiwei",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,296,31

Additionally, we elucidate variables associated with CARV, management strategies utilized, and impact on early and late outcomes. METHODS This was a retrospective study among patients transplanted between 2012-15 (n=255, mean age 55.6 ±13.5 yrs, M: F 152:103). The diagnosis of CARV was based on the multiplex PCR on nasopharyngeal swab samples. Baseline characteristics, post-transplant variables, and outcomes were compared among patients with and without CARV. RESULTS Eighty CARV infections developed among a quarter of the study group (n=62, 24.3%). Rhinovirus/Enterovirus was the most commonly isolated CARV (n=24) followed by Coronavirus (n=17) and RSV (n=9). A significant proportion of episodes (43.8%) required hospitalization. The use of nasal corticosteroids and left single LT were independently associated with an increased risk of CARV. CARV infections did not impact the lung functions during the first year or the CLAD free survival at three years. CONCLUSIONS There is a significant burden of CARV infections during the first year after LT. The use of nasal corticosteroids may increase the risk of CARV infection. CARV infections did not impact outcomes.","Mahan, Luke D; Kanade, Rohan; Mohanka, Manish R; Bollineni, Srinivas; Joerns, John; Kaza, Vaidehi; Torres, Fernando; La Hoz, Ricardo M; Banga, Amit",Clinical transplantation,296,31

A virtual pharmacy simulation, MyDispense, developed by the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Monash University, enables students to practice the skills of a professional pharmacist, from novice to highly advanced, in a safe virtual environment that is web-based and highly accessible. The free online simulation allows students to undertake scenarios where patients can present with prescription or self-care requirements, and are also challenged with validation tasks requiring them to check the work of virtual colleagues for accuracy, legality, and medicine safety. COMMENTARY This commentary describes the use of a virtual simulation, MyDispense, in enhancing didactic instruction, complementing experiential education, and the challenges of the virtual simulation to pharmacy educators. MyDispense is now deployed to 186 schools of pharmacy across 34 countries to over 25,000 students worldwide who have completed over 963,000 exercises globally. IMPLICATIONS The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (aka COVID-19) pandemic presents challenges to pharmacy education requiring many educators to switch to remote online learning. Simulation programs, such as MyDispense, help to replicate aspects of pharmacy practice and can be used creatively to meet course needs. The use of MyDispense is an excellent example of pharmacy educators collaborating globally and learning from each other to improve student learning.","Mak, Vivienne; Fitzgerald, Jill; Holle, Lisa; Vordenberg, Sarah E; Kebodeaux, Clark",Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning,296,31

Hence, the need for a solid evidence base for nursing practice and a clear direction for clinical nursing research are paramount. Therefore, a Delphi survey was conducted to determine clinical (research focused on patient outcomes) nursing and midwifery priorities for research within this region. DESIGN A Delphi survey, using iterative rounds of an online survey of regional clinical nursing and midwifery research experts, was conducted between January and April 2016. METHODS Consensus was determined by percentage agreement on level of priority for topics as determined by participants. Additionally, results were compared between countries within the region by income and mortality levels using Kendall's tau. FINDINGS Critical research topics were focused on public/community/primary care as well as emergency preparedness for disasters, and these priorities are well aligned with gaps in the literature for this region. There were statistically significant differences between priority level and country mortality group for geriatrics, self-management of disease, and sexually transmitted infections. CONCLUSIONS Critical research priorities should focus on population-based health topics. Between-country differences should be analyzed further. A clinical research database for the region may help improve research access for nurses and midwives. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Practicing nurses and midwives lack extensive evidence (including culturally relevant evidence) on which to practice. Increasing research in areas identified in this survey may improve patient outcomes and quality of care regionally.","Sun, Carolyn; Dohrn, Jennifer; Oweis, Arwa; Huijer, Huda Abu-Saad; Abu-Moghli, Fathieh; Dawani, Hania; Ghazi, Cheherezade; Larson, Elaine",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,296,1

AIM To develop evidence-based approaches to medical rehabilitation for patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection. RESULTS The clinical effects and suggested mechanisms of action of rehabilitation technologies in patients with pneumonia, including those associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection, are considered in Detail. The most studied of the physical methods that have a proven effect are physical exercises, breathing exercises, the complex effect of factors of resort therapy, hydrotherapy, which affect the main clinical manifestations of the underlying disease, astheno-neurotic syndrome and increasing immunity. Clinical recommendations for medical rehabilitation are proposed and its promising methods are considered. CONCLUSION Regular generalization and analysis of high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate various physical methods of treatment of patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection is Necessary, which serve as a basis for the development of future valid clinical recommendations.

Astrocytes are a key component of cerebral NVC, but their role in spinal NVC is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine whether inhibition of astrocyte metabolism by fluorocitrate alters spinal NVC. In 14 rats, local field potential (LFP) and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) were recorded simultaneously in the lumbosacral enlargement during noxious stimulation of the sciatic nerve before and after a local administration of fluorocitrate (N = 7) or saline (N = 7). Fluorocitrate significantly reduced SCBF responses (p < 0.001) but not LFP amplitude (p = 0.22) compared with saline. Accordingly, NVC was altered by fluorocitrate compared with saline (p < 0.01). These results support the role of astrocytes in spinal NVC and have implications for spinal cord imaging with fMRI for conditions in which astrocyte metabolism may be altered.","Paquette, Thierry; Piché, Mathieu; Leblond, Hugues",The journal of physiological sciences : JPS,296,1

In their GTP-bound form, Arf proteins recruit a specific set of protein effectors to the membrane surface. These effectors function in vesicle formation and tethering, non-vesicular lipid transport and cytoskeletal regulation. Beyond fundamental membrane trafficking roles, Arf proteins also regulate mitosis, plasma membrane signaling, cilary trafficking and lipid droplet function. Tight spatial and temporal regulation of the relatively small number of Arf proteins is achieved by their guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which catalyze GTP binding and hydrolysis, respectively. A unifying function of Arf proteins, performed in conjunction with their regulators and effectors, is sensing, modulating and transporting the lipids that make up cellular membranes. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we discuss the unique features of Arf small G proteins, their functions in vesicular and lipid trafficking in cells, and how these functions are modulated by their regulators, the GEFs and GAPs. We also discuss how these Arf functions are subverted by human pathogens and disease states.","Jackson, Catherine L; Bouvet, Samuel",Journal of cell science,296,28

Serum from convalescent MERS patients may provide some benefit but is not readily available. In contrast, nearly all camels in the Middle East have been infected with MERS-CoV. Here, we show that sera obtained from MERS-immune camels augment the kinetics of MERS-CoV clearance and reduce the severity of pathological changes in infected lungs, with efficacy proportional to the titer of MERS-CoV-neutralizing serum antibody. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome, caused by a coronavirus, is highly lethal, with a case fatality rate of 35 to 40%. No specific therapy is available, and care is generally supportive. One promising approach is passive administration of sera from convalescent human MERS patients or other animals to exposed or infected patients. The vast majority of, if not all, camels in the Middle East have been infected with MERS-CoV, and some contain high titers of antibody to the virus. Here, we show that this antibody is protective if delivered either prophylactically or therapeutically to mice infected with MERS-CoV, indicating that this may be a useful intervention in infected patients.","Zhao, Jincun; Perera, Ranawaka A P M; Kayali, Ghazi; Meyerholz, David; Perlman, Stanley; Peiris, Malik",Journal of virology,296,27

The number of such studies is growing alongside the expansion of data collection. We aim to gain a broad picture of the scope of how routine healthcare data have been utilised. METHODS This study follows a systematic mapping review approach which does not make a judgement on the quality of the papers included in the review, thereby enabling a complete overview of the field. RESULTS Of 4481 publications retrieved, 386 met the eligibility criteria for this study. These publications covered a wide range of conditions, but the majority were based on one or only a small number of neurological conditions. In particular, publications concerned with three discrete areas of neurological practice - multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy/seizure and Parkinson's disease - accounted for 60% of the total. MS was the focus of the highest proportion of eligible studies (35%), yet in the recent Global Burden of Neurological Disease study it ranks only 14th out of 15 neurological disorders for DALY rates. In contrast, migraine is the neurological disorder with the highest ranking of DALYs globally (after stroke) and yet it was represented by only 4% of eligible studies. CONCLUSION This review shows that there is a disproportionately large body of literature pertaining to relatively rare disorders, and a correspondingly small body of literature describing more common conditions.

These interventions may lead to hypercapnia, barotrauma, and haemodynamic failure in the event of an obstructed upper airway. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and the haemodynamic effects of the Ventrain, a manually operated ventilation device that provides expiratory ventilation assistance. Transtracheal ventilation was carried out with the Ventrain in different airway scenarios in live pigs, and its performance was compared with a conventional jet ventilator. METHODS Pigs with open, partly obstructed, or completely closed upper airways were transtracheally ventilated either with the Ventrain or by conventional jet ventilation. Airway pressures, haemodynamic parameters, and blood gases obtained in the different settings were compared. RESULTS Mean (SD) alveolar minute ventilation as reflected by arterial partial pressure of CO2 was superior with the Ventrain in partly obstructed airways after 6 min in comparison with traditional manual jet ventilation [4.7 (0.19) compared with 7.1 (0.37) kPa], and this was also the case in all simulated airway conditions. At the same time, peak airway pressures were significantly lower and haemodynamic parameters were altered to a lesser extent with the Ventrain. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that the Ventrain device can ensure sufficient oxygenation and ventilation through a small-bore transtracheal catheter when the airway is open, partly obstructed, or completely closed. Minute ventilation and avoidance of high airway pressures were superior in comparison with traditional hand-triggered jet ventilation, particularly in the event of complete upper airway obstruction.","Paxian, M; Preussler, N P; Reinz, T; Schlueter, A; Gottschall, R",British journal of anaesthesia,296,19

METHODS In a 6-month winter period, 20 young children with cystic fibrosis and 18 age-matched, healthy, control subjects were contacted twice per week for detection of symptoms of an acute respiratory illness. If any symptom was present, then a home visit was made for physical examination and collection of nasopharyngeal swabs for viral analysis. In addition, parents were instructed to collect nasopharyngeal swabs every 2 weeks. RESULTS Children with cystic fibrosis and healthy control subjects had similar frequencies of acute respiratory illnesses (3.8+/-1.0 and 4.2+/-1.7 episodes, respectively). Although there were no significant differences in upper respiratory tract symptoms, the children with cystic fibrosis had longer periods of lower respiratory tract symptoms (22.4+/-22.2 vs 12.8+/-13.8 days) and a higher mean severity score per episode (2.35+/-0.64 vs 1.92+/-0.46). In addition, similar increases in upper respiratory tract symptom scores were associated with significantly greater increases in lower respiratory tract symptom scores in children with cystic fibrosis. No differences in the seasonal occurrences and distributions of respiratory viruses were observed, with picornaviruses and coronaviruses being the most prevalent. CONCLUSIONS Although there were no differences in the seasonal occurrences and distributions of polymerase chain reaction-detected respiratory viruses, acute respiratory illnesses were frequently associated with increased lower respiratory tract morbidity in young children with cystic fibrosis.","van Ewijk, Bart E; van der Zalm, Marieke M; Wolfs, Tom F W; Fleer, Andre; Kimpen, Jan L L; Wilbrink, Berry; van der Ent, Cornelis K",Pediatrics,296,16

High-fat diet (HFD) feeding and binge ethanol synergistically induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice with significant intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration; such HFD-plus-ethanol treatment markedly up-regulated the hepatic expression of many chemokines with the highest fold (approximately 30-fold) induction of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), which contributes to hepatic neutrophil infiltration and liver injury. Furthermore, HFD feeding activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma that subsequently inhibited CXCL1 upregulation in hepatocytes, thereby forming a negative feedback loop to prevent neutrophil overaction; whereas binge ethanol blocked this loop and then exacerbated CXCL1 elevation, neutrophil infiltration, and liver injury. Interestingly, inflamed mouse hepatocytes attracted neutrophils less effectively than inflamed human hepatocytes due to the lower induction of CXCL1 and the lack of the interleukin (IL)-8 gene in the mouse genome, which may be one of the reasons for difficulty in development of mouse models of alcoholic steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatic overexpression of Cxcl1 and/or IL-8 promoted steatosis-to-NASH progression in HFD-fed mice by inducing neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, hepatocyte death, fibrosis, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Collectively, obesity and binge drinking synergistically promote steatohepatitis via the induction of CXCL1 and subsequent hepatic neutrophil infiltration.","Hwang, Seonghwan; Ren, Tianyi; Gao, Bin",Clinical and molecular hepatology,296,1

Kai Zacharowski.,14.265482,3.600142,2020-03-17,"BACKGROUND To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) as a distraction technique in the management of acute pain and anxiety during amniocentesis. STUDY DESIGN A randomized controlled trial was conducted between September 2020 and October 2020 involving 60 women undergoing mid-trimester amniocentesis. Thirty women were assigned randomly to the VR intervention (immersive video content as a distraction method) group and 30 to the standard care group using a predetermined randomization code. The primary outcome measure was the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, along with the women's ratings of their extent of anxiety experienced during the procedure. The VAS consisted of a 10 cm line ranging from 0 to 10 (anchored by 0 = no pain and 10=very severe pain). Anxiety was assessed on Spielberger's state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) questionnaire. RESULTS The patients' characteristics and obstetric data were similar in both groups. The ratings on the VAS indicated that the VR intervention was associated with significantly less pain than the ratings in the standard of care group; namely, 2.5 ± 1.5 vs. 3.8 ± 1.7, respectively (95 % CI 0.44-2.13; p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in maternal anxiety levels before and after amniocentesis. CONCLUSION The VR intervention as a distractive technique emerged as effective in reducing pain during amniocentesis. It is easy to use, relatively inexpensive, has the advantage of no serious side effects, and may decrease the fear of pain that can affect patients' experiences and compliance with this procedure.","Melcer, Yaakov; Maymon, Ron; Gal-Kochav, Maayan; Pekar-Zlotin, Marina; Levinsohn-Tavor, Orna; Meizner, Israel; Svirsky, Ran","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",296,1
124093,124093,124093,From the Editor-in-Chief's Desk.,14.315646,3.6165118,2017,"Previous studies have demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) hepatotropism is determined largely by postentry events rather than by availability of the viral receptor. In addition, mutation of MHV nonstructural protein 2 (ns2) abrogates the ability of the virus to replicate in the liver and induce hepatitis but does not affect replication in the central nervous system (CNS). Here we show that replication of ns2 mutant viruses is attenuated in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) generated from wild-type (wt) mice but not in L2 fibroblasts, primary astrocytes, or BMM generated from type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice. In addition, ns2 mutants are more sensitive than wt virus to pretreatment of BMM, but not L2 fibroblasts or primary astrocytes, with alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β). The ns2 mutants induced similar levels of IFN-α/β in wt and IFNAR(-/-) BMM, indicating that ns2 expression has no effect on the induction of IFN but rather that it antagonizes a later step in IFN signaling. Consistent with these in vitro data, the virulence of ns2 mutants increased to near that of wt virus after depletion of macrophages in vivo. These data imply that the ability of MHV to replicate in macrophages is a prerequisite for replication in the liver and induction of hepatitis but not for replication or disease in the CNS, underscoring the importance of IFN signaling in macrophages in vivo for protection of the host from hepatitis. Our results further support the notion that viral tissue tropism is determined in part by postentry events, including the early type I interferon response.","Zhao, Ling; Rose, Kristine M; Elliott, Ruth; Van Rooijen, Nico; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,296,1

In this work we have used a metabolomics approach to study the dynamic metabolic changes occurring in the plasma samples of a swine model following two different causes of CA, namely asphyxia (ACA) and ventricular fibrillation (VFCA). Plasma samples were collected at baseline and every minute during the experimental phases. In order to identify the metabolomics profiles characterizing the two pathological entities, all samples were analysed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and LC-MS/MS spectrometry.The metabolomics fingerprints of ACA and VFCA significantly differed during the peri-arrest period and the resuscitation phase. Major alterations were observed in plasma concentrations of metabolites related to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, and anaplerotic replenishing of TCA. ACA animals showed significant metabolic disturbances during the asphyxial and CA phases, while for VFCA animals this phenomenon resulted shifted at the resuscitation phase. Interestingly, starting from the asphyxial phase, the ACA animals were stratified in two groups based on their metabolomics profiles that resulted to be correlated with the clinical outcome. Succinate overproduction was observed in the animals with the worse outcome, suggesting a potential prognostic role for this metabolite.","Varvarousis, Dimitrios; Xanthos, Theodoros; Ferino, Giulio; Noto, Antonio; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Mura, Massimo; Scano, Paola; Chalkias, Athanasios; Papalois, Apostolos; De-Giorgio, Fabio; Baldi, Alfonso; Mura, Paolo; Staikou, Chryssoula; Stocchero, Matteo; Finco, Gabriele; d'Aloja, Ernesto; Locci, Emanuela",Scientific reports,296,1

Many studies focused on general population, although it is reasonable to expect that patients with neurodevelopmental disorders might have been at higher risk. Children/adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) might be potentially more vulnerable, due to their intolerance to forced restrictions that limit stimulating experiences, to obligation to follow instructions and to acceptation of imposed rules We aimed to compare stress-related behavioral changes of the first COVD-19 related confinement among 6-18 years old ADHD and typically developing subjects. METHODS Two parent-proxy online surveys have been employed, shared via social media. Symptoms of acute stress related to the pandemic and a question about family members/households' COVID-19 positivity have been listed in 8 yes/no items. Chi-squared tests were applied. RESULTS Final sample consisted of 1078 typically developing subjects and 979 ADHD. Exaggerated startle response, difficulties in waking-up, angry mood as well as COVID-19 related fears were more prevalent among ADHD vs. typically developing subjects. typically developing subjects showed higher prevalence of research for information about COVID-19 and worries about death. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the COVID-19 experience significantly impacted children and adolescents with ADHD to a great extent, similarly to typically developing subjects. ADHD showed more anxious-phobic responses, while typically developing subjects demonstrate more depressive attitudes. Differences in stress symptoms profiles between ADHD and T typically developing subjects warrant to develop distinct strategies of therapeutic interviews.","Giallonardo, Martina; Uccella, Sara; DE Carli, Fabrizio; Nobili, Lino; Bruni, Oliviero; DE Grandis, Elisa; Melegari, Maria G",Minerva pediatrics,296,16

METHODS The present study includes 80 ASA 1-2 patients aged between 20 and 65 who were scheduled for endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) under sedation. Patients were instructed to fill out the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) before the procedure. For sedation, 0.03 mg kg-1 intravenous midazolam, 1 mg kg-1 lidocaine, 1 µ kg-1 fentanyl, and then a bolus dose of 1 mg kg-1 propofol were infused over a period of 60 s. The time elapsed until the bispectral index (BIS) value reached 75 was recorded. For anesthesia maintenance, 2 mg kg-1 h-1 propofol infusion was administered. In the case of sedation failure, an additional dose of 0.1 mg kg-1 propofol (IV) was administered to ensure sedation depth with a BIS level of 65-75, and the propofol infusion was halted once the BIS value dropped below 65. RESULTS STAI-S and STAI-T scores were significantly positively correlated with PSQ minor pain and PSQ total scores. The time elapsed until reaching a BIS level of 75, propofol infusion dose used during sedation, and the need for additional doses of propofol, heart rate (HR), and duration of post-anesthesia care unit stay were significantly positively correlated with both preoperative anxiety and preoperative pain sensitivity. In terms of postoperative pain, the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1 h was more highly correlated with STAI-S and STAI-T than with PSQ. The VAS 2 h was only correlated with STAI-S and STAI-T. CONCLUSION The significant linear correlation between preoperative anxiety and pain sensitivity and anesthesia need can facilitate better preoperative management by predicting individual anesthetic consumption.

METHODS In May 2020, we interrogated the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios of CT for COVID-19 identification were computed. Cumulative positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value, stratified by disease prevalence, were calculated. RESULTS Ten articles were included (1332 patients). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and summary diagnostic odds ratio of CT were 82% [95% confidence interval (CI), 79%-84%], 68% (95% CI, 65%-71%), and 18 (95% CI, 9.8-32.8). The PPV and negative predictive value were 54% (95% CI, 30%-77%) and 94% (95% CI, 88%-99%) at a COVID-19 prevalence lower than 40%, and 80% (95% CI, 62%-91%) and 77% (95% CI, 68%-85%) at a prevalence higher than 40%.

In the last decade, the approach has begun to advance from being a computer-based means of rationalizing experimental observations to producing apparently credible predictions for a number of real-world applications within industrial sectors such as advanced materials and drug discovery. However, key aspects concerning the reproducibility of the method have not kept pace with the speed of its uptake in the scientific community. Here, we present a discussion of uncertainty quantification for molecular dynamics simulation designed to endow the method with better error estimates that will enable it to be used to report actionable results. The approach adopted is a standard one in the field of uncertainty quantification, namely using ensemble methods, in which a sufficiently large number of replicas are run concurrently, from which reliable statistics can be extracted. Indeed, because molecular dynamics is intrinsically chaotic, the need to use ensemble methods is fundamental and holds regardless of the duration of the simulations performed.

Prior literature finds that creativity tends to improve across an ideation session. Here we compared people's beliefs against their actual creative performance. Consistent with prior research, we found that people's creativity, on aggregate, remained constant or improved across an ideation session. However, people's beliefs did not match this reality. We consistently found that people expected their creativity to decline over time. We refer to this misprediction as the creative cliff illusion. Study 1 found initial evidence of this effect across an ideation task. We found further evidence in a sample with high domain-relevant knowledge (study 2), when creativity judgments were elicited retrospectively (study 3), and across a multiday study (study 5). We theorized the effect occurs because people mistakenly associate creativity (the novelty and usefulness of an idea) with idea production (the ability to generate an idea). Study 4 found evidence consistent with this mechanism. The creative cliff illusion was attenuated among those with high levels of everyday creative experience (study 6) and after a knowledge intervention that increased awareness of the effect (study 7). Demonstrating the impact of creativity beliefs on downstream performance, study 8 found that declining creativity beliefs negatively influenced task persistence and creative performance, suggesting that people underinvest in ideation.

Fissureless fissure-last technique has been described as useful technique to reduce air leak, yet in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) data are limited and mostly on the upper lobes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of fissureless fissure-last VATS 'non-upper' lobectomies and the impact of it on the immediate outcome, especially relating to air leak. METHODS This study is a monocentric single-surgeon retrospective analysis on prospectively collected data. During 24 months, 46 patients underwent VATS 'non-upper' lobectomy or lower bilobectomy, with conventional (VATS-c) technique in 20 and fissureless fissure-last (VATS-f) technique in 26 patients. Results were evaluated according to preoperative, perioperative and postoperative parameters. RESULTS There were no differences between VATS-c and VATS-f groups in any characteristics or peri- and postoperative variables, except the number of staplers, where it was significantly higher in VATS-c group (MVATS-c = 5.7; MVATS-f = 7.7; P = 0.001). Operation time did not differ between the groups, but showed gender-related difference, being longer in males (MVATS-c = 188; MVATS-f = 157; P = 0.04). Prevalence of air leak was 20%; prolonged air leak (PAL) (>5 days) being 11% and PAL (>7 days) 0%. Patients with air leak were older by tendency (MVATS-c = 74.9; MVATS-f = 66.5; P = 0.08), had more complications (P = 0.025; relative risk = 2.65) and stayed longer at hospital (MVATS-c = 10.8; MVATS-f = 7.7; P = 0.02). Postoperative complications were present in 24% of patients. CONCLUSION VATS-f lobectomy is safe and feasible not only for 'upper' but also for 'non-upper' lobes. When applied to properly selected patients, it may reduce air leak and PAL and thus may potentially reduce the rate of complications.","Stamenovic, Davor; Bostanci, Korkut; Messerschmidt, Antje; Tillmann, Jahn; Kostic, Marko; Schneider, Thomas",ANZ journal of surgery,296,1

The manual method used a pressure manometer to adjust pressure at cruising altitude and after landing. A PressureEasy device was connected to the pilot balloon of the third tube and set to a pressure of 20 mm Hg to 22 mm Hg. The final method filled the balloon with 10 mL of saline. Both size 8.0-mm and 7.5-mm ETT were studied during three flights. RESULTS In the control tube, pressure exceeded 70 mm Hg at cruising altitude. Manual management corrected for pressure at altitude but resulted in low cuff pressures upon landing (<10 mm Hg). The PressureEasy reduced the pressure change to a maximum of 36 mm Hg, but on landing, cuff pressures were less than 15 mm Hg. Saline inflation ameliorated cuff pressure changes at altitude, but initial pressures were 40 mm Hg. CONCLUSION None of the three methods using air inflation managed to maintain cuff pressures below those associated with tracheal damage at altitude or above pressures associated with secretion aspiration during descent. Saline inflation minimizes altitude-related alteration in cuff pressure but creates excessive pressures at sea level. New techniques need to be developed.","Britton, Tyler; Blakeman, Thomas C; Eggert, John; Rodriquez, Dario; Ortiz, Heather; Branson, Richard D",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,296,1

As a result, these patients require regular monitoring of the complete blood counts (CBC) for optimal patient care. To reduce the strain on the patient, there is a need for a point-of-care (POC) hematology device that provides rapid and reliable results both in general and in cytopenic samples and is suitable for outpatient clinics. We evaluated the HemoScreen device for the most used CBC parameter both overall and at the lower range. METHODS The HemoScreen was compared with the Sysmex XN-9000 in 206 routine venous samples and 79 capillary bedside samples focusing on white blood cells (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), red blood cells (RBC), PLT and HGB. RESULTS The HemoScreen was less precise compared to the acceptance criteria set for larger and more advanced hematology instrument with a CV% 3.0-3.7 for WBCs, 3.6-8.4 for ANCs, 1.1-1.5 for RBCs, 2.5-4.4 for PLTs, and 1.7-2.3 for HGB. Correlation coefficient for all five parameters for the entire range was r >.95 and r >.90 at lower range for venous and capillary samples. Bias limits were within the CTCAE acceptance limits. CONCLUSIONS The HemoScreen provides rapid and accurate test results, for evaluation of WBC, PLT, and HGB, as well as at low concentrations for guiding transfusions and postchemotherapy treatment. The device is easy to operate and can measure both venous and capillary samples. Therefore, the HemoScreen is well suited for smaller outpatient clinics and potentially home use.","Kristian Kur, Dår; Thøgersen, Danny; Kjeldsen, Lars; Friis-Hansen, Lennart",International journal of laboratory hematology,296,14

MATERIAL AND METHODS The review is based on a complete literature search through PubMed, Medline. Single port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS), single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), laparoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), ergonomics, technologies, robotic SPLS, SPLS or SILS operations were the keywords used for the literature search. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The SPLS approach imposes several restrictions: Maintenance of sufficient exposure, sustained pneumoperitoneum, adequate retraction, collision between instruments (internal and external), collision between instruments and optics, and limited instrument manipulation and triangulation. Compensatory techniques such as using percutaneous sutures for retraction and employing coaxial, flexible, and articulating instruments have been used to improve triangulation. CONCLUSIONS The ergonomics imposed by this approach are different from those of multi-port laparoscopic surgery. Considerable progress in port and instruments for SPLS has been achieved in the last five years in order to overcome the constraints and problems facing the operating surgeon when using the SPLS approach. Further more advanced instrumentation such as hand-held manipulators with seven degrees of freedom (DOF) and robotic devices for SPLS is needed to realize the full potential of the SPLS approach.","Tang, Benjie; Hou, Sichuan; Cuschieri, Sir Alfred",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,296,1

DESIGN Prospective laboratory animal experiment. SETTING Investigational laboratory. SUBJECTS Eight instrumented pigs. INTERVENTIONS Eight anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs were monitored with an arterial line and a pulmonary artery catheter. Multiple extrasystoles were induced by right ventricular pacing (25% of heart beats). Arterial pressure waveforms were recorded and stroke volume variation was computed from the new and from the standard algorithm. The new stroke volume variation algorithm is designed to restore the respiratory component of the arterial pressure waveform despite multiple ectopic heart beats. Cardiac output was measured before and after 56 fluid boluses (7 mL/kg of 6% hydroxy ethyl starch) performed at different volemic states. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A positive response to fluid boluses (>15% increase in cardiac output) was observed in 21 of 56 boluses. The new stroke volume variation was higher in responders than in nonresponders (19% ± 5% vs. 12% ± 3%, p < .05), whereas the standard stroke volume variation was similar in the two groups (29% ± 8% vs. 26% ± 11%, p = .4). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the new stroke volume variation was an accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness (sensitivity = 86%, specificity = 85%, best cutoff value = 14%, area under the curve = 0.892 ±, whereas the standard stroke volume variation was not (area under the curve = 0.596 ± 0.077). CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the standard stroke volume variation, the new stroke volume variation algorithm was able to predict fluid responsiveness in animals with multiple ventricular extrasystoles.","Cannesson, Maxime; Tran, Nam Phuong; Cho, Max; Hatib, Feras; Michard, Frederic",Critical care medicine,296,1

However, there are still few data on COVID-19 occurring in hematologic patients. METHODS One hundred two patients with COVID-19 symptoms and a nasopharyngeal swab positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 seen at 2 hematologic departments located in Lombardy, Italy, during March 2020 were studied. Risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were analyzed by comparisons of patients with COVID-19 and the standard hematologic population managed at the same institutions in 2019. Thirty-day survival was compared with the survival of matched uninfected control patients with similar hematologic disorders and nonhematologic patients affected by COVID-19. RESULTS Male sex was significantly more prevalent in patients with COVID-19. The infection occurred across all different types of hematologic disease; however, the risk of acquiring a COVID-19 infection was lower for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher for patients with immune-mediated anemia on immunosuppressive-related treatments. The 30-day mortality rate was 39.2%, which was higher than the rates for nonhematologic patients with COVID-19 (23.5%; P = .02) and uninfected hematologic controls (3%; P < .001). The severity of the respiratory syndrome at presentation and active hematologic treatment were independently associated with a worse prognosis. Neither diagnosis nor disease status affected the prognosis. The worst prognosis was demonstrated among patients on active hematologic treatment and those with more severe respiratory syndrome at COVID-19 presentation. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients should be advised to seek medical attention at the earliest signs of dyspnea and/or respiratory infection. Physicians should perform a risk-benefit analysis to determine the impact of temporarily deferring nonlifesaving treatments versus the risk of adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19. LAY SUMMARY Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurs across all different types of hematologic disease; however, the risk of acquiring it is lower for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher for patients with immune-mediated anemia on immunosuppressive treatment. The 30-day mortality rate is 39.2%, which is far higher than the rates for both uninfected hematologic controls (3%; P < .001) and nonhematologic patients with COVID-19 (23.5%; P = .02) despite matching for age, sex, comorbidities, and severity of disease. Variables independently associated with a worse prognosis are the severity of the respiratory syndrome at presentation and any type of active hematologic treatment.

The performance evaluation indicated that the pilot project collection system's strong points included strong economics, low environmental impact and low social impact. This study also shows that Suzhou's integrated system has developed a comprehensive body of laws and clarified regulatory responsibilities for each of the various government departments to solve the problems of commercial food waste management.

For centuries, scientists have used slides, counting chambers (hemocytometers), and diluting and staining solutions for this task. Then, automated hemocytometry began. This science, now linked to the daily routine of laboratory hematology, has completed an overwhelming path over a few decades. Our laboratories today operate with versatile multiparameter systems, ranging from complex single-channel instruments to bulky continuous flow machines. In terms of clinical information obtained from a simple routine blood test, the full exploitation of their potential depends on the operators' imagination and courage. A comprehensive review of the scientific publications that have accompanied the development of hemocytometry from the 1950s to today would require entire volumes. More than seven hundred contributions that authors worldwide have published in Clinical and Laboratory Haematology until 2007 and then the International Journal of Laboratory Hematology are summarized. Such journals have represented and hopefully will continue to represent the privileged place of welcome for future scientific research in hemocytometry. Improved technologies, attention to quality, new reagents and electronics, information technology, and scientist talent ensure a more profound and deeper knowledge of cell properties: current laboratory devices measure and count even minor immature or pathological cell subpopulations.

The aim of the current study is to validate a Turkish version of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS), which is a brief English-language mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death. Participants were assessed using the PGS, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). We surveyed 758 Turkish native speakers who participated online. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the factor structure of the PGS was satisfactory. The scale was internally consistent with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 and a composite reliability of 0.90. The PGS demonstrated construct validity with strong correlations with suicidal ideation and substance use coping. Positive correlations of the PGS with the PHQ-4 and the WSAS demonstrated adequate convergent validity. The PGS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional grief using an optimized cut score of ≥ 3 (89% sensitivity and 72% specificity). The PGS also demonstrates incremental validity by explaining most of the variance (43%) in functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss beyond measures of depression and generalized anxiety. These findings closely replicate the original validation study on the PGS in English and suggest that the current Turkish version of the PGS is a valid and reliable measure to assess the severity of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death.","Evren, Cuneyt; Evren, Bilge; Dalbudak, Ercan; Topcu, Merve; Kutlu, Nilay",Death studies,296,1

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,296,16

METHODS Data obtained from 271 consecutive patients (70 men and 201 women; median age 57 years; range 23-79 years) who presented with UIA for coil embolization between July 2011 and June 2013 were analyzed. Two independent reviewers examined the DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient maps obtained the following day for the presence of restrictive diffusion spots and counted the number of spots. Multivariate analysis was then performed to identify independent risk factors for developing microembolism following the coiling of an aneurysm. RESULTS Microembolic lesions were noted in 101 of 271 patients (37.3%). The results of the multivariate analysis showed that the following factors significantly influenced the risk for microembolism: age, diabetes, previous history of ischemic stroke, high-signal FLAIR lesions in the white matter, multiple aneurysms, and the insertion of an Enterprise stent (all ORs > 1.0 and all p values < 0.05). Previously known risk factors such as prolonged procedure duration, aneurysm size, and decreased antiplatelet function did not show any significant influence. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of microembolism after endovascular coiling of UIA was not low. Lesions occurred more frequently in patients with vascular status associated with old age, diabetes, and previous stroke. Aneurysm multiplicity and the type of stent used for treatment also influenced lesion occurrence.","Park, Jung Cheol; Lee, Deok Hee; Kim, Jae Kyun; Ahn, Jae Sung; Kwun, Byung Duk; Kim, Dae Yoon; Choi, Choong Gon",Journal of neurosurgery,296,1

The natural history of these aneurysms has gradually been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment for these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 377 patients with 400 paraclinoid aneurysms treated between January 2006 and December 2012. Their clinical records, endovascular reports, and radiologic and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Because aneurysms ≥7 mm are at higher risk of rupture, we classified aneurysms as small (<7 mm) or large (≥7 mm). RESULTS Overall, 115 of the 400 aneurysms (28.8%) were large (≥7 mm). Thromboembolic complications were found significantly more often with large aneurysms than with small ones (7.4% vs 1.0%, P = .001). Hemorrhagic complications were found only with small aneurysms (0.7%). The 6-month morbidity rates were similar for small (1.0%) and large (0.8%) aneurysms. Immediate angiographic outcomes were similar (P = .37), whereas recurrences and retreatment occurred more frequently with large aneurysms (P = .001 and P = .007, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that aneurysm size was the only independent predictor for recurrence (P = .005). Most recurrences (81%) were detected by scheduled angiography at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Aneurysm size influenced the type of complication (thromboembolic or hemorrhagic) and the recurrence rate.

Optimised medical therapy (OMT), the first-line treatment modality in CS, may reduce or delay - but it does not abolish - CS-related strokes. As per current AHA/ASA and ESC/ESVS/ESO guidelines, carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a less-invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for CS revascularisation in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Ten-year follow-up from the CREST trial in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic CS confirmed equipoise of CAS and CEA in the primary endpoint. Nevertheless CAS - using a widely open-cell, first-generation stent and first-generation (distal/filter) neuroprotection - has been criticised for its relative excess of (mostly minor) strokes by 30 days, a significant proportion of which were post-procedural. Atherosclerotic plaque protrusion through conventional carotid stent struts, confirmed on intravascular imaging, has been implicated as a leading mechanism of the relative excess of strokes with CAS vs. CEA, including delayed strokes with CAS. Different designs of mesh-covered carotid stents have been developed to prevent plaque prolapse. Several multi-centre/multi-specialty clinical studies with CGurad MicroNet-Covered Embolic Prevention Stent System (EPS) and RoadSaver/Casper were recently published and included routine DW-MRI cerebral imaging peri-procedurally and at 30 days (CGuard EPS). Data from more than 550 patients in mesh-covered carotid stent clinical studies to-date show an overall 30-day complication rate of ~1% with near-elimination of post-procedural events. While more (and long-term) evidence is still anticipated, these results - taken together with optimised intra-procedural neuroprotection in CAS (increased use of proximal systems including trans-carotid dynamic flow reversal) and the positive 12-month mesh-covered stent data reports in 2017 - are transforming the carotid revascularisation field today. Establishing effective algorithms to identify the asymptomatic subjects at stroke risk despite OMT, and large-scale studies with mesh-covered stents including long-term clinical and duplex ultrasound outcomes, are the next major goals.","Musiałek, Piotr; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Postepy w kardiologii interwencyjnej = Advances in interventional cardiology,296,1

Definitions of these indicators can differ between countries, affecting comparability of preterm birth and stillbirth rates across countries. This study aimed to document national-level adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of preterm birth and stillbirth in the WHO Western Pacific region. A systematic search of government health websites and 4 electronic databases was conducted. Any official report or published study describing the national definition of preterm birth or stillbirth published between 2000 and 2020 was eligible for inclusion. A total of 58 data sources from 21 countries were identified. There was considerable variation in how preterm birth and stillbirth was defined across the region. The most frequently used lower gestational age threshold for viability of preterm birth was 28 weeks gestation (range 20-28 weeks), and stillbirth was most frequently classified from 20 weeks gestation (range 12-28 weeks). High-income countries more frequently used earlier gestational ages for preterm birth and stillbirth compared with low- to middle-income countries. The findings highlight the importance of clear, standardized, internationally comparable definitions for perinatal indicators. Further research is needed to determine the impact on regional preterm birth and stillbirth rates.","Connolly, Mairead; Phung, Laura; Farrington, Elise; Scoullar, Michelle J L; Wilson, Alyce N; Comrie-Thomson, Liz; Homer, Caroline S E; Vogel, Joshua P",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,296,1

Yet research with adolescent samples has typically focused on the experiences of victims rather than perpetrators, and males as perpetrators and females as victims. In the current article, we consider whether risk and protective factors operate similarly within and across sex assigned at birth. A national sample of youth, ages 14 and 15, were recruited via social media and surveyed online (N = 1,981). At the individual level, girls who sexually harassed others, were more likely to have a propensity to respond to stimuli with anger compared to boys who sexually harassed. At the relational level, girls who sexually harassed were more likely to be victims of sexual harassment compared to boys, and having a negative peer environment (have delinquent peers, seen someone get attacked, and know someone who has been sexually assaulted) was of particular importance in understanding why girls harass others. For boys who harass, family relations, having seen or heard about peer physical or sexual assault and bullying perpetration were important for contextualizing boys' sexual harassment. As empathy increased, the relative odds of sexually harassing decreased for girls. Future research should explore motivations for perpetrating sexual harassment, bystander interventions, and longitudinal frameworks to identify causal patterns to determine which factors inhibit or facilitate sexual harassment.","Stroem, Ida Frugård; Kimberly, L Goodman; Ybarra, Michele L; Mitchell, Kimberly J",Journal of interpersonal violence,296,10

In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the DED in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms and present the short- and midterm results. METHODS We treated 34 aneurysms using 26 devices in 24 patients with wide-necked, mostly medium-sized, and fusiform aneurysms. Fourteen of the patients included in the study were women and the other 10 were men. Headache was the most frequent symptom. Although 31 (91.2%) aneurysms were in the anterior circulation, 3 (8.8%) were in the posterior. Intracranial stent medication was accomplished in all patients. All patients were evaluated 1 day later for any ischemic lesion with diffusion-weighted imaging. The first and second follow-up angiograms were planned to be performed after 3 and 9 months. RESULTS In all patients, the treatment was successful. No hemorrhagic complication was seen on computed tomography scan performed immediately after the procedure. All patients were discharged without any neurologic deficit. Although 20 (71.4%) of 28 aneurysms in 20 patients were totally closed on the 3-month follow-up angiogram, 14 (77.8%) of 18 aneurysms in 9 patients were totally closed on the 9-month follow-up. General morbidity was 8.4%, and mortality was 4.3%.

Patients presenting for NORA procedures are also older and sicker than ever. Commensurate with the requirements of procedural medicine, anesthetic monitoring must meet the American Society of Anesthesiologists standards for basic monitoring. RECENT FINDINGS There have been improvements in the required monitors that are used for intraoperative patient care. Some of these changes have been with new technologies and others have occurred with software refinements. In addition, specialized monitoring devises have also been introduced into NORA locations (depth of hypnosis, respiratory monitoring, point-of care ultrasound). These additions to the monitoring tools available to the anesthesiologist working in the NORA-environment push the boundaries of procedures which may be accomplished in this setting. SUMMARY NORA procedures constitute a growing percentage of total administered anesthetics. There is no difference in the monitoring standard between that of an anesthetic administered in an operating room and a NORA location. Anesthesiologists in the NORA setting must have the same compendium of monitors available as do their colleagues working in the operating suite.","Routman, Justin; Boggs, Steven Dale",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,296,16

RAB14 acts as molecular switches that shift between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state and regulates circulation of vesicles between the Golgi and endosomal compartments. In present study, we investigated the roles of RAB14 during oocyte meiotic maturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Microinjection with siRNA and exogenous mRNA for knock down and rescue, and immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and real-time RT-PCR were utilized for the study. RESULTS Our results showed that RAB14 localized in the cytoplasm and accumulated at the cortex during mouse oocyte maturation, and it was also enriched at the spindle periphery. Depletion of RAB14 did not affect polar body extrusion but caused large polar bodies, indicating the failure of asymmetric division. We found that absence of RAB14 did not affect spindle organization but caused the spindle migration defects, and this might be due to the regulation on cytoplasmic actin assembly via the ROCK-cofilin signalling pathway. We also found that RAB14 depletion led to aberrant Golgi apparatus distribution. Exogenous Myc-Rab14 mRNA supplement could significantly rescue these defects caused by Rab14 siRNA injection. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our results suggest that RAB14 affects ROCK-cofilin pathway for actin-based spindle migration and Golgi apparatus distribution during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation.","Zou, Yuan-Jing; Shan, Meng-Meng; Wang, Hong-Hui; Pan, Zhen-Nan; Pan, Meng-Hao; Xu, Yi; Ju, Jia-Qian; Sun, Shao-Chen",Cell proliferation,296,33

Our objective was to compare outcomes of laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) vs. open total gastrectomy (OTG) for gastric adenocarcinoma using a national cancer database. METHODS The National Cancer Database (2010-2014) was analyzed for total gastrectomy cases performed for gastric adenocarcinoma. Patient demographics and surgical outcomes were stratified by stage and compared based on laparoscopic vs. open surgical approach. Primary outcome measures included 30-day and 90-day mortality and Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate long-term survival. RESULTS There were 2584 cases analyzed, including 592 (22.9%) stage I, 710 (27.5%) stage II, and 1282 (49.6%) stage III cases. The distribution of LTG vs. OTG cases was 156 (26.4%) vs. 436 (73.6%) for stage I, 163 (23.0%) vs. 547 (77.0%) for stage II, and 241 (18.8%) vs. 1041 (81.2%) for stage III. For all stages analyzed, there was no difference between laparoscopic vs. open approach for adjusted 30-day mortality (stage I: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.52, p = 0.75; stage II: AOR 1.36, p > 0.99; stage III: AOR 0.46, p = 0.29) or 90-day mortality (stage I: AOR 0.46, p = 0.99; stage II: AOR 1.17, p = 0.99; stage III: 0.57, p = 0.29). There was no difference between LTG vs. OTG 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curves for any stage (stage I: p = 0.20; stage II: p = 0.83; stage III: p = 0.46). When compared to OTG, LTG had a similar hazard ratio (HR) for mortality (HR 0.89 p = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic total gastrectomy and OTG have comparable 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and long-term survival.","Gambhir, Sahil; Inaba, Colette S; Whealon, Matthew; Sujatha-Bhaskar, Sarath; Pejcinovska, Marija; Nguyen, Ninh T",Surgical endoscopy,296,31

Arthrocentesis of both middle carpal joints was performed pre-treatment, and 10 min, 24 h, 48 h, 7 and 14 days after treatment. Synovial nucleated cell counts and total solids, tiludronate, sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG), chondroitin sulfate 846 epitope (CS-846, a measure of aggrecan synthesis), and collagen type II cleavage neoepitope (C2C) concentrations were determined. Histologic analysis of joint tissues and sGAG quantitation in cartilage was performed at 14 days in HDT horses. Data were analyzed by repeated measures non-parametric ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. High dose tiludronate administration produced synovial fluid tiludronate concentrations of 2,677,500 ng/mL, exceeding concentrations that were safe for cartilage in vitro, and LDT administration produced synovial fluid concentrations of 1,353 ng/mL, remaining below concentrations considered potentially detrimental to cartilage. With HDT, synovial fluid total solids concentration was higher at 24 h and 7 days and sGAG concentration was higher at 48 h, compared to control joints. Synovial fluid CS-846 concentration was increased over pre-treatment values in HDT control but not in HDT treated joints at 24 and 48 h. All joints (HDT and LDT control and treated) showed a temporary decrease in synovial fluid C2C concentration, compared to pre-treatment values. Histologic features of articular cartilage and synovial membrane did not differ between HDT treated and control joints. High dose tiludronate treatment caused a transient increase in synovial total solids and temporarily increased proteoglycan degradation in cartilage. Although clinical significance of these changes are questionable, as they did not result in articular cartilage damage, further investigation of the safety of intraarticular HDT in a larger number of horses is warranted.","Duesterdieck-Zellmer, Katja F; Moneta, Lindsey; Ott, Jesse F; Larson, Maureen K; Gorman, Elena M; Hunter, Barbara; Löhr, Christiane V; Payton, Mark E; Morré, Jeffrey T; Maier, Claudia S",PeerJ,296,27

Formal communication processes, such as briefing, sign in and time out, are designed to promote this. AIMS We investigated patterns of communication of clinically relevant information between OR staff in simulated surgical scenarios, to identify factors associated with effective information sharing. We focused on the influence of precase briefing, sign in and time out, which we defined as formal team communications. METHOD Twenty teams of six participated in two scenarios during a day-long course. Participants each received unique, clinically relevant items of information (information probes) prior to simulations and were tested postscenario on recall of the information in the probe. Using videos of the simulations, we coded each time an information probe was mentioned against a structured framework. RESULTS Of the 145 instances where a probe was mentioned at least once, 75 (51.7%) were mentioned during a formal team communication. However, there were 89 instances of a possible 234 (38%) where a probe was never mentioned. Some team members were more likely to mention the information than others. When probes were mentioned during formal team communications, significantly more team members were attentive (1.4 vs 2.3; p<0.001), the information was significantly more likely to be recalled and the team was five times more likely (p=0.01) to recall the information than if the information was only mentioned outside of a formal communication. CONCLUSIONS While our study supports the value of formal team communications during precase briefing, sign in and time out in the Surgical Safety Checklist, our findings suggest suboptimal transmission of information between team members and unequal contributions of information by different professional groups.","Cumin, David; Skilton, Carmen; Weller, Jennifer",BMJ quality & safety,296,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS The expression levels of miR-182-5p in OC tissues and paracancerous normal tissues were detected. The miR-182-5p expression in OC cells and ovarian epithelial cells was also determined. Through online prediction (TargetScan, miRDB), the potential target of miR-182-5p was screened and further confirmed by the Luciferase reporter gene assay. The effects of the miR-182-5p on human ovarian serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma cell line (SKOV3) cells were determined by in vitro experiments. RESULTS The low expression of miR-182-5p in OC was confirmed by quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) was identified as a direct target of miR-182-5p. Subsequent experiments showed that the BNIP3 knockdown resulting from the up-regulation of miR-182-5p inhibited cell proliferation, clone formation and migration ability of OC cells. CONCLUSIONS Our research showed the inhibitory function of miR-182-5p in OC by targeting BNIP3, thus providing an experimental basis for the treatment of OC.","Jia, X-N; Yin, S-D; Wei, Y; Chen, L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,296,1

INTRODUCTION Febrile neutropenia in pediatric oncology patients poses a significant burden of increased morbidity and mortality. Prompt, efficient emergency care and rapid antibiotic administration within 60 minutes of presentation to hospital is required to prevent clinical deterioration and reduce rates of intensive care admission and mortality. Efficient emergency department care delivery is impacted by modern day challenges, such as increasing user-demand, limited resources, and lack of flow. In response to this, to expedite care provision, practice guidelines have been developed to include nurse-initiated protocols that guide nurses to initiate specific predetermined investigations and interventions for patients meeting certain criteria. Febrile neutropenic pediatric patients may be a specific group that can benefit from nurse-initiated protocols due to the time-critical nature of required care. INCLUSION CRITERIA The scoping review will consider literature that reports on nurse-initiated protocols in the management of pediatric febrile oncology patients with suspected neutropenia in the emergency department setting. METHODS JBI methodology for scoping reviews will guide the review process.

Clinical trials investigating the role of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) reported conflicting results. This study aimed to systematically review the best available evidence and synthesize the results. Several electronic databases were searched for candidate studies up to 12 October 2020. Studies eligible for meta-analysis were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Primary outcomes are the recovery and mortality rates, while secondary outcomes are the safety profile of remdesivir. The main effective measures are the rate ratio (RR) and rate difference (RD). Four clinical trials and one observational study were included. Remdesivir treatment for 10 days increased the recovery rate on day 14 by 50% among severe Covid-19 patients (RR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.33-1.7), while on day 28 it was increased by 14% among moderate and severe Covid-19 patients (RR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.06-1.22). Additionally, remdesivir decreased the mortality rate on day 14 by 36% among all patients (RR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.45-0.92) but not on day 28 (RR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.56-1.97). Nonmechanically ventilated Covid-19 patients showed better response to remdesivir in the recovery (RR = 0.3, 95%CI = 0.13-0.7) and mortality (RR = 2.33, 95%CI = 1.24-4.4) rates on day 14. Remdesivir reduced serious adverse effects by absolute 6% and no significant Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects were reported. At this early stage of the pandemic, there is evidence that remdesivir can be safely administered for hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It improves the recovery rate in both moderate and severe patients but, the optimal effect is achieved for those who are severely affected but not mechanically ventilated.","Elsawah, Hozaifa Khalil; Elsokary, Mohamed Ahmed; Abdallah, Mahmoud Samy; ElShafie, Ahmed Hanei",Reviews in medical virology,296,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS After randomization, 3 x 3 cm pieces of Atrium C-Qur, Mesh ProLite Ultra, Composix, Parietex, Proceed, Sepramesh, and DualMesh were sewn to the intact peritoneum on either side of a midline incision in 41 New Zealand white rabbits. Necropsy was performed at 120 days, and explants were evaluated for adhesion grade, adhesion amount, and mesh contraction. Histologic evaluation included extent of capsule formation, abdominal wall tissue ingrowth, degrees of inflammation and vascularization of the surrounding tissue, and the presence of mesothelialization. Results. There were no significant differences between the C-Qur mesh and the commercially available meshes tested with regard to adhesion grade or amount, although percentage adhesion coverage for the C-Qur mesh was much less than for Composix and Proceed. The C-Qur mesh contracted less than all meshes, significantly less (P < .05) than DualMesh or Proceed. DualMesh exhibited the greatest amount of capsule formation and inflammation on its parietal side as compared with the other meshes. CONCLUSIONS Placing lightweight polypropylene mesh with an omega-3 fatty acid barrier coating intraperitoneally results in more favorable adhesion characteristics compared with Composix and Proceed meshes at 120-day explantation after intraperitoneal placement. The minimal amount of contraction and favorable tissue response in comparison to other commercially available meshes makes C-Qur mesh a practical alternative for laparoscopic and open ventral hernia repair.","Pierce, Richard A; Perrone, Juan M; Nimeri, Abdelrahman; Sexton, Jennifer A; Walcutt, Julie; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical innovation,296,16

Late tracheostomy insertion, large endotracheal tubes and high cuff pressures increase their risk of subglottic and tracheal stenosis. This patient cohort also often appears to have co-morbidities associated with laryngotracheal stenosis, including high body mass index and laryngopharyngeal reflux. METHODS This paper presents three coronavirus disease 2019 patients who were intubated for a mean of 28 days before tracheostomy, leading to complex multi-level stenoses. RESULTS All patients underwent multiple endoscopic tracheoplasty procedures and two required tracheal resections. There was a mean of 33.9 days between interventions. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients do not appear to respond as well to steroid, laser and balloon dilatation as other adult stenosis patients. CONCLUSION Intubated coronavirus disease 2019 patients have an increased risk of laryngotracheal stenosis, as a result of multiple factors. Otolaryngology teams should be vigilant in investigating for this complication. International guidelines on time to tracheostomy should be followed, despite a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.","Scholfield, D W; Warner, E; Ahmed, J; Ghufoor, K",The Journal of laryngology and otology,296,31

Many studies have examined youth's beverage consumption, but little is known about what methods are commonly used to assess youth beverage consumption and whether these strategies are valid and reliable. This study aimed to systematically review articles assessing beverage consumption among children and adolescents. We searched PubMed and Scopus for English-language articles published between February 2007 and February 2017 that measured and reported on American youth's (ages 2-18 years) beverage consumption. Searches yielded 17,165 articles, of which 589 articles describing 615 measures were extracted. We examined the types of assessment methods used, characteristics of these methods (e.g. validity, reliability, and literacy level), characteristics of study samples, and beverages assessed. The most common assessment methods were questionnaires/screeners (used by 65.4% of articles) and recalls (24.4%). About three-quarters of articles did not address validity (70.5%) or reliability (79.5%) of any measures used. Study populations were diverse: 54.7% of articles included low-income children, and 90.2% included non-White children. The most commonly assessed beverage category was sugar-sweetened beverages. Findings suggest that improved measurement techniques and reporting are both needed to track progress towards a goal of ensuring all youth have healthy beverage consumption.","Grummon, A H; Sokol, R L; Hecht, C A; Patel, A I",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,296,1

Four speakers and six panellists addressed the current situation, preventive measures, and future directions for achieving the target of hepatitis elimination by 2030 Findings: Globally, Hepatitis B and C (HBV & HCV) accounts for 96% of all hepatitis mortality and more than 300 million people are living with viral hepatitis. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1 in 3 people worldwide has been infected with either HBV or HCV.Global uptake in childhood vaccination is significant for HBV, but the birth dose for all infants is too low (nearly 39% percent). Despite vaccination, 1.8 billion 5-year-old get infected every year with HBV.Various programs and projects are contributing to the elimination of the Hepatitis to reach the international goal. Due to COVID-19 there would be setbacks however we have all the tools within our reach and we must use them to get elimination, most importantly deliver it to the people who need it the most, if we plan to succeed by 2030. Conclusion: Hepatitis claims the lives of millions of people globally each year.With prevention, treatment, diagnostics, and vaccination hepatitis elimination is attainable. Greater investment in eliminating hepatitis will generate higher long-term returns. We have the tools, treatments, and strategies to combat this infectious disease. We need the support of various sectors to execute the plan, proper implementation of the idea, training, and awareness to the public domain. With leadership, resources, and multi-stakeholder collaboration, elimination of viral hepatitis is achievable.","Purohit, A.; Nayak, P.; Kapasi, R.; Harsh, J.; Singhi, R.",Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development,296,1

Patients may present with symptoms other than the main symptoms of respiratory tract infections, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, which may sometimes cause a delayed treatment in managing COVID-19 patients. Reports of various hospitals have also demonstrated gastrointestinal complaints as a clinical manifestation in those patients. The patients may come with gastrointestinal symptoms as their early clinical manifestation, or the gastrointestinal symptoms may be found in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which indeed can be explained since the SARS-CoV-2, an etiologic agent of COVID-19 infection, can obviously be found along the gastrointestinal tract.

New-onset diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been reported as the complications of COVID-19 in several studies. It seems that the prevalence of DKA due to Covid-19 is increasing. Therefore, two cases of individuals with DKA due to COVID-19 are presented in this study to inform other researchers about the details of this phenomenon. Material and Methods: Demographic characteristics, medical histories, physical examinations, laboratory investigations, real-time RT-PCR tests, computed tomography (CT) imaging studies, given treatments, clinical courses, and management outcomes were documented prospectively. Results: In the present experience, the manifestation of COVID-19 disease in the second case with a history of diabetes was more severe than in the first case. In the second case, with underlying diabetes and COVID-19, the DKA manifestation was associated with consciousness loss, severe restlessness, and respiratory distress;however, in the first case, with COVID-19 without diabetes, the DKA manifestation was associated with anorexia, weight loss, and lack of respiratory distress, which were milder symptoms than the second case. Conclusion: Due to the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 in Iran, it is recommended to raise awareness of DKA symptoms among health professionals. © The Author(s) 2021;All rights reserved.

In this study we examined whether humor moderates the relationship between extent of self-isolation and the depressive symptoms that people experience when locked down. Participants were 400 Japanese adults aged between 21 and 69 years, who completed the Humor Styles Questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale in addition to responding to a question to establish the extent of their self-isolation. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis results indicate that affiliative humor moderated the relationship between the degree of self-isolation and depression, and attenuated their association. In contrast, aggressive humor strengthened their association. Our study findings suggest that affiliative humor served to safeguard people from suffering from depression induced by self-isolation during lockdown, whereas aggressive humor increased the likelihood of people becoming depressed during lockdown.

In particular, an agent based model was used with the aim to indicate an optimal lockdown strategy, defined here as the one which minimizes mean lockdown time over regional unit provided health service is not overwhelmed. With this approach the lockdown extent was also considered by varying restrictions between complete regional school closure and/or significant social distancing in semi-public spaces. In result, a cooperative effect was discovered in the case when closure of schools was accompanied by severe restrictions of social contacts in semi-public spaces. Moreover, the regional lockdown approach implemented here on the level of counties (units of population around 100k) proofed to be successful, that is allowed to identify optimal entrance and release thresholds for lockdown.

Therapeutically, they are some of the most cost-effective drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases ranging from skin rashes to COVID-19, but their use is limited by adverse effects. Glucocorticoids exert their effects via the glucocorticoid receptor, a type I nuclear hormone receptor which modulates gene expression. The transcriptional activity of some related, but nuclear restricted, type II nuclear hormone receptors can be enhanced by a family of intracellular transport proteins, the fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). We find that the transcriptional activity of the GR can be altered by a sub-set of FABP family members dependent on the GR-ligand. The ability of some FABPs to selectively promote or limit the transcriptional activity of the GR in a ligand-dependent manner could facilitate the discovery of drugs that narrow GR activity to only the desired subset of therapeutically relevant genes.","Liu, Bonan; Chandrashekaran, Indu R.; Ilyichova, Olga; Valour, Damien; Melchiore, Fabien; Bourrier, Chantal; Giganti, Adeline; Stephan, Jean-Philippe; Dacquet, Catherine; Genissel, Patrick; Gosgnach, Willy; Weaver, Richard J.; Porter, Christopher J.H.; Scanlon, Martin J.; Halls, Michelle L.",bioRxiv,296,32

Results: The mean age of cases was 51.3 plus-or-minus sign 14.8 years. Thirty-two patients (47.8%) were classified as severe cases and 11 (16.4%) patients were categorized as critical. The frequency of blood lymphocytes, CD3+ cells, CD25+FOXP3+ T cells; and absolute count of CD3+ T cells, CD25+FOXP3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD16+56+ lymphocytes were lower in more severe cases in comparison to milder cases. Percentages of lymphocytes, T cells, and NK cells were significantly lower inthe patients who died (p= 0.002 and P= 0.042, p=0.006, respectively). Conclusion: Findings of this cohort study suggests that the frequency of CD4+, CD8+, CD25+FOXP3+ T cells, and NK cells were difference in the severe COVID-19 patients. Moreover, lower frequency of , T cells, and NK cells are predictors of mortality of these patients.","Rezaei, M.; Marjani, M.; Tabarsi, P.; Moniri, A.; purabdollah, M.; Abtahian, Z.; Kazempour Dizaji, M.; Dalil Roofchayee, N.; Dezfuli, N.

Many scenarios to reach net-zero emissions in buildings rely on electrification, but meeting the heat demand peaks in the winter can be challenging, particularly when wind and solar resources are low. This paper examines how to mitigate space heating demand peaks most cost-effectively in a top-down, sector-coupled model with carbon dioxide emissions constraint to be net-zero. It introduces the first model that co-optimises both supply and efficiency simultaneously including all European countries with hourly resolution. The competition between technologies to address these heating peaks, namely building retrofitting, thermal energy storage and individual hybrid heat pumps with backup gas boilers is examined. A novel thought experiment demonstrates that the level of building renovation is driven by the strong seasonal heat peaks, rather than the overall energy consumption. If all three instruments are applied, total costs are reduced by up to 17%. Building renovation enables the largest benefit with cost savings of up to 14% and allows individual gas boilers to be removed from the energy system without significant higher costs.","Zeyen, Elisabeth; Hagenmeyer, Veit; Brown, Tom",,296,1

However, the degree of specificity depends upon particular training protocols. Manipulating covert spatial attention during training facilitates learning transfer to other locations. Here we investigated whether feature-based attention (FBA), which enhances the representation of particular features throughout the visual field, facilitates VPL transfer, and how long such an effect would last. To do so, we implemented a novel task in which observers discriminated a stimulus orientation relative to two reference angles presented simultaneously before each block. We found that training with FBA enabled remarkable location transfer, reminiscent of its global effect across the visual field, but preserved orientation specificity in VPL. Critically, both the perceptual improvement and location transfer persisted after one year. Our results reveal robust, long-lasting benefits induced by FBA in VPL, and have translational implications for improving generalization of training protocols in visual rehabilitation.","Hung, Shao-Chin; Carrasco, Marisa",bioRxiv,296,25

This research focuses on the main issue of the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the organization of sports events (SEs), and in particular, cycling competitions. This study, therefore, aims to provide deeper insights into (a) the measures introduced to face the health emergency situation in cycling events, (b) the comparison of these measures with previous experiences in similar SE contexts, and (c) the possible evolution of organizational models for cycling events in the post-pandemic era. Fifteen semi-structured interviews with cycling athletes, managers, and officials constitute the methodological basis for this study. The results show that countermeasures have been taken that are effective in dealing with pandemic characteristics and are likely to be applied in the future, while others will be phased out or used again only when necessary. This study enhances scientific knowledge by analyzing a renewed approach to risk management for SEs, with a specific focus on pandemics and medical risks. Finally, the study shows that cycling events need to adapt the specifics of such a new approach to the standards projected on future scenarios for which the COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way.","Bazzanella, Filippo Muratore Nunzio Schlemmer Philipp Alexander Happ Elisabeth",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,296,1

Objectives: To describe capillaroscopic findings and their usefulness in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. Methods: We designed a cross-sectional study, carried out in a single care center for critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at the ABC Medical Center, Mexico City, which included patients from an intensive care unit (ICU) and internal medicine ward from March to April 2020. Demographic, biochemical and clinical features were collected. All patients signed the informed consent and the study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. All patients underwent nail capillary imaging of the 3 central fingers of each hand with a portable microscope with 60-100x magnification coupled to a smartphone with 7 megapixel images in an immersion medium. Capillaroscopy was performed in patients who did not have fever or hypothermia, or need vasopressors at the time of evaluation. Control subjects are healthy subjects matched on age and sex from a database of healthy controls without rheumatic diseases. Image evaluation of COVID-19 patients was performed in a blinded way for their characteristics. Prior to the analysis of the images, a pilot test was obtained with 4 rheumatologists in random cases, obtaining an acceptable global agreement in the visualization of capillaries and specific alterations of the nail bed. (Kappa = 0.58, p = 0.0019). Obtained data from capillaroscopies were used to be compared between severe and moderate cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Additionally, we compared the findings against a healthy population in order to establish a reference. Results: We included data from 27 patients and 32 controls with similar demographic features. Patients with COVID-19 patients had a mean age of 43 +/-13.8 years, 63% female. Comorbidities were present in 44.4% with: type II Diabetes Mellitus 18.5%, systemic arterial hypertension 18.5%, and rheumatoid arthritis 3.7%. The mean length of stay time was 13 +/-7.1 days, 48.1% were admitted to the ICU, and 40.7% required invasive mechanical ventilation. In the capillaroscopic review remarkable findings of patients vs. controls were hemosiderin deposits (33 vs 12.5%, p=0.05), less frequently observable capillaries (77 vs 100%, p=0.005), any abnormality in capillaries (25.9 vs. 6.3%, p=0.03). Of notice, specific findings in COVID-19 patients were capillary tortuosities in 19%, dilatation in 9.5%, serpentine pattern in 4.8%, bush pattern in 9.5% and decreased density in only 4.8% of the cases. No avascular areas or capillaries of neoformation were observed. Finally, the presence of hemosiderin was associated with worse presentation and risk factors for severe COVID-19: Male sex 66.7 vs. 27.8%, (p = 0.024);Admission to ICU 77% vs 33% (p = 0.029);BMI > 30 kg/m2 66.7 vs. 27.8% (p = 0.053). And risk for ICU admission OR = 7.0 (95% CI 1.098 -44.6). No significant associations were found for abnormalities in capillary morphology. Conclusion: We present one of the first reports of nailfold capillaroscopic findings in patients with COVID-19 and the first to compare to healthy controls. Previous data on this regard suggests the presence of endothelial dysfunction and microvascular complications such as micro hemorrhage or micro thrombosis. Further studies may confirm these findings and prognostic value for worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Bermudez Bermejo, P.

Here we show for the first time that brain network connectivity can change longitudinally as a result of a personalized receptive music-based intervention (MBI) in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Using a combination of whole-brain regression, seed-based connectivity analysis, and representational similarity analysis (RSA), we compared fMRI responses during a simple music listening task in older adults before and after an eight-week personalized music listening program. Participants rated self-selected and researcher-selected musical excerpts on liking and familiarity. Parametric effects of liking, familiarity, and selection showed significant activation of auditory, reward, default mode, and sensorimotor areas both pre- and post-intervention. Seed-based connectivity comparing pre- and post-intervention showed a significant increase in functional connectivity between auditory regions and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and this auditory-mPFC connectivity was modulated by participant liking and familiarity ratings. RSA showed significant representations of selection and novelty in auditory regions at both time-points, and an increase in striatal representation of musical stimuli following intervention. Taken together, results show a sensitivity of auditory, reward, default, and sensorimotor regions to individual differences in music familiarity and liking, as well as a shift in brain network dynamics following the personalized MBI. Results show how regular music listening can provide an auditory channel towards the mPFC, thus offering a potential neural mechanism supporting healthy brain aging.","Quinci, Milena Aiello; Belden, Alexander; Goutama, Valerie; Gong, Dayang; Hanser, Suzanne; Donovan, Nancy J.; Geddes, Maiya; Loui, Psyche",bioRxiv,296,16

The prevalence of CKD in cancer patients is close to 20-30% however there has been limited data about cancer patients with CKD and COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of this patient population at a tertiary cancer center. Methods: All patient data - demographics, labs, comorbidities and outcomes - were aggregated and analyzed in the Syntropy platform, Palantir Foundry ('Foundry'), as part of the Data-Driven Determinants of COVID-19 Oncology Discovery Effort (D3CODE) protocol at MD Anderson. The cohort was defined by the following: (1) positive COVID-19 test;(2) baseline eGFR 15-59 ml/min/1.73m2 calculated by chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation. The baseline GFR and creatinine values used the most temporally proximal lab results within 30 days prior to the patient's infection. AKI was defined as an absolute change of creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dl above the baseline after the positive COVID-19 test. Results: Out of 790 patients with COVID19,19.6% had underlying CKD. Among these, 86.5% and 46.5% had history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively. 77.3% had a solid malignancy and 87.3% of them had metastatic disease. 67.7% were asymptomatic, 14.2% required ICU admission, 10.3% required invasive ventilation support, and 11.6% died within 90 days of the COVID-19 test. AKI developed within the first 30 days in 61.3% and 8.4% required renal replacement therapy. AKI was more prevalent in patients who were hospitalized (84.2% vs. 31.7%, p&lt; 0.001), had concurrent pneumonia (63.3% vs. 36.8%, p&lt; 0.002), required critical care (68.3% vs. 15.8% , p&lt; 0.001), and were on ventilation support (16.8% vs. 0%, p=0.002).

Conclusions: The overall mortality rate of cancer patients with CKD and positive COVID-19 test was relatively high and close to 1.7 times the rate of patients with no CKD at our tertiary cancer center. AKI is a common complication in CKD patients with concurrent pneumonia and requiring ventilation support, and was associated with increased morality at 90 days.","Mamlouk, O.; Turin, A.; D039,; Achiardi, D.; Simbaqueba, C.; Dickson, K.; Franco-Vega, M.; Halm, J.; Mandayam, S.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,296,1

In clinical practice, the striking similarities observed at computed tomography (CT) between the diseases make it difficult to distinguish a COVID-19 superinfection from a progression of SSc-ILD. Objectives: The aim of our study was to identify the main CT features that may help distinguishing SSc-ILD from COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: 22 international readers were included and divided in the radiologist group (RAD) and non-radiologist group (nRAD). The RAD group included nonchest RAD and chest-RAD. A total of 99 patients, 52 with COVID-19 and 47 with SSc-ILD, were included in the study. Results: Fibrosis inside focal ground glass opacities (GGO) in the upper lobes;fibrosis in the lower lobe GGO;reticulations in lower lobes (especially if bilateral and symmetrical or associated with signs of fibrosis) were the CT parameters most frequently associated with SSc-ILD. The CT parameters most frequently associated with COVID-19 pneumonia were: consolidation (CONS) in the lower lobes, CONS with peripheral (both central/peripheral or patchy distributions), anterior and posterior CONS and rounded-shaped GGOs in the lower lobes. After multivariate analysis, the presence of CONS in the lower lobes (p <0.0001) and signs of fibrosis in GGO in the lower lobes (p <0.0001) remained independently associated with COVID-19 pneumonia or SSc-ILD, respectively. These two variables were combined in a predictive score which resulted positively associated with the COVID-19 diagnosis, with 96.1% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity: 3 different risk class for COVID-19 pneumonia may be identified: high risk for COVID-19 pneumonia (5-9 points);probable overlap COVID-19 pneumonia in SSc-ILD (4 points);low risk for COVID-19 pneumonia (0-3 points). Conclusion: The CT differential diagnosis between COVID-19 Pneumonia and SSc-ILD is possible and may be fostered in practice by the use of a radiological score. In the case where an overlap of both diseases is suspected, the presence of consolidation in the lower lobes may suggest a COVID-19 pneumonia while the presence of fibrosis inside GGO may indicate a SSc-ILD.","Orlandi, M.; Landini, N.; Sambataro, G.; Nardi, C.; Bruni, C.; Bellando-Randone, S.; Denton, C.; Luppi, F.; Ruaro, B.; Tomassetti, S.; Cavigli, E.; Melchiorre, F.; Palmucci, S.; Guiducci, S.; Moggi Pignone, A.; Allanore, Y.; Bartoloni, A.; Confalonieri, M.; Cortese, G.; Dagna, L.; De Cobelli, F.; De Paulis, A.; Harari, S.; Khanna, D.; Kuwana, M.; Miele, V.; Taliani, G.; Hughes, M.; Vanchieri, C.; Colagrande, S.; Matucci-Cerinic, M.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,296,1

While most research has analysed the impact of the pandemic on mainstream food systems, this article examines how alternative and local food systems (ALFS) in 13 countries responded in the first months of the crisis. Using primary and secondary data and combining the Multi-Level Perspective with social innovation approaches, we highlight the innovations and adaptations that emerged in ALFS, and how these changes have created or supported the sustainability transition in production and consumption systems. In particular, we show how the combination of social and technological innovation, greater citizen involvement, and the increased interest of policy-makers and retailers have enabled ALFS to extend their scope and engage new actors in more sustainable practices. Finally, we make recommendations concerning how to support ALFS’ upscaling to embrace the opportunities arising from the crisis and strengthen the sustainability transition. © 2021","Nemes, G.; Chiffoleau, Y.; Zollet, S.; Collison, M.; Benedek, Z.; Colantuono, F.; Dulsrud, A.; Fiore, M.; Holtkamp, C.; Kim, T.

Recently, we could show that plasma cell survival requires secreted factors such as APRIL and direct contact to stromal cells, which act in concert to activate NF-kB- and PI3K-dependent signaling pathways to prevent cell death. However, the precise dynamics of the underlying regulatory network are confounded by the complexity of potential interaction and cross-regulation pathways. Here, based on flow-cytometric quantification of key signaling proteins in the presence or absence of the required survival signals, we generated a quantitative model of plasma cell survival. Our model emphasizes the non-redundant and essential nature of the two plasma cell survival signals APRIL and stromal cell contact, providing resilience to endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial stress, respectively. Importantly, the modeling approach allowed us to unify distinct data sets and derive a consistent picture of the intertwined signaling and apoptosis pathways regulating plasma cell survival.","Burt, Philipp; Cornelis, Rebecca; Geißler, Gustav; Hahne, Stefanie; Radbruch, Andreas; Chang, Hyun-Dong; Thurley, Kevin",bioRxiv,296,1
173324,173324,173324,Spanish fact-checking services: An approach to their business models,14.152299,3.1607106,2021,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) infectious cycle starts with the viral adsorption and entry into the host cell. The virus is internalized via clathrin/dynamin mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. As several other viruses, ASF virion is then internalized and incorporated into the endocytic pathway. Endosomal maturation entails luminal acidification and the lowering of pH acting on the multi-layered virion structure dissolves the outer capsid. Upon decapsidation, the inner viral membrane is exposed to interact with the limiting membrane of the late endosome for fusion. Egress from endosome is related to cholesterol efflux, but it remains an intriguing process albeit essential for infection, specifically for the viral nucleic acid exit to the cytoplasm for replication. ASFV proteins E248R and E199L, with structural homology to the VACV proteins of the fusion complex, seem to have similar functions in ASFV. A direct interaction between these ASFV proteins with the cholesterol transporter protein NPC1 (Niemann-Pick C type 1) was observed, which was also shared by the E248R homologous protein L1R of VACV. Binding occurs between the transmembrane domain of E248R with the loop C of NPC1 at the same domain than EBOV binding site. These interactions suggest that these ASFV proteins are crucial for membrane fusion. CRISPR NPC1 KO Vero cells lacking NPC1 protein that were resistant to EBOV, reduced ASFV infection levels significantly. Reductions on ASFV infectivity and replication in NPC1 KO cells were accompanied by lesser viral factories of smaller size and lacking the typical cohesive morphology between endosomes and viral proteins. We observed a compensatory effect in NPC1 KO cells, elevating NPC2 levels while silencing NPC2 in Vero cells with shRNA, also reduced ASFV infection. Our findings pave the way to understand the role of these proteins at the membrane viral fusion step for several viruses. Author Summary African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a deadly disease of pigs and wild boars that was endemic in Africa but have extended over the last years to Europe, Asia and Oceania with high socioeconomic impact. ASFV enters the cell by endocytosis and has adapted to the endosomal conditions to acquire infectivity. Viral infectivity is dependent on cholesterol traffic at the endosomes, especially at the fusion step. Fusion of the internal viral membrane with the endosomal membrane is required for the exit of the viral DNA to the cytoplasm to start replication. ASF virion internal membrane proteins E248R and E199L were found to bind the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) receptor at the endosome. These proteins are highly conserved among ASFV isolates and resemble proteins of the VACV entry/fusion complex. The function of NPC1 is to regulate the efflux of dietary cholesterol efflux from the endosome to the endoplasmic reticulum, which appears to be necessary for viral fusion. NPC1 knockout cells by CRISPR reduced infection affecting infectivity and early replication. Also, removing the associated endosomal protein NPC2, further declined infectivity. These results show the relevance of NPC1 receptor in the viral infection actually shared by unrelated important viral families.","Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel Ángel; Urquiza, Jesús; del Puerto, Ana; Garcia-Dorival, Isabel; Lasala, Fátima; Barrado-Gil, Lucía; Galindo, Inmaculada; Delgado, Rafael; Alonso, Covadonga",bioRxiv,296,16

The optimal timing of salvage initiation remains uncertain although there is a trend to treating early biochemical relapse. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, delaying therapy of asymptomatic relapsed patients is also desirable, but avoidance of renal failure and symptomatic bony disease is important. Whole body STIR MRI with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has the potential to diagnose bone involvement at a very early, pre-symptomatic stage, before cortical destruction occurs. It may be a useful tool to assess the ability to defer therapy in myeloma patients with asymptomatic biochemical relapse. Methods: We performed a retrospective audit of newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic myeloma, diagnosed between April 2012 and Oct 2019. We studied only patients in first relapse who had achieved PR or better to first-line therapy. Patients were typically monitored with monthly serum protein electrophoresis and free light chain assessments. The preferred imaging modality during the study period was whole body STIR MRI with DWI analysis and additional dedicated spinal sequences. Response and relapse criteria were as defined by the IMWG with the exception that regular urine BJP monitoring was not performed. Rapid biochemical relapse was defined as per Sonneveld (ASH Education Book 2017). The decision to initiate therapy for relapse was at the discretion of the treating hematologist. Results: 125 patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma who achieved PR or better to first line therapy were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 64yrs (range, 32 to 89yrs) and 72% were male. Immunoglobulin type was IgG (54%), IgA (23%), light chain (22%) and IgD (1%). ISS stage was I (19%), II (60%) and III (21%) and 21% were high risk as defined by the presence of t(4;14), t(14;16) or del17p by bone marrow FISH. Half received autologous stem cell transplantation with bortezomib-based therapy being the commonest induction for both transplant- and non-transplant-eligible populations. Amongst this group with responsive disease, haematological response was CR (38%), VGPR (29%) and PR (33%). 75 (60%) of patients have relapsed at a median of 32 months. For patients in CR and VGPR, it took a median of 92 days from the first presence or increase in monoclonal immunoglobulin until IMWG defined relapse criteria were met. At the time of IMWG defined relapse, in terms of assessing need for therapy, the patients clinical status was defined as: rapid biochemical relapse (15%), relapse in a patient with high risk FISH (26%), relapse in a patient with renal failure at diagnosis (15%) and meeting CRAB criteria exclusive of MRI findings (7%), leaving 37% (n=27) in slow biochemical relapse without a definite indication for urgent therapy. MRI was performed as the bone imaging modality in 20 of these 27 slow biochemical relapse patients at a median of 42 days (range, -12 days to 210 days) after IMWG defined relapse: 10 demonstrated new focal bone lesions, 3 no lesions, 4 stable lesions and 3 improved bone lesions. Of these 10 patients with no new MRI detected bone disease, two were treated immediately at physician discretion. Thus, only 8 of 75 relapses were asymptomatic with a normal MRI, had no other indication for urgent therapy and were observed. For this group, the median time to treatment was 96 days (range, 34 to 576 days). Of these 5 had therapy initiated at physician discretion in the absence of clinical deterioration at a median of 78 days post biochemical relapse, one had treatment started 38 days after relapse due to renal deterioration and two were observed for 6 months and 1.4 years prior to the development of progressive focal bone lesions on MRI. None of the 10 patients with slow biochemical relapse and no new focal MRI bone lesions developed symptomatic bone disease within 6 months of that normal MRI. Conclusion: Whole body STIR MRI identifies new focal bone lesions in half of patients with slow biochemical relapse and no other treatment indication, jus ifying early therapy initiation at biochemical progression. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, whole body STIR MRI with DWI may also be a useful tool to identify patients with slow biochemical relapse who are suitable for careful observation rather than salvage chemotherapy. Only a minority (11% in our study) of relapses, however, are potentially suitable for this approach.

Since the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) can be potentially used for diagnosing dementia related diseases, it can be leveraged to devise a computer-aided screening tool. Objective: This work aims to develop an online screening tool by leveraging Artificial Intelligence and the CDT. Methods: Images of an analog clock drawn by 3,263 cognitively intact and 160 impaired subjects were used. First, we processed the images from the CDT by a deep learning algorithm to obtain dementia scores. Then, individuals were classified as belonging to either category by combining CDT image scores with the participants age. Results: We have evaluated the performance of the developed models by applying 5-fold cross validation on 20% of the dataset. The deep learning model generates dementia scores for the CDT images with an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 81.3%. A composite logistic regression model using age and the generated dementia scores, yielded an average AUC and average weighted F1 score of 92% and 94.4% , respectively. Discussion: CDT images were subjected to distortion consistent with an image drawn on paper and photographed by a cell phone. The model offers a cost-effective and easily deployable mechanism for detecting cognitive impairment online, without the need to visit a clinic.","Amini, S.; Zhang, L.; Hao, B.; Gupta, A.; Song, M.; Karjadi, C.; Lin, H.; Kolachalama, V.

The resulting model localized accurately in realistic conditions with noise and reverberation, outperforming alternative systems that lacked human ears. In simulated experiments, the network exhibited many features of human spatial hearing: sensitivity to monaural spectral cues and interaural time and level differences, integration across frequency, and biases for sound onsets. But when trained in unnatural environments without either reverberation, noise, or natural sounds, these performance characteristics deviated from those of humans.

Dynamic cybercrimes make it increasingly difficult for managers and researchers to anticipate the types, magnitude, and severity of future information security (ISec) breaches. Thus, we perform a systematic literature review (SLR) that explores, gathers, and categorizes event studies to examine the influence of favorable and unfavorable ISec events on stock markets. We extend the research conducted by Spanos and Angelis (2016) and provide a comprehensive understanding of the market's efficiency to process public information released about ISec events, ISec contingency factors, and the influence of ISec events on stock prices and factors other than price. Our systematic search reveals 58 relevant papers that include 80 studies. We find that in 75% of the studies ISec events can significantly affect a company's stock market performance, and that such effects are primarily exhibited within two days before and after the event day. Further, the magnitude of abnormal returns is higher in studies examining unfavorable ISec events, such as ISec breaches, compared to abnormal returns from favorable events, such as ISec investments and ISec certifications. In the end, our SLR serves as a foundation for ISec and management communities to build upon to keep industry and academia apprised of continually developing trends, new attack vectors and types of data breaches, protective ISec behaviors and programs, and their subsequent influences on stock market values and returns. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Ali, S.

The disease is caused by the SARs-Cov-2 which is related to the SARs-Cov-1 that causes SARs. There is evidence suggesting that the virus originated from the Rhinolophilid bats and has subsequently undergone recombination to allow for a natural selection for a human host and it is thought that the recombination might have occurred either prior or upon infection of the human host. These events of natural selection are presumed to have hastened human to human transmission. However, analyses of sequences from Covid-19 isolates from China and across the globe point to a unique case scenario that may suggest selection and evolution of the virus upon infection of the human host. In this paper we have examined the role of the human ACE-2 receptor in determining the predisposition to Covid-19 and analyzed Covid-19 sequences deposited in the virus database from around the globe to provide evidence that the disease burden is different across regions and among individuals as determined by the genetics of the virus and that the virus is rapidly evolving across regions and populations. Our phylogenetics data confirms that all strains circulating around the globe are related to the strains from China, the origin of the virus and further depicts varying degrees of similarity and disparity which suggests that the virus is mutating. While the USA has already been shown to have sequences closely related to the Wuhan sequences, here we report that the sequences from Spain and Africa are distantly related to the Wuhan sequences. Owing to the unique presentation of the disease in regions across the globe, the summary presented here informs of the need to tailor the management of the disease as dictated by viral and host genetic factors and the observed regional burden of the disease.","Muthanje, E.

Results The rate of COVID-19 positivity among the pediatric oncology patient attending oncology clinic of the hospital is 8.21%. Total 28 patients (12 from oncology clinic of our hospital and 16 from other hospitals referred to our COVID-19 unit) were included in our study. The most common malignancy was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (64.28%). The most common symptom was fever (64.28%). Oxygen therapy was needed for 42.85% patients. Eight patients required ICU admission (two required invasive ventilation and one required noninvasive ventilation). Positive C-reactive protein value was associated with severe disease requiring ICU admission. Mean delay in starting chemotherapy in newly diagnosed cases was 28.77 days (standard deviation = 9.67). One newly diagnosed patient expired due to preexisting disease. Conclusion Though vulnerable, most of the pediatric oncology patients suffered a mild COVID-19 infection without any significant COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. There is a significant delay in starting specific oncology therapy, that is, chemotherapy as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in newly diagnosed pediatric oncology patients, which can increase morbidities and mortality related to malignancy.","Chowdhoury, S.

Motivated by practical needs in medicine to risk-stratify patients into subgroups, DICE brings self-supervision to unsupervised tasks to generate cluster membership that may be used to categorize unseen patients by risk levels. DICE is driven by a combined objective function and constraint which require a statistically significant association between the outcome and cluster membership of learned representations. DICE also performs a neural architecture search to optimize cluster membership and hyper-parameters for model likelihood and classification accuracy. The performance of DICE was evaluated using two datasets with different outcome ratios extracted from real-world electronic health records of patients who were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 and heart failure. Outcomes are defined as in-hospital mortality (15.9%) and discharge home (36.8%), respectively. Results show that DICE has superior performance as measured by the difference in outcome distribution across clusters, Silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index for clustering, and Area under the ROC Curve for outcome classification compared to baseline approaches.","Huang, Y.",,296,17

Due to the debate on the source of the outbreak, wildlife meat consumption has gained international attention and become an area that requires further exploration. The purpose of this research is to explore the differences in game consumption motivations and behaviours among populations in northern and southern China. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey on wild meat awareness with (potential) game consumers across the country as target groups was conducted. Findings: Results from this study showed that consumers in the southern region have a preference for wildlife. This preference was determined by factors such as natural environment, history and culture and the level of economic development. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of game consumption between the north and south since game meat is not a major component of the daily diet. Practical implications: The government should consider banning this trade permanently to prevent future disease outbreaks caused by wildlife-to-human transmissions. Originality/value: The consumption of game meat is regional, but the animals in game trades live across a wider area, and thus, game trades have a global influence on ecological systems and human health. Therefore, this epidemic is also a global concern, which might lead people to display a highly negative attitude towards consuming game meat.","Wei, Lei Hao YiTing Zhu Hong Li Jun",British Food Journal,296,33

These measures capture the importance of hubs and neighborhood isolation in a network. In the earliest phases of the pandemic, neighborhood isolation rapidly increased, and the importance of downtown central business districts declined. Mobility hubs generally regained their importance, whereas neighborhood isolation remained elevated and increased again during the latter half of 2020. Linear regression models with city and week fixed effects find that new COVID-19 cases are positively associated with neighborhood isolation changes a week later. Additionally, places with larger populations, more public transportation use, and greater racial and ethnic segregation had larger increases in neighborhood isolation during 2020.","Marlow, T.; Makovi, K.; Abrahao, B.",Sociological Science,296,1

Methods We updated a living systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. in this update we modified our inclusion criteria to include: 1) cohort studies;2) cross-sectional studies that investigated and cross-assessed SARS-COV-2 positivity rates in schools and communities;and 3) pre-post studies. We performed risk of bias evaluation for all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results 6270 articles were retrieved and six new studies were added in this update. In total from the two updates and using the new inclusion criteria, we identified 1.1 cohort studies (1st update: n=5;2nd update: n=6) and one cross-sectional study (1st update: n=1;2nd update: n=0). We performed a meta-analysis on nine of the 11 cohort studies investigating IAR in schools. Nine cohort studies reported a total of 91 student and 52 staff index cases that exposed 5698 contacts with 101 secondary infections (overall infection attack rate (IAR) = 1.45%, 95% CI = 0.31%-3.26%). IARs for students and school staff were 1.66% (95% CI = 0.08%-4.78%) and 1.18% (95% CI = 0.00%-4.43%) respectively. The risk of bias was found to be high for most studies identified, limiting the confidence in results. Conclusions There is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission. Emerging evidence suggests the overall IAR and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in school settings are low. Higher TAR were found in students, compared to staff.","Xu, W.; Li, X.; Dong, Y.

Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is a rare disorder that can be potentially serious. In wAIHA, autoantibodies react with protein antigens on red blood cells (RBCs) at body temperature, leading to RBC phagocytosis and destruction by Fcg receptor-bearing macrophages in a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) dependent signaling pathway (see figure). Fostamatinib is a potent oral SYK inhibitor, approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Fostamatinib prevents platelet destruction in ITP through inhibition of SYK-dependent platelet phagocytosis by Fcγ receptor-bearing macrophages. Fostamatinib was evaluated in a phase 2, open-label, multicenter study (NCT02612558) for the treatment of wAIHA. Results of the study demonstrated that 11 of 25 (44%) patients had markedly improved hemoglobin (Hgb) levels after fostamatinib treatment. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with those in the fostamatinib safety database of >4000 patients across multiple diseases. Based on the results of the phase 2 study, a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study (NCT03764618) was initiated to investigate the safety and efficacy of fostamatinib in patients with wAIHA. The phase 3 study began enrolling patients this year and intends to enroll approximately 90 patients at 103 sites in 22 countries across North America, Europe, and Australia. This is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study to evaluate a SYK inhibitor for the treatment of wAIHA (see diagram). Study Design and Methods Inclusion Criteria include: • Age ≥18;• Diagnosis of primary or secondary wAIHA (documented by an IgG or IgA positive direct antiglobulin test [DAT]);• failure of ≥1 prior treatment for wAIHA;• Haptoglobin <LLN (lower limit of normal) or total bilirubin >ULN (upper limit of normal) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >ULN;• Baseline hemoglobin level ≤9 g/dL or, if hemoglobin is >9 g/dL to <10 g/dL, subject must be on a permitted wAIHA treatment AND have symptoms associated with anemia. Exclusion Criteria include: • Presence of other forms of AIHA;• Uncontrolled or insufficiently controlled hypertension;• Neutrophil count <1,000/µL, • Platelet count <30,000/μL (unless patient has Evans syndrome);• Transaminase levels >1.5 x ULN. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to fostamatinib or placebo for 24 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by concomitant steroid use and severity of anemia at baseline. The starting dose of fostamatinib is 100 mg BID and will be increased to 150 mg BID at Week 4, based on tolerability. The dose may be reduced in the event of dose-limiting AEs. At screening, patients may continue selected concurrent wAIHA therapies including steroids (maximum of 2 therapies) throughout the 24-week study period. A steroid taper protocol will allow reduced used of steroids in patients who have a hemoglobin response. Rescue therapy will be allowed as needed. Patients who complete the phase 3 study can rollover to an open-label extension study. The efficacy endpoints will include hemoglobin response, defined as a hemoglobin level ≥10 g/dL with a ≥2 g/dL increase from baseline (Day 1) in the absence of rescue therapy;duration of hemoglobin response;and the need for wAIHA rescue treatment. The safety endpoints will include the incidence of adverse events. Patients will be evaluated in the clinic, including safety and laboratory assessments, at two-week intervals. Statistics: A sample size of 90 subjects (randomized 1:1) would be required to provide 80% power to detect a difference in the response between the active and placebo groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 (based on results of the phase 2 study). The response rate will be compared between groups using a chi-square test adjusted for randomization stratification factors. Current enrollment status: As of July 2, 2020, 83 sites are open to screening (subject to local regulations about the COVID-19 pandemic), and 43 patien s have been randomized. Most patients (88%) had primary wAIHA, 12% had secondary disease including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis, scleroderma, smoldering Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus in 1 patient each. The median age at baseline is 61 years (range 28-87), and 63% are female. [Formula presented] Disclosures: Cooper: Amgen: Honoraria, Speakers Bureau;Novartis: Honoraria, Speakers Bureau.

In addition, prolonged hospital stay, invasive therapeutic devices, widespread use of empiric antibiotics and most importantly use of immune-suppressants like Steroid or Tocilizumab further increases the chances of bacterial infection. As opposed to this concept- physical distancing, frequent hand washing and use of gloves and protective gear by the healthcare workers also diminishes the chance of secondary bacterial infection. The present study is done to delineate the bacteriological profile, infection site predisposition or to gain knowledge on antibiotic sensitivity pattern. Method : Retrospective data will be analyzed from June 2020, when the first COVID wave came to June 2021, corresponding to second COVID wave. The present study is a pilot study before collecting and analyzing the whole data Only those samples which were positive for bacterial isolates were randomly selected and the COVID status and drug resistance patterns were checked. Results and discussion: The most common organism found was Klebsiella. Acinetobacter was also found in few patients. But most striking finding was that COVID positive patients showed higher incidence of antibiotic resistance with Acinetobacter. Though E Coli was also found commonly in COVID positive patients, they were not drug resistant. Conclusion: MDR infections are common in COVID patients. Acinetobacter and Klebsiella are prone to develope MDR infections. While E.Coli is also common in COVID patients, chance of drug resistance is less among them.","Haldar, A. K.; Mukherjee, D.

Traffic emissions remain a large contributor to air pollution in urban areas. The mobility restrictions put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic provided a large-scale real-world experiment that allows for the evaluation of changes in traffic emissions and the corresponding changes in air quality. Here we use observational data, as well as modelling, to analyse changes in nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter resulting from the COVID-19 restrictions at the height of the lockdown period in Spring of 2020. Accounting for the influence of meteorology on air quality, we found that reduction of ca. 30–50 % in traffic counts, dominated by changes in passenger cars, corresponded to reductions in median observed nitrogen dioxide concentrations of ca. 40 % (traffic and urban background locations) and a ca. 22 % increase in ozone (urban background locations) during weekdays. Lesser reductions in nitrogen dioxide concentrations were observed at urban background stations at weekends, and no change in ozone was observed. The modelled reductions in median nitrogen dioxide at urban background locations were smaller than the observed reductions and the change was not significant. The model results showed no significant change in ozone on weekdays or weekends. The lack of a simulated weekday/weekend effect is consistent with previous work suggesting that NOx emissions from traffic could be significantly underestimated in European cities by models. These results indicate the potential for improvements in air quality due to policies for reducing traffic, along with the scale of reductions that would be needed to result in meaningful changes in air quality if a transition to sustainable mobility is to be seriously considered. They also confirm once more the highly relevant role of traffic for air quality in urban areas.","von Schneidemesser, Erika Sibiya Bheki Caseiro Alexandre Butler Tim Lawrence Mark G.; Leitao, Joana Lupascu Aurelia Salvador Pedro",Atmospheric Environment: X,296,8

To understand the host immune responses against CCHFV, we have performed a global transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a longitudinal cohort of CCHF patients who survived and temporal untargeted proteomics analysis of CCHFV infected cells. Our results indicate that during the acute phase of CCHFV infection, the host’s metabolic reprogramming towards central carbon metabolism including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis occurs. This could be regulated by the PI3K/Akt, HIF-1, FoxO, and AMPK signaling pathways and play a central role in viral replication. Moreover, key interferon stimulating genes (ISGs; ISG12, ISG15, ISG20 and MXs; Mx1 and Mx2) are activated during infection, suggesting a role for type I and II interferon-mediated antiviral mechanisms. Targeting type I interferon response through metabolic perturbation could be an attractive therapeutic intervention for CCHFV as well as aid as antiviral strategies.","Neogi, Ujjwal; Elaldi, Nazif; Appelberg, Sofia; Ambikan, Anoop T.; Kennedy, Emma; Dowall, Stuart; Bagci, Binnur K.; Gupta, Soham; Rodriguez, Jimmy E.; Svensson-Akusjärvi, Sara; Monteil, Vanessa M.; Végvári, Ákos; Weber, Friedemann; Hewson, Roger; Mirazimi, Ali",bioRxiv,296,14

This Eastern European country experienced a number of challenges before the pandemic, including a war with Russia in the east of the country, high external debt, high energy intensity and low added value of the economy. The purpose of this study is to measure how deep the energy poverty problem in Ukraine is and how it changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying selected quantitative and financial indicators, the authors showed the problem of energy poverty in Ukraine remained acute at the beginning of 2020, especially in terms of heating. Moreover, its level in Ukraine was three times higher than the average level for the all the EU countries. Furthermore, in 2020, during the pandemic, there were drastic increasing arrears of households on utility bills that meant a new leap of energy poverty in Ukraine. This study did not search for the causes of the identified leap in energy poverty, which apparently connected with the global and local economic and social consequences of the pandemic. However, it revealed the depth of this problem and the lower impact of the nature factor (air temperature) on energy poverty during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is required to identify the underlying drivers and develop possible solutions to this problem in Ukraine and other European countries suffering from high energy poverty. © 2021.

The triplet loss (TL) is popularly used to generate realistic visual distributions from semantics by automatically searching discriminative representations. However, the traditional TL cannot search reliable unseen disentangled representations due to the unavailability of unseen classes in ZSL. To alleviate this drawback, we propose in this work a multi-modal triplet loss (MMTL) which utilizes multimodal information to search a disentangled representation space. As such, all classes can interplay which can benefit learning disentangled class representations in the searched space. Furthermore, we develop a novel model called Disentangling Class Representation Generative Adversarial Network (DCR-GAN) focusing on exploiting the disentangled representations in training, feature synthesis, and final recognition stages. Benefiting from the disentangled representations, DCR-GAN could fit a more realistic distribution over both seen and unseen features.

Of course, the investment required to determine with full accuracy the components of the street economy (how many people, where they work, and what are the characteristics of these people), which have a very dynamic structure, are usually based on social needs, is very large. However, by photographing the street economy on a regional basis, today the need to regulate this sector, which has more impact on the mental and physical health of both the individual and society than ever before, is strongly manifested. In this study, a systematic layout proposal was tried to be proposed for this arrangement. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Kellevezir, I.",Contemporary Studies in Economic and Financial Analysis,296,25

The COVID-19 pandemic represented the first large-scale opportunity to shed light into mechanisms of action, safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma using modern evidence-based medicine approaches. Studies ranging from observational case series to randomized controlled trials (RCT) have reported highly variable efficacy results for COVID-19 CP (CCP), resulting in more doubt than certainty. Reasons for CCP success and failure may be hidden in study details, which are usually difficult to explain to physicians and the public but provide fertile ground for designing next-generation studies. In this paper we analyzed variables associated with efficacy such as clinical settings, disease severity, CCP SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and function, dose, timing of administration (variously defined as time from onset of symptoms, molecular diagnosis, diagnosis of pneumonia, or hospitalization, or by serostatus), outcomes (defined as hospitalization, requirement for ventilation, clinical improvement or mortality), CCP provenance and time for collection, and criteria for efficacy. Focusing only on the results from the 23 available RCT we noted that these were more likely to show signals of efficacy, including reductions in mortality, if the plasma neutralizing titer was [≥] 160 and the time to randomization was [≤] 9 days, consistent with passive antibody therapy efficacy requiring dosing with sufficient antibody. The fact that most studies revealed signals of efficacy despite variability in CCP and its use suggest robust therapeutic effects that become apparent despite the data noise.","Focosi, D.; Franchini, M.; Pirofski, L.-a.; Burnouf, T.; Paneth, N.; Joyner, M.

We further aimed to estimate the impact of HIV infection and age on disease burden and transmission, and to assess the burden of Bordetella pertussis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Participants We enrolled 1684 individuals in 327 randomly selected households in two sites (rural Agincourt subdistrict, Mpumalanga Province and urban Jouberton Township, North West Province) over 3 consecutive influenza and RSV seasons. A new cohort of households was enrolled each year. Eligible households included those with >2 household members where [≥]80% of household members provided consent (and assent for children aged 7-17 years). Enrolled household members were sampled with nasopharyngeal swabs twice weekly during the RSV and influenza seasons of the year of enrolment. Serology samples were collected at enrolment and before and after the influenza season annually. Findings to date There were 122,113 potential individual follow-up visits over the 3 years, and participants were interviewed for 105,783 (87%) of these. Out of 105,683 nasopharyngeal swabs from follow-up visits, 1,258 (1%), 1,026 (1%), 273 (<1%), 38,829 (37%) tested positive on PCR for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, pertussis and pneumococcus respectively. Future plans Future planned analyses include analysis of influenza serology results and RSV burden and transmission. Households enrolled in the PHIRST study during 2016-2018 were eligible for inclusion in a study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission initiated in July 2020. This study uses similar testing frequency and household selection methods to assess the community burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of asymptomatic infection in virus transmission.

Experimental research was conducted with three groups (two experimental groups and a control group) to explore (a) the impact of the introduction of STEM in Maker knowledge learning effectiveness, Maker self-efficacy, and Maker works;(b) the effect of introducing VR on the recognition of Makerspace;and (c) the effect of Maker courses on the development of Maker skills. The results show that the proposed Maker course improves students' Maker self-efficacy, and that STEM-based instruction has a significant impact on learning effectiveness. However, according to the profile evaluations, the STEM-oriented group's Maker works were more complicated and systematic than that of experiment group 1. Moreover, the VR groups (groups 1 and 2) were more familiar with Makerspace than was the PPT group (the control group). Therefore, the findings indicate that when Makerspace is introduced, VR content is a more effective teaching method than PowerPoint slides. Second, the Maker curriculum improves students' Maker self-efficacy. Specifically, STEM-oriented instruction improves students' Maker knowledge, complexity, and completion of Maker works.","Shu, Yu Huang Tien-Chi",Journal of Educational Research,296,1

Vegetation and soil are known to be key sources of airborne microbiota––the aerobiome. Only a limited number of studies have attempted to characterise the dynamics of the aerobiome, and no studies to date have investigated these dynamics from a vertical perspective simulating human exposure. Studies of pollution and allergenic pollen show vertical stratification at various scales, and present an expectation that such vertical stratification may also be present in the aerobiome. Such stratification could have important implications for public health and for the design, engineering and management of urban green spaces. For example, do children receive the same exposure to airborne microbiota as taller adults, and what are the downstream implications for health? In this study, we combine an innovative columnar sampling method at soil level, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 m together with high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to assess whether significant vertical stratification of the aerobiome occurred in a parkland habitat in Adelaide, South Australia. Our results provide evidence of vertical stratification in both alpha and beta (compositional) diversity of airborne bacterial communities, with diversity increasing roughly with height. We also found significant vertical stratification in known pathogenic and beneficial bacterial taxa, suggesting potentially different exposure attributes between adults and children. These results could have important implications for public health and urban planning, potentially informing ways to optimise the design and management of health-promoting urban green spaces.","Robinson, Jake M.; Cando-Dumancela, Christian; Liddicoat, Craig; Weinstein, Philip; Cameron, Ross; Breed, Martin F.",bioRxiv,296,24

However, after two weeks, theatres opened, and productions from New York City's Broadway, such as the musical comedy Ask Dad, appeared at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, to rave reviews. Toronto's stages became more diverse following the Spanish flu, with productions such as Shuffle Along, the first all-Black musical on Broadway, which hit the city's stages in 1923, and one of the first locally cast shows, Amateur Minstrel Frolics, which appeared in 1924 at the Winter Garden Theatre.

These are not only evaluations of the economic efficiency of milk production. Opinions expressed by various social groups are also an important contribution to improving the approach to milk production on the farm. As a result of such opinions, a vision of an ideal dairy farm may be formed. The aim of the study was to develop the thematic area of an ideal dairy farm in the opinion of two groups of students who were learning remotely (in the distance learning system) due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The first group consisted of six Erasmus+ students. The second group consisted of 70 full-time Polish students. As part of their homework, the students answered three questions about the ideal dairy farm. Students had 4 weeks to do their homework. Erasmus+ students’ homework was used to propose a ranking method for assessing the answers to three questions by the students themselves. Homework of Polish students was used to analyze the frequency of using certain keywords. Polish students, in their homework on the ideal dairy farm, mainly used the basic concepts related to dairy production. Unfortunately, a very small number of students used terms that represent a responsible approach to dairy production, including ethical aspects, freedom, sustainability, animal pain, antibiotics, and organic milk production. In conclusion, it was indicated that the curriculum should be structured in such a way as to raise students’ awareness of dairy production and its current challenges. © 2021 by the authors.

To address this question, we systematically examined variation in vertebrate eDNA signatures across depth (0 m to 10 m) and horizontal space (nearshore and surf zone) over three successive days in a Southern California kelp forest. Across a broad range of marine vertebrates (teleosts, elasmobranchs, birds, and mammals), results showed significant variation in species richness and community assemblages across 4-5 m depth, reflecting microhabitat depth preferences of common Southern California nearshore rocky reef taxa. We also found significant differences in community assemblages between nearshore and surf zone sampling stations at the same depth, and across three sampling days. Patterns of microhabitat partitioning in eDNA signatures across space and time were largely consistent with known habitat preferences and species behavior. Results highlight the sensitivity of eDNA in capturing fine-scale vertical, horizontal, and temporal variation in marine vertebrate communities, demonstrating the ability of eDNA to capture a highly localized snapshot of marine biodiversity in dynamic coastal environments.","Monuki, Keira; Barber, Paul H.; Gold, Zachary",bioRxiv,296,1

However, the existing literature generally neglects the role of actors' behaviour and agency within property market shifts, and how market shifts affect cities. In response, we establish a framework that systematically unpacks the role, characteristics and behaviour of property investors in investment market shifts within urban development. We consider market shifts as modifications to established economic and regulatory processes and argue that a multidimensional approach is required to understand property investors and their role within property investment markets that shapes the urban built environment. Our main contribution is a novel approach and methodology to read changing property investor landscapes by linking wider economic and regulatory changes to investment actors and their investment strategies. Empirically, we focus on Amsterdam's changing investor landscape over the last 15 years. We investigate how crises, represented by far-reaching institutional disruptions of economic and regulatory systems, relate to Amsterdam's landscape of property investors. Correspondingly, we define three distinct periods of analysis, based on transaction volumes and regulatory interventions at national and local levels: the pre-global financial crisis (GFC) period from 2005 to 2008, the post-GFC recovery period from 2009 to 2013, and the pre-Covid19 boom period from 2014 to 2020. We reveal how Amsterdam's investor landscape changed over the course of these periods through a mixed methods analysis, including quantitative investment transaction analysis, mapping, and in-depth interviews with investors. We ultimately suggest that reading property market shifts through multidimensional characteristics would enable more targeted policy solutions, moving away from empirically ill-supported stereotypes of property actor behaviours.","Tasan-Kok, T.; Ozogul, S.; Legarza, A.",European Urban and Regional Studies,296,5

Some complex organs of the human body which cannot be seen visible even after dissection of the cadaver can be printed using a 3D printer which provides haptic studies on organs and bones to students. These 3D printed parts can be used in pre-operative planning such as analysis and diagnosis formulation of affected organs. Further, it can be used in explaining the operative procedures to patients which helps them to understand and co-operate with the medical procedures. Therefore, this project aims at 3DP of complex organs and bones for anatomical studies and pre-operative planning procedures. As a first step in the project, some of the human bones were printed and analyzed for its quality.","Paramasivam, V.; Sindhu,; Singh, G.; Santhanakrishnan, S.",Procedia Manufacturing,296,12

The NCI NCTN was developed to support rapid trial start-up of NCI-funded cancer control/prevention, cancer treatment, and nontherapeutic clinical trials that occur within the institution through centralized institutional administration and shared clinical resource allocation (personnel, lab services). TMIST is a randomized clinical trial assessing two breast cancer screening imaging modalities, tomosynthesis and digital mammography, in the population of women presenting for screening mammography and therefore requires active involvement of radiology. Methods: TMIST seeks to enroll 164,946 women, ages 45 to 74 years who present for screening mammography. Because the population under evaluation are women already scheduled for screening mammography, the mammography clinic is critical to successful recruitment as well as adherence to imaging randomization assignments over a 5-year period and therefore must be actively engaged in this trial with a breast imaging radiologist championing the trial within this service. To get active engagement of breast imaging radiologists, we needed to first make them aware of TMIST. Breast imaging radiologists that were already actively involved in the NCTN received notification of the trial through the NCTN email lists. So our goal was to come up with a strategy to reach out to breast imaging radiologists that were not active members in the NCTN. This was achieved through in-person informational sessions to introduce the trial at national and international breast imaging meetings, introduction of the trial and the workings of the NCTN network to the radiology community through articles placed in American College of Radiology (ACR) newsletters, ads promoting TMIST on ACR social media platforms, and direct email by the TMIST study chair to key radiology stakeholders. As of February 15, 2021, there are 115 sites open: 106 in the U.S. and 9 internationally with an additional 54 sites planning to open. A total of 39,366 women are enrolled in the trial with twothirds also consenting to optional blood and/or buccal cell collection. Minority populations' participation in the trial is over 20%. A significant drop in enrollment occurred in Spring 2020 coinciding with the suspension of mammography services globally due to COVID-19 beginning mid- March 2020. Enrollment and follow-up screening visits for TMIST restarted in May 2020 and gradually ramped back up to pre-COVID totals in September 2020. Our highest monthly accrual so far occurred in November 2020 with 2,148 subjects enrolled.","Pisano, E.; Gatsonis, C.; Schnall, M. D.; Yaffe, M.; Troester, M. A.; Gareen, I. F.; Collins, L.

We hypothesize that in The Netherlands the same environmental factors and mobility trends that are associated with the seasonality of flu-like illnesses are predictors of COVID-19 seasonality as well. Methods: We used meteorological, pollen/hay fever and mobility data from the Netherlands with its 17.4 million inhabitants. For the reproduction number of COVID-19 (Rt), we used data from the Dutch State Institute for Public Health. This Rt metric is a daily estimate that is based on positive COVID-19 tests in the Netherlands in hospitals and municipalities. For all datasets we selected the overlapping period of COVID-19 and the first allergy season: from February 17, 2020 till September 21, 2020 (total number of measurements: n = 218), the end of pollen season. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop an environmental prediction model of the Rt of COVID-19. Next, we studied whether adding mobility trends to an environmental model improved the predictive power. Results: By means of stepwise backward multiple linear regression four highly significant (p value < 0.01) predictive factors are selected in our combined model: temperature, solar radiation, hay fever incidence, and mobility to indoor recreation locations. Our combined model explains 87.5% of the variance of Rt of COVID-19 and has a good and highly significant fit: F(4, 213) = 374.2, p-value < 0.00001. The combined model had a better overall predictive performance compared to a solely environmental model, which still explains 77.3% of the variance of Rt, and a good and highly significant fit: F(4, 213) = 181.3, p < 0.00001. Conclusions: We conclude that the combined mobility and environmental model can adequately predict the seasonality of COVID-19 in a country with a temperate climate like the Netherlands. In this model higher solar radiation, higher temperature and hay fever are related to lower COVID-19 reproduction, and mobility to indoor recreation locations with increased COVID-19 spread.","Hoogeveen, M.

Real time RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction), which is the standard detection method for COVID-19, is likely to have low detection rate in early stages of the infection possibly due to less viral load in the patients. On the other hand, in comparison to RT-PCR, patterns obtained from radiography on chest CT scans show higher sensitivity and specificity. However, due to the sensitive nature and difficulties in publicly acquiring medical data, only 2 open-sourced COVID CT datasets with images containing clinical findings of COVID-19 could be found. Applying existing deep learning models to the limited CT scans can distinguish COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT images but with lesser accuracy. The paper proposes to use existing deep learning-based frameworks on an augmented dataset consisting of pixel scaled images (of the original CT images) and the original CT images to diagnose COVID-19 infection. Since this is a binary classification problem the paper proposes to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify CT images into infected and not infected categories. The implementation is done with Keras and Tensorflow using an 80/20 ratio for training and validation. The proposed methodology (using pixel scaled images) achieved a validation accuracy of over 90% in detecting COVID-19 with an F1-score of 0.96 compared to the best F1-score of 0.86 on the original dataset. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Shetty, S.; Gawade, A.; Deolekar, S.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,296,5

OBJECTIVES The aims are to provide education and guidance for interventional pain specialists and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic that minimizes COVID-related morbidity while allowing a return to interventional pain care. METHODS The methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards, appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest, as well as a panel of experts from various regions, specialities, and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification were reviewed. The principles of best evidence synthesis of available literature and grading for recommendations as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) typically utilized in ASIPP guideline preparation was not utilized in these guidelines due to limitations because of their lack of available literature on COVID-19, risk mitigation and stratification. These guidelines are considered evidence -- informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS Numerous risk factors have emerged that predispose patients to contracting COVID-19 and/or having a more severe course of the infection. COVID-19 may have mild symptoms, even be asymptomatic, or may be severe and life threatening. Older age and certain comorbidities, such as underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, have been associated with worse outcomes. In pain care, COVID-19 patients are a heterogeneous group with some individuals relatively healthy and having only a short course of manageable symptoms while others become critically ill. It is necessary to assess patients on a case-by-case basis and craft individualized care recommendations. A COVID-ARMS risk stratification tool was created to quickly and objectively assess patients. Interventional pain specialists and their patients may derive important benefits from evidence-informed risk stratification, protective strategies to prevent infection, and the gradual resumption of treatments and procedures to manage pain. LIMITATIONS COVID-19 was an ongoing pandemic at the time during which these recommendations were developed. The pandemic has created a fluid situation in terms of evidence-informed guidance. As more and better evidence is gathered, these recommendations may be modified. CONCLUSIONS Chronic pain patients require continuity of care but during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, steps must be taken to stratify risks and protect patients from possible infection to safeguard them from COVID-19-related illness and transmitting the disease to others. Pain specialists should optimize telemedicine encounters with their pain patients, be cognizant of risks of COVID-19 morbidity, and take steps to evaluate risk-benefit on a case-by-case basis. Pain specialists may return to practice with lower-risk patients and appropriate safeguards.","Shah, Shalini; Diwan, Sudhir; Soin, Amol; Rajput, Kartic; Mahajan, Amit; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Kaye, Alan D; Hirsch, Joshua A; Gharibo, Christopher",Pain physician,296,28

Children with FRRI were defined as having > or =9 episodes of upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and/or > or =4 episodes of acute otitis media during follow-up. Nasopharyngeal aspirates, middle ear fluid specimens, and serum samples were analyzed for 8 common respiratory viruses. Of 1358 URI episodes, 642 (47%) occurred in the 78 children with FRRI. At least 1 virus was associated with 62% of these episodes, whereas the corresponding figure for children without FRRIs was 54%. The frequency of different viruses was similar in both groups, but the relative proportion of rhinovirus infections was slightly higher among children with FRRI. In conclusion, a specific viral etiology does not explain the excess of URI episodes in children with FRRI.","Nokso-Koivisto, Johanna; Pitkäranta, Anne; Blomqvist, Soile; Jokinen, Jukka; Kleemola, Marjaana; Takala, Aino; Kilpi, Terhi; Hovi, Tapani",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,296,12

The heart of taxonomy is the biological species, which forms the foundation for higher levels of classification. Whereas species have long been established among sexual eukaryotes, achieving a meaningful species concept for prokaryotes has been an onerous task and has proven exceedingly difficult for describing viruses and bacteriophages. Moreover, the assembly of viral ""species"" into higher-order taxonomic groupings has been even more tenuous, since these groupings were based initially on limited numbers of morphological features and more recently on overall genomic similarities. The wealth of nucleotide sequence information that catalyzed a revolution in the taxonomy of free-living organisms necessitates a reevaluation of the concept of viral species, genera, families, and higher levels of classification. Just as microbiologists discarded dubious morphological traits in favor of more accurate molecular yardsticks of evolutionary change, virologists can gain new insight into viral evolution through the rigorous analyses afforded by the molecular phylogenetics of viral genes. For bacteriophages, such dissections of genomic sequences reveal fundamental flaws in the Linnaean paradigm that necessitate a new view of viral evolution, classification, and taxonomy.","Lawrence, Jeffrey G; Hatfull, Graham F; Hendrix, Roger W",Journal of bacteriology,296,20

While commendable, justifiable, and compassionate, EA programs are not designed to collect the necessary vital clinical data that can be later used in the New Drug Application process before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In particular, they lack the necessary rigor of properly crafted and controlled randomized controlled trials (RCT) which ensure that each patient closely monitored for side effects and other potential dangers associated with the drug, that the data is documented, stable and are traceable and that the patient population is well defined with the defined target condition. Overall, while RCTs is deemed to be of the most reliable methodologies within evidence-based medicine, morally, however, they are problematic in EA programs. Nevertheless, actionable data ought to be collected from EA patients. To this end, we look to the growing incorporation of real-world data real-world evidence as increasingly useful substitutes for data collected via RCTs, including the ethical, legal and social implications thereof.

In this cross-sectional case control study, in addition to bacteria, we aimed to determine respiratory viruses using, for the first time in our country, the Reverse Transcription PCR DNA Microarray method, and we also aimed to evaluate its diagnostic performance. METHODS Respiratory viruses were investigated from nasopharyngeal swabs of 76 patients diagnosed with atypical pneumonia and 64 healthy controls using the CLART Pneumovir (Genomica, Spain) kit and from 10 mL blood samples of the same subjects. M. pneumoniae IgM was detected by ELISA and L. pneumophila IgM and C. pneumoniae IgM by indirect immunofluorescence. Person's chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Our results showed that the specificity (100%) and the positive predictive value (100%) of the CLART Pneumovir kit were high, but its sensitivity (53%), its negative predictive value (64%), and its kappa value (50%) were low. Parainfluenza Virus type 3 and M. pneumoniae were found alone or together as the most common microorganisms while no cases of human bocavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, or coronavirus were detected.

We aimed to evaluate the physical and mental health of fibromyalgia patients during the COVID 19 outbreak and identify protective/risk factors. METHODS An online survey was published in May 2020, following two months of lockdown due to the COVID 19 outbreak, including questionnaires regarding demographic characteristics, access to medical services, anxiety, depression, life approach, coping strategies, perception of social support, widespread pain index (WPI) and symptoms severity scale (SSS), insomnia severity index (ISI) and patient global assessment. RESULTS Of the 233 patients included in the study, 98% were forced to discontinue complementary - alternative treatments during lockdown. Up to 30% of responders who had been treated with medical cannabis had to stop due to logistic difficulties and this was associated with significantly higher scores of WPI/SSS (p=0.024). Higher levels of anxiety and depression were significantly correlated with higher levels of pain, sleep disorders and subjective perception of deterioration (p=0.00). Higher scores of social support and positive life approach were correlated with less anxiety and depression (p<0.01), lower levels of pain (p<0.05) and less sleep disturbances (p<0.01). Avoidant coping style was strongly associated to higher levels of pain, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, and subjective perception of worsening (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Fibromyalgia patients reported adverse mental and physical outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak. Factors such as stopping current treatments may play a central role. Social support and a positive life approach appear to be protective.","Aloush, Valerie; Gurfinkel, Avital; Shachar, Noam; Ablin, Jacob N; Elkana, Odelia",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,296,20

Motivated by the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK, we determine, using stochastic simulations and deterministic 'moment closure' models of disease transmission on networks of premises (nodes), network and disease properties that are important for contact tracing efficiency. For random networks with a high average number of connections per node, little clustering of connections and short latency periods, contact tracing is typically ineffective. In this case, isolation of infected nodes is the dominant factor in determining disease epidemic size and duration. If the latency period is longer and the average number of connections per node small, or if the network is spatially clustered, then the contact tracing performs better and an overall reduction in the proportion of nodes that are removed during an epidemic is observed.","Kiss, Istvan Z; Green, Darren M; Kao, Rowland R",Proceedings.

We show that this cap binding also occurs in vivo and that, while this activity is required for expression of viral information (killer toxin mRNA level and toxin production) in a wild-type strain, this requirement is suppressed by deletion of SKI1/XRN1/SEP1. We propose that the virus creates decapped cellular mRNAs to decoy the 5'-->3' exoribonuclease specific for cap- RNA encoded by XRN1. The SKI2 antiviral gene represses the copy numbers of the L-A and L-BC viruses and the 20S RNA replicon, apparently by specifically blocking translation of viral RNA. We show that SKI2, SKI3, and SKI8 inhibit translation of electroporated luciferase and beta-glucuronidase mRNAs in vivo, but only if they lack the 3' poly(A) structure. Thus, L-A decoys the SKI1/XRN1/SEP1 exonuclease directed at 5' uncapped ends, but translation of the L-A poly(A)- mRNA is repressed by Ski2,3,8p. The SKI2-SKI3-SKI8 system is more effective against cap+ poly(A)- mRNA, suggesting a (nonessential) role in blocking translation of fragmented cellular mRNAs.","Masison, D C; Blanc, A; Ribas, J C; Carroll, K; Sonenberg, N; Wickner, R B",Molecular and cellular biology,296,23

These contain a common leader sequence derived from the 5' non-coding region of the genomic RNA. In this study, the sequence of the junction sites, i.e. the sites where the leader sequence joins to the body of the subgenomic RNA, was determined for all six subgenomic RNAs. For each subgenomic RNA, six to nine cDNA clones were isolated by means of reverse transcription and PCR. The nucleotide sequence at the junction site was identical for all eight cDNA clones derived from subgenomic RNA4. However, heterogeneity was observed in the nucleotide sequence surrounding the junction sites of the cDNA clones derived from subgenomic RNAs 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7. This heterogeneity suggests that the fusion of the leader to the body of the subgenomic RNA may be imprecise. The junction sites of the six subgenomic RNAs had a conserved sequence motif of six nucleotides (UCAACC or a highly similar sequence). The distance between the junction site and the translation initiation codon of the downstream open reading frame varied from nine to 83 nucleotides.","Meulenberg, J J; de Meijer, E J; Moormann, R J",The Journal of general virology,296,16

Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones, were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body, SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs, including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the antiviral medications listed and discussed in this article have been effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients or preventing the virus from spreading further. However, other drugs have to be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion about their effectiveness or ineffectiveness.","Rommasi, F; Nasiri, M J; Mirsaiedi, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,296,1

Several documents confirm the clinical efficacy of this therapy for treating bacterial and viral infections. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search was conducted by August 2020 using global databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane library, Google scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used to evaluate the included studies. Using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA), the pooled data analysis process was performed. Results: A total of 15 eligible articles were enrolled in the current quantitative synthesis. The statistical analysis showed that clinical improvement in the group of patients who had received convalescent plasma was significantly increased compared to the control group (OR: 2.23; 1.12-4.45 with 95% CIs; p value: 0.022; Q-value: 6.11; I 2 : 83.64; Eggers p value: 0.064; Beggs p value: 0.093).

METHODS: We assessed the presence of viral RNA in samples from environmental surfaces before and after UV LED irradiation in COVID-19 patient rooms after patient discharge. RESULTS: We analyzed 216 environmental samples from 17 rooms: 2 from airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 15 from isolation rooms in the community treatment center (CTC). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in 40 (18.5%) of 216 samples after patient discharge: 12 (33.3%) of 36 samples from AIIRs in the ICU, and 28 (15.6%) of 180 samples from isolation rooms in the CTC. In 1 AIIR, all samples were PCR negative after UV LED irradiation. In the CTC rooms, 14 (8.6%) of the 163 samples were PCR positive after UV LED irradiation. However, viable virus was not recovered from the culture of any of the PCR-positive samples. CONCLUSIONS: Although no viable virus was recovered, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on various environmental surfaces. The use of a UV LED disinfection robot was effective in spacious areas such as an ICU, but its effects varied in small spaces like CTC rooms. These findings suggest that the UV LED robot may need enough space to disinfect rooms without recontamination by machine wheels or insufficient disinfection by shadowing.","Choi, Hee Kyoung; Cui, Chunguang; Seok, Hyeri; Bae, Joon-Yong; Jeon, Ji Hoon; Lee, Gee Eun; Choi, Won Suk; Park, Man-Seong; Park, Dae Won",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,296,13

A recent study by Kemp and colleagues in Cancer Research identified an immuno-modulatory axis originating in tumor-associated macrophages whereby macrophage-derived apolipoprotein E (APOE) activates NF-&#954;B in tumor cells in a paracrine manner, inducing expression of immunosuppressive chemokines. In contrast, APOE promotes antitumor immunity in other cancer types including melanoma, highlighting the context dependency of APOE signaling and its impact on the tumor microenvironment. As new immunotherapy approaches increasingly aim to modulate both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments of the PDAC immune milieu, identification of specific mechanisms that foster macrophage-mediated immune suppression may facilitate the development of effective strategies that enable the immune system to tackle these tumors.See related article by Kemp et al., p. 4305.","Sherman, Mara H",Cancer Res,296,1

We used SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases. RESULTS: Of 70 patient enrolled, the mean age was 57.0 years and 29 patients (41%) were men. Median Charlson comorbidity index was 1.70(±2.5). Twenty-seven (39%) patients had pneumonia. Fatigue (93% [65]), cough (80% [55]) and fever (77% [54]) were the three main symptoms. Neurologic symptoms were present in more than half of the patients: anosmia (53% [37]) and dysgeusia (48% [34]). The mean duration of anosmia was 7.4 (±5, [1-21]) days, 51% (36/70) recovered before 28 days of evolution. Only one patient with anosmia had not recovered at the end of the follow-up. Patients with anosmia had less often a pneumonia (10/37 vs 17/33, p = 0.036), were less often hospitalized (13/37 vs 20/33, p = 0.033) and needed less often oxygen therapy (6/37 vs 17/33, p = 0.002) than patients without anosmia. There were no statistically differences for viral load between patients with anosmia and patients without anosmia (5.5 [2.0-8.6] vs 5.3 [2.1-8.5] log copies/ml respectively, p = 0.670). The fatality of COVID-19 in our study was 6% with four deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia and dysgeusia are present in half of COVID-19 patients.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia currently represents a worldwide health problem; the correlations between cardiovascular disease, myocardial injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear, but initial data show that myocardial damage represents a negative prognostic factor. Myocardial injury during SARS-CoV-2, as defined by a pathological rise in circulating troponin levels, is not an uncommon complication in hospitalized patients, and is significantly more frequent in intensive care unit patients and among those who died. In this setting, myocardial injury is mainly secondary to type 2 myocardial infarction (mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand during respiratory failure); other causes include myocarditis, coronary thrombosis, sepsis or septic shock. At present, only few cases of TTS have been described during SARS-CoV-2.

Firstly, while Covid-19 provides a vivid contextualisation of many biological concepts, it does not change the underlying concepts themselves. Moreover, it will not take long before it passes from being contemporary experience to a historical case study. Care is, therefore, needed to retain focus on the core concepts of biology, rather than allocating too much time to the particulars of the Covid-19 case.

In Nepal, urban dwelling has increased in recent years, raising requirement for low-cost, mass produced bricks to meet the population needs. Working equids (WEs) play a key role in non-mechanised kilns. Assessing the welfare of these equids is the starting point to addressing concerns. In line with One Welfare principles, the health and welfare of animals, people and the kiln environment are interlinked. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In December 2019, 119 WEs were assessed in seven brick kilns in three districts of Nepal, using the Equid Assessment Research and Scoping tool, developed by The Donkey Sanctuary. The objective was to measure welfare at the start of the brick kiln season. RESULTS: Horses were the predominant species of WE. Hazardous housing and environments were seen in all kilns. Behaviour responses were mixed. Owner responses and animal examination indicated poor working conditions. Signs of harmful practice were evident in most animals. The majority were underweight, with poor general health, skin alterations and musculoskeletal issues. CONCLUSION: The welfare of equids prior to starting brick kiln work is poor, posing significant concerns for the actual working period. Intervention to enhance health and welfare is required.","Rodrigues, Joao Brandao; Sullivan, Rebekah J E; Judge, Andrew; Norris, Stuart Lee; Burden, Faith A",Vet Rec,296,6

However, two SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred among intercollegiate university athletic programs during the fall 2020 semester despite mandatory directly observed daily antigen testing. METHODS: During the fall 2020 semester, athletes and staff in both programs were tested daily using Quidel's Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA), with positive antigen results requiring confirmatory testing with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We used genomic sequencing to investigate transmission dynamics in these two outbreaks. RESULTS: In Outbreak 1, 32 confirmed cases occurred within a university athletics program after the index patient attended a meeting while infectious despite a negative antigen test on the day of the meeting. Among isolates sequenced from Outbreak 1, 24 (92%) of 26 were closely related, suggesting sustained transmission following an initial introduction event. In Outbreak 2, 12 confirmed cases occurred among athletes from two university programs that faced each other in an athletic competition despite receiving negative antigen test results on the day of the competition. Sequences from both teams were closely related and distinct from viruses circulating in Team 1's community, suggesting transmission during intercollegiate competition in Team 2's community. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that antigen testing alone, even when mandated and directly observed, may not be sufficient as an intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate settings, and highlight the importance of supplementing serial antigen testing with appropriate mitigation strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in congregate settings.","Moreno, Gage K; Braun, Katarina M; Pray, Ian W; Segaloff, Hannah E; Lim, Ailam; Poulsen, Keith; Meiman, Jonathan; Borcher, James; Westergaard, Ryan P; Moll, Michael K; Friedrich, Thomas C; O039,; Connor, David H",Clin. infect. dis,296,1

Although many argue over the potential merits of antibody testing as an immunity passport to allow the economy to restart, there are other implications that stand at the heart of the bioethical debate that are often overlooked. Particularly with COVID-19, there are many uncertainties and the discourse alone of antibodies presumes misinformation that may outweigh the epidemiological benefits of antibody testing.

This article, we studied the impact of wage recession on employee loyalty, the same was studied by Linz et al, 2013. We decided to study employee loyalty during this pandemic period. Based on this the study objectives are framed to determine the various dimensions of employee loyalty, the impact of wage recession on loyalty and problems faced by employees those who work from home. The study population is college teachers and ITians. In these two sectors adopted a change in their working mode (i.e work from home) and faced wage recession. ITians don't face many issues since it is not new for them but for the teaching community, work from home is an entirely new concept. Teachers try to learn to work in a new platform like google meet, zoom app, cisco Webex meet and give assignments online and conduct exams in virtual mode, leading them to prepare themselves for a changing environment. The work from home created more stress for teachers but for ITians the family intervention and network issues created more stress. Apart from these issues, the employer also reduces the payment from 10% to 50%. Both are the major contributors of employee loyalty. A questionnaire was designed based on the suggestions of HR managers. The data was collected through the virtual mode from 96 professors and 74 ITians in and around Chennai. We measured the key factors which affect employee loyalty like salary, treatment by organization, career focus, job involvement, job satisfaction, wellbeing and work recognition. The study findings revealed that pay reduction does not affect loyalty much. Lack of communication creates more work stress among the employees. This virtual mode of working increased more working hours and responsibility but poor recognition by employers. Our study results reveal that most of the respondents have moderate loyalty and if the work of employees continues to be unrecognized which may decrease the loyalty in future.","Kaur, Mandeep Sinha Rajendra Chaudhary Vijesh Sikandar M.

Our aim was to quantify the association between influenza vaccination status and risk of hospitalisation or all-cause mortality in people diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using routinely collected health records from patients registered to a General Practitioner (GP) practice in South West England within the Electronic Care and Health Information Analytics database. The cohort included 6921 people with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (1 January-31 July 2020). Data on influenza vaccination, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality were ascertained through linked clinical and demographic records. We applied propensity score methods (stabilised inverse probability of treatment weight) to quantify the association between influenza vaccination status and COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation or all-cause mortality). RESULTS: 2613 (38%) participants received an influenza vaccination between 1 January 2019 and COVID-19 diagnosis. Receipt of influenza vaccination was associated with a significantly lower odds of hospitalisation or all-cause mortality (adjusted OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97, p=0.02), and 24% reduced odds of all-cause mortality (adjusted OR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.90). DISCUSSION: Influenza vaccination was associated with a 15%-24% lower odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes.

However, in many cases only incomplete datasets are available, particularly in health care applications, where each patient typically undergoes different clinical procedures or can drop out of a study. Since the data to train the neural networks need to be complete, most studies discard the incomplete datapoints, which reduces the size of the training data, or impute the missing features, which can lead to artefacts. Alas, both approaches are inadequate when a large portion of the data is missing. Here, we introduce GapNet, an alternative deep-learning training approach that can use highly incomplete datasets. First, the dataset is split into subsets of samples containing all values for a certain cluster of features. Then, these subsets are used to train individual neural networks. Finally, this ensemble of neural networks is combined into a single neural network whose training is fine-tuned using all complete datapoints. Using two highly incomplete real-world medical datasets, we show that GapNet improves the identification of patients with underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology and of patients at risk of hospitalization due to Covid-19. By distilling the information available in incomplete datasets without having to reduce their size or to impute missing values, GapNet will permit to extract valuable information from a wide range of datasets, benefiting diverse fields from medicine to engineering.","Chang, Yu-Wei; Natali, Laura; Jamialahmadi, Oveis; Romeo, Stefano; Pereira, Joana B.; Volpe, Giovanni",,296,6

Environ Microbiol 21: 1513-1528). The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public-health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics. However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well-being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection. And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of 'germs' and endows them with their poor image. It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination-capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative. This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand. Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision-making processes. While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families. In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology-centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre-occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology. And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action. If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions. Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration. In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.","McGenity, Terry J; Gessesse, Amare; Hallsworth, John E; Garcia Cela, Esther; Verheecke-Vaessen, Carol; Wang, Fengping; Chavarría, Max; Haggblom, Max M; Molin, Søren; Danchin, Antoine; Smid, Eddy J; Lood, Cédric; Cockell, Charles S; Whitby, Corinne; Liu, Shuang-Jiang; Keller, Nancy P; Stein, Lisa Y; Bordenstein, Seth R; Lal, Rup; Nunes, Olga C; Gram, Lone; Singh, Brajesh K; Webster, Nicole S; Morris, Cindy; Sivinski, Sharon; Bindschedler, Saskia; Junier, Pilar; Antunes, André; Baxter, Bonnie K; Scavone, Paola; Timmis, Kenneth",Microb Biotechnol,296,1

Biologics are mainly administered by intravenous injection but inhalation might be beneficial for the treatment of lung diseases (e.g. asthma). This review discusses biological and pharmaceutical challenges for delivery of biologics and describes promising candidates. Insufficient stability of the proteins during aerosolization and the biological environment of the lung are the main obstacles for pulmonary delivery of biologics. Novel nebulizers will improve delivery by inducing less shear stress and administration as dry powder appears suitable for delivery of biologics. Other promising strategies include pegylation and development of antibody fragments, while carrier-encapsulated systems currently play no major role in pulmonary delivery of biologics for lung disease. While development of various biologics has been halted or has shown little effects, AIR DNase, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, recombinant neuraminidase, and heparin are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. Several biologics are being tested for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, and it is expected that these trials will lead to improvements in pulmonary delivery of biologics.","Fröhlich, Eleonore; Salar-Behzadi, Sharareh",Eur J Pharm Biopharm,296,26

Currently, no mass-market wrist-worn SpO2 monitor meets the medical standards for pulse oximeters. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this monocentric and prospective clinical study with single-blind analysis was to test and validate the accuracy of the reflective pulse oximeter function of the Withings ScanWatch to measure SpO2 levels at different stages of hypoxia. The secondary objective was to confirm the safety of this device when used as intended. METHODS: To achieve these objectives, we included 14 healthy participants aged 23-39 years in the study, and we induced several stable plateaus of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) ranging from 100%-70% to mimic nonhypoxic conditions and then mild, moderate, and severe hypoxic conditions. We measured the SpO2 level with a Withings ScanWatch on each participant's wrist and the SaO2 from blood samples with a co-oximeter, the ABL90 hemoximeter (Radiometer Medical ApS). RESULTS: After removal of the inconclusive measurements, we obtained 275 and 244 conclusive measurements with the two ScanWatches on the participants' right and left wrists, respectively, evenly distributed among the 3 predetermined SpO2 groups: SpO2&#8804;80%, 80%<SpO2&#8804;90%, and 90%<SpO2. We found a strong association and a high level of agreement between the measurements collected from the devices, with high Pearson correlation coefficients of r=0.944 and r=0.954 on the correlation plots, low Pearson correlation coefficients of r=0.083 (P=.17) and r=0.23 (P=.001) on Bland-Altman plots, biases of 0.98% (95% CI 0.65-1.32) and 1.56% (95% CI 1.24-1.87), and root mean square errors of 2.97% and 3.00% from the participants' right and left hands, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the Withings ScanWatch is able to measure SpO2 levels with adequate accuracy at a clinical grade. No undesirable effects or adverse events were reported during the study.

Such global transformations could not but cause a massive change in both consciousness at the socio-anthropological level and traditional forms of management at the civilizational level. Speaking about the civil society in the era of digitalization, it should be understood that this is, first of all, a network society, and without understanding this type of society it is pointless to talk about new forms of civil society. The network society was considered a well-studied object of research by the early 2000s, however today the radical acceleration of ICT and other processes are connected with digital information-network revolution involving artificial intelligence, the possibility of which was not even thought about 20 years ago. Therefore, the main purpose of our paper is an attempt to conceptualize potential risks for civil society connected with the development, testing and implementation of digital services and technologies in the global economy. To achieve this, we used system and synergistic philosophical and methodological approaches developed by the modern post-non-classical science and applied for self-developing systems. To reveal the global trends in the economy and related social problems, we undertook comparative and interdisciplinary analyses based on sources available. Sociological,philosophicalandmethodologicalreflectionsaboutradicalchangesintheanthropotechnosphere during the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed a number of serious problems that threaten the well-being of civil society, such as the aggravation of economic inequality, the collapse of many small businesses due to the quarantine and the introduction of remote forms of work, mass layoffs of qualified specialists, job cuts including the area of intellectual work, transport and service, as well as a significant decrease in the income of the population, decline in the quality of education, a sharp reduction in tourist flows, the ban on mass demonstrations and gatherings, which is an integral basis of the life of civil society. Thus, during the period of pandemic lockdowns, there is a significant change in the economic and socio-cultural environment of modern civilization. At the same time, the crisis situation provides means not only for the development of civil society, but also for the maintenance of enforcing and regulating functions of the state, which can upset the harmonious balance of interaction between society and any state (capitalist, socialist) or the global state of TNCs. An analysis of the world economic development in the 21st century has revealed some signs of a systemic crisis of civilization, along with the processes of digitalization as a catalyst for the shift of the paradigm of civilizational development and a catalyst for civil movements. The most striking Umwelts («perceptual environment») of civil society emerging in the digital realm are described in the paper. © 2021 Institute of Society Transformation.

The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care. METHODS: Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables. RESULTS: Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age>50 years, measured temperature>37.5°C, oxygen saturation<95%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6% (94.8-96.3%), specificity of 20.0% (19.0-21.0%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19-0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., >75% probability with +5 or more points). CONCLUSION: Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.","Kline, Jeffrey A; Camargo, Carlos A; Courtney, D Mark; Kabrhel, Christopher; Nordenholz, Kristen E; Aufderheide, Thomas; Baugh, Joshua J; Beiser, David G; Bennett, Christopher L; Bledsoe, Joseph; Castillo, Edward; Chisolm-Straker, Makini; Goldberg, Elizabeth M; House, Hans; House, Stacey; Jang, Timothy; Lim, Stephen C; Madsen, Troy E; McCarthy, Danielle M; Meltzer, Andrew; Moore, Stephen; Newgard, Craig; Pagenhardt, Justine; Pettit, Katherine L; Pulia, Michael S; Puskarich, Michael A; Southerland, Lauren T; Sparks, Scott; Turner-Lawrence, Danielle; Vrablik, Marie; Wang, Alfred; Weekes, Anthony J; Westafer, Lauren; Wilburn, John",PLoS One,296,13

Multivariate analyses examined associations between these variables after accounting for age, sex and education. RESULTS: Close to 1 in 4 Canadians (24%) had an underlying health condition that increased their risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Overall, 36% of the population were very or extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their own health. Individuals with underlying health conditions had higher odds (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 2.5) of being highly concerned than those without these conditions, after adjustment for demographic characteristics. High percentages of Canadians took precautions to reduce the risk of infection regardless of whether or not they had underlying health conditions.

Thus, this study aims to review the outcomes of ongoing clinical studies on stem cells in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The results will be associated with possible applications to COVID-19. Only three clinical trials related to stem cells are considered complete, whereby two are in Phase 1 and one is in Phase 2. Basically, the ongoing studies on coronavirus are using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow or the umbilical cord to demonstrate their feasibility, safety, and tolerability. The studies not related to coronavirus are all in ARDS conditions; four of them are in Phase 1 and three in Phase 2. With the COVID-19 boom, many clinical trials are being carried out using different sources with an emphasis on MSC-based therapy used to inhibit inflammation. One of the biggest challenges in the current treatment of COVID-19 is the cytokine storm, however MSCs can prevent or mitigate this cytokine storm through their immunomodulatory capacity. We look forward to the results of the ongoing clinical trials to find a treatment for the disease. Researchers around the world are joining forces to help fight COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Understanding an operator's cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human-machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. METHOD: Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. RESULTS: Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by the n-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times. APPLICATION: Results are applicable to the assessment of the effects of high cognitive workload in manufacturing.","Biondi, Francesco N; Cacanindin, Angela; Douglas, Caitlyn; Cort, Joel",Hum Factors,296,1

This research revealed that most of the FPs have good knowledge of, and a positive attitude towards COVID-19 treatment. It was observed that participants who tended towards conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience, and who had higher life satisfaction, and lower levels of death anxiety also reported more positive attitudes towards COVID-19. While the main target population of COVID-19 disease are the older age groups, FPs' attitudes and fear levels were not associated with age, gender, or years of experience.","Gokdemir, Ozden; Pak, Halil; Bakola, Maria; Bhattacharya, Sudip; Hoedebecke, Kyle; Jelastopulu, Eleni",,296,16

Methods: Primers showing optimal in-silico features were subjected to analytical sensitivity and specificity to assess the limit of detection (LOD) and cross-reaction with closely- and distantly-related viral species, and clinically prominent bacterial and fungal species. In order to evaluate the clinical utility, our RT-LAMP was subjected to a large number of clinical samples, including 213 negative and 47 positive patients, relative to two commercial quantitative RT-PCR assays. Results: The analytical specificity and sensitivity of our assay was 100% and 500 copies/ml when serial dilution was performed in both water and sputum. Subjecting our RT-LAMP assay to clinical samples showed a high degree of specificity (99.5%), sensitivity (91.4%), positive predictive value (97.7%), and negative predictive value (98.1%) when used relative to qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay was two times faster than qRT-PCR and is storable at room temperature. A suspected case that later became positive tested positive using both our RT-LAMP and the two qRT-PCR assays, which shows the capability of our assay for screening purposes. Conclusions: We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process two times more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes when demand is increasing at critical situations.","Jiang, Minghua; Pan, Weihua; Arasthfer, Amir; Fang, Wenjie; Ling, Liyan; Fang, Hua; Daneshnia, Farnaz; Yu, Jian; Liao, Wanqing; Pei, Hao; Li, Xiaojing; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,296,27

We aim to investigate the association between different dosages of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Methods and Results: Retrospective study of 450 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Sant’Orsola Bologna Hospital from March 01 to April 10, 2020. Clinical, laboratory and treatment data were collected and analyzed. The in-hospital mortality between COVID-19 patients treated with standard prophylactic LMWH dosage vs. intermediate LMWH dosage was compared. Out of 450 patients, 361 received standard deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis enoxaparin treatment (40-60mg daily) and 89 patients received intermediate enoxaparin dosage (40–60 mg twice daily) for 7 days. No significant differences in the main demographic characteristics and laboratory testings at admission were observed in the two heparin regimen subgroups, except for older age and prevalence of hypertension in the group treated with “standard” prophylaxis LMWH dosage. The intermediate LMWH administration was associated with a lower in-hospital all-cause mortality compared to the “standard” prophylactic LMWH dosage (18.8% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.02). This difference remained significant after adjustment with the propensity score for variables that differed significantly between the dosage groups (OR= 0.260, 95% CI 0.089–0.758, p=0.014). Conclusions: Intermediate LMWH dosage seems to be associated with lower incidence of mortality compared to standard DVT prophylaxys in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

As of 2 May, 2020, over 3 million COVID-19 cases had been confirmed, and 235,290 deaths had been reported globally, and the numbers are still increasing. It is important to understand the phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and known coronaviruses, and to identify its hosts for preventing the next round of emergency outbreak. In this study, we employ an effective alignment-free approach, the Natural Vector method, to analyze the phylogeny and classify the coronaviruses based on genomic and protein data. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to, but distinct from the SARS-CoV branch. By analyzing the genetic distances from the SARS-CoV-2 strain to the coronaviruses residing in animal hosts, we establish that the most possible transmission path originates from bats to pangolins to humans.","Dong, Rui; Pei, Shaojun; Yin, Changchuan; He, Rong Lucy; Yau, Stephen S-T",,296,16

However, data regarding myeloid cell expansion have been collected in Europe, where the mortality rate by COVID-19 is greater than those in other regions including Japan. Thus, characteristics of COVID-19-induced myeloid cell subsets remain largely unknown in the regions with low mortality rates. Here, we analyzed cellular dynamics of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subsets and examined whether any of them correlate with disease severity and prognosis, using blood samples from Japanese COVID-19 patients. We observed that polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs, but not other MDSC subsets, transiently expanded in severe cases but not in mild or moderate cases. Contrary to previous studies in Europe, this subset selectively expanded in survivors of severe cases and subsided before discharge, but such transient expansion was not observed in non-survivors in Japanese cohort. Analysis of plasma cytokine/chemokine levels revealed positive correlation of PMN-MDSC frequencies with IL-8 levels, indicating the involvement of IL-8 on recruitment of PMN-MDSCs to peripheral blood following the onset of severe COVID-19. Our data indicate that transient expansion of the PMN-MDSC subset results in improved clinical outcome. Thus, this myeloid cell subset may be a predictor of prognosis in cases of severe COVID-19 in Japan.","Takano, Tomohiro; Matsumura, Takayuki; Adachi, Yu; Terahara, Kazutaka; Moriyama, Saya; Onodera, Taishi; Nishiyama, Ayae; Kawana-Tachikawa, Ai; Miki, Shoji; Hosoya-Nakayama, Kaori; Nakamura-Hoshi, Midori; Seki, Sayuri; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Yoshimura, Yukihiro; Miyata, Nobuyuki; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Sasaki, Hiroaki; Miyazaki, Kazuhito; Kinoshita, Noriko; Sudo, Tsutomu; Akiyama, Yutaro; Sato, Rubuna; Suzuki, Tadaki; Matano, Tetsuro; Takahashi, Yoshimasa",Int Immunol,296,25

The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.","Kroo, Laurel; Kothari, Anesta; Hannebelle, Melanie; Herring, George; Pollina, Thibaut; Chang, Ray; Peralta, Dominic; Banavar, Samhita P; Flaum, Eliott; Soto-Montoya, Hazel; Li, Hongquan; Combes, Kyle; Pan, Emma; Vu, Khang; Yen, Kelly; Dale, James; Kolbay, Patrick; Ellgas, Simon; Konte, Rebecca; Hajian, Rozhin; Zhong, Grace; Jacobs, Noah; Jain, Amit; Kober, Filip; Ayala, Gerry; Allinne, Quentin; Cucinelli, Nicholas; Kasper, Dave; Borroni, Luca; Gerber, Patrick; Venook, Ross; Baek, Peter; Arora, Nitin; Wagner, Philip; Miki, Roberto; Kohn, Jocelyne; Kohn Bitran, David; Pearson, John; Arias-Arco, Beatriz; Larrainzar-Garijo, Ricardo; Herrera, Cristián Muñiz; Prakash, Manu",PLoS One,296,20

Pulmonary inflammation with subsequent fibrosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection is strongly accelerated. Recently, we have developed CRP apheresis to selectively remove CRP from human plasma. CRP may contribute to organ failure and pulmonary fibrosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection by CRP-mediated complement and macrophage activation. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old male patient at high risk was referred with dyspnea and fever. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of throat smear revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection. CRP levels were ~200 mg/L. Two days after admission, CRP apheresis using the selective CRP adsorber (PentraSorb® CRP) was started. CRP apheresis was performed via peripheral venous access on days 2, 3, 4, and 5. Following a 2-day interruption, it was done via central venous access on days 7 and 8. Three days after admission the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated due to respiratory failure. Plasma CRP levels decreased by ~50% with peripheral (processed blood plasma &#8804;6000 mL) and by ~75% with central venous access (processed blood plasma &#8804;8000 mL), respectively. No apheresis-associated side effects were observed. After the 2-day interruption in apheresis, CRP levels rapidly re-increased (>400 mg/L) and the patient developed laboratory signs of multi-organ failure. When CRP apheresis was restarted, CRP levels and creatinine kinases (CK/CK-MB) declined again. Serum creatinine remained constant. Unfortunately, the patient died of respiratory failure on day 9 after admission. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on CRP apheresis in a SARS-CoV-2 patient. SARS-CoV-2 may cause multi-organ failure in part by inducing an excessive CRP-mediated autoimmune response of the ancient innate immune system.","Torzewski, Jan; Heigl, Franz; Zimmermann, Oliver; Wagner, Florian; Schumann, Christian; Hettich, Reinhard; Bock, Christopher; Kayser, Stefan; Sheriff, Ahmed",Am J Case Rep,296,16

Reaching beyond the sphere of professional geosciences, it led to professional, cultural, and philosophical approaches to handle the social-ecological structures of our planet 'wherever human activities interact with the Earth system'. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 and considering geoscientists' experiences dealing with disasters (related to hazards like tsunamis, floods, climate changes), this essay (1) explores the geoethical approach, (2) re-casts geoethics within western philosophical systems, such as the Kantian imperatives, Kohlberg scale of moral adequacy, Jonas' imperative of responsibility, and (3) advances a 'geoethical thesis'. The latter takes the form of a hypothesis of a much broader scope of geoethics than initially envisioned. That hypothesis appears by suspecting a relationship between the relative successes in the COVID-19 battle with the positioning of agents (individual, collective, institutional) into ethical frameworks. The turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic calls for the transfer of experiences between different disciplinary domains to further sustainable governance, hence generalizing the geoethical approach. It is emphasized that only when behaving as responsible and knowledgeable citizens then people of any trade (including [geo-]scientists) can transgress the boundaries of ordinary governance practices with legitimacy.","Marone, E.; Bohle, M.",Sustainability,296,20

SARS-CoV-2 retains its infectivity in vitro in simulated human-fed-gastric and fasted-intestinal fluid after 2 h. Oral inoculation with the highest intranasal inoculum (105 PFUs) causes mild pneumonia in 67% (4/6) of the animals, with no weight loss. The lung histopathology score and viral load are significantly lower than those infected by the lowest intranasal inoculum (100 PFUs). However, 83% of the oral infections (10/12 hamsters) have a level of detectable viral shedding from oral swabs and feces similar to that of intranasally infected hamsters.

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases, with a large spectrum of symptoms. The fear of contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to continuously monitor non-severe COVID-19 patients, either from their quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g. hotels). In particular, facilitating contact tracing with proximity and location tracing apps was adopted in many countries very rapidly. Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively monitor patient health status. In this paper, we present a review of remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 20 states during the time of the pandemic. We emphasize in the discussion particular aspects that are common ground for the reviewed states, in particular the future impact of the pandemic on remote health monitoring and consideration on data privacy.","Behar, Joachim A; Liu, Chengyu; Kotzen, Kevin; Tsutsui, Kenta; Corino, Valentina D A; Singh, Janmajay; Pimentel, Marco A F; Warrick, Philip; Zaunseder, Sebastian; Andreotti, Fernando; Sebag, David; Kopanitsa, Georgy; McSharry, Patrick E; Karlen, Walter; Karmakar, Chandan; Clifford, Gari D",Physiol Meas,296,6

Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) scanning, becoming one of the primary determinative methods for its diagnosis and staging, requires, however, close contact of healthcare workers with patients, therefore increasing the risk of infection. This work thus proposes an autonomous robotic solution that enables POCUS scanning of COVID-19 patients' lungs for diagnosis and staging. An algorithm was developed for approximating the optimal position of an ultrasound probe on a patient from prior CT scans to reach predefined lung infiltrates. In the absence of prior CT scans, a deep learning method was developed for predicting 3D landmark positions of a human ribcage given a torso surface model. The landmarks, combined with the surface model, are subsequently used for estimating optimal ultrasound probe position on the patient for imaging infiltrates. These algorithms, combined with a force-displacement profile collection methodology, enabled the system to successfully image all points of interest in a simulated experimental setup with an average accuracy of 20.6 +/- 14.7 mm using prior CT scans, and 19.8 +/- 16.9 mm using only ribcage landmark estimation. A study on a full torso ultrasound phantom showed that autonomously acquired ultrasound images were 100% interpretable when using force feedback with prior CT and 88% with landmark estimation, compared to 75 and 58% without force feedback, respectively. This demonstrates the preliminary feasibility of the system, and its potential for offering a solution to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in vulnerable environments.","Al-Zogbi, L.; Singh, V.; Teixeira, B.; Ahuja, A.; Bagherzadeh, P.

Of particular importance is the question of how the model structure constrains its dynamics. This paper discusses an algebraic framework to study such questions. The systems discussed here are given by mappings on an affine space over a finite field, whose coordinate functions are polynomials. They form a general class of models which can represent many discrete model types. Assigning to such a system its dependency graph, that is, the directed graph that indicates the variable dependencies, provides a mapping from systems to graphs. A basic property of this mapping is derived and used to prove that dynamical systems with an acyclic dependency graph can only have a unique fixed point in their phase space and no periodic orbits. This result is then applied to a published model of in vitro virus competition.","Laubenbacher, Reinhard; Murrugarra, David; Veliz-Cuba, Alan",,296,16

Both the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and the Royal College of Psychiatrists updated their positions in line with that review, and Public Health England published a 152-page report called Dependence and withdrawal associated with some prescribed medicines: an evidence review. The report made several recommendations relevant to general practice. Method: In order to facilitate implementation of these recommendations, an online survey was designed to explore United Kingdom general practitioner (GP) experiences, opinions, knowledge and needs in relation to depression, ADs and withdrawal. A total of 66 GPs had completed the survey when COVID-19 occurred. Results: In keeping with previous findings, this small sample of GPs had a predominantly psycho-social perspective on the causes of, and treatments for, depression. They broadly considered ADs effective for moderate/severe depression and ineffective for minimal/mild depression, for which they preferred psychological therapies and social prescribing. There was a marked lack of consistency in GPs’ knowledge about the incidence and duration of withdrawal effects. Only a minority (29%) felt their knowledge about withdrawal was ‘adequate’ and fewer (17%) believed this about their ‘Ability to distinguish between withdrawal effects and return of the original problem (e.g. depression)’. Two-thirds (68%) would like more training on these matters. Conclusion: It is hoped that even this small sample will be helpful when designing, and seeking funding for, GP training programmes, and when implementing the PHE recommendations for support services, based in the primary care system, for the millions of people contemplating or initiating withdrawal from ADs every year in the UK.","Read, John; Renton, Julia; Harrop, Christopher; Geekie, Jim; Dowrick, Christopher",Ther.

We take the view that a successful treatment of COVID-19 patients (i) increases the probability of a recovery or improvement within a certain time interval, say 28 days; (ii) aims to expedite favourable events within this time frame; and (iii) does not increase mortality over this time period.

In the last decade, a strategy change in the day of embryo transfer has been developed. Many IVF centres choose nowadays to transfer at later stages of embryo development, for example, transferring embryos at blastocyst stage instead of cleavage stage. However, it still is not known which embryo transfer policy in IVF is more efficient in terms of cumulative live birth rate (cLBR), following a fresh and the subsequent frozen-thawed transfers after one oocyte retrieval. Furthermore, studies reporting on obstetric and neonatal outcomes from both transfer policies are limited. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have set up a multicentre randomised superiority trial in the Netherlands, named the Three or Fivetrial. We plan to include 1200 women with an indication for IVF with at least four embryos available on day 2 after the oocyte retrieval. Women are randomly allocated to either (1) control group: embryo transfer on day 3 and cryopreservation of supernumerary good-quality embryos on day 3 or 4, or (2) intervention group: embryo transfer on day 5 and cryopreservation of supernumerary good-quality embryos on day 5 or 6. The primary outcome is the cLBR per oocyte retrieval. Secondary outcomes include LBR following fresh transfer, multiple pregnancy rate and time until pregnancy leading a live birth. We will also assess the obstetric and neonatal outcomes, costs and patients' treatment burden. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the Central Committee on Research involving Human Subjects in the Netherlands in June 2018 (CCMO NL 64060.000.18).

Infection in humans results in a variety of outcomes ranging from asymptomatic cases to the disease COVID-19, which can have significant morbidity and mortality, with over two million confirmed deaths worldwide as of January 2021. Over a year into the pandemic, sequencing analysis has shown that variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being selected as the virus continues to circulate widely within the human population. The predominant drivers of genetic variation within SARS-CoV-2 are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) caused by polymerase error, potential host factor driven RNA modification, and insertion/deletions (indels) resulting from the discontinuous nature of viral RNA synthesis. While many mutations represent neutral 'genetic drift' or have quickly died out, a subset may be affecting viral traits such as transmissibility, pathogenicity, host range, and antigenicity of the virus. In this review, we summarise the current extent of genetic change in SARS-CoV-2, particularly recently emerging variants of concern, and consider the phenotypic consequences of this viral evolution that may impact the future trajectory of the pandemic.","Peacock, Thomas P; Penrice-Randal, Rebekah; Hiscox, Julian A; Barclay, Wendy S",J. gen. virol,296,7

Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. METHODS: The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16-64, 65-79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. RESULTS: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). CONCLUSION: This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining population.","Russo, Antonio Giampiero; Decarli, Adriano; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia",Vaccine,296,21

Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data. RESULTS: hCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of â¼2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires â¼50mn on our cluster.

We include best practice recommendations to mitigate these issues and conclude with implications for interdisciplinary models of care in crisis settings. RECENT FINDINGS: Certain biomarkers, demographics, and medical comorbidities predict an increased risk for mortality among patients with COVID-19 and kidney disease, but concerns related to physical exposure and conservation of personal protective equipment have exacerbated existing barriers to empathic communication and value clarification for these patients. Variability in patient characteristics and outcomes has made prognostication nuanced and challenging. The pandemic has also highlighted the complexities of dialysis decision-making for older adults at risk for poor outcomes related to COVID-19. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for nephrologists to be competent in serious illness communication skills that include virtual and remote modalities, to be aware of prognostic tools, and to be willing to engage with interdisciplinary teams of palliative care subspecialists, intensivists, and ethicists to facilitate goal-concordant care during crisis settings.","Nair, Devika; Malhotra, Sonia; Lupu, Dale; Harbert, Glenda; Scherer, Jennifer S",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,296,1

Patients and methods: The QoL of 68 RA patients was assessed using Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (MOS-SF36) scale across the physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) components scores. The disease activity score (DAS28) was considered. Patients accepting to participate and having a mean of communication via social network, in particular WhatsApp were included. Results: The mean age of the patients was 49.9 ± 12.1 years (11–83 years) and were 65 females and 3 males. The mean DAS-28 at the start of the restriction measures was 3.4 ± 1.5, the mean PCS and MCS were 71.1 ± 20.3 and 67.1 ± 16.02 respectively and became 4.7 ± 2.04, 38.1 ± 4.96 and 36.8 ± 3.8 respectively. After 2 months, none of the RA patients presented with classic symptoms of COVID-19 infection. 8 patients were screened by Rapid Diagnostic Test and Reverse Transcription‐Polymerase Chain Reaction. Only 1 case was positive but asymptomatic. All patients had altered QoL according to MOS-SF36. Factors associated with this deterioration were stress related to SARS-CoV2 isolation (p = 0.001), stress of having an activity flare-up (p = 0.001), fear of being stigmatized (p = 0.009). The economic factors were significantly associated with temporary unemployment, decrease in monthly income, and drug discontinuation (p = 0.001, p = 0.002 and p = 0.046 respectively). Conclusion: The impact of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic is negative on the QoL of RA patients and many factors were contributing.","Zomalheto, Zavier; Assogba, Calixte; Dossou-yovo, Hilaire",Egypt.

The dromedary camel is considered a possible host of the virus and also to act as a reservoir, transmitting the virus to humans. Here, we studied evolutionary relationships for 31 complete genomes of betacoronaviruses, including eight newly sequenced MERS-CoV genomes isolated from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. Through bioinformatics tools, we also used available sequences and 3D structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein to predict MERS-CoV epitopes and assess antibody binding affinity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the eight new sequences have close relationships with existing strains detected in camels and humans in Arabian Gulf countries. The 2019-nCov strain appears to have higher homology to both bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV strains. The spike protein tree exhibited clustering of MERS-CoV sequences similar to the complete genome tree, except for one sequence from Qatar (KF961222). B cell epitope analysis determined that the MERS-CoV spike protein has 24 total discontinuous regions from which just six epitopes were selected with score values of >80%. Our results suggest that the virus circulates by way of camels crossing the borders of Arabian Gulf countries.

Based on structural data derived from X-ray crystallographic data of related trypsin-like proteases, a homology model of TMPRSS2 is described and validated using the broad spectrum COVID-19 drug candidate camostat as a probe. Both active site recognition and catalytic function are examined using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamic (QM/MM MD) simulations of camostat and its active metabolite, 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetate (GBPA). Substrate binding is shown to be primarily stabilized through salt bridge formation between the shared guanidino pharmacophore and D435 in pocket A (flanking the catalytic S441). Based on the binding mode of GBPA, residues K342 and W461 have been identified as potential contacts involved in TMPRSS2 selective binding and activity. Additional data is reported that indicates the transition state structure is stabilized through H-bonding interactions with the backbone N-H groups within an oxyanion hole following bottom-side attack of the carbonyl by S441. This is supported by prior work on related serine proteases suggesting further strategies to exploit in the design of more potent inhibitors. Taken overall, the proposed structure along with the key contact sites and mechanistic features identified should prove highly advantageous to the design and rational development of safe and effective therapeutics that target TMPRSS2 and avoid inhibition of other trypsin-dependent processes.","Escalante, Diego E; Ferguson, David M",Med Chem Res,296,26

In this context, a number of questions arose, from the increased stroke risk due to COVID-19 infection to the quality of stroke patient care. The overwhelming need of COVID-19 patient management made mandatory a complete re-organization of the stroke pathways: many health professionals were reallocated and a number of stroke units was turned into COVID-19 wards. As a result, acute stroke care suffered from a shortage of services and delays in time-dependent treatments and diagnostic work-up. In-patient and out-patient care and rehabilitation facilities for stroke survivors were also reduced or slowed down, to direct resources to COVID-19 patients care and to reduce contagion risks. Overall, this is likely to result in a significant future increased burden of complications and disabilities that will impact the health care systems in the coming months. Thus, while still fighting against COVID-19 disease, authorities need to promptly implement robust action plans, including an increase of workforce, without forgetting the assurance of a high level of stroke care. The medical community and the health care administrators should always keep in mind that stroke was before, and will be after the pandemic, a, sometimes, life-threatening condition, and almost always a disease with a severe impact on the quality of life.","Bersano, Anna; Pantoni, Leonardo",J. neurol,296,24

Understanding the Immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is essential for interrupting viral infectivity and preventing aberrant immune responses before a vaccine can be developed. In this review, we provide the latest insights into the roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) and Ang II receptor-1 (AT1-R) in this disease. Novel therapeutic strategies, including recombinant ACE2, ACE inhibitors, AT1-R blockers, and Ang 1-7 peptides, may prevent or reduce viruses-induced pulmonary, cardiac, and renal injuries. However, more studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of these therapeutics. Furthermore, considering the common role of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in AT1-R expressed on peripheral tissues and cytokine receptors on the surface of immune cells, potential targeting of this pathway using JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) is suggested as a promising approach in patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals. In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19. Since the combination of MTX and baricitinib leads to outstanding clinical outcomes, the addition of baricitinib to MTX might be a potential strategy.","Seif, Farhad; Aazami, Hossein; Khoshmirsafa, Majid; Kamali, Monireh; Mohsenzadegan, Monireh; Pornour, Majid; Mansouri, Davood",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,296,20

Female gender (OR - 0.98, p=0.04) and younger age (OR - 0.65, p=0.04) were associated with higher level of anxiety according to regression model. The total score of SAVE-9 with a high degree of confidence predicted the GAD-7 value in comparative ROC analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers in Russia reported high rates of stress and anxiety. The Russian version of the SAVE-9 displayed a good ratio of sensitivity to specificity compared with GAD-7 and can be recommended as a screening instrument for detection of stress and anxiety in healthcare workers.","Mosolova, Ekaterina; Chung, Seockhoon; Sosin, Dmitryi; Mosolov, Sergey",Psychiatr Danub,296,1

The aim of this study was to elucidate the differential expression of miRNAs in COVID-19. METHODS: The total RNA was extracted and purified from the peripheral blood of ten patients with COVID-19 and four healthy donors. The expression levels of various miRNAs were detected by high-throughput sequencing, and correlation analysis was performed on the target genes that are primed by miRNAs. KEY FINDINGS: Compared with the healthy controls, 35 miRNAs were upregulated and 38 miRNAs were downregulated in the human patients with COVID-19. The top 10 genes were listed below: hsa-miR-16-2-3P,hsa-miR-5695,hsa-miR-10399-3P,hsa-miR-6501-5P,hsa-miR-361-3P,hsa-miR-361-3p, hsa-miR-4659a-3p, hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-4685-3p, hsa-miR-454-5p, and hsa-miR-30c-5p. The 10 genes with the greatest reduction were listed below: hsa-miR-183-5p, hsa-miR-627-5p, hsa-miR-941, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-146b-5p, hsa-miR-454-3p, hsa-miR-18a-5p, hsa-miR-340-5p, and hsa-miR-17-5p. Remarkably, miR-16-2-3p was the most upregulated miRNA, with a 1.6-fold change compared to that of the controls. Moreover, the expression of miR-6501-5p and miR-618 was 1.5-fold higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the healthy donors. Meanwhile, miR-627-5p was the most downregulated miRNA, with a 2.3-fold change compared to that of the controls. The expression of other miRNAs (miR-183-5p, miR-627-5p, and miR-144-3p) was reduced by more than 1.3-fold compared to that of the healthy donors. Cluster analysis revealed that all of the differentially expressed miRNA target genes were clustered by their regulation of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. Importantly, peptidases, protein kinases, and the ubiquitin system were shown to be the highest enrichment categories by enrichment analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The differential miRNA expression found in COVID-19 patients may regulate the immune responses and viral replication during viral infection.","Li, Caixia; Hu, Xiao; Li, Leilei; Li, Jin-Hui",J Clin Lab Anal,296,16

By August 18, 2020, the United States, Brazil, and India were the most affected countries. Health infrastructure and socioeconomic vulnerabilities may be affecting the response capacities of these countries. We compared official indicators to identify which vulnerabilities better determined the exposure risk to COVID-19 in both the most and least affected countries. To achieve this purpose, we collected indicators from the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, and the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE). All indicators were normalized to facilitate comparisons. Speed, incidence, and population were used to identify the groups of countries with the highest and lowest risks of infection. Countries' response capacities were determined based on socioeconomic, political, and health infrastructure conditions. Vulnerabilities were identified based on the indicator sensitivity. The highest-risk group included the U.S., Brazil, and India, whereas the lowest-risk group (with the largest population by continent) consisted of China, New Zealand, and Germany. The high-sensitivity cluster had 18 indicators (50% extra IDVI), such as merchandise trade, immunization, public services, maternal mortality, life expectancy at birth, hospital beds, GINI index, adolescent fertility, governance, political stability, transparency/corruption, industry, and water supply. The greatest vulnerability of the highest-risk group was related first to economic factors (merchandise trade), followed by public health (immunization), highlighting global dependence on Chinese trade, such as protective materials, equipment, and diagnostic tests. However, domestic political factors had more indicators, beginning with high sensitivity and followed by healthcare and economic conditions, which signified a lesser capacity to guide, coordinate, and supply the population with protective measures, such as social distancing.","Cartaxo, Adriana Nascimento Santos; Barbosa, Francisco Iran Cartaxo; de Souza Bermejo, Paulo Henrique; Moreira, Marina Figueiredo; Prata, David Nadler",PLoS One,296,1

Caregivers understood and approved the restriction of visits in ICU, in order to limit epidemic spreading, worried by overwhelming of their capacity would be overwhelmed and that they would not be able to admit all the patients requiring intensive care. However, they quickly sought to compensate by creating different relationships with relatives, using new ways of communication enabling patients and their relatives to keep in touch. Letters, messages services, phone calls and e-visits were set up. This brought new risks such as patient’ images diffusion on social networks. In addition, relatives, caught with contradictory stressful information provided by medias, did not always understand that they could not have a direct access to patients and put psychological pressure on healthcare providers. Considering that previous recommendations support an unrestricted access of relatives to the ICU patients, caregivers have had to deal with new rules and have got experience that will be useful in case of the occurrence of comparable events.","Fieux, Fabienne; Hantala, Nicolas; Satre-Buisson, Lea; Quillerou, Buenn",Prat.

We analyzed a census of public communications (n = 372,466) from 704 public health agencies, state and local emergency management agencies, and elected officials posted on Twitter between January 1 and August 31, 2020, measuring message retransmission via the number of retweets (ie, a message passed on by others), an important indicator of engagement and reach. To assess content, we extended a lexicon developed from the early months of the pandemic to identify key concepts within messages, employing it to analyze both the textual content of messages themselves as well as text included within embedded images (n = 233,877), which was extracted via optical character recognition. Finally, we modelled the message retransmission process using a negative binomial regression, which allowed us to quantify the extent to which particular message features amplify or suppress retransmission, net of controls related to timing and properties of the sending account. In addition to identifying other predictors of retransmission, we show that the impact of images is strongly driven by content, with textual information in messages and embedded images operating in similar ways. We offer potential recommendations for crafting and deploying social media messages that can ""cut through the noise"" of an infodemic.","Renshaw, Scott Leo; Mai, Sabrina; Dubois, Elisabeth; Sutton, Jeannette; Butts, Carter T",Health Secur,296,12

The objective of this study was to evaluate the mental health status of pan-Indian frontline doctors combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among frontline doctors of tertiary care hospitals in India (East: Kolkata, West Bengal; North: New Delhi; West: Nagpur, Maharashtra; and South: Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala) from May 23, 2020, to June 6, 2020. Doctors involved in clinical services in outpatient departments, designated COVID-19 wards, screening blocks, fever clinics, and intensive care units completed an online questionnaire. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale were used to assess depression and perceived stress. Results: The results of 422 responses revealed a 63.5% and 45% prevalence of symptoms of depression and stress, respectively, among frontline COVID-19 doctors. Postgraduate trainees constituted the majority (45.5%) of the respondents. Moderately severe and severe depression was noted in 14.2% and 3.8% of the doctors, respectively. Moderate and severe stress was noted in 37.4% and 7.6% of participants, respectively.

METHODS: Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. RESULTS: In total, 21% (n = 10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the overall mortality rate was 13% (n = 6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p < 0.001) upon admission than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p = 2.6 × 10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p = 0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements; whereas, the concentrations in survivors were stable. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Increased concentrations of NfL and GFAp in COVID-19 patients on admission may indicate increased mortality risk. Measurement of blood biomarkers for nervous system injury can be useful to detect and monitor CNS injury in COVID-19.","Aamodt, Anne Hege; Høgestøl, Einar August; Popperud, Trine Haug; Holter, Jan Cato; Dyrhol-Riise, Anne Ma; Tonby, Kristian; Stiksrud, Birgitte; Quist-Paulsen, Else; Berge, Tone; Barratt-Due, Andreas; Aukrust, Pål; Heggelund, Lars; Blennow, Kaj; Zetterberg, Henrik; Harbo, Hanne Flinstad",J. neurol,296,20

In this study, we identify a dual-functional cross-linking peptide 8P9R which can inhibit the two entry pathways (endocytic pathway and TMPRSS2-mediated surface pathway) of SARS-CoV-2 in cells. The endosomal acidification inhibitors (8P9R and chloroquine) can synergistically enhance the activity of arbidol, a spike-ACE2 fusion inhibitor, against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in cells. In vivo studies indicate that 8P9R or the combination of repurposed drugs (umifenovir also known as arbidol, chloroquine and camostat which is a TMPRSS2 inhibitor), simultaneously interfering with the two entry pathways of coronaviruses, can significantly suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in hamsters and SARS-CoV in mice. Here, we use drug combination (arbidol, chloroquine, and camostat) and a dual-functional 8P9R to demonstrate that blocking the two entry pathways of coronavirus can be a promising and achievable approach for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo. Cocktail therapy of these drug combinations should be considered in treatment trials for COVID-19.","Zhao, Hanjun; To, Kelvin K W; Lam, Hoiyan; Zhou, Xinxin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Peng, Zheng; Lee, Andrew C Y; Cai, Jianpiao; Chan, Wan-Mui; Ip, Jonathan Daniel; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Yeung, Man Lung; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chu, Allen Wing Ho; Jiang, Shibo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Nat Commun,296,4

Besides, some antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporin have heterocyclic moiety. The growing prevalence of multi-drug resistant pathogens represents serious global concern,which requires the development of new antimicrobial drugs. Moreover, the emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19 disease and all these health dilemmas urge the scientific community to examine the possible antimicrobial and antiviral capacities of some bioactive benzothiazole derivatives against these severe causative agents.This mini-review highlights some recent scientific literature on different benzothiazole molecules and their derivatives. It turns out that, there are numerous synthesized benzothiazole derivatives which exhibited different mode of actions against microorganisms or viruses and accordingly suggested them as an active candidate in the discovery of new antimicrobial or antiviral agents for clinical development. The recommended bioactive benzothiazole derivatives mentioned in the current study are mainly Schiff bases, azo dyes and metal complexes benzothiazole derivatives; the starting material for most of these derivatives are 2-aminobenzothiazole although careful pharmaceutical studies should be conducted to ensure the safety and efficacy of these bioactive synthesized molecules as an antimicrobial or antiviral drug in the future.","Elamin, Manahil B.; Elaziz, Amani Abd Elrazig Salman Abd; Abdallah, Emad Mohamed",Int.

Data sources: We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence), which retrieves articles from multiple sources such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, among other pre-print and protocols repositories. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) was adapted to expand the range of evidence and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place on a daily search basis. The search covered a period of time up to July 31, 2020. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel living systematic reviews to this question's specificities. We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of either suspension or indication of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers as monotherapy, or in combination versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We pooled the results using meta-analysis and applied the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We will resubmit results every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results: We screened 772 records, but none was considered for eligibility. We identified 55 ongoing studies, including 41 randomized trials evaluating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: We did not find a randomized clinical trial meeting our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence for supporting the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies would provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers in the near future. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020182495.

Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also involves multiple other organs, including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms, including virus-induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and postinfectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID-19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system, COVID-19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain-Barre syndrome, and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis is still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID-19.

The used PCR systems were designed to detect sequences representing the group-specific virulence genes encoding fimbriae f5 (K99), Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx2), heat-stable enterotoxins (st), heat-labile enterotoxins (lt), intimin (eae), hemolysin (hylA), and EAEC heat-stable enterotoxin (astA). In the present work, a total of 150 E. coli field isolates were recovered from 150 fecal swabs collected from 100 diarrheic and 50 apparently healthy in-contact cattle and buffalo calves under 3 months old. Out of these 150 isolated E. coli, 106 isolates from 77 diarrheic and 29 in-contact calves harbored one or more of the investigated virulence genes. The pathotyping of the isolates could classify them into shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) with a 30.7, 2.7, 12.7, and 7.3% distribution, respectively. Meanwhile, the detection rates of f5, stx1, stx2, st, lt, eae, hylA, and astA genes were 17.3, 27.3, 6.7, 10, 37.3, 17.7, 9.3, and 20.7%, respectively. These virulence genes were found either single or in different combinations, such as stx/eae, stx/st/f5, eae/st/f5, or st/lt/f5. Four attaching-effacing shigatoxigenic E. coli isolates (AE-STEC) harboring stx/eae were retrieved from diarrheic calves. Although none of the stx-or eae-positive isolates was verified as O157:H7, STEC isolates detected in apparently healthy calves have potential pathogenicity to humans highlighting their zoonotic importance as reservoirs. Atypical combinations of ETEC/STEC and ETEC/EPEC were also detected in percentages of 14.7 and 2.7%, respectively. Most of these atypical combinations were found more in buffalo calves than in cattle calves. While STEC and EPEC isolates were detected more in cattle calves than in buffalo calves, ETEC isolates were the same in the two species. The pathogenic E. coli infection in calves was recorded to be higher in the first weeks of life with the largest numbers of virulence factor-positive isolates detected at the age of 4 weeks. Histopathological examination of five intestinal samples collected from four dead buffalo calves revealed typical attaching and effacing (AE) lesion which was correlated with the presence of intimin encoding virulence gene (eae). Other lesions characterized by hemorrhagic enteritis, shortening and fusion of intestinal villi and desquamation of the lining epithelium of intestinal mucosa had also been detected.","Awad, Walid S; El-Sayed, Amr A; Mohammed, Faten F; Bakry, Noha M; Abdou, Nadra-Elwgoud M I; Kamel, Mohamed S",Trop. anim. health prod,296,16

Tears in these tendons are common and often debilitating. There is uncertainty regarding both the histological and macroscopic features of hip abductor tears. This study aims to clarify both the macroscopic and microscopic features of the tendon and enthesis in hip abductor tendon tears. METHODS: Thirty-six cadavers with an average age of 81 were dissected, and the hip abductor mechanisms removed en-bloc. The presence, location and size of the tears were recorded and analysed. The samples were processed into histological blocks and viewed using both transmitted and polarised light. Tendon histology was graded using the modified Movin's score in three sections (deep, middle and superficial layers) and the enthesis graded separately using 5-point criteria. Analysis of variance was used to confirm histological features associated with tears. RESULTS: Tears were found in 24 of 36 samples (67%). The most common finding was an isolated tear in the gluteus minimus (46%), followed by concurrent gluteus medius and gluteus minimus tears (33%). Histology revealed significantly more degeneration in both the tendon (p = 0.0005) and enthesis (p = 0.0011) when tears were present. Furthermore, these changes were concentrated in the deeper layers of the tendon (p = 0.0002) and enthesis (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated degeneration as the primary pathology underlying hip abductor tendon tears. Degenerative changes occur in both the tendon and enthesis, with the deeper layers predominantly affected. These findings are important for guiding surgical repair techniques and to aid the development of novel materials and biologics.","Zhu, Mark F; Smith, Brittany; Krishna, Sanjeev; Musson, David S; Riordan, Peter R; McGlashan, Sue R; Cornish, Jillian; Munro, Jacob T",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,296,12

Influenza causes a heavy disease burden in older adults, but can be alleviated by vaccination. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a potential government-funded seasonal influenza vaccination program in older adults in China. METHODS: We characterized the health and economic impact of a fully funded influenza vaccination program for older adults using China-specific influenza disease burden, and related cost data, etc. Using a decision tree model, we calculated the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of vaccination from the societal perspective, at a willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to GDP per capita (US$8840). Moreover, we estimated the threshold vaccination costs, under which the fully funded vaccination program is cost-effective using GDP per capita as the willingness-to-pay threshold. RESULTS: Compared to current self-paid vaccination, a fully funded vaccination program is expected to prevent 19,812 (95% uncertainty interval, 7150-35,783) influenza-like-illness outpatient consultations per year, 9418 (3386-17,068) severe acute respiratory infection hospitalizations per year, and 8800 (5300-11,667) respiratory excess deaths due to influenza per year, and gain 70,212 (42,106-93,635) QALYs per year. Nationally, the incremental costs per QALY gained of the vaccination program is US$4832 (3460-8307), with a 98% probability of being cost-effective. The threshold vaccination cost is US$10.19 (6.08-13.65). However, variations exist between geographical regions, with Northeast and Central China having lower probabilities of cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the implementation of a government fully funded older adult vaccination program in China. The regional analysis provides results across settings that may be relevant to other countries with similar disease burden and economic status, especially for low- and middle-income countries where such analysis is limited.","Yang, Juan; Atkins, Katherine E; Feng, Luzhao; Baguelin, Marc; Wu, Peng; Yan, Han; Lau, Eric H Y; Wu, Joseph T; Liu, Yang; Cowling, Benjamin J; Jit, Mark; Yu, Hongjie",BMC Med,296,2

However, concerns have been raised regarding the global shortage of medical grade masks and the limited evidence on the efficacy of fabric masks. This study used a standard mask testing method (ASTM F2101-14) and a model virus (bacteriophage MS2) to test the viral filtration efficiency (VFE) of fabric masks compared with commercially available disposable, surgical, and N95 masks. Five different types of fabric masks were purchased from the ecommerce website Etsy to represent a range of different fabric mask designs and materials currently available. One mask included a pocket for a filter; which was tested without a filter, with a dried baby wipe, and a section of a vacuum cleaner bag. A sixth fabric mask was also made according to the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines (Australia). Three masks of each type were tested. This study found that all the fabric masks had a VFE of at least 50% when tested against aerosols with an average size of 6.0 µm (VFE (6.0 µm)). The minimum VFE of fabric masks improved (to 63%) when the larger aerosols were excluded to give and average aerosol size of 2.6 µm (VFE (2.6 µm)), which better represents inhaled aerosols that can reach the lower respiratory system. The best performing fabric masks were the cotton mask with a section of vacuum cleaner bag (VFE (6.0 µm)= 99.5%, VFE (2.6 µm)= 98.8%) or a dried baby wipe (VFE (6.0 µm)= 98.5%, VFE (2.6 µm)= 97.6%) in the pocket designed for a disposable filter, the mask made using the Victorian DHHS design (VFE (6.0 µm)= 98.6%, VFE (2.6 µm)=99.1%) and one made from a layer of 100% hemp, a layer of poly membrane, and a layer of cheesecloth (VFE (6.0 µm)= 93.6%, VFE (2.6 µm)= 89.0%). The VFE of two surgical masks (VFE (6.0 µm)= 99.9% and 99.6%, VFE (2.6 µm)= 99.5% and 98.5%) and a N95 masks (VFE (6.0 µm)= 99.9%, VFE (2.6 µm)= 99.3%) were comparable to their advertised bacterial filtration efficacy. This research supports the use of fabric masks in the community to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, future research is needed to explore the optimum design in ensuring proper fit. There is also a need for mass education campaigns to disseminate this information, along with guidelines around the proper usage and washing of fabric masks.","Whiley, Harriet; Keerthirathne, Thilini Piushani; Nisar, Muhammad Atif; White, Mae A.

METHODS: This is a controlled randomized trial for a multidisciplinary telehealth intervention in Southern Brazil, with social distancing measures. Adults aged 18 years or older with previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were included in the study. The intervention performed was a set of strategies to help patients stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic and included the maintaining of telephone contacts and providing educational materials on issues related to mental health, healthy habits, and diabetes care. The primary outcome was a positive screening for mental health disorders (Self-Reporting Questionnaire) after 16 weeks of intervention. A positive screening for mental health disorders was considered when the survey scored greater than or equal to 7. Secondary outcomes included a positive screening for diabetes-related emotional distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes), eating (Eating Attitudes Test), and sleep disorders (Mini Sleep Questionnaire). Comparisons with &#967;2 tests for dichotomous outcomes, along with the Mann-Whitney U test, was used for between group analyses. RESULTS: A total of 91 individuals agreed to participate (46 intervention group and 45 control group). There were no differences in demographic and clinical data at baseline. After 16 weeks of follow-up, a positive screening for mental health disorders was found in 37.0% of participants in the intervention group vs. 57.8% in the control group (P = 0.04). Diabetes-related emotional distress was found in 21.7% of participants in the intervention group vs. 42.2% in the control group (P = 0.03). No differences were found between groups with regard to eating and sleep disorders. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that maintaining remote connections with health professionals during social distancing and quarantine have the potential to reduce the prevalence of positive screening for mental health disorders and diabetes-related emotional distress in adults with type 2 diabetes.","Alessi, Janine; de Oliveira, Giovana Berger; Franco, Debora Wilke; Becker, Alice Scalzilli; Knijnik, Carolina Padilla; Kobe, Gabriel Luiz; Amaral, Bibiana Brino; de Brito, Ariane; Schaan, Beatriz D; Telo, Gabriela Heiden",Acta diabetol,296,29

The understanding of the transmission and the duration of viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the timeframe and potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to antibody response. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study of 36 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Karolinska University Hospital. Patients with more than 8 days of symptom duration were sampled from airways, for PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and in vitro culture of replicating virus. Serum SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies titers were assessed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and microneutralization assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in airway samples in 23 patients (symptom duration median 15 days, range 9-53 days), whereas 13 patients were SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative (symptom duration median 21 days, range 10-37 days). Replicating virus was detected in samples from 4 patients at 9-16 days. All but two patients had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in serum, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in 33 out of 36 patients. Total SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated. High levels of both total IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in patients sampled later after symptom onset and in patients where replicating virus could not be detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the presence of SARS-Cov-2 specific antibodies in serum may indicate a lower risk of shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2 by hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Glans, Hedvig; Gredmark-Russ, Sara; Olausson, Mikaela; Falck-Jones, Sara; Varnaite, Renata; Christ, Wanda; Maleki, Kimia T; Karlberg, Maria Lind; Broddesson, Sandra; Falck-Jones, Ryan; Bell, Max; Johansson, Niclas; Färnert, Anna; Smed-Sörensen, Anna; Klingström, Jonas; Bråve, Andreas",BMC Infect Dis,296,2

Currently, in vivo treatment efficacy of NIR-PIT is observable days after treatment, but monitoring would be improved by more acute detection of intratumor change. Fluorescence imaging may detect increased tumor perfusion immediately after treatment. METHODS: In the first experiment, athymic nude mouse models bearing unilateral subcutaneous flank tumors were treated with either NIR-PIT or laser therapy only. In the second experiment, mice bearing bilateral flank tumors were treated with NIR-PIT only on the left-sided tumor. In both groups, immediately after treatment, indocyanine green was injected at different doses intravenously, and mice were monitored with the Shimadzu LIGHTVISION fluorescence imaging system for 1 hour. RESULTS: Tumor-to-background ratio of fluorescence intensity increased over the 60 minutes of monitoring in treated mice but did not vary significantly in control mice. Tumor-to-background ratio was highest in the 1 mg kg-1 and 0.3 mg kg-1 doses. In mice with bilateral tumors, tumor-to-untreated tumor ratio increased similarly. CONCLUSIONS: Acute changes in tumor perfusion after NIR-PIT can be detected by real-time fluorescence imaging.","Rosenberg, Adrian; Fujimura, Daiki; Okada, Ryuhei; Furusawa, Aki; Inagaki, Fuyuki; Wakiyama, Hiroaki; Kato, Takuya; Choyke, Peter L; Kobayashi, Hisataka",Mol Imaging,296,1

As our understanding of infectious diseases such as Corona Virus Disease 2019 improves, we expect electronic nose technology to detect changes associated with pathogenesis of the disease such as biomarkers of immune response for respiratory symptoms, central nervous system injury, and/or peripheral nervous system injury in the breath and/or odor of an individual. In this paper, a design of an electronic nose was configured to detect the concentration of a COVID-19 breath simulation sample of alcohol, acetone, and carbon monoxide mixture. After preheating for 24 hours, the sample was carried into an internal bladder of the collection vessel for analysis and data was collected from three sensors to determine suitability of these sensors for the application of exhaled breath analysis. Test results show a detection range in parts-per-million within the sensor detection range of at least 10-300 ppm. The output response of an MQ-2 and an MQ-135 sensor to a diverse environment of target gasses show the MQ-2 taking a greater length of time to normalize baseline drift compared to an MQ-135 sensor due to cross interferences with other gasses. The COVID-19 breath simulation sample was established and validated based on preliminary data obtained from parallel COVID-19 breath studies based in Edinburgh and Dortmund. This detection method provides a non-invasive, rapid, and selective detection of gasses in a variety of applications in virus detection as well as agricultural and homeland security.

As SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, very little information is available from researchers and therefore, a rigorous effort is required to decode its pathogenicity. There are no licenced treatment options available for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections and the development of a new antiviral drug targeting coronavirus cannot happen soon. Consequently, drug repurposing is a promising solution for combating the present pandemic. In this review, we have thoroughly discussed all the proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome; their importance in pathogenicity and their potential role in drug discovery. Also, the budding threat of co-infections by other pathogenic microbes has been highlighted. Furthermore, the advances made in the medicinal field for the treatment and prevention of this viral infection is explained. Altogether, this review will provide some insightful discussions about this infectious disease and will meet certain of the knowledge gaps which exist by presenting an exhaustive and extensive scientific report on the ongoing mission for COVID-19 drug discovery.","Srivastava, Vartika; Ahmad, Aijaz",J Infect Public Health,296,19

In this observational study, we aimed at assessing the presence of a malnutrition condition in SARS-Cov2 patients after the acute phase and the effects of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program on nutritional and functional status. METHODS: We recruited 48 patients (26 males/22 females) admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit after discharge from acute Covid Hospitals in northern Italy with negative swab for SARS-Cov2. We used the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria to identify patients with different degrees of malnutrition. Patients underwent a 3 to 4-week individual multidisciplinary rehabilitation program consisting of nutritional intervention (energy intake 27to30 kcal/die/kg and protein intake 1-1.3 g/die/kg), exercise for total body conditioning and progressive aerobic exercise with cycle- and arm-ergometer (45 min, 5 days/week). At admission and discharge from our Rehabilitation Unit, body composition and phase angle (PhA) (BIA101 Akern), muscle strength (handgrip, HG) and physical performance (Timed-Up-and-Go, TUG) were assessed. RESULTS: At admission in all patients the mean weight loss, as compared to the habitual weight, was -12.1 (7.6)%, mean BMI was 25.9 (7.9) kg/m2, mean Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Index (ASMI) was 6.6 (1.7) kg/m2 for males and 5.4 (1.4) kg/m2 for females, mean phase angle was 2.9 (0.9)°, mean muscle strength (HG) was 21.1 (7.8) kg for males and 16.4 (5.9) kg for females, mean TUG value was 23.7 (19.2) s. Based on GLIM criteria 29 patients (60% of the total) showed a malnutrition condition. 7 out of those 29 patients (24%) presented a mild/moderate grade and 22 patients (76%) a severe grade. After a rehabilitation program of an average duration of 25 days (range 13-46) ASMI increased, with statistically significant differences only in females (p = 0.001) and HG improved only in males (p = 0.0014). In all of the patients, body weight did not change, CRP/albumin (p < 0.05) and TUG (p < 0.001) were reduced and PhA increased (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We diagnosed a malnutrition condition in 60% of our post SARS-Cov2 patients. An individualized nutritional intervention with adequate energy and protein intake combined with tailored aerobic and strengthening exercise improved nutritional and functional status.","Gobbi, M; Brunani, A; Arreghini, M; Baccalaro, G; Dellepiane, D; La Vela, V; Lucchetti, E; Barbaglia, M; Cova, A; Fornara, E; Galli, S; Cimolin, V; Brugliera, L; Capodaglio, P",Clin. nutr.

To examine spatiotemporal changes in the transmission potential, we aimed to present regional estimates of the doubling time and reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 in the country. METHODS: Daily series of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the most affected regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We employed established mathematical and statistical methods to investigate the time-varying reproduction numbers and doubling time for COVID-19 in Korea. RESULTS: At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province experienced the first peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by a second wave in early June, withRt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu had yet to experience a second wave of the disease. During the first wave, mean Rt for these areas reached 3.5-4.4, and doubling time ranged from 2.8 to 4.6 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the effectiveness of control measures against COVID-19 in Korea. However, the easing of restrictions that had been imposed by the government in May 2020 facilitated a second wave in the greater Seoul area.","Shim, Eunha; Tariq, Amna; Chowell, Gerardo",Int J Infect Dis,296,6

Individual factors, family and contextual features, and community support may influence how individuals feel, think and act during a crisis. COVID-19 was an unexpected pandemic that forced many European countries to take confinement measures and restrict social face to face interactions. This study is an effort to understand how Portuguese residents dealt with the pandemic during the first confinement period, considering different sociodemographic characteristics and trauma exposure perceptions. Five hundred and five adults, between 18 and 79 years old participated in this study via an online self-report assessment protocol. Sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, age, marital status, employment status, and caring responsibilities had an impact on individuals' perceptions regarding their exposure to the pandemic and their quality of life. Perceived exposure to the pandemic was found to predict quality of life in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains. Results have practical implications for European and local policy-making, as well as for targeting psychological interventions for those whose mental health has been negatively affected by the pandemic and for those who may become more affected if confinement measures are implemented again.","Morgado, Alice Murteira; Cruz, Joana; Peixoto, Maria Manuela",Curr Psychol,296,30

As of 11 August 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases worldwide had reached 19 million, with 700,000 reported deaths, indicating this pandemic's significant global impact. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed the application of rehabilitation therapy in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients. A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Springer, CNKI, and Wanfang Data of database up to 1 August 2020. The search terms included the English terms and their Chinese equivalents: 'COVID-19,' 'ARDS,' 'rehabilitation,' 'critically ill patients,' 'physiotherapy,' 'respiratory rehabilitation,' 'traditional Chinese medicine,' and 'psychotherapy.' EXPERT OPINION: Rehabilitation research concerning patients with COVID-19 remains ongoing. Rehabilitation guidance for such patients with COVID-19 is based on previous experience. However, as different patients have differing degrees of dysfunction, personalized plans need to be designed according to the patients' age, sex, lifestyle, hobbies, occupation, and physical conditions. The rapid development of remote devices that can monitor patients' real-time physical conditions post-discharge may encourage better adherence to rehabilitation training.","Sun, Tiantian; Guo, Liyun; Tian, Fei; Dai, Tiantian; Xing, Xiaohong; Zhao, Junqing; Li, Qiang",Expert Rev Respir Med,296,11

In turn, COVID-19 sequelae may perpetuate existing health disparities. The co-occurrence of afflictions may also result in compromised safety performance. To curb the likelihood of a COVID-19 based truck driver syndemic, several action stepsare needed. First, key COVID-19 metrics need to be established for this population. Second, relationships between long-haul trucker network attributes and COVID-19 spread need to bedelineated. Third, mutually reinforcing interactions between endemic health disparities and COVID-19 vulnerability need to be elucidated.

METHODS: We included 257 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from three teaching hospitals in Rhode Island. We extracted data from within the first 24 hours of admission. Variables were excluded if values were missing in >20% of cases, otherwise missing values were imputed. 115 patients with complete data after imputation were used for primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis was done after exclusion of one variable (LDH) in the complete dataset (n=257). Primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and critical illness (mechanical ventilation or death), respectively. RESULTS: Only the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (RO-AUC) of COVID-GRAM (0.775, 95%CI 0.525-0.915) for in-hospital death, and CURB65 for in-hospital death (RO-AUC 0.842, 95%CI 0.674-0.932) or critical illness (RO-AUC=0.766, 95%CI 0.584-0.884) were significantly better than random. Sensitivity analysis yielded similar trends. Calibration plots showed better agreement between estimated and observed probability of in-hospital death for CURB65, compared to COVID-GRAM. The negative predictive value (NPV) of CURB65&#8805;2 was 97.2% for in-hospital death and 88.1% for critical illness. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-GRAM score demonstrated acceptable predictive performance for in-hospital death. The CURB65 score had better prognostic utility for in-hospital death and critical illness. The high NPV of CURB65 values &#8805;2, may be useful in triaging and allocation of resources.","Shi, Yiyun; Pandita, Aakriti; Hardesty, Anna; McCarthy, Meghan; Aridi, Jad; Weiss, Zoe F; Beckwith, Curt G; Farmakiotis, Dimitrios",Int J Clin Pract,296,16

The disease's size and magnitude is not uncommon but it appears to be at the point of hysteria surrounding it. Consequently, in a very short time, extreme measures for dealing with the situation appear to have become the norm. Any such actions affect the privacy of individuals in particular. For some cases, there is intensive monitoring of the whole population while the medical data of those diagnosed with the virus is commonly circulated through institutions and nations. This may well be in the interest of saving the world from a deadly disease, but is it really appropriate and right? Although creative solutions have been implemented in many countries to address the issue, proponents of privacy are concerned that technologies will eventually erode privacy, while regulators and privacy supporters are worried about what kind of impact this could bring. While that tension has always been present, privacy has been thrown into sharp relief by the sheer urgency of containing an exponentially spreading virus. The essence of this dilemma indicates that establishing the right equilibrium will be the best solution. The jurisprudence concerning cases regarding the willingness of public officials to interfere with the constitutional right to privacy in the interests of national security or public health has repeatedly proven that a reasonable balance can be reached.","Talukder, Sajedul; Sakib, Md.

The Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology established the Obstetrics and Gynecology MIRAI Committee in 2015. Within the MIRAI Committee, Japanese Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynecology (JTOG) was established; it was comprised of 20 promising young obstetrician-gynecologists recommended from regions across Japan. The office term is 2 years. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to learn and inform about the results of MIRAI's activities. METHODS: We surveyed the trends in new obstetrician-gynecologists and also matched each seminar participant with them. RESULT: The number of new memberships has been increasing since the nadir in 2016. In particular, there are over 100 more new physicians specializing in the field in 2020 than there were at the nadir in 2016. It was revealed that approximately 50% of the participants in the summer school specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. Furthermore, approximately 70% of POP2 participants specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, which shows that these two recruitment seminars are extraordinarily effective events that result in an increase in the number of new obstetricians and gynecologists. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the activities of this MIRAI Committee and JTOG have been effective. With the spread of COVID-19 and the inability of obstetrician-gynecologists and students/clinical trainees to perform social distancing, it is currently difficult to hold hands-on seminars.

METHOD: Participants were 202 abstinent smokers who completed the delay discounting task and the cigarette purchase task. In order to analyze the smoking relapse predictors and the impact of time to relapse, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were carried out. RESULTS: Fewer years of regular smoking (HR = .79, p = .014), as well as higher delay discounting (HR AUClogd = .80, p = .019) and intensity of demand (HR = 1.26, p = .019) were associated with a higher likelihood of smoking relapse. These variables were associated with a faster relapse. CONCLUSIONS: High delay discounting and intensity of demand were associated with a higher risk of relapse after quitting smoking. These findings highlight the importance of adapting treatment strategies for these two variables (delay discounting and cigarette demand), which might confer protective risk against smoking relapse.

STUDY DESIGN: For 34 European countries, publicly available data were collected on daily numbers of COVID-19 deaths, population size, healthcare capacity, government restrictions and their timing, tourism and change in mobility during the pandemic. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate generalised linear models using different selection algorithms (forward, backward, stepwise and genetic algorithm) were analysed with height of COVID-19 daily deaths' peak and time to the peak as dependent variables. RESULTS: The proportion of the population living in urban areas, mobility at the day of first reported death and number of infections when borders were closed were assessed as significant predictors of the height of COVID-19 daily deaths' peak. Testing the model with a variety of selection algorithms provided consistent results. Total hospital bed capacity, population size, the number of foreign travellers and the day of border closure were found to be significant predictors of time to COVID-19 daily deaths' peak. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that countries with higher proportions of the population living in urban areas, countries with lower reduction in mobility at the beginning of the pandemic and countries having more infected people when closing borders experienced a higher peak of COVID-19 deaths. Greater bed capacity, bigger population size and later border closure could result in delaying time to reach the deaths' peak, whereas a high number of foreign travellers could accelerate it.","Jablonska, Katarzyna; Aballéa, Samuel; Toumi, Mondher",Public Health,296,1

BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 outbreak a shortage of respirators is occurring worldwide; more specifically, CE-certified FFP2 respirators. This has resulted in an increased supply to hospitals of alternative respirators of uncertain quality. Nevertheless, the quality of the respirators used by our healthcare workers must be ensured. METHOD: A protocol and criteria based on applicable standards was developed to ensure the quality of respirators. The protocol has been implemented at the Catharina hospital and includes verification of the documents accompanying the respirator, visual inspection of the respirator and a test for total inward leak of particles into respirators. FINDINGS: 67% of the respirators brands and types received in the Catharina hospital did not meet quality criteria. CONCLUSION: With a simple verification protocol the quality of the respirators can be checked and guaranteed while there is a shortage of the CE approved respirators which are normally used. With this in-hospital protocol health care workers can be equipped with safe-to-use respirators.","van Wezel, Ralph A C; Vrancken, Anne C T; Ernest, Marieke; Laurensse, Johan; van Doornmalen Gomez Hoyos, Josephus P C M",J. hosp. infect,296,22

Affected patients fail to mount an appropriate humoral response against community acquired infectious diseases and recent reports have provided data supporting the increased susceptibility of these patients to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this context, the infusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma could represent an effective therapeutic strategy. CASE PRESENTATION: 25-year old woman diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency in 2013, developed severe COVID-19 that rapidly progressed to pneumonia presenting with multiple bilateral lung opacities that were both central and peripheral and presented as ground-glass and consolidation types involving all lobes, bilaterally. As blood oxygen saturation decayed and lung abnormalities were not responsive to large spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, patient was placed on mechanical ventilation and compassionate-use of approved COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma was introduced. The patient presented a rapid response to the approach and mechanical ventilation could be interrupted 24 h after first dose of COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma. As a whole, the patient received four doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma during a period of 6 days. There was rapid improvement of clinical status, with interruption of supplemental oxygen therapy after 6 days and reduction of lung abnormalities as evidence by sequential computed tomography scans. CONCLUSIONS: This is a single patient report that adds to other few reports on common variable immunodeficiency and agammaglobulinemia, suggesting that COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma could be a valuable therapeutic approach to treat patients affected by dysgammaglobulinemias and presenting severe COVID-19.","Ribeiro, Luciana C; Benites, Bruno Deltreggia; Ulaf, Raisa G; Nunes, Thyago A; Costa-Lima, Carolina; Addas-Carvalho, Marcelo; Proenca-Modena, José Luiz; Granja, Fabiana; da Costa, Vitor Antonio; Duarte, Adriana da Silva Santos; Zangirolami, Audrey Basso; Amaro, Emerson Clayton; Mansour, Eli; Zollner, Ricardo L; Velloso, Licio A",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,296,26

These provided high quality rest spaces with peer-to-peer psychological support provided by National Health Service (NHS) staff volunteers called 'wellbeing buddies', trained in psychological first aid. The aim of the study was to explore the views of centre visitors and operational staff towards this COVID-19 workforce wellbeing provision. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with twenty-four (20F, 4M) employees from an acute hospital trust in the UK. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed, data were handled and analysed using thematic analysis. Interviews generated 3 over-arching themes, and 13 sub-themes covering 'exposure and job roles', 'emotional impacts of COVID-19 and 'the wellbeing centres'. Supported wellbeing centres were viewed as critical for the wellbeing of hospital employees during the first surge of COVID-19 in the UK. Wellbeing initiatives require managerial advocacy and must be inclusive. Job-related barriers to work breaks and accessing staff wellbeing provisions should be addressed. High quality rest spaces and access to peer-to-peer support are seen to benefit individuals, teams, organisations and care quality. Training NHS staff in psychological first aid is a useful approach to supporting the wellbeing of the NHS workforce during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Blake, Holly; Gupta, Alisha; Javed, Mahnoor; Wood, Ben; Knowles, Steph; Coyne, Emma; Cooper, Joanne",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),296,3

Results were compared with clinical and functional parameters and outcomes. METHODS: All images underwent quantitative analyses with a dedicated workstation using a semi-automatic lung segmentation software to compute ventilated lung volume (VLV), Ground-glass opacity (GGO) volume (GGO-V), and consolidation volume (CONS-V) as absolute volume and as a percentage of total lung volume (TLV). The ratio between CONS-V, GGO-V, and VLV (CONS-V/VLV and GGO-V/VLV, respectively), TLV (CONS-V/TLV, GGO-V/TLV, and GGO-V + CONS-V/TLV respectively), and the ratio between VLV and TLV (VLV/TLV) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were enrolled. GGO-V/TLV significantly correlated with WBC (r = 0.369), neutrophils (r = 0.446), platelets (r = 0.182), CRP (r = 0.190), PaCO2 (r = 0.176), HCO3- (r = 0.284), and PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) values (r = - 0.344). CONS-V/TLV significantly correlated with WBC (r = 0.294), neutrophils (r = 0.300), lymphocytes (r = -0.225), CRP (r = 0.306), PaCO2 (r = 0.227), pH (r = 0.162), HCO3- (r = 0.394), and P/F (r = - 0.419) values. Statistically significant differences between CONS-V, GGO-V, GGO-V/TLV, CONS-V/TLV, GGO-V/VLV, CONS-V/VLV, GGO-V + CONS-V/TLV, VLV/TLV, CT score, and invasive ventilation by ET were found (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of quantitative semi-automated algorithm for lung CT elaboration effectively correlates the severity of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia with laboratory parameters and the need for invasive ventilation.

The development of ARDS has been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to determine whether serum KL-6 levels are associated with mortality and severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Among 361 Japanese patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Kanagawa Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center between February 2020 and December 2020, 356 patients with data on serum KL-6 levels were enrolled and their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A negative correlation was observed between KL-6 levels and the ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen on admission. The KL-6 levels on admission and the maximal KL-6 levels were higher in patients with severe disease (n = 60) than in those with nonsevere disease (n = 296). Furthermore, the maximal KL-6 levels were higher in nonsurvivors (n = 6) than in survivors (n = 350). In nonsurvivors, the KL-6 levels increased as the disease progressed. The optimal cutoff value of the maximal KL-6 level for discriminating between survivors and nonsurvivors was 684 U/mL, with a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 90.5%, and an area under the curve of 0.89.

Therefore possible hazards in tissue, blood, urine and aerosolized particles generated during surgery, are evaluated. Understanding the risk, recommendations for clinical practice are provided. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of available literature on urological and other surgical procedures in patients with virus infections such as HPV, HIV and hepatitis B and current publications on COVID-19. RESULTS: Several possible pathways for viral transmission appear in the literature. Recent groups detected SARS-CoV-2 in the urine and faeces, even after negative pharyngeal swabs. In addition, viral RNA can be detected in the blood and several tissues. During surgery, viral particles are released, aerosole-borne and present a certain risk for transmission and infection. However, there is currently no evidence on the exact risk for infection by the substances mentioned above. It remains unclear whether or not viral particles in the urine, blood or faeces are infectious. CONCLUSIONS: Whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by aerosols remains controversial. In any case, standard surgical masks offer inadequate protection from SARS-CoV-2. Full PPE including at least FFP-2 masks and safety goggles should be used. Aerosolized particles might remain for a longer time in the operation theatre and contaminate other surfaces, like floors or computer input devices. Therefore scrupulous hygiene and disinfection of surfaces must be carried out. To prevent aerosolization during laparoscopic interventions, the pneumoperitoneum should be evacuated with suction devices. The use of virus proof HEPA filters is recommended. Local separation of anesthesia/intubation and operation theatre can reduce the danger of viral transmission. Lumbar anaesthesia should be considered especially in endourology. Based on current knowledge, COVID-19 is no contraindication for acute urological surgery. If possible however, as european guideline committees recommend, non-emergency urological interventions should be postponed until negative SARS-CoV-2 tests become available.","Kunz, Yannic; Horninger, Wolfgang; Pinggera, Germar-M",BJU int,296,24

In public health emergencies over the past several decades, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has played a major role in providing guidance, resources, and other support to state and local public health departments, for example, in large foodborne disease outbreaks, in response to major natural disasters, and especially in response to large-scale infectious disease threats (e.g., West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and H1N1 influenza).1 (Am J Public Health.

Using parameter estimates derived from the recorded mortality data, a numerical (SEIR) model was developed to predict the spread of Covid-19 sub regionally. Model outputs, including analysis of transmission rates and the basic reproduction number, suggest national lockdown flattened the curve and reduced potential deaths by up to 4000 locally. The modelled number of infected and recovered individuals is higher than official estimates, and a revised form of the theoretical critical population fraction requiring immunisation is derived. Combining published (sub-regional) mortality rate data with deterministic models on disease spread has the potential to help public health practitioners refine bespoke mitigation plans guided by local population demographics.","Petford, N.; Campbell, J.",The Open Public Health Journal,296,21

The purpose of this study was to quantify the imaging volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic across patient service locations and imaging modality types. METHODS: Imaging case volumes in a large health care system were retrospectively studied, analyzing weekly imaging volumes by patient service locations (emergency department, inpatient, outpatient) and modality types (x-ray, mammography, CT, MRI, ultrasound, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine) in years 2020 and 2019. The data set was split to compare pre-COVID-19 (weeks 1-9) and post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) periods. Independent-samples t tests compared the mean weekly volumes in 2020 and 2019. RESULTS: Total imaging volume in 2020 (weeks 1-16) declined by 12.29% (from 522,645 to 458,438) compared with 2019. Post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) revealed a greater decrease (28.10%) in imaging volumes across all patient service locations (range 13.60%-56.59%) and modality types (range 14.22%-58.42%). Total mean weekly volume in 2020 post-COVID-19 (24,383 [95% confidence interval 19,478-29,288]) was statistically reduced (P = .003) compared with 33,913 [95% confidence interval 33,429-34,396] in 2019 across all patient service locations and modality types. The greatest decline in 2020 was seen at week 16 specifically for outpatient imaging (88%) affecting all modality types: mammography (94%), nuclear medicine (85%), MRI (74%), ultrasound (64%), interventional (56%), CT (46%), and x-ray (22%). DISCUSSION: Because the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, these results may assist in guiding short- and long-term practice decisions based on the magnitude of imaging volume decline across different patient service locations and specific imaging modality types.","Naidich, Jason J; Boltyenkov, Artem; Wang, Jason J; Chusid, Jesse; Hughes, Danny; Sanelli, Pina C",J Am Coll Radiol,296,27

The uptake of facemasks, however, remains far from universal in countries where this practice lacks cultural roots. In this paper, we aim to identify the barriers to mask-wearing in Spain, a country with no mask-wearing culture. We conduct one of the first nationally representative surveys (n = 4,000) about this unprecedented public health emergency and identify the profile of citizens who are more resistant to face-masking: young, educated, unconcerned with being infected, and with an introverted personality. Our results further indicate a positive correlation between a social norm of mask-wearing and mask uptake and demonstrate that uptake of facemasks is especially high among the elderly living in localities where mask-wearing behavior is popular. These results are robust when controlling for respondents' demographics, time spent at home, and occupation fixed effects. Our findings can be useful for policymakers to devise effective programs for improving public compliance.","Barceló, Joan; Sheen, Greg Chih-Hsin",PLoS One,296,6

Neutralizing antibodies are a potential treatment for COVID-19. Objective: To determine the effect of bamlanivimab monotherapy and combination therapy with bamlanivimab and etesevimab on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in mild to moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The BLAZE-1 study is a randomized phase 2/3 trial at 49 US centers including ambulatory patients (N = 613) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and had 1 or more mild to moderate symptoms. Patients who received bamlanivimab monotherapy or placebo were enrolled first (June 17-August 21, 2020) followed by patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab or placebo (August 22-September 3). These are the final analyses and represent findings through October 6, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of bamlanivimab (700 mg [n = 101], 2800 mg [n = 107], or 7000 mg [n = 101]), the combination treatment (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab [n = 112]), or placebo (n = 156). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in SARS-CoV-2 log viral load at day 11 (±4 days). Nine prespecified secondary outcome measures were evaluated with comparisons between each treatment group and placebo, and included 3 other measures of viral load, 5 on symptoms, and 1 measure of clinical outcome (the proportion of patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, an emergency department [ED] visit, or death at day 29). Results: Among the 577 patients who were randomized and received an infusion (mean age, 44.7 [SD, 15.7] years; 315 [54.6%] women), 533 (92.4%) completed the efficacy evaluation period (day 29). The change in log viral load from baseline at day 11 was -3.72 for 700 mg, -4.08 for 2800 mg, -3.49 for 7000 mg, -4.37 for combination treatment, and -3.80 for placebo. Compared with placebo, the differences in the change in log viral load at day 11 were 0.09 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.52; P = .69) for 700 mg, -0.27 (95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; P = .21) for 2800 mg, 0.31 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.76; P = .16) for 7000 mg, and -0.57 (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.14; P = .01) for combination treatment. Among the secondary outcome measures, differences between each treatment group vs the placebo group were statistically significant for 10 of 84 end points. The proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations or ED visits was 5.8% (9 events) for placebo, 1.0% (1 event) for 700 mg, 1.9% (2 events) for 2800 mg, 2.0% (2 events) for 7000 mg, and 0.9% (1 event) for combination treatment. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 9 patients (6 bamlanivimab, 2 combination treatment, and 1 placebo). No deaths occurred during the study treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, compared with placebo, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11; no significant difference in viral load reduction was observed for bamlanivimab monotherapy. Further ongoing clinical trials will focus on assessing the clinical benefit of antispike neutralizing antibodies in patients with COVID-19 as a primary end point.

The current study aimed to further examine the possible impact of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on in hospital mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data from the second largest insurance fund in Germany, BARMER. Patients hospitalised for ST elevation (STEMI) and non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, acute limb ischaemia (ALI), aortic rupture, acute stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) between 1 January 2017, and 31 October 2020, were included. Admission rates per 10 000 insured and mortality were compared between March - June 2017 - 2019 (pre-COVID) and March - June 2020 (COVID). Mortality rates were determined by the occurrence of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 316 718 hospitalisations were included (48.7% female, mean 72.5 years), and 21 191 (6.7%, 95% CI 6.6% - 6.8%) deaths occurred. In hospital mortality increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with the three previous years for patients with acute stroke from 8.3% (95% CI 8.0 - 8.5) to 9.6% (95% CI 9.1 - 10.2), while no statistically significant changes were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, ALI, aortic rupture, and TIA. When comparing patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.4%, 95% CI 2.3 - 2.5) vs. non-infected patients, a higher in hospital mortality was observed for acute stroke (12.4% vs. 9.0%), ALI (14.3% vs. 5.0%), and TIA (2.7% vs. 0.3%), while no statistically significant differences were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, and aortic rupture. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis of claims data has provided hints of an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and increased in hospital mortality in patients with acute stroke. Furthermore, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased mortality in patients with stroke, TIA, and ALI. Future studies are urgently needed to better understand the underlying mechanism and relationship between the new coronavirus and acute stroke.","Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Seiffert, Moritz; Gerloff, Christian; L039,; Hoest, Helmut; Acar, Laura; Thomalla, Götz",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,296,1

Recently, concern arose on unrecognized infections before this date. For a better understanding of the pandemic, we retrospectively analyzed patient samples for SARS-CoV-2 from the prospective CAPNETZ study cohort. METHODS: We used nasopharyngeal swab samples from a cohort of well characterized patients with community acquired pneumonia of the CAPNETZ study group, recruited from different geographic regions across Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland between 02nd December 2019 and 28th April 2020. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR for a broad range of respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR were performed on all samples. RESULTS: In our cohort, respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 21.5% (42/195) of patients with rhinovirus as the most frequently detected pathogen. The detection rate increased to 29.7% (58/195) when SARS-CoV-2 was included. No SARS-CoV-2 positive sample was detected before end of March 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viral pathogens accounted for a considerable number of positive results but no SARS-CoV-2 case was identified before the end of March 2020.","Panning, Marcus; Wiener, Julius; Rothe, Kathrin; Schneider, Jochen; Pletz, Mathias W; Rohde, Gernot; Rupp, Jan; Witzenrath, Martin; Spinner, Christoph D",Infection,296,29

This study aimed to estimate the impact of such changes on migraine severity during 2020 March-May lockdown. METHODS: Patients affected by migraine with or without aura, diagnosed by expert physicians, completed a detailed interview comprehensive of: assessment of migraine characteristics; measure of physical activity (PA) levels; measure of the intake frequency of main Italian foods; the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire investigating sleep disorders. RESULTS: We included 261 patients with a mean age of 44.5 ± 12.3 years. During social distancing, 72 patients (28%) reported a headache worsening, 86 (33%) an improvement, and 103 (39%) a stable headache frequency. A significant decrease of the PA levels during COVID-19 quarantine in the whole study sample was observed (median total metabolic equivalent task (METs) decreased from 1170 to 510; p < 0.001). Additionally, a significant difference was reported on median ISI scores (from 7 to 8; p < 0.001), which were increased in patients who presented a stable or worsening headache. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that the restrictions taken during the pandemic have affected the practice of PA levels and sleep quality in migraine. Hence, PA and sleep quality should be assessed to find strategies for an improvement in quality of life.","Di Stefano, Vincenzo; Ornello, Raffaele; Gagliardo, Andrea; Torrente, Angelo; Illuminato, Elisa; Caponnetto, Valeria; Frattale, Ilaria; Golini, Raffaella; Di Felice, Chiara; Graziano, Fabiola; Caccamo, Maria; Ventimiglia, Davide; Iacono, Salvatore; Matarazzo, Gabriella; Armetta, Francesco; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Firenze, Alberto; Sacco, Simona; Brighina, Filippo",Nutrients,296,29

The closure or reduction of community services people rely on after release such as treatment centres and shelters has exacerbated the risks of poor health outcomes and harms. This paper aims to learn from peer health mentors (PHM) about changes to their work during overlapping health emergencies, as well as barriers and opportunities to support people leaving prison in this context. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The Unlocking the Gates (UTG) Peer Health Mentoring Program supports people leaving prison in British Columbia during the first three days after release. The authors conducted two focus groups with PHM over video conference in May 2020. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and themes were iteratively developed using narrative thematic analysis. FINDINGS: The findings highlighted the importance of peer health mentorship for people leaving prisons. PHM discussed increased opportunities for collaboration, ways the pandemic has changed how they are able to provide support, and how PHM are able to remain responsive and flexible to meet client needs. Additionally, PHM illuminated ways that COVID-19 has exacerbated existing barriers and identified specific actions needed to support client health, including increased housing and recovery beds, and tools for social and emotional well-being. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This study contributes to our understanding of peer health mentorship during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of mentors. PHM expertise can support release planning, improved health and well-being of people leaving prison and facilitate policy-supported pandemic responses.","McLeod, Katherine E; Timler, Kelsey; Korchinski, Mo; Young, Pamela; Milkovich, Tammy; McBride, Cheri; Young, Glenn; Wardell, William; Condello, Lara-Lisa; Buxton, Jane A; Janssen, Patricia A; Martin, Ruth Elwood",International journal of prisoner health (Online),296,8

METHODS: We present a multicenter case series from 9 centers in the United States of patients with acute neurological deficits consistent with AIS and COVID-19 who were treated with IV tPA. RESULTS: We identified 13 patients (mean age 62 (±9.8) years, 9 (69.2%) male). All received IV tPA and 3 cases also underwent mechanical thrombectomy. All patients had systemic symptoms consistent with COVID-19 at the time of admission: fever (5 patients), cough (7 patients), and dyspnea (8 patients). The median admission NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score was 14.5 (range 3-26) and most patients (61.5%) improved at follow up (median NIHSS score 7.5, range 0-25). No systemic or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages were seen. Stroke mechanisms included cardioembolic (3 patients), large artery atherosclerosis (2 patients), small vessel disease (1 patient), embolic stroke of undetermined source (3 patients), and cryptogenic with incomplete investigation (1 patient). Three patients were determined to have transient ischemic attacks or aborted strokes. Two out of 12 (16.6%) patients had elevated fibrinogen levels on admission (mean 262.2 ± 87.5 mg/dl), and 7 out of 11 (63.6%) patients had an elevated D-dimer level (mean 4284.6 ±3368.9 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: IV tPA may be safe and efficacious in COVID-19, but larger studies are needed to validate these results.","Carneiro, Thiago; Dashkoff, Jonathan; Leung, Lester Y; Nobleza, Christa O039; Hana, S; Marulanda-Londono, Erika; Hathidara, Mausaminben; Koch, Sebastian; Sur, Nicole; Boske, Alexandra; Voetsch, Barbara; Aboul Nour, Hassan; Miller, Daniel J; Daneshmand, Ali; Shulman, Julie; Curiale, Gioacchino; Greer, David M; Romero, Jose Rafael; Anand, Pria; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,296,23

Prevalence of clinical co-morbidities and laboratory abnormalities were compared between groups using descriptive statistics. Univariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of mortality, ICU care and mechanical ventilation. Predictors significant at P &#8804; .10 were included in multivariate analysis. Five hundred and sixty patients were included in the analysis. Age and myocardial injury were only independent predictors of mortality, in patients with/without baseline co-morbidities.

It has now been clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV­2 resides in the upper airways and transmits easily via aerosols and droplets, which significantly increases the risk of infection when performing upper airway procedures. Ventilated COVID-19 patients in a critical condition in the intensive care unit may require tracheotomy for long-term ventilation and to improve weaning. However, the risk of secondary infection of medical personnel performing subsequent tracheostomy care remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the risk of droplet dispersion during tracheostomy tube change and overview tracheostomy tube change in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature was reviewed, quantitative and qualitative analyses of droplet formation during tracheostomy tube change in nâ¯= 8 patients were performed, and an overview of and checklist for tracheostomy tube change were compiled. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that tracheostomy tube change, in particular insertion of the new tube, may cause significant droplet formation. The aerosolization of particles smaller than 5â¯µm was not analyzed. CONCLUSION: Our data, together with the current literature, clearly emphasize that tracheostomy care is associated with a high infection risk and should only be performed by a small group of well-trained, maximally protected healthcare personnel.","Kempfle, J S; Löwenheim, H; Huebner, M J; Iro, H; Mueller, S K",HNO,296,1

People with underlying psychiatric disorders are more susceptible to stress than the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of concomitant psychiatric conditions in the orthopaedic trauma population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated orthopaedic trauma patients who received care at our institution between February through April of 2019 and February through April of 2020. Patient sex, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, fracture location, tobacco use, employment status, mental health diagnosis and presence of interpersonal violence were documented. Mental health diagnoses were defined based on International Classification of Diseases-10 classification. RESULTS: The study included 553 orthopaedic patients evaluated at our institution during the defined time period. Patients in the 2020 cohort had a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses (26% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001) compared with the 2019 group. The odds ratio for mental health disorder in the 2020 patients was 2.21 (95% CI 1.54, 3.18) compared with the 2019 cohort. The 2020 cohort had a higher percentage of patients who reported interpersonal violence (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disease among orthopaedic trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with those seen during the same time of the year in 2019.

AIM: The study objective was to propose a method for recording sequences of HCW behaviours during mock vs. actual procedures and to evaluate differences for use in infection risk modelling and staff training. METHODS: Procedures for three types of care were observed under mock and actual settings: IV-drip care, observational care, and doctors' rounds on a respiratory ward in a university teaching hospital. Contacts and hand hygiene behaviours were recorded in real-time using either a handheld tablet or video cameras. FINDINGS: Actual patient care demonstrated 70% more surface contacts. It was also 2.4 minutes longer but equal in terms of patient contacts. On average, doctors spent 7.5mins (2.5mins for mock) with patients whilst auxiliary nurses took 4.9mins for ""obs"" (2.4mins for mock). While registered nurses took 3.2mins for mock IV-care and 3.8mins for actual observation this translated to a 44% increase in contacts. In 51% of actual care and 37% of mock care episodes, hand hygiene was performed before patient contact; in comparison, 15% of staff delivering actual care performed hand hygiene after patient contact on leaving the room vs 22% for mock care. Number of overall touches in the patient room was a modest predictor of hand hygiene.

However, bone mineral density does not account for all the fragility fractures, being a part of them attributable to impairment in bone quality. Aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of DXA-derived geometry and structural indexes in the assessment of bone status in mastocytosis. Ninety-six consecutive patients (46 women and 50 men) affected by cutaneous (CM) or systemic (SM) mastocytosis were studied. Mean age (± SD) was 53.3 ± 14.23. Spine lateral X-rays for Genant's scale, DXA for lumbar (L) and femoral (F) bone mineral density (BMD), bone strain index (BSI), lumbar trabecular bone score (TBS), and hip structural analysis (HSA) were performed. Among the laboratory variables, data of serum tryptase were reported. Tryptase was higher in SM (p = 0.035), inversely correlated with LBMD (r = - 0.232; p = 0.022) and TBS (r = - 0.280; p = 0.005), and directly with L-BSI (r = 0.276; p = 0.006). L-BSI remained statistically significant (p = 0.006; adjusted R2 = 0.101) together with mastocytosis (SM or CM: p = 0.034) in the multivariate regression model with tryptase as dependent variable, being LBMD and TBS not statistically significant (p = 0.887, and p = 0.245, respectively). Tryptase increased about 22 units for each unit increase of L-BSI and about 18 units for SM against CM. L-BSI was lower (p = 0.012), while FN-BSI and FT-BSI were higher in women (p < 0.001) than in men. HSA indexes were significantly higher in men, particularly with SM. SM is a risk factor for reduced bone mass, texture and strength. Since mean L-BSI and Z-modulus of all the femoral sites are statistically higher in men than in female, it could be argued that men have a better femoral bone resistance to bending forces than women, but a worse lumbar bone resistance to compressive loads. DXA indexes of bone quality are useful in mastocytosis' bone assessment and its clinical management.","Ulivieri, Fabio Massimo; Rinaudo, Luca; Piodi, Luca Petruccio; Barbieri, Valentina; Marotta, Giorgio; Sciumè, Mariarita; Grifoni, Federica Irene; Cesana, Bruno Mario",Calcif. tissue int,296,29

Antigen-based rapid detection tests are available; however, insufficient data about their performance are available. METHODS: The lateral-flow immunochromatographic BIOCREDIT COVID-19 antigen test was evaluated using nasopharyngeal swabs in a viral transport medium from patients with confirmed infection, contacts, and exposed healthcare professionals at Fayoum University Hospital in Egypt. Test performance was determined in comparison to the SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. RESULTS: Three hundred ten specimens from 3 categories-patients with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19, contacts, and exposed healthcare professionals-were included; 188 specimens were RT-PCR-positive, from which 81 were detected by rapid antigen test. Overall sensitivity was 43.1%. Sensitivity was significantly higher in specimens with high viral loads. CONCLUSION: Poor sensitivity of the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 test does not permit its use for diagnosis, and it can only be used in conjunction with RT-PCR for screening.","Abdelrazik, Abeer Mohamed; Elshafie, Shahira Morsy; Abdelaziz, Hossam M",,296,30

We hypothesize that, in addition to viral load and host antibody repertoire, host genetic variants influence vulnerability to infection. Here we apply human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models and CRISPR engineering to explore the host genetics of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs4702), common in the population and located in the 3' UTR of the protease FURIN, influences alveolar and neuron infection by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Thus, we provide a proof-of-principle finding that common genetic variation can have an impact on viral infection and thus contribute to clinical heterogeneity in COVID-19.

Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health-care workers (HCWs). The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCWs. RESEARCH QUESTION: âªâªâª STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. INTERPRETATION: The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections. In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.","Wahidi, Momen M; Shojaee, Samira; Lamb, Carla R; Ost, David; Maldonado, Fabien; Eapen, George; Caroff, Daniel A; Stevens, Michael P; Ouellette, Daniel R; Lilly, Craig; Gardner, Donna D; Glisinski, Kristen; Pennington, Kelly; Alalawi, Raed",Chest,296,4

The coronavirus spike glycoprotein contains three (S1, S2, and S2') cleavage sites that are processed by human host proteases. The exact nature of these cleavage sites, and their respective processing proteases, can determine whether the virus can cross species and the level of pathogenicity. Recent comparisons of the genomes of the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV, with less pathogenic strains (e.g., Bat-RaTG13, the bat homologue of SARS-CoV2) identified possible mutations in the receptor binding domain and in the S1 and S2' cleavage sites of their spike glycoprotein. However, there remains some confusion on the relative roles of the possible serine proteases involved for priming. Using anthrax toxin as a model system, we show that in vivo inhibition of priming by pan-active serine protease inhibitors can be effective at suppressing toxicity. Hence, our studies should encourage further efforts in developing either pan-serine protease inhibitors or inhibitor cocktails to target SARS-CoV2 and potentially ward off future pandemics that could develop because of additional mutations in the S-protein priming sequence in coronaviruses.","Barile, Elisa; Baggio, Carlo; Gambini, Luca; Shiryaev, Sergey A; Strongin, Alex Y; Pellecchia, Maurizio",Molecules (Basel),296,32

Methods: Between January-June 2019 and January-June 2020, we compared the proportion of ischemic strokes (total & direct CSC presentations) & intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) relative to total admissions using logistic regression, and among the direct CSC presentations, we compared door to tPA and thrombectomy times using Wilcoxon Rank Sum. Results: A total of 4808 cases were assessed (Table 1). There was an initial drop of ∼30% in cases at the pandemic onset (Fig.1). Numerically fewer patients in the 2020 period were seen at primary and CSCs (Table 1).

Being a recent virus outbreak, there are still no available therapeutic regimens that have been approved in large randomised trials and so patients are currently being treated with multiple drugs. This raises concerns regarding drug interaction and their implication in arrhythmic burden. In fact, two of the actually used drugs against SARS-CoV2, such as chloroquine and the combination lopinavir/ritonavir, might determine a QT (the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) interval prolongation and they show several interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs and antipsychotic medications, making them prone to an increased risk of developing arrhythmias. This brief review focuses the attention on the most relevant drug interactions involving the currently used COVID-19 medications and their possible association with cardiac rhythm disorders, taking into account also pre-existing condition and precipitating factors that might additionally increase this risk. Furthermore, based on the available evidence and based on the knowledge of drug interaction, we propose a quick and simple algorithm that might help both cardiologists and non-cardiologists in the management of the arrhythmic risk before and during the treatment with the specific drugs used against SARS-CoV2.","Sciaccaluga, Carlotta; Cameli, Matteo; Menci, Daniele; Mandoli, Giulia Elena; Sisti, Nicolò; Cameli, Paolo; Franchi, Federico; Mondillo, Sergio; Valente, Serafina",Postgrad. med. j,296,13

METHODS: Emergency funding allocation criteria and funding amounts by general practice were obtained from the MOH. Practices were stratified according to their proportion of high-needs enrolled patients (Maori, Pacific or living in an area with the highest quintile of socioeconomic deprivation). Funding per practice was calculated for separate and total payments according to practice stratum of high-needs enrolled patients. RESULTS: The median combined March and April funding for general practices with 80% high-needs patients was 28% higher per practice ($36,674 vs $28,686) and 48% higher per patient ($10.50 vs $7.11) compared with the funding received by general practices with fewer than 20% high-needs patients. Although the March allocation did increase funding for high-needs patients, the April allocation did not.

Consequently, visuality and social media platforms like Twitter have come to play a vital role in disseminating prevention messages widely. Yet to date, only little is known about what characterizes visual risk communication during the Covid-19 pandemic. To address this gap in the literature, this study's objective was to determine how visual risk communication was used on Twitter to promote the World Health Organisations (WHO) recommended preventative behaviours and how this communication changed over time. METHODS: We sourced Twitter's 500 most retweeted Covid-19 messages for each month from January-October 2020 using Crowdbreaks. For inclusion, tweets had to have visuals, be in English, come from verified accounts, and contain one of the keywords 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'corona', or 'covid'. Following a retrospective approach, we then performed a qualitative content analysis of the 616 tweets meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Our results show communication dynamics changed over the course of the pandemic. At the start, most retweeted preventative messages came from the media and health and government institutions, but overall, personal accounts with many followers (51.3%) predominated, and their tweets had the highest spread (10.0%, i.e., retweet count divided by followers). Messages used mostly photographs and images were found to be rich with information. 78.1% of Tweets contained 1-2 preventative messages, whereby 'stay home' and 'wear a mask' frequented most. Although more tweets used health loss framing, health gain messages spread more. CONCLUSION: Our findings can inform the didactics of future crisis communication. The results underscore the value of engaging individuals, particularly influencers, as advocates to spread health risk messages and promote solidarity. Further, our findings on the visual characteristic of the most retweeted tweets highlight factors that health and government organisations should consider when creating visual health messages for Twitter. However, that more tweets used the emotive medium of photographs often combined with health loss framing raises concerns about persuasive tactics. More research is needed to understand the implications of framing and its impact on public perceptions and behaviours.","Sleigh, Joanna; Amann, Julia; Schneider, Manuel; Vayena, Effy",BMC Public Health,296,13

However, accurately mapping the time-to-event of hospital outcomes, such as the LoS in the intensive care unit (ICU), requires understanding patient trajectories while adjusting for covariates and observation bias, such as incomplete data. Standard methods, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator, require prior assumptions that are untenable given current knowledge. Using real-time surveillance data from the first weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic in Galicia (Spain), we aimed to model the time-to-event and event probabilities of patients' hospitalised, without parametric priors and adjusting for individual covariates. We applied a non-parametric mixture cure model and compared its performance in estimating hospital ward (HW)/ICU LoS to the performances of commonly used methods to estimate survival. We showed that the proposed model outperformed standard approaches, providing more accurate ICU and HW LoS estimates. Finally, we applied our model estimates to simulate COVID-19 hospital demand using a Monte Carlo algorithm. We provided evidence that adjusting for sex, generally overlooked in prediction models, together with age is key for accurately forecasting HW and ICU occupancy, as well as discharge or death outcomes.","López-Cheda, Ana; Jácome, María-Amalia; Cao, Ricardo; De Salazar, Pablo M",Epidemiol Infect,296,16

Based on the Italian COVID-19 death surveillance, which collects data from all the hospitals throughout the country, we aimed to describe clinical features and care pathway of patients dying with COVID-19 and a preceding diagnosis of a PD. Methods: in this cross-sectional study, the characteristics of a representative sample of patients, who have died with COVID-19 in Italian hospitals between February 21st and August 3rd 2020, were drawn from medical charts, described and analysed by multinomial logistic regression according to the recorded psychiatric diagnosis: no PD, severe PD (SPD) (i.e. schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders), common mental disorder (CMD) (i.e. depression without psychotic features, anxiety disorders). Findings: the 4020 COVID-19 deaths included in the study took place in 365 hospitals across Italy. Out of the 4020 deceased patients, 84 (2â¢1%) had a previous SPD, 177 (4.4%) a CMD. The mean age at death was 78.0 (95%CI 77.6-78.3) years among patients without a PD, 71.8 (95%CI 69.3-72.0) among those with an SPD, 79.5 (95%CI 78.0-81.1) in individuals with a CMD. 2253 (61.2%) patients without a PD, 62 (73.8%) with an SPD, and 136 (78.2%) with a CMD were diagnosed with three or more non-psychiatric comorbidities.When we adjusted for clinically relevant variables, including hospital of death, we found that SPD patients died at a younger age than those without a PD (adjusted OR per 1 year increment 0.96; 95% CI 0.94-0.98). Women were significantly more represented among CMD patients compared to patients without previous psychiatric history (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.05-2.32). Hospital admission from long-term care facilities (LTCFs) was strongly associated with having an SPD (aOR 9.02; 95% CI 4.99-16.3) or a CMD (aOR 2.09; 95% CI 1.19-3.66). Comorbidity burden, fever, admission to intensive care and time from symptoms' onset to nasopharyngeal swab did not result significantly associated with an SPD or with a CMD in comparison to those without any PD. Interpretation: even where equal treatment is in place, the vulnerability of patients with a PD may reduce their chance of recovering from COVID-19. The promotion of personalised therapeutic projects aimed at including people with PD in the community rather than in non-psychiatric LTCFs should be prioritised.","Lega, Ilaria; Nisticò, Lorenza; Palmieri, Luigi; Caroppo, Emanuele; Lo Noce, Cinzia; Donfrancesco, Chiara; Vanacore, Nicola; Scattoni, Maria Luisa; Picardi, Angelo; Gigantesco, Antonella; Brusaferro, Silvio; Onder, Graziano",EClinicalMedicine,296,20

Previous research on the effects of wearing veils or face-covering niqabs showed that covering of the mouth led to the attribution of negative emotions and to the perception of less intense positive emotions. The current study compares a sample from the Netherlands with a sample from the United Arab Emirates on their perception of emotions from faces covered by a niqab, censoring black bars, or uncovered faces. The results show that covering the mouth area leads to greater anxiety in participants in both countries. Furthermore, although participants did not report greater decoding difficulties for faces that were covered as compared to fully visible, results show that face coverage did influence emotion perception. Specifically, happiness and anger were perceived as being less intense. Further, face coverage by a niqab, as compared to black bars, yielded lower emotional intensity ratings. We conclude that face coverage in particular can modulate the perception of emotions, but that affective contextual cues may play a role as well.","Kret, M. E.; Maitner, A. T.; Fischer, A.

It explores the relevant factors affecting mental health and provides evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used the Chinese version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21 (DASS-21) to assess the mental health and the impact of events scale-revised (IES-R) to assess the COVID-19 psychological impact. RESULTS: The students with hearing loss are frustrated with their disability and particularly vulnerable to stress symptoms, but they are highly endurable in mitigating this negative impact on coping with their well-being and responsibilities. They are also more resilient psychologically but less resistant mentally to the pandemic impacts than the students with normal hearing. Their mental and psychological response to the pandemic is associated with more related factors and variables than that of the students with normal hearing is. CONCLUSIONS: To safeguard the welfare of society, timely information on the pandemic, essential services for communication disorders, additional assistance and support in mental counseling should be provided to the vulnerable persons with hearing loss that are more susceptible to a public health emergency.","Yang, Ying; Xiao, Yanan; Liu, Yulu; Li, Qiong; Shan, Changshuo; Chang, Shulin; Jen, Philip H-S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),296,16

Broadcast TV!",14.401543,3.2464156,2020,"Since December 2019, the world has been devastated by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Emergency Departments have been experiencing situations of urgency where clinical experts, without long experience and mature means in the fight against COVID-19, have to rapidly decide the most proper patient treatment. In this context, we introduce an artificially intelligent tool for effective and efficient Computed Tomography (CT)-based risk assessment to improve treatment and patient care. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven approach built on top of volume-of-interest aware deep neural networks for automatic COVID-19 patient risk assessment (discharged, hospitalized, intensive care unit) based on lung infection quantization through segmentation and, subsequently, CT classification. We tackle the high and varying dimensionality of the CT input by detecting and analyzing only a sub-volume of the CT, the Volume-of-Interest (VoI). Differently from recent strategies that consider infected CT slices without requiring any spatial coherency between them, or use the whole lung volume by applying abrupt and lossy volume down-sampling, we assess only the ""most infected volume"" composed of slices at its original spatial resolution. To achieve the above, we create, present and publish a new labeled and annotated CT dataset with 626 CT samples from COVID-19 patients. The comparison against such strategies proves the effectiveness of our VoI-based approach. We achieve remarkable performance on patient risk assessment evaluated on balanced data by reaching 88.88%, 89.77%, 94.73% and 88.88% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score, respectively.","Chatzitofis, Anargyros; Cancian, Pierandrea; Gkitsas, Vasileios; Carlucci, Alessandro; Stalidis, Panagiotis; Albanis, Georgios; Karakottas, Antonis; Semertzidis, Theodoros; Daras, Petros; Giannitto, Caterina; Casiraghi, Elena; Sposta, Federica Mrakic; Vatteroni, Giulia; Ammirabile, Angela; Lofino, Ludovica; Ragucci, Pasquala; Laino, Maria Elena; Voza, Antonio; Desai, Antonio; Cecconi, Maurizio; Balzarini, Luca; Chiti, Arturo; Zarpalas, Dimitrios; Savevski, Victor",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),296,20

To do this, government statistics regarding the level of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 per municipality were combined with statistics regarding church attendance and church membership rates. Results showed that in the Dutch Bible belt the level of patients with COVID-19 was strongly related to church attendance, but in the southern, traditionally Catholic part of The Netherlands nominal church membership mattered more than church attendance. On the basis of these findings, the conclusion was drawn that religion probably facilitates the spread of the virus in both a direct and indirect way. It facilitates the spread of the virus directly through worship services but also indirectly by way of endorsing more general cultural festivities like carnival and maybe even by strengthening certain non-religious social bonds. Epidemiologists monitoring the spread of the virus are called upon to focus more on these possible indirect or latent effects of religion.","Vermeer, Paul; Kregting, Joris",Religions,296,26

However, there are no consistent data about who might benefit most from it. METHODS: We administered TCZ on a compassionate-use basis to patients with SSP who were hospitalized (excluding intensive care and intubated cases) and who required oxygen support to have a saturation >93%. The primary endpoint was intubation or death after 24 h of its administration. Patients received at least one dose of 400 mg intravenous TCZ from March 8, 2020 to April 20, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 207 patients were studied and 186 analyzed. The mean age was 65 years and 68% were male patients. A coexisting condition was present in 68% of cases. Prognostic factors of death were older age, higher IL-6, d-dimer and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP), lower total lymphocytes, and severe disease that requires additional oxygen support. The primary endpoint (intubation or death) was significantly worst (37% vs 13%, p < 0·001) in those receiving the drug when the oxygen support was high (FiO2 >0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: TCZ is well tolerated in patients with SSP, but it has a limited effect on the evolution of cases with high oxygen support needs.","Górgolas Hernández-Mora, Miguel; Cabello Úbeda, Alfonso; Prieto-Pérez, Laura; Villar Álvarez, Felipe; Álvarez Álvarez, Beatriz; Rodríguez Nieto, María Jesús; Carrillo Acosta, Irene; Fernández Ormaechea, Itziar; Al-Hayani, Aws Waleed Mohammed; Carballosa, Pilar; Calpena Martínez, Silvia; Ezzine, Farah; Castellanos González, Marina; Naya, Alba; López De Las Heras, Marta; Rodríguez Guzmán, Marcel José; Cordero Guijarro, Ana; Broncano Lavado, Antonio; Macías Valcayo, Alicia; Martín García, Marta; Bécares Martínez, Javier; Fernández Roblas, Ricardo; Piris Pinilla, Miguel Ángel; Fortes Alen, José; Sánchez Pernaute, Olga; Romero Bueno, Fredeswinda; Heili-Frades, Sarah; Peces-Barba Romero, Germán",Int J Infect Dis,296,24

The complex molecular cascade of events related to the viral pathogenicity is triggered by the Spike protein upon interacting with the ACE2 receptor on human lung cells through its receptor binding domain (RBDSpike). One potential therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 could thus be limiting the infection by blocking this key interaction. In this current study, we adopt a protein design approach to predict and propose non-virulent structural mimics of the RBDSpike which can potentially serve as its competitive inhibitors in binding to ACE2. The RBDSpike is an independently foldable protein domain, resilient to conformational changes upon mutations and therefore an attractive target for strategic re-design. Interestingly, in spite of displaying an optimal shape fit between their interacting surfaces (attributed to a consequently high mutual affinity), the RBDSpike-ACE2 interaction appears to have a quasi-stable character due to a poor electrostatic match at their interface. Structural analyses of homologous protein complexes reveal that the ACE2 binding site of RBDSpike has an unusually high degree of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, attributed to key evolutionary changes, making it inherently ""reaction-prone."" The designed mimics aimed to block the viral entry by occupying the available binding sites on ACE2, are tested to have signatures of stable high-affinity binding with ACE2 (cross-validated by appropriate free energy estimates), overriding the native quasi-stable feature. The results show the apt of directly adapting natural examples in rational protein design, wherein, homology-based threading coupled with strategic ""hydrophobic â polar"" mutations serve as a potential breakthrough.","Basu, Sankar; Chakravarty, Devlina; Bhattacharyya, Dhananjay; Saha, Pampa; Patra, Hirak K",J Mol Model,296,29

This virus is highly transmissible among individuals through both droplets and aerosol leading to determine severe pneumonia. Among the various factors that can influence both the onset of disease and the severity of its complications, the microbiome composition has also been investigated. Recent evidence showed the possible relationship between gut, lung, nasopharyngeal, or oral microbiome and COVID-19, but very little is known about it. Therefore, we aimed to verify the relationships between nasopharyngeal microbiome and the development of either COVID-19 or the severity of symptoms. To this purpose, we analyzed, by next generation sequencing, the hypervariable V1-V2-V3 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=18) and control (CO) individuals (n=12) using Microbiota solution A (Arrow Diagnostics). We found a significant lower abundance of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria in COVID-19 patients in respect to CO (p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively) from the phylum up to the genus (p<0.001). The Fusobacterium periodonticum (FP) resulted as the most significantly reduced species in COVID-19 patients respect to CO. FP is reported as being able to perform the surface sialylation. Noteworthy, some sialic acids residues on the cell surface could work as additional S protein of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 could use sialic acids as receptors to bind to the epithelium of the respiratory tract, promoting its clustering and the disease development. We can therefore speculate that the significant reduction of FP in COVID-19 patients could be directly or indirectly linked to the modulation of sialic acid metabolism. Finally, viral or environmental factors capable of interfering with sialic metabolism could determine a fall in the individual protection from SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are necessary to clarify the precise role of FP in COVID-19.","Nardelli, Carmela; Gentile, Ivan; Setaro, Mario; Di Domenico, Carmela; Pinchera, Biagio; Buonomo, Antonio Riccardo; Zappulo, Emanuela; Scotto, Riccardo; Scaglione, Giovanni Luca; Castaldo, Giuseppe; Capoluongo, Ettore",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,296,17

METHODS: We evaluated the traffic inflow and newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in eight regions of Korea from January 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The toll collection system (TCS) traffic volume in 2019-2020 and traffic inflow trends were analyzed using independent samples t-test and nonlinear regression, respectively. The association between the TCS traffic volume and confirmed COVID-19 cases by city was analyzed using correlation analysis. RESULTS: The traffic volume in 2020 showed a 3.7% decrease from that in 2019. The TCS traffic trend in the eight provinces decreased during the first COVID-19 wave, gradually increased until the second wave, decreased after the second wave, and showed a sharp decrease in the third wave. There was a positive correlation between the traffic inflow volume and newly confirmed cases in Busan-Gyeongnam and Jeonbuk, but not in Daegu-Gyeongbuk or Gangwon. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the regions was associated with an increase in traffic inflow. Therefore, the Korean government will be able to establish preventive social distancing policies by identifying increases or decreases in traffic volume. Furthermore, it will be necessary to establish social distancing regulations according to the vaccine supplies in each area in relation to the traffic volume.","Lee, Hocheol; Noh, Eunbi; Jeon, Huiwon; Nam, Eun Woo",Int. j. infect. dis,296,33

Our LTx practice during the early pandemic may provide a blueprint for managing LTx in an era of continued community prevalence. Patients who underwent LTx at our institution between March 1 and May 20, 2020 were included. Recipient, operative, and donor characteristics were compared to those from our program in 2019, and COVID-19 testing practices were evaluated for March, April, and May to understand how our practice adapted to the pandemic. Our program performed 36 LTx, 33% more than the same period in 2019. Recipient, operative, and donor characteristics during COVID-19 were similar to those in 2019. By April 1, all donors and recipients underwent pre-transplant COVID-19 testing, all returning negative results. To date, no recipients have developed post-transplant COVID-19. At our institution, pre-transplant COVID-19 testing, use of local donor lungs, and avoidance of donors from areas of increased community penetration supported a safe and effective LTx practice during the early COVID-19 pandemic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between 1 May and 30 June 2020. The study included 359 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and assessed by clinical evaluation, nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction, and lung computed tomography. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven (54.9%) of the patients were male and 162 (45.1%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 58.5 years (20-91). Two hundred ninety-four (81.9%) patients were treated in the inpatient clinic and 65 (18.1%) patients were treated in the intensive care unit. Various ocular diseases were observed in 16 (4.5%) of the patients. Although the rate of ocular disease was 12 out of 294 (4.1%) in patients followed up in the inpatient clinic, this rate was 4 out of 65 (6.2%) in intensive care patients. There was no systemic problem in one patient, in whom conjunctival hyperemia was the first and only reason for admission to the hospital. Four patients followed up in the inpatient clinic had conjunctivitis at the time of admission, and conjunctivitis occurred in three patients during hospitalization. Subconjunctival hemorrhage occurred in five patients and vitreous hemorrhage in one patient.

This scenario is a particularly hot issue nowadays: How could a new disease for which only limited data are available be diagnosed using features of previous diseases? In this problem, so-called few-shot learning, the difficulty of the classification task is to learn the unique feature characteristics associated with the classes. Although there are solutions, but if the images come from different views, they will not handle these views well. We proposed an improved method, so-called Double-View Matching Network (DVMN based on the deep neural network), which solves the few-shot learning problem as well as the different views of the pathological recordings in the images. The main contribution of this is the convolutional neural network for feature extraction and handling the multi-view in image representation. Our method was tested in the classification of images showing unknown COVID-19 symptoms in an environment designed for learning a few samples, with prior meta-learning on images of other diseases only. The results show that DVMN reaches better accuracy on multi-view dataset than simple Matching Network without multi-view handling. © 2021 Scientific Association for Infocommunications.

Dromedary camels are the source of zoonotic infection. Over 70% of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected dromedaries are found in Africa but no zoonotic disease has been reported in Africa. We aimed to understand whether individuals with exposure to dromedaries in Africa had been infected by MERS-CoV. METHODS: Workers slaughtering dromedaries in an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, were compared with abattoir workers without direct dromedary contact, non-abattoir workers from Kano, and controls from Guangzhou, China. Exposure to dromedaries was ascertained using a questionnaire. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were tested for MERS-CoV specific neutralising antibody and T-cell responses. FINDINGS: None of the participants from Nigeria or Guangdong were MERS-CoV seropositive. 18 (30%) of 61 abattoir workers with exposure to dromedaries, but none of 20 abattoir workers without exposure (p=0·0042), ten non-abattoir workers or 24 controls from Guangzhou (p=0·0002) had evidence of MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in PBMC. T-cell responses to other endemic human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, HKU-1, and NL-63) were observed in all groups with no association with dromedary exposure. Drinking both unpasteurised camel milk and camel urine was significantly and negatively associated with T-cell positivity (odds ratio 0·07, 95% CI 0·01-0·54). INTERPRETATION: Zoonotic infection of dromedary-exposed individuals is taking place in Nigeria and suggests that the extent of MERS-CoV infections in Africa is underestimated. MERS-CoV could therefore adapt to human transmission in Africa rather than the Arabian Peninsula, where attention is currently focused.

Objectives: We aimed to assess current global practice and experience in management of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy to identify information to guide prospective and randomized studies. Methods: Physicians were queried about their current approach to prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with COVID-19 using an online survey tool distributed through multiple international organizations between April 10 and 14, 2020. Results: 515 physicians responded from 41 countries. The majority of respondents (78%) recommended prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with most recommending use of low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin. Significant practice variation was found regarding need for dose escalation of anticoagulation outside the setting of confirmed or suspected VTE. Respondents reported the use of bedside testing when unable to perform standard diagnostic imaging for diagnosis of VTE. 291 respondents reported observing thrombotic complications in their patients with 64% noting that the complication was pulmonary embolism (PE). Of the 44% of respondents that estimated incidence of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 in their hospital, estimates ranged widely from 1 to 50%. 174 respondents noted bleeding complications (34% minor bleeding, 14% clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and 12% major bleeding). Conclusion: Well-designed epidemiologic studies are urgently needed to understand the incidence and risk factors of VTE and bleeding complications in COVID-19 patients. Randomized clinical trials addressing use of anticoagulation are also needed.","Rosovsky, Rachel P; Sanfilippo, Kristen M; Wang, Tzu Fei; Rajan, Sandeep K; Shah, Surbhi; Martin, Karlyn A; Ní Áinle, Fionnuala; Huisman, Menno; Hunt, Beverley J; Kahn, Susan R; Kevane, Barry; Lee, Agnes Yy; McLintock, Claire; Baumann Kreuziger, Lisa",,296,30

A set of communities can be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact within each community far exceeds that between them (e.g. the U.S. could be partitioned by state or commuting zone boundaries). COVID-19 can be eliminated if the community-to-community reproductive number---i.e. the expected/average number of other communities to which a single infected community will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. We find that this community-to-community reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between communities and exponential in the length of the time-delay before community-level action is taken. Thus, reductions in travel and the speed at which communities take action can play decisive roles in stopping the outbreak. The analysis suggests that for the coronavirus to be eliminated, it is not necessary to impose aggressive social distancing measures all over the world at once, but rather only in communities in which active spreading is detected. The sooner such measures are imposed, the shorter the duration they must remain in place. If infected communities (including those that become re-infected in the future) are quick enough to act, the number of actively infected communities (and thus the number of communities in which such measures are required) will exponentially decrease over time.","Siegenfeld, Alexander F.; Bar-Yam, Yaneer",,296,33

It is not clear how the N protein mediates such distinct functions. The N protein contains two RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder. Phosphorylation of the central disordered region promotes the protein's transcriptional function, but the underlying mechanism is not known. Here, we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like condensates and discrete 15-nm particles based on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We propose that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing.","Carlson, Christopher R; Asfaha, Jonathan B; Ghent, Chloe M; Howard, Conor J; Hartooni, Nairi; Safari, Maliheh; Frankel, Alan D; Morgan, David O",Mol. cell,296,16

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of lockdown on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic progression in nine different countries (New Zealand, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, the UK, Sweden, and the USA). DESIGN: We conducted a cross-country comparative evaluation using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based model completed with pharmacokinetic approaches. MAIN MEASURES: The rate of new daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in the nine countries was calculated from the World Health Organization's published data. Using a SIR-based model, we determined the infection (ß) and recovery (Î³) rate constants; their corresponding half-lives (t1/2ß and t1/2Î³); the basic reproduction numbers (R0 as ß/Î³); the rates of susceptible S(t), infected I(t), and recovered R(t) compartments; and the effectiveness of lockdown. Since this approach requires the epidemic termination to build the (I) compartment, we determined S(t) at an early epidemic stage using simple linear regressions. KEY RESULTS: In New Zealand, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and the UK, early-onset stay-at-home orders and restrictions followed by gradual deconfinement allowed rapid reduction in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (t1/2ß &#8804; 14 days) with R0 &#8804; 1.5 and rapid recovery (t1/2Î³ &#8804; 18 days). By contrast, in Sweden (no lockdown) and the USA (heterogeneous state-dependent lockdown followed by abrupt deconfinement scenarios), a prolonged plateau of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (terminal t1/2ß of 23 and 40 days, respectively) with elevated R0 (4.9 and 4.4, respectively) and non-ending recovery (terminal t1/2Î³ of 112 and 179 days, respectively) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset lockdown with gradual deconfinement allowed shortening the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and reducing contaminations. Lockdown should be considered as an effective public health intervention to halt epidemic progression.","Mégarbane, Bruno; Bourasset, Fanchon; Scherrmann, Jean-Michel",J Gen Intern Med,296,1

BD-368-2 also displayed strong therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice. Additionally, the 3.8 Å cryo-EM structure of a neutralizing antibody in complex with the spike-ectodomain trimer revealed the antibody's epitope overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Moreover, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies could be directly selected based on similarities of their predicted CDR3H structures to those of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies.

Agranulocytosis, although rare, is a life-threatening condition associated with ATD therapy. For patients who recovered from ATD-induced agranulocytosis, surgery or radioiodine (RAI) therapy are adequate options to restore the patient’s euthyroid state. Here we report a case of ATD-related agranulocytosis where lithium therapy was used before RAI to control thyrotoxicosis and prevent worsening of hyperthyroidism. Case Report: A 74-year-old female with a previous history of hypertension presented with a 2-month history of weight loss (12 lbs), palpitations and shortness of breath. She was afebrile with a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 149/80, a fine tremor and a moderate diffuse goiter. She had a normal eye exam. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated TSH &amp;lt;0.01 uIU/mL (0.35-5.5), FT4 3.11 ng/dL (0.51-1.65) and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) 40 (&amp;lt;1,0 U/L), consistent with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves’ disease. She was started on methimazole (MMI) 15mg and metoprolol. After four weeks, symptoms resolved and thyroid function tests (TFT) improved. However, after two months of treatment, she was hospitalized for fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain. White blood cell count (WBC) was 650/μL, and neutrophil count was 90/μL. A diagnosis of gastroenteritis and agranulocytosis was made and MMI was stopped. After seven days, symptoms resolved, the neutrophil count was 2200/ul and TFT were acceptable (FT4 1.25, ng/dL TT3 1.67 ng/ml, TSH &amp;lt;0.02 uIU/mL). She was discharged without ATDs and a RAI dose of 20 mCi was scheduled. However, RAI therapy had to be postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. After 3 weeks, TFT worsened and therapy with lithium carbonate 300 mg TID was started as the patient refused thyroidectomy. Lithium was initiated 12 days before RAI therapy and was maintained 7 days after the procedure. No side effects associated with lithium treatment were reported. TFT 7 days after RAI were FT4 1.43, ng/dL TT3 2.05 ng/ml and TSH &amp;lt;0.02 uIU/mL. One month later, the patient was euthyroid without need for thyroid medication and remains on follow up. Discussion: Serum thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations usually increase after RAI therapy for Graves’ disease, a worrisome fact in patients with increased risk for cardiovascular complications. Previous studies report that pre-RAI treatment with lithium prevents changes in serum TH concentrations and enhances RAI therapy’s effectiveness. Here, treatment with lithium was used to control thyrotoxicosis and prevent further increase in TH levels associated with RAI therapy. Lithium is particularly suitable for patients with ATD-related side effects before definitive therapy (radioiodine or thyroidectomy). The antithyroid effect of lithium in this setting should be further studied.","Fantin, Esther H.; Goemann, Iuri Martin",Journal of the Endocrine Society,296,20

With the number of cases increasing rapidly, the epidemiological data on the nutritional practice is scarce. In this study, we aim to describe the clinical characteristics and nutritional practice in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This is a multicenter, ambidirectional cohort study conducted at 11 hospitals in Hubei Province, China. All eligible critical COVID-19 patients in the study hospital intensive care units at 00:00, March 6th, 2020, were included. Data collection was performed via written case report forms. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were identified and enrolled, of whom eight died during the 28-day outcome follow- up period. The median interval between hospital admission and the study day was 24 (interquartile range, 13- 26) days and 52.2% (23 of 44) of patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation. The median nutrition risk in critically ill (mNUTRIC) score was 3 (interquartile range, 2-5) on the study day. During the enrolment day, 68.2% (30 of 44) of patients received enteral nutrition (EN), while 6.8% (3 of 44) received parenteral nutrition (PN) alone. Nausea and aspiration were uncommon, with a prevalence of 11.4% (5 of 44) and 6.8% (3 of 44), respectively. As for energy delivery, 69.7% (23 of 33) of patients receiving EN and/or PN were achieving their prescribed targets.

COVID-19 is a novel emerging infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 characterized as atypical pneumonia. As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, sore throat, fatigue, cough, and dyspnoea combined with recent exposure. Most of the patients with COVID-19 have mild or moderate disease, however up to 5-10% present with severe and even life-threatening disease course. The mortality rates are approximately 2%. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective and specific antiviral treatment. Currently, supportive care measures such as ventilation oxygenation and fluid management remain the standard of care. Several clinical trials are currently trying to identify the most potent drug or combination against the disease, and it is strongly recommended to enroll patients into ongoing trials. Antivirals can be proven as safe and effective only in the context of randomized clinical trials. Currently several agents such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, monoclonal antibodies, antisense RNA, corticosteroids, convalescent plasma and vaccines are being evaluated.

We sought to review the guidance on conducting remote consultations and found that while there is a large amount of information about the implementation of remote consultations at an organisation level, there is a paucity of high-quality papers considering the guidelines for online consultations alongside practical advice for their implementation at the individual level. We reviewed guidelines from reputable medical sources and generated practical advice to assist practitioners to perform safe and effective video consultation. Additionally, we noted reports in the literature of a lack of transparency and resulting confusion regarding the choice of telemedicine platforms. We, therefore, sought to summarise key characteristics of a number of major telemedicine platforms. We recognised a lack of clarity regarding the legal status of performing remote consultations, and reviewed advice from medico-legal sources. Finally, we address the sources of these individual uncertainties, and give recommendations on how these might be addressed systematically, so the practitioners are well trained and competent in the use of online consultations, which will inevitably play an increasingly large role in both primary and secondary care settings in the future.","Howgego, Gregory; Sharma, Ishta; Kalu, Peter",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,296,20

This study assessed the effects of and proper preparation for this educational approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS The homeschooling behaviors and feelings of school-age children were assessed with 2010 online surveys obtained separately from students, parents, and teachers of grades 1-9 in 15 Chinese provinces. Answers were compared among low- (grades 1-3), middle- (grades 4-6), and high- (grades 7-9) grade groups. The chi-square test was used to identify significant differences between groups. RESULTS We found that 76% of the respondents thought the homeschooling style was acceptable. However, teachers were concerned that students' interest, focus, and academic performance would decline. Sixty-nine percent of the parents reported their children had more than 3 hours of daily screen time, and 82% of students had less than 2 hours of daily outdoor activity. Ninety-five percent of the parents were concerned about their children's eyesight. Additionally, 17.6% of the students were suspected to have emotional or behavioral problems according to the parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) results. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) results of parents and teachers showed higher levels of anxiety than usual. CONCLUSIONS Students should continue the going-to-school rhythm at home to cope with changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrated grade-specific approaches are needed. Because long screen time and insufficient outdoor activities can severely affect children's eyesight, appropriate eye-protection measures should be implemented.","Zhao, Ying; Guo, Yong; Xiao, Yu; Zhu, Ranke; Sun, Wei; Huang, Weiyong; Liang, Deyi; Tang, Liuying; Zhang, Fan; Zhu, Dongsheng; Wu, Jie-Ling",Med Sci Monit,296,19

To protect their health, effective occupational health and safety measures (OHSM) are necessary. Outpatient caregivers (n = 15) participated in semi-structured telephone interviews in May/June 2020 (1) to examine the pandemic-related OHSM that have been implemented in their outpatient care services, as well as (2) to identify their corresponding unmet needs. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed by using qualitative content analysis in accordance with Mayring. Available OHSM in outpatient care services described by outpatient caregivers mainly included personal protective equipment (PPE) and surface disinfection means after an initial shortage in the first peak of the pandemic. Further OHSM implied social distancing, increased hygiene regulations and the provision of pandemic-related information by the employer, as well as the possibility to consult a company doctor. Our study revealed that OHSM were largely adapted to the health threats posed by COVID-19, however an optimum has not yet been achieved. There is still a need for improvement in the qualitative and quantitative supply of PPE, as well as on the organisational level, e.g., with regard to the development of pandemic plans or in work organisation.","Hetzmann, Mara Shirin; Mojtahedzadeh, Natascha; Nienhaus, Albert; Harth, Volker; Mache, Stefanie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),296,21

A descriptive analysis of participants was performed using relative frequencies. Chi-squared tests were performed to compare the responses of selected variables. Multinomial logistic regressions were performed to compare the variations of PA with all the variables identified. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 88. Among people who practiced PAs before the first lockdown, the probability to keep practicing PAs is higher among those with a lower level of education, among housewives and retirees and among those who lived in cities of 10,000-19,999 inhabitants. For those who did not practice PAs before the social distancing, the probability of starting to practice is greater in those with a lower level of education and for those who suffered from a chronic disease. Our results place the emphasis on the complexity and multifactoriality of the changes that emerged during the first lockdown. The ""education"" factor emerges, as a significant determinant of PA that should certainly be explored further.","Porrovecchio, Alessandro; Olivares, Pedro R; Masson, Philippe; Pezé, Thierry; Lombi, Linda",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),296,1

Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to analyze the adverse factors of virus clearance. Of the 309 COVID-19 patients, eighty-nine (28.8%) patients received corticosteroid treatment during hospitalization. Corticosteroid group showed higher C-reactive protein (median 11.1 vs. 7.0 mg/l, P = 0.018) and lower lymphocytes (median 0.9 vs. 1.4 × 109/l, P < 0.001) on admission. Fever (93.3% vs. 65.0%, P < 0.001) and cough (69.7% vs. 57.3%, P = 0.043) were more common in corticosteroid group.

Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are predicted to reduce viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and prevent hospitalization. METHODS: In this ongoing phase 2 trial involving outpatients with recently diagnosed mild or moderate Covid-19, we randomly assigned 452 patients to receive a single intravenous infusion of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 in one of three doses (700 mg, 2800 mg, or 7000 mg) or placebo and evaluated the quantitative virologic end points and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the viral load at day 11. The results of a preplanned interim analysis as of September 5, 2020, are reported here. RESULTS: At the time of the interim analysis, the observed mean decrease from baseline in the log viral load for the entire population was -3.81, for an elimination of more than 99.97% of viral RNA. For patients who received the 2800-mg dose of LY-CoV555, the difference from placebo in the decrease from baseline was -0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.98 to -0.08; P = 0.02), for a viral load that was lower by a factor of 3.4. Smaller differences from placebo in the change from baseline were observed among the patients who received the 700-mg dose (-0.20; 95% CI, -0.66 to 0.25; P = 0.38) or the 7000-mg dose (0.09; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.55; P = 0.70). On days 2 to 6, the patients who received LY-CoV555 had a slightly lower severity of symptoms than those who received placebo. The percentage of patients who had a Covid-19-related hospitalization or visit to an emergency department was 1.6% in the LY-CoV555 group and 6.3% in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis of a phase 2 trial, one of three doses of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 appeared to accelerate the natural decline in viral load over time, whereas the other doses had not by day 11.

EBV replicates in the stratified epithelium but the nasopharynx is also composed of pseudostratified epithelium with distinct cell types. Latent infection is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we show with nasopharyngeal conditionally reprogrammed cells cultured at the air-liquid interface that pseudostratified epithelial cells are susceptible to EBV infection. Donors varied in susceptibility to de novo EBV infection, but susceptible cultures also displayed differences with respect to pathogenesis. The cultures from one donor yielded lytic infection but cells from two other donors were positive for EBV-encoded EBERs and negative for other lytic infection markers. All cultures stained positive for the pseudostratified markers CK7, MUC5AC, &#945;-tubulin in cilia, and the EBV epithelial cell receptor Ephrin receptor A2. To define EBV transcriptional programs by cell type and to elucidate latent/lytic infection-differential changes, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on one EBV-infected culture that resulted in alignment with many EBV transcripts. EBV transcripts represented a small portion of the total transcriptome (~0.17%). All cell types in the pseudostratified epithelium had detectable EBV transcripts with suprabasal cells showing the highest number of reads aligning to many EBV genes. Several restriction factors (IRF1, MX1, STAT1, C18orf25) known to limit lytic infection were expressed at lower levels in the lytic subcluster. A third of the differentially-expressed genes in NPC tumors compared to an uninfected pseudostratified ALI culture overlapped with the differentially-expressed genes in the latent subcluster. A third of these commonly perturbed genes were specific to EBV infection and changed in the same direction. Collectively, these findings suggest that the pseudostratified epithelium could harbor EBV infection and that the pseudostratified infection model mirrors many of the transcriptional changes imposed by EBV infection in NPC.","Ziegler, Phillip; Tian, Yarong; Bai, Yulong; Abrahamsson, Sanna; Bäckerholm, Alan; Reznik, Alex S; Green, Anthony; Moore, John A; Lee, Stella E; Myerburg, Michael M; Park, Hyun Jung; Tang, Ka-Wei; Shair, Kathy Ho Yen",PLoS Pathog,296,1

We examined whether time spent grooming with others in a highly social mammal species was associated with infection status for gastrointestinal parasites. Of six parasites detected, one (Trichuris sp.) was associated with social grooming behaviors, but more specifically with direct physical contact with others. Individuals infected with Trichuris sp. spent significantly less time grooming conspecifics than those not infected, and time in direct contact with others was the major predictor of infection status. One model correctly predicted infection status for Trichuris sp. with a reliability of 95.17% overall when the variables used were time spent in direct contact and time spent grooming others. This decrease in time spent grooming and interacting with others is likely a sickness behavior displayed by individuals with less energy or motivation for non-essential behaviors.

Data on the SARS-CoV-2-exposure/infection rate of gastrointestinal endoscopy staff is scarce. This study aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2-exposure/infection rate among gastrointestinal endoscopists/nurses performing gastrointestinal endoscopies before and after the adoption of specific prevention measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a teaching hospital (Rome, Central Italy) on retrospective data (9 March-15 April 2020) of consecutive gastrointestinal endoscopies, characteristics of procedures, patients and endoscopy staff, SARS-CoV-2-exposure/positivity of patients and staff before and after adoption of prevention measures. Exposed staff tested for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs(RNA-PCR) and serology. RESULTS: A total of 130 gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed in 130 patients (age 66 ± 14 years, 51% women, 51% inpatients, 56.9% lower). A total of 12 (9.2%) patients were SARS-CoV-2-positive and 14(10.8%) had a high risk of potential infection. Of the endoscopy staff (n = 16, 5 endoscopists, 8 nurses and 3 residents), 14 (87.5%) were exposed to SARS-CoV-2-infected and 16 (100%) to potentially infected patients. 3/5 and 5/5 endoscopists were exposed to actual and potential, 1/3 and 3/3 residents to actual and potential and 8/8 nurses to actual and potential infection, respectively. None of the staff was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. None experienced fever or any other suspicious symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. Before the adoption of prevention measures, more endoscopists/nurses were in the endoscopy room than after (3.5 ± 0.6 vs. 2.1 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001).

A small percentage of affected patients (20%) progress into the second stage of the disease clinically presenting with severe or fatal involvement of lung, heart, and vascular system, all contributing to multiple-organ failure. The so-called ?cytokines storm' is considered the pathogenic basis of severe disease and it is a target for treatment with corticosteroids, immunotherapies, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). We provide an overview of the role of IVIg in the therapy of adult patients with COVID-19 disease. After discussing the possible underlying mechanisms of IVIg immunomodulation in COVID-19 disease, we review the studies in which IVIg was employed. Considering the latest evidence that show a link between new coronavirus and autoimmunity, we also discuss the use of IVIg in COVID-19 and anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination related autoimmune diseases and the post-COVID-19 syndrome. The benefit of high-dose IVIg is evident in almost all studies with a rapid response, a reduction in mortality and improved pulmonary function in critically ill COVID-19 patients. It seems that an early administration of IVIg is crucial for a successful outcome.

We aimed to determine the completeness of reporting (COR) for case reports published on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed database for all single-patient case reports of confirmed COVID-19 published from Jan. 1 to Apr. 24, 2020. All included case reports were assessed for adherence to the CARE (Case Report) 31-item checklist, which was used to create a composite COR score. The primary outcome was the mean COR score assessed by 2 independent raters. Secondary outcomes included whether there was a change in overall COR score with certain publication factors (e.g., publication date) and whether there was a linear relation between COR and citation count and between COR scores and social media attention. RESULTS: Our search identified 196 studies that were published in 114 unique journals. We found that the overall mean COR score was 54.4%. No one case report included all of the 31 CARE checklist items. There was no significant correlation between COR with either citation count or social media attention. INTERPRETATION: We found that the overall COR for case reports on COVID-19 was poor. We suggest that journals adopt common case-reporting standards to improve reporting quality.","Scaffidi, Michael A; Gimpaya, Nikko; Li, Juana; Bansal, Rishi; Verma, Yash; Elsolh, Karam; Donn, Gemma M; Panjwani, Abhishek; Khan, Rishad; Grover, Samir C",CMAJ Open,296,1

It is frequently complicated by both thrombosis and hemorrhage. A markedly prothrombotic state associated with high rates of venous thromboembolism has been described in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019) infection. These rates have currently not been described during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in comparison to other viral pneumonias. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Single high-volume tertiary critical care department at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Patients 16 years old or greater receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, with coronavirus disease 2019 were compared with a cohort of patients with influenza pneumonia between June 1, 2012, and May 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rates of venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage were compared in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 against a historic population of patients with influenza pneumonia who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There were 51 patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to coronavirus disease 2019 and 80 patients with influenza. At cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 37% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with 8% of patients with influenza had filling defects on CT pulmonary angiography (p = 0.0001). Catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis shown on ultrasound Doppler after decannulation was present in 53% with coronavirus disease 2019 versus 25% with influenza (p = 0.01). The rates of intracranial hemorrhage at the time of cannulation were 16% with coronavirus disease 2019 and 14% with influenza (p = 0.8). Elevated d-dimer levels were seen in both conditions and were significantly higher in those with pulmonary thromboembolism than those without in coronavirus disease 2019 (p = 0.02). Fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in those with coronavirus disease 2019 than influenza (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Significant rates of pulmonary thromboembolism and of catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis were seen in both viral infections but were greater in those requiring the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in coronavirus disease 2019 than for influenza.","Doyle, Andrew J; Hunt, Beverley J; Sanderson, Barnaby; Zhang, Joseph; Mak, Sze M; Benedetti, Guilia; Breen, Karen A; Camporota, Luigi; Barrett, Nicholas A; Retter, Andrew",Crit Care Med,296,16

The objective of this study was to perform a linguistic validation and cross-cultural adaptation of the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status scale for people infected with COVID-19 for the Chilean population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of scale validation was carried out. The study was performed in two phases: (1) forward-translation, reverse-translation and (2) apparent cross-validity adaptation. For the apparent validity analysis, 29 individuals who had been hospitalized in Hospital del Salvador with a COVID-19 infection diagnosis and at the time of the interview were in their homes participated. RESULTS: In phase 1 forward-translation, an item required semantical changes. The reverse-translation versions were similar, and the most relevant doubts were resolved in a consensus meeting. In phase 2, the pilot study confirmed adequate understanding and scale applicability. CONCLUSIONS: Using a systematic and rigorous methodology allowed obtaining a Spanish version of the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status scale for Chile, which is conceptually and linguistically equivalent to the original instrument and adequate to assess the functional status of people infected with COVID-19.","Lorca, Luz Alejandra; Torres-Castro, Rodrigo; Ribeiro, Ivana Leao; Benavente, Paulina; Pizarro, Marta; San Cristobal, Belgica; Ugarte, Javiera; Laura, Cristobal; Huanchicay, Camila; Mamani, Alexandra",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,296,20

More importantly, we find an increase in positive assessments of their country in domains directly related to the COVID-19 response (civic awareness and international leadership) but not in domains less directly related to the pandemic. We also find that while Koreans take pride in their collective response to the crisis, their disenchantment with the political class has grown.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown of the Danish society, pregnant women were considered to be at increased risk, and access to antenatal care changed. METHODS: On 8 April 2020A, a questionnaire was sent to 332 pregnant women previously sampled by general practitioners in two Danish regions. The women were contacted via secured e-mail (e-Boks), and questionnaires were returned until 6 May. RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 257 women (77%). More than half believed that they were at a high risk of infection with COVID-19, and a third of the women were concerned about the risk of serious disease - especially for their unborn child. Almost 90% isolated at home most of the time. The majority were worried about possible consequences of the pandemic for antenatal care, but very few had actually missed a scheduled preventive consultation with their general practitioner, and only 15% had missed an appointment with their midwife. The majority of the women preferred normal consultations and found no added safety in shifting the consultation from the normal clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown have had a major impact on Danish pregnant women. Even so, concerns were more focused on access to care than on the risk of COVID-19 infection.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 are mediated by the spike glycoprotein of virus, and the host specific receptors and proteases. Recently, besides pulmonary complications as the chief symptom, investigations have also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can trigger neurological manifestations. Herein, to investigate the expression level of receptors and related proteases is important for understanding the neuropathy in COVID-19. We determined the expression levels of receptor ACE2 and CD147, and serine protease TMPRSS2 in human and mouse brain cell lines and mouse different region of brain tissues with qRT-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that the expression pattern of all them was very different to that of lung. ACE2 is lower but CD147 is higher expressed in mostly brain cell lines and mouse brain tissues comparing with lung cell line and tissue, and TMPRSS2 has consistent expression in brain cell lines and mouse lung tissues. It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have a different way of infection to cerebral nervous system.

This informational asset should be thoroughly and wisely used in the coming year colliding in a global task force to control this infection. Epidemiology of this infection shows that the available estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence largely depended on the availability of molecular testing and the extent of tested population. Within molecular diagnosis, the viability and infectiousness of the virus in the tested samples should be further investigated. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has a genetic normal evolution that is a dynamic process. The immune system participates to the counterattack of the viral infection by pathogen elimination, cellular homoeostasis, tissue repair and generation of memory cells that would be reactivated upon a second encounter with the same virus. In all these stages, we still have knowledge to be gathered regarding antibody persistence, protective effects and immunological memory. Moreover, information regarding the intense pro-inflammatory action in severe cases still lacks and this is important in stratifying patients for difficult to treat cases. Without being exhaustive, the review will cover these important issues to be acknowledged to further advance in the battle against the current pandemia.","Neagu, Monica; Calina, Daniela; Docea, Anca Oana; Constantin, Carolina; Filippini, Tommaso; Vinceti, Marco; Drakoulis, Nikolaos; Poulas, Konstantinos; Nikolouzakis, Taxiarchis Konstantinos; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Tsatsakis, Aristidis",J Cell Mol Med,296,16

Cancer incidence and/or death depends on several intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., dietary habits, socio-behavioral activities, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, gender, races/ethnicities and age). Various studies have found that an inverse relationship subsists between environmental temperature and cancer risk. Furthermore, this negative relationship was found to be more consistent in the USA female population. This research mainly focuses on influence of aging on cold environment mediated cancer risk for overall and various anatomical site-specific cancers. Age-specific county-wise data of cancer incidence rate (CIR) in the USA female population was selected in this study. Statistical analysis found a negative correlation between the average annual temperature (AAT) and CIR in all anatomical sites (AAS; overall) as well as different anatomical site-specific cancers (e.g., breast, melanoma, leukaemia, pancreas, bladder, uterus, thyroid and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), except for cervical cancer) in different age groups (e.g., less than 50 years, 50 plus years, less than 65 years and 65 plus years). In addition, an inverse relationship between the AAT and CIR was found in case of paediatric cancer. However, all the results obtained from the linear model based statistical analysis proposed that the older age-group of females particularly above 65 years seems to be more prone to cold temperature linked cancer risk. For example, age-specific cold linked cancer incidence appears to be more inclined in case of breast cancer in the age-group of 65 plus years. This study, for first time, proposes that aging may have a positive influence on the relationship between cancer incidence and environment temperature.","Bandyopadhayaya, Shreetama; Bundel, Rashmi; Tyagi, Shikhar; Pandey, Arvind; Mandal, Chandi C",J Therm Biol,296,20

We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. The median (IQR) incubation period was 5.5 (3.0-8.0) days. More than half (56%) of the patients were mild disease severity, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and 3% were critical. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The final clinical outcomes in 189 (97.9%) were recovered and 4 (2.1%) were deceased. The incidence of pneumonia was 39%.

We compared the capacity to change the postural responses after unexpected external perturbation and investigated the habituation plateaus of postural responses to non-sequential perturbation trials in people with Parkinson's disease and healthy older adults. METHODS: In people with Parkinson's disease (n = 37) and older adults (n = 20), sudden posterior support-surface translational were applied in 7 out of 17 randomized trials to ensure perturbation unpredictability. Electromyography and center of pressure parameters of postural response were analyzed by ANOVAs (Group vs. Trials). Two simple planned contrasts were performed to determine at which trial the responses first significantly habituate, and by which trials the habituation plateaus. FINDINGS: Older adults demonstrated a first response change in trial 5 and habituation plateaus after trial 4, while for people with Parkinson's disease, the first change occurred in trial 2 and habituation plateau after trial 5 observed by center of pressure range. People with Parkinson's disease demonstrated a greater center of pressure range in trial 1 compared to older adults. Independent of trial, people with Parkinson's disease vs. older adults demonstrated a greater ankle muscle co-activation and recovery time. INTERPRETATION: Despite the greater center of pressure range in the first trial, people with Parkinson's disease can habituate to unpredictable perturbations. This is reflected by little, to no difference in the time-course of adaptation for all but 2 parameters that showed only marginal differences between people with Parkinson's disease and older adults.","Beretta, Victor Spiandor; Carpenter, Mark Gregory; Barbieri, Fabio Augusto; Santos, Paulo Cezar Rocha; Orcioli-Silva, Diego; Pereira, Marcelo Pinto; Gobbi, Lilian Teresa Bucken","Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)",296,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 103 (41 women and 62 men; 68.8 years of mean age-range, 29-93 years) with suspicious COVID-19 viral infection evaluated by reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All patients underwent CT examinations at the time of admission in addition to clinical and laboratory findings recording. All chest CT examinations were reviewed using a structured report. Moreover, using an artificial intelligence tool we performed an automatic segmentation on CT images based on Hounsfield unit to calculate residual healthy lung parenchyma, ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations and emphysema volumes for both right and left lungs. Two expert radiologists, in consensus, attributed at the CT pulmonary disease involvement a severity score using a scale of 5 levels; the score was attributed for GGO and consolidation for each lung, and then, an overall radiological severity visual score was obtained summing the single score. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Symptoms and comorbidities did not show differences statistically significant in terms of patient outcome. Instead, SpO2 was significantly lower in patients hospitalized in critical conditions or died while age, HS CRP, leukocyte count, neutrophils, LDH, d-dimer, troponin, creatinine and azotemia, ALT, AST and bilirubin values were significantly higher. GGO and consolidations were the main CT patterns (a variable combination of GGO and consolidations was found in 87.8% of patients). CT COVID-19 disease was prevalently bilateral (77.6%) with peripheral distribution (74.5%) and multiple lobes localizations (52.0%). Consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma volumes showed statistically significant differences in the three groups of patients based on outcome (patients discharged at home, patients hospitalized in stable conditions and patient hospitalized in critical conditions or died) while GGO volume did not affect the patient's outcome. Moreover, the overall radiological severity visual score (cutoff &#8805; 8) was a predictor of patient outcome. The highest value of R-squared (R2 = 0.93) was obtained by the model that combines clinical/laboratory findings at CT volumes. The highest accuracy was obtained by clinical/laboratory and CT findings model with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively, of 88%, 78% and 81% to predict discharged/stable patients versus critical/died patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, both CT visual score and computerized software-based quantification of the consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma on chest CT images were independent predictors of outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Salvatore, Cappabianca; Roberta, Fusco; Angela, de Lisio; Cesare, Paura; Alfredo, Clemente; Giuliano, Gagliardi; Giulio, Lombardi; Giuliana, Giacobbe; Maria, Russo Gaetano; Paola, Belfiore Maria; Fabrizio, Urraro; Roberta, Grassi; Beatrice, Feragalli; Vittorio, Miele",,296,16

AIM OF THE STUDY: To describe changes in the differential leukocyte counts including eosinophils, in a cohort of symptomatic patients with confirmed COVID-19 and to correlate these changes, if any, with the severity of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recorded the clinical data, lab findings, including inflammatory markers and leukocyte and differential count, course of the disease and severity score in 314 confirmed symptomatic cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: Laboratory tests revealed that 28.7 % (n =86) had mild eosinophilia (eosinophil count > 500 <1,500/µL). Thirty-four patients (11.3%) had elevated absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (>8,000/µL), and 7 (2.3%) had decreased ANC (< 1,500/µl). Seven patients (2.3%) had lymphopenia (<1,000/µL) and 4 (4.67%) had lymphocytosis (> 4,000/µL). C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 83 patients (27.6%). Chest X-Ray changes included: increased broncho vascular markings (38%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) pneumonitis (19.3%), lobar consolidation (5%), bronchopneumonia (8.3%), nodular opacity (1%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (2.3%), pleural effusion (1.0%) and other atypical findings (6.6%). Patients with eosinophilia had significantly lower CRP, and lower % of GGO, lobar and bronchopneumonia and ARDS in their chest images compared to patients without eosinophilia (p: <0.05). They also had a lower requirement for a hospital stay, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen supplementation versus patients without eosinophilia (p: <0.05). The eosinophils count was correlated negatively with the duration of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen supplementation and with CRP level (r: - 0.34, -0.32, -0.61 and - 0.39, respectively) (p: < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a relatively high prevalence of eosinophilia in symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients. Patients with eosinophilia had a lower level of CRP, milder clinical course and better disease outcomes compared to those without eosinophilia. Our findings indicated a protective role of eosinophils in mitigating the severity of inflammatory diseases through an inhibitory mechanism, as evidenced by lower CRP. This protective role of eosinophils needs to be validated by further prospective studies.","Nair, Arun Prabhakaran; Soliman, Ashraf; Al Masalamani, Muna A; De Sanctis, Vincenzo; Nashwan, Abdulqadir J; Sasi, Sreethish; Ali, Elrazi A; Hassan, Ola A; Iqbal, Fatima M; Yassin, Mohamed A",Acta Biomed,296,1

Ivermectin is among the drugs whose effectiveness in treatment has been investigated. In this study; it was aimed to investigate the presence of gene mutations that alter ivermectin metabolism and cause toxic effects in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ivermectin use in the treatment of patients without mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe COVID19 pneumonia were included in the study, which was planned as a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind phase 3 study. Two groups, the study group and the control group, took part in the study. Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for 5 days in the form of a solution prepared for enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine + favipiravir + azithromycin- of patients included in the study group. Patients in the control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin. The presence of mutations was investigated by performing sequence analysis in the mdr1/abcab1 gene with the Sanger method in patients included in the study group according to randomization. Patients with mutations were excluded from the study and ivermectin treatment was not continued. Patients were followed for 5 days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and follow-up period, clinical response and changes in laboratory parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients, 36 in the study group and 30 in the control group were included in the study. Mutations affecting ivermectin metabolism was detected in genetic tests of six (16.7%) patients in the study group and they were excluded from the study. At the end of the 5-day follow-up period, the rate of clinical improvement was 73.3% (22/30) in the study group and was 53.3% (16/30) in the control group (p = 0.10). At the end of the study, mortality developed in 6 patients (20%) in the study group and in 9 (30%) patients in the control group (p = 0.37). At the end of the follow-up period, the average peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) values of the study and control groups were found to be 93.5 and 93.0%, respectively. Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/FiO2 ratios were determined as 236.3 ± 85.7 and 220.8 ± 127.3 in the study and control groups, respectively. While the blood lymphocyte count was higher in the study group compared to the control group (1698 ± 1438 and 1256 ± 710, respectively) at the end of the follow-up period (p = 0.24); reduction in serum C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer levels was more pronounced in the study group (p = 0.02, p = 0.005 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings obtained, ivermectin can provide an increase in clinical recovery, improvement in prognostic laboratory parameters and a decrease in mortality rates even when used in patients with severe COVID-19. Consequently, ivermectin should be considered as an alternative drug that can be used in the treatment of COVID-19 disease or as an additional option to existing protocols.","Okumus, Nurullah; Demirtürk, Nese; Çetinkaya, Riza Aytaç; Güner, Rahmet; Avci, Ismail Yasar; Orhan, Semiha; Konya, Petek; Saylan, Bengü; Karalezli, Aysegül; Yamanel, Levent; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Yilmaz, Gülden; Savasçi, Ümit; Eser, Fatma; Taskin, Gürhan",BMC Infect Dis,296,1

In this issue of the JCI, Qin, Wu, and Chen et al. focused specifically on people whose acute infection lacked obvious neurological involvement. Severely infected patients showed abnormal gray matter volumes, white matter diffusion, and cerebral blood flow compared with healthy controls and those with mild infection. The data remain associative rather than mechanistic, but correlations with systemic immune markers suggest effects of inflammation, hypercoagulation, or other aspects of disease severity. Mechanistic research is warranted. Given the lack of obvious neurological symptoms, neurocognitive assessments were not performed, but the findings suggest that such assessments may be warranted in severely affected patients, even without obvious symptoms. Further, studying CNS involvement of other disorders with overlapping pathophysiologies such as inflammation, coagulation, hypoxia, or direct viral infection may reveal the causes for COVID-19-related neuropathology.","Mahajan, Amit; Mason, Graeme F",J. clin. invest,296,1

Fever, cough, sore throat, headache, exhaustion, muscular aches, and difficulty breathing are all typical symptoms of COVID-19. A reliable detection technique is needed to identify affected individuals and care for them in the early stages of COVID-19 and reduce the virus's transmission. The most accessible method for COVID-19 identification is RT-PCR; however, due to its time commitment and false-negative results, alternative options must be sought. Indeed, compared to RT-PCR, chest CT scans and chest X-ray images provide superior results. Because of the scarcity and high cost of CT scan equipment, X-ray images are preferable for screening. In this paper, a pre-trained network, DenseNet169, was employed to extract features from X-ray images. Features were chosen by a feature selection method (ANOVA) to reduce computations and time complexity while overcoming the curse of dimensionality to improve predictive accuracy. Finally, selected features were classified by XGBoost. The ChestX-ray8 dataset, which was employed to train and evaluate the proposed method.

Consumption of famotidine, a histamine H2 receptor antagonist widely used to treat acid reflux and gastritis, is associated with improved survival and attenuated COVID-19 disease severity (Mather JF et al. Am J Gastroenterol. 115:1617,2020;Freedberg DE, et al. Gastroenterology 159: 1129, 2020;Janowitz T et al. Gut, 69:1592, 2020). However, the mode of action for these beneficial effects is unknown. Here we studied famotidine in mice exposed to bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). LPS (6 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally in male C57BL/6 mice followed by intraperitoneal injection of famotidine (100 µg/mouse) or vehicle (PBS) twice daily for 3 days. Two-week survival was 100% in the famotidine-treated group vs. 70% in the PBS-control group (n=30/group, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, famotidine administration significantly reduced serum and splenic TNF levels and serum IL-6 levels in the endotoxemic mice (p&lt;0.05, famotidine vs. PBS). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells co-cultured with famotidine and LPS also express significantly reduced amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, HMGB1, IP-10, GM-CSF). Together these results indicate famotidine inhibits endotoxin induced cytokine storm and attenuates lethality in mice exposed to lethal endotoxemia.","George, Sam Thompson Dane Tynan Aisling Silverman Harold Li Jian Hua Chang Eric Andersson Ulf Chavan Sangeeta Tracey Kevin Yang Huan",The FASEB Journal,296,1

Little is known about patient satisfaction with telemedicine in orthopedics or the factors associated with selection of telemedicine versus face-to-face care. Thus, we examined (1) the association between patient satisfaction and mode of visit (telemedicine versus in-person) and (2) predictors of patient satisfaction in a large orthopedic practice during the onset of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of in-person and telemedicine visits within a large, university-affiliated orthopaedic practice between March 2020 and April 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients who completed a patient satisfaction survey were included. Demographic and other office visit (eg, type of provider and type of visit) data were collected. A Patient Satisfaction Aggregate (PSA, range 0 to 1) score was calculated by taking the average of five patient satisfaction questions. Linear regression was used to examine (1) the association between PSA score and mode of visit and (2) predictors of PSA score. RESULTS: A total of 2,049 of 6,515 patient satisfaction surveys were completed and included for analysis, of which 748 had telemedicine visits and 1,301 had in-person visits. No association was found between PSA score and mode of visit with and without adjustment for duration of patient-physician relationship, appointment type (new versus follow-up), provider type (physician versus nonphysician), and provider subspecialty (βunadjusted = 0.004 [SE = 0.01], P = 0.44;βadjusted = 0.001 [SE = 0.01], P = 0.92).

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with crucial mutations pose a global challenge in context of therapeutic drugs and vaccines being developed globally. There are currently no specific therapeutics or vaccines available to combat SARS-CoV-2 devastation. In view of this, the current study aimed to identify and characterize the mutations found in the Nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian isolates. Non-structural protein, Nsp13 protein sequences from Indian isolates were analyzed by comparing with the first reported Severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequence from Wuhan, China. Out of 825 Nsp13 protein sequences, a total of 38 mutations were observed among Indian isolates. Our data show that mutations in Nsp13 at various positions (H164Y, A237T, T214I, C309Y, S236I, P419S, V305E, G54S, H290Y, P53S, A308Y, and A308Y) have a significant impact on the proteins stability and flexibility. Also, the impact of Nsp13 mutations on the protein function were predicted based on PROVEAN score that includes 15 mutants as neutral and 23 mutants as deleterious effect. Furthermore, B-cell epitopes contributed by Nsp13 were identified using various predictive immunoinformatic tools. Immunological Parameters of Nsp13 such as antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity were evaluated to predict the potential B-cell epitopes. The predicted peptide sequences were correlated with the observed mutants. Our predicted data showed that there are seven high rank linear epitopes as well as 18 discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on immunoinformatic tools. Moreover, it was observed that out of total 38 identified mutations among Indian SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 protein, four mutant residues at position 142 (E142), 245 (H245), 247 (V247) and 419 (P419) are localised in the predicted B cell epitopic region. Altogether, the results of the present in-silico study might help to understand the impact of the identified mutations in Nsp13 protein on its stability, flexibility and function.","Kumari, Deepa; Kumari, Namrata; Kumar, Sudhir; Sinha, Prabhat Kumar; Shahi, Shivendra Kumar; Biswas, Nihar Ranjan; Kumar, Abhay",,296,16

All of these events are preceded by a ubiquitous rise of intracellular calcium, which results from influx of external calcium and/or calcium release from internal storage. In Drosophila, this calcium rise initiates from the pole(s) of the oocyte by influx of external calcium in response to mechanical triggers. It is thought to trigger calcium responsive kinases and/or phosphatases, which in turn alter the oocyte phospho-proteome to initiate downstream events. Recent studies revealed that external calcium enters the activating Drosophila oocyte through Trpm channels, a feature conserved in mouse. The local entry of calcium raises the question of whether Trpm channels are found locally at the poles of the oocyte or are localized around the oocyte periphery, but activated only at the poles.

We examined disparities in community ICU beds by US communities' median household income. We found a large gap in access by income: 49 percent of the lowest-income communities had no ICU beds in their communities, whereas only 3 percent of the highest-income communities had no ICU beds. Income disparities in the availability of community ICU beds were more acute in rural areas than in urban areas.

Physical health monitoring of these patients can have positive effects on outcomes. Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust (BSMHFT) states that a physical health assessment (PHA) should be completed within 72 hours of admission. This comprises a physical health form (PHF) and minimum data set (MDS): BP, BMI, TB and BBV status, alcohol and drug screen, smoking status, Hba1c and lipids. In a 2017 audit, compliance was shown to need improvement, with 28.3% of admissions not having a PHF documented.ObjectivesTo assess whether PHAs for new admissions to the Oleaster, Birmingham during the first wave of COVID-19 were completed in line with trust policyTo compare findings with a previous auditTo make recommendations to improve inpatient physical health and compliance with trust policyMethodA retrospective audit was conducted, with PHA details accessed via the electronic medical records system RiO. Admissions from 16/03/2020-30/06/2020 were accessed and 158 admissions (155 patients) were included. 21 admissions were excluded as they were internal transfers;only data from the initial admission were included. Data were collected by 2 medical students and a psychiatry trainee using a data collection tool. Data were recorded and analysed on Excel.ResultOf 158 admissions, 81 had PHFs (51.3%). 59 were completed within 72 hours of admission (34.3%);39 were completed fully (24.7%). Of incomplete PHFs, 2 explicitly stated incompletion due to COVID-19. 22 PHFs were created but not completed within 72 hours. 15 gave a deferral reason e.g., refusal to consent or agitation. For 77 admissions (47.3%), no assessment was documented, with no reason given.2 admissions (1.3%) recorded the full MDS within 72 hours of admission.2 admissions (1.3%) had fully complete PHAs (PHF and MDS) within 72 hours of admission, fulfilling trust policy.Conclusion51.3% of admissions had a PHF, with 34.3% documented within 72 hours of admission. However, only 1.3% of admissions fulfilled trust policy of both a completed PHF and MDS within 72 hours of admission. There were more admissions without a PHF than in the previous 2017 audit;47.33% compared to 28.3% previously. Given trust targets that a PHA should be fully completed for 100% of admissions, it was found that the Oleaster did not meet these guidelines during this period and improvements must be made to maintain integrity of patient care.","Lawson-Smith, Erin Sutherland Danielle Brookes Eleanor Zhang Alex George Joji",BJPsych Open,296,20

In addition, government authorities are currently investing greater efforts in developing internet hospitals. PURPOSE: The purpose of this essay was to assess how outpatients feel about online outpatient clinics and to analyze the factors that affect their satisfaction and willingness to return to these clinics. The results provide advice regarding how to more effectively encourage patients to use online outpatient clinics. METHODS: A self-developed questionnaire was used to survey 191 patients who had visited the online outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province from January to July 2019. A descriptive analysis was conducted on the collected data, and factors influencing satisfaction were identified. RESULTS: The majority of the surveyed patients were young or middle-aged (92.7%) and 42.9% held a college degree or higher. Nearly three-quarters (72.2%) expressed feeling satisfied or better with the online outpatient clinic, with 31.4% of these expressing feeling very satisfied. Nearly all (91.1%) expressed the opinion that the online outpatient clinic had improved their awareness of health self-management . Furthermore, 176 (92.1%) were willing to use the online outpatient clinic again. The results of univariate analysis showed that the main factors negatively influencing re-use of the online outpatient clinic were: failure to solve the problem in a timely manner (&#967;2 = 8.603, p = .045), the complicated process of online registration (&#967;2 = 8.322, p = .016), the failure of the online physical examination (&#967;2 = 8.958, p = .015), and unreliable quality (&#967;2 = 15.373, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: The participants surveyed in this study reported a lower satisfaction for their online outpatient clinic experience than reported in similar surveys of traditional outpatient services. However, many reported that their health-related self-management awareness had improved after use, indicating that they feel better about the online outpatient clinic. The factors that affected willingness to reuse to the online outpatient clinic related mainly to imperfections related to the clinic and its inability to adequately meet patient needs. Online outpatient clinics should simplify the process of registration, improve functions, and increase service functions such as online examination appointments and follow-up visits to improve patient satisfaction.","Peng, Yao-Yao; Li, Xiao-Ling; Zhao, Shu-Zhen; He, Xiao-Li; Shi, Zheng-Yan",Hu Li Za Zhi,296,16

Sources of information: Program-specific documents, preexisting, and related to COVID-19; documents from provincial, national, and international kidney transplant societies/agencies and organ procurement agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. Methods: Challenges in the care of pediatric kidney transplant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Society of Transplantation (CST) Pediatric Group. It identified pediatric kidney transplant nephrologists (including a pediatric nephrologist ethicist) across the country and formed a workgroup. The initial guidance document was drafted and members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all suggestions in detail via e-mail and virtual meetings. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CST Kidney Transplant Working Group, by the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) COVID-19 Rapid Response Team (RRT), and an infectious disease expert. The suggestions were presented at an interactive webinar sponsored by CSN in collaboration with the CST and Canadian Association of Pediatric Nephrologists (CAPN), and attended by pediatric kidney health care professionals for further peer input. Final revisions were made based on feedback received. CJKHD editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. Key findings: We identified 8 key areas of pediatric kidney transplant care that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) transplant activity, (2) outpatient clinic activity, (3) monitoring, (4) multidisciplinary care, (5) medications (immunosuppression and others), (6) patient/family education/support, (7) school and employment, and (8) management of pediatric kidney transplant patients who are COVID-19 positive. We make specific suggestions for each of these areas. Limitations: A full systematic review of available literature was not undertaken for the sake of expediency in development of this guideline. There is a paucity of literature to support evidence-based recommendations at this time. Instead, these guidelines were formulated based on expert opinion derived from available knowledge/experience and are subject to the biases associated with this level of evidence. The parallel review process that was created to expedite the publication of this work may not be as robust as standard arms' length peer review processes. Implications: These recommendations are meant to serve as a guide to pediatric kidney transplant directors, clinicians, and administrators for providing the best patient care in the context of limited resources while protecting patients and health care providers wherever possible by limiting exposure to COVID-19. We recognize that recommendations may not be applicable to all provincial/local health authority practices and that they may not be delivered to all patients given the time and resource constraints affecting the individual provincial/local health jurisdiction.","Teoh, Chia Wei; Gaudreault-Tremblay, Marie-Michele; Blydt-Hansen, Tom D; Goldberg, Aviva; Arora, Steven; Feber, Janusz; Langlois, Valerie; Ruhl, Michelle; Phan, Veronique; Morgan, Catherine; Acott, Philip; Hamiwka, Lorraine",Can J Kidney Health Dis,296,22

The global reaction to COVID-19 may drive interest in vaccines for other diseases. OBJECTIVES: Our study investigated the correlation between global online interest in COVID-19 and interest in CDC-recommended routine vaccines. DESIGN, SETTINGS, MEASUREMENTS: This infodemiology study used Google Trends data to quantify worldwide interest in COVID-19 and CDC-recommended vaccines using the unit search volume index (SVI), which estimates volume of online search activity relative to highest volume of searches within a specified period. SVIs from December 30, 2019 to March 30, 2020 were collected for ""coronavirus (Virus)"" and compared with SVIs of search terms related to CDC-recommended adult vaccines. To account for seasonal variation, we compared SVIs from December 30, 2019 to March 30, 2020 with SVIs from the same months in 2015 to 2019. We performed country-level analyses in ten COVID-19 hotspots and ten countries with low disease burden. RESULTS: There were significant positive correlations between SVIs for ""coronavirus (Virus)"" and search terms for pneumococcal (R = 0.89, p < 0.0001) and influenza vaccines (R = 0.93, p < 0.0001) in 2020, which were greater than SVIs for the same terms in 2015-2019 (p = 0.005, p < 0.0001, respectively). Eight in ten COVID-19 hotspots demonstrated significant positive correlations between SVIs for coronavirus and search terms for pneumococcal and influenza vaccines. LIMITATIONS: SVIs estimate relative changes in online interest and do not represent the interest of people with no Internet access. CONCLUSION: A peak in worldwide interest in pneumococcal and influenza vaccines coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic in February and March 2020. Trends are likely not seasonal in origin and may be driven by COVID-19 hotspots. Global events may change public perception about the importance of vaccines. Our findings may herald higher demand for pneumonia and influenza vaccines in the upcoming season.","Paguio, Joseph Alexander; Yao, Jasper Seth; Dee, Edward Christopher",Vaccine,296,1

Therefore, it is essential to interrogate whether heads of state like President Trump are using the limelight to harm others. As I show through a qualitative content analysis of 87 communication events, instead of unifying and reassuring the public with cogent solutions, President Trump has leveraged the spotlight to name enemies: China, COVID-19, and the press.

In this study, nucleic acid detection and antibody detection (IgG and IgM) were combined to improve the testing accuracy of patients with suspected COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: The positive rate of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection (IgG and IgM) were compared in suspected COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 71 patients with suspected COVID-19 were selected to participate in this study, which included a retrospective analysis of clinical features, imaging examination, laboratory biochemical examination and nucleic acid detection and specific antibody (IgM and IgG) detection. RESULTS: The majority of participants with suspected COVID-19 presented with fever (67.61%) and cough (54.93%), and the imaging results showed multiple small patches and ground-glass opacity in both lungs, with less common infiltration and consolidation opacity (23.94%). Routine blood tests were mostly normal (69.01%), although only a few patients had lymphopenia (4.23%) or leucopenia (12.68%). There was no statistical difference in the double-positive rate between nucleic acid detection (46.48%) and specific antibody (IgG and IgM) detection (42.25%) (P = 0.612), both of which were also poorly consistent with each other (kappa = 0.231). The positive rate of combined nucleic acid detection and antibody detection (63.38%) was significantly increased, compared with that of nucleic acid detection (46.48%) and that of specific antibody (IgG and IgM) detection (42.25%), and the differences were statistically significant (P = 0.043 and P = 0.012, respectively).

METHODS: Authors collected regional recommendations to re-organize the healthcare system during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The specific protocols implemented in an orthopaedic hospital, selected as a regional hub for minor trauma, are analyzed and described in this article. RESULTS: Two referral centres were identified as the hubs for minor trauma to reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals. These two centres have specific features: an emergency room, specialized orthopaedic surgeons for joint diseases and trauma surgeons on-call 24/7. Patients with trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach or needing non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery were moved to these hospitals. Authors report the internal protocols of one of these centres. All elective surgery was stopped, outpatient clinics limited to emergencies and specific pathways, ward and operating theatre dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients were implemented. An oropharyngeal swab was performed in the emergency room for all patients needing to be admitted, and patients were moved to a specific ward with single rooms to wait for the results. Specific courses were organized to demonstrate the correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: The structure of the orthopaedic hubs, and the internal protocols proposed, could help to improve the quality of assistance for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Randelli, Pietro Simone; Compagnoni, Riccardo",Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,296,16

Challenges of resource allocation frequently lead to ethical concerns of healthcare inequity. To tackle this, such developing nations continually need to implement healthcare innovation, coupled with capacity building to ensure new strategies continue to be developed and executed. The COVID-19 pandemic has made significant demands of healthcare systems across the world-to provide equitable healthcare to all, to ensure public health principles are followed, to find novel solutions for previously unencountered healthcare challenges, and to rapidly develop new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Countries worldwide have struggled to accomplish these demands, especially the latter two, considering that few nations had long-standing systems in place to ensure processes for innovation were on-going before the pandemic struck. The crisis represents a critical juncture to plan for a future. This future needs to incorporate a vision for the implementation of healthcare innovation, coupled with capacity building to ensure new strategies continue to be developed and executed.

Since stigma is created and reinforced by society-through in-person and online social interactions-referencing the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or ""China virus"" has the potential to create and perpetuate stigma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess if there was an increase in the prevalence and frequency of the phrases ""Chinese virus"" and ""China virus"" on Twitter after the March 16, 2020, US presidential reference of this term. METHODS: Using the Sysomos software (Sysomos, Inc), we extracted tweets from the United States using a list of keywords that were derivatives of ""Chinese virus."" We compared tweets at the national and state levels posted between March 9 and March 15 (preperiod) with those posted between March 19 and March 25 (postperiod). We used Stata 16 (StataCorp) for quantitative analysis, and Python (Python Software Foundation) to plot a state-level heat map. RESULTS: A total of 16,535 ""Chinese virus"" or ""China virus"" tweets were identified in the preperiod, and 177,327 tweets were identified in the postperiod, illustrating a nearly ten-fold increase at the national level. All 50 states witnessed an increase in the number of tweets exclusively mentioning ""Chinese virus"" or ""China virus"" instead of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or coronavirus. On average, 0.38 tweets referencing ""Chinese virus"" or ""China virus"" were posted per 10,000 people at the state level in the preperiod, and 4.08 of these stigmatizing tweets were posted in the postperiod, also indicating a ten-fold increase. The 5 states with the highest number of postperiod ""Chinese virus"" tweets were Pennsylvania (n=5249), New York (n=11,754), Florida (n=13,070), Texas (n=14,861), and California (n=19,442). Adjusting for population size, the 5 states with the highest prevalence of postperiod ""Chinese virus"" tweets were Arizona (5.85), New York (6.04), Florida (6.09), Nevada (7.72), and Wyoming (8.76). The 5 states with the largest increase in pre- to postperiod ""Chinese virus"" tweets were Kansas (n=697/58, 1202%), South Dakota (n=185/15, 1233%), Mississippi (n=749/54, 1387%), New Hampshire (n=582/41, 1420%), and Idaho (n=670/46, 1457%).

Amniotic fluid is a biofluid with great potential for insights into the feto-maternal milieu. It is rich in metabolites, and metabolic consequences of inflammation is yet researched only to a limited extent. Metabolomic profiling provides opportunities to identify potential biomarkers of inflammatory conditioned pregnancy complications such as spontaneous preterm delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform metabolomic profiling of amniotic fluid from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies in the mid-trimester to identify potential biomarkers associated with spontaneous preterm delivery and gestational duration at delivery. A secondary aim was to replicate previously reported mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolic biomarkers of spontaneous preterm delivery in asymptomatic women. METHOD: A nested case-control study was performed within a larger cohort study of asymptomatic pregnant women undergoing mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis at 14-19 gestational weeks in Gothenburg, Sweden. Medical records were used to obtain clinical data and delivery outcome variables. Amniotic fluid samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery (n = 37) were matched with amniotic fluid samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous delivery at term (n = 37). Amniotic fluid samples underwent untargeted metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate random forest analyses were used for data processing. A secondary targeted analysis was performed, aiming to replicate previously reported mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolic biomarkers in women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis did not distinguish the samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery from those with a subsequent term delivery. Neither was the metabolic profile associated with gestational duration at delivery. Potential metabolic biomarker candidates were identified from four publications by two different research groups relating mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolomes to spontaneous PTD, of which fifteen markers were included in the secondary analysis. None of these were replicated. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolomic profiles of early mid-trimester amniotic fluid were not associated with spontaneous preterm delivery or gestational duration at delivery in this cohort.","Hallingström, Maria; Barman, Malin; Savolainen, Otto; Viklund, Felicia; Kacerovsky, Marian; Brunius, Carl; Jacobsson, Bo",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,296,16

In Spain, the second European country in incidence of the disease at the time of data collection, there are few studies that include both laboratory parameters and clinical parameters. Our aim is to study the relationship of a wide series of biomarkers with admission to intensive care and death in a hospital in the Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain), with special attention to IL-6 due to its role in the systemic inflammatory response associated with a worse prognosis of the disease. Methods: Data were collected from 546 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. All of them had IL-6 results, in addition to other biochemical and haematological parameters. The difference of the medians for the selected parameters between the groups (ICU vs non-ICU, dead vs survivors) was studied using a Mann-Whitney analysis. The independent variables that predicted death were studied using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Results: Higher age and blood concentrations of ALT, creatinine, CK, cTnI, LDH, NT-proBNP, CRP, IL-6, leucocyte count and D-dimer together with lower blood concentrations of albumin and lymphocyte count were associated with mortality in univariate analysis. Age, LDH, IL-6 and lymphocyte count remained associated with death in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Age, LDH, IL-6 and lymphocyte count, as independent predictors of death, could be used to establish more aggressive therapies in COVID-19 patients.

To survey the increasing number of dietary supplements that contain magnolia bark or its extract, an affordable quantitative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) - densitometry method was developed. The methanol extracts were analyzed on the silica gel plates after manual sample application using n-hexane - ethyl acetate - ethanol (16:3:1, v/v/v) as a mobile phase. For quantitation, the chromatograms were scanned in the absorbance mode at the wavelength &#955; = 290 nm. The limits of detection and quantitation were 90 and 280 ng/zone for magnolol and 70 and 200 ng/zone for honokiol, respectively. None of the two targeted neolignans were detected in two of the six analyzed supplements. In the other four samples, the measured amounts were between 0.95-114.69 mg g-1 for magnolol and 4.88-84.86 mg g-1 for honokiol. Moreover, separations of these two neolignans on the TLC and high-performance TLC (HPTLC) layers were compared and HPTLC was combined with antioxidant (DPPH) and antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis and Aliivibrio fischeri) assays and mass spectrometry (MS), using the elution-based interface. Both magnolol and honokiol exhibited effects in all bioactivity assays. The HPTLC-MS tests confirmed purity of neolignan zones in the extracts of dietary supplements and supported tentative identification of the alkaloid piperine and the isoflavone daidzein as additional bioactive components of the investigated dietary supplements. Using the same mobile phase in the orthogonal directions 2D-HPTLC-MS experiments proved degradation, i.e., instability of magnolol and honokiol on the silica gel adsorbent.","Lata, Eliza; Fulczyk, Agnieszka; Ott, Péter G; Kowalska, Teresa; Sajewicz, Mieczyslaw; Móricz, Ágnes M",J Chromatogr A,296,24

The negative impact of COVID-19 is widespread and includes not only people who contracted the disease but also those with chronic morbidities such as diabetes whose care is compromised due to diversion of medical resources. People with diabetes are generally more susceptible to infection as a result of altered immunity. People with diabetes have a worse prognosis from COVID-19 and there is evidence to suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may directly affect pancreatic function precipitating hyperglycaemic crises.

Diabetes services are re-organized to ensure that medical care of people with diabetes is maintained despite resource and other practical constraints. Public health measures including social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of face masks are crucial in containing community transmission of the virus. Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated city in the world, is particularly vulnerable and has in place a stringent containment policy and aggressive contact tracing to ensure public safety during this pandemic.","Luk, Andrea O Y; Ng, Susanna S S; Holt, Richard I G",Diabet Med,296,22

We aim to study the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of pediatric hospital services including emergency department (ED) attendances, hospitalizations, diagnostic categories and resource utilization in Singapore. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of ED attendances and hospital admissions among children < 18 years old from January 1st to August 8th 2020 in a major pediatric hospital in Singapore. Data were analyzed in the following time periods: Pre-lockdown (divided by the change in Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level), during-lockdown and post-lockdown. We presented the data using proportions and percentage change in mean counts per day with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We attended to 58,367 children with a mean age of 5.1 years (standard deviation, SD 4.6). The mean ED attendance decreased by 331 children/day during lockdown compared to baseline (p < 0.001), attributed largely to a drop in respiratory (% change - 87.9, 95% CI - 89.3 to - 86.3, p < 0.001) and gastrointestinal infections (% change - 72.4, 95%CI - 75.9 to - 68.4, p < 0.001). Trauma-related diagnoses decreased at a slower rate across the same periods (% change - 40.0, 95%CI - 44.3 to - 35.3, p < 0.001). We saw 226 children with child abuse, with a greater proportion of total attendance seen post-lockdown (79, 0.6%) compared to baseline (36, 0.2%) (p < 0.001). In terms of ED resource utilization, there was a decrease in the overall mean number of procedures performed per day during the lockdown compared to baseline, driven largely by a reduction in blood investigations (% change - 73.9, 95%CI - 75.9 to - 71.7, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted a significant decrease in infection-related presentations likely attributed to the lockdown and showed that the relative proportion of trauma-related attendances increased.

METHODS: We searched electronic databases from inception to 17 December 2020. Studies that reported clinical data on patients with COVID-19 and pericarditis were included. Descriptive statistics were used for categorical and continuous variables [mean +/- standard deviation or median (interquartile range)]. As an exploratory analysis, differences between patients with acute pericarditis and myopericarditis were compared. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies (32 case reports and 1 case series) involving 34 patients were included. The mean age was 51.6 +/- 19.5 years and 62% of patients were men. Sixty-two percentage of patients were diagnosed with myopericarditis. The most frequent electrocardiographic pattern (56%) was diffuse ST-elevation and PR depression. Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade were reported in 76 and 35% of cases, respectively. The median values of C-reactive protein [77 mg/dl (12-177)] and white blood cells [12 335 cells/mul (5625-16 500)] were above the normal range. Thirty-eight percent and 53% of patients were treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine, respectively. These drugs were more frequently used in patients with acute pericarditis compared with myopericarditis. The in-hospital mortality was 6% without a significant difference between both groups. CONCLUSION: Our review shows that COVID-19 patients with pericarditis had similar clinical features to other viral cardiotropic infections. However, NSAIDs and colchicine were used in half or less of the cases. Overall, the short-term prognosis was good across groups.","Diaz-Arocutipa, C.; Saucedo-Chinchay, J.; Imazio, M.",Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine,296,1

The COVID-19 disease includes, also damage to other organ systems as well as coagulopathy. The present report describes a case of COVID-19 presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and subsequent acute limb ischemia (ALI). PRESENTATION OF CASE: An 84-years old hospitalized female patient presenting diabetes and recent COVID-19 reported acute onset of abdominal pain and typical findings of AMI. The CT-angiography confirmed the AMI secondary to a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion. The patient was managed through an endovascular approach using a SMA mechanical thrombectomy and stenting with a good result. DISCUSSION: Treatment of this life-threatening condition includes surgical resection of the necrotic bowel, restoration of blood flow to the ischemic intestine and supportive measure - gastrointestinal decompression, fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic support. Endovascular management of AMI is preferred over the standard surgical approach due to a reduced mortality and morbidity rates. Imaging findings of intestinal necrosis, however, represent an indication for AMI surgical treatment with explorative laparotomy. Different endovascular solutions have been employed to address AMI including mechanical thrombectomy, local thrombolysis, and PTA-stenting. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 clinical presentation can be atypical, including gastrointestinal symptoms. If a first embolic event occurs, an aggressive anticoagulation treatment could be inefficient to reduce the risk of subsequent embolization events. The limited life expectancy of such revascularization procedures should orientate towards less invasive treatments.","Dinoto, E; Ferlito, F; La Marca, M A; Mirabella, D; Bajardi, G; Pecoraro, F",Int J Surg Case Rep,296,16

While attaching a HEPA filter to the endotracheal tube will protect the anesthesia machine and the gas sampling line from contamination, this contribution to the dead space makes ventilation of these small patients challenging. Direct filtration of the gas sampling line eliminates this problem; however, appropriate filters are not readily available. AIMS: Identify a small filter capable of filtering out particles of a size similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the gas sampling line. METHODS: We used fluorescence microspheres suspended in a solution for a challenge test to determine the filtration efficiency of various filters. The microspheres varied in diameter (0.02 µm, 0.042 µm, 0.109 µm, and 0.989 µm). A fluorescence plate reader was used to evaluate the degree of fluorescence intensity in the flow-through from various filters and referenced to the fluorescence intensity of the input. RESULTS: AHEPA filter, as recommended as an anti-viral filter, effectively filtered all the particles tested. The B. Braun PERIFIX Flat Epidural Filter was the second most effective filter, filtering particles larger than 0.042 µm. Other filters tested did not filter fluorescence microspheres equivalent in size to a single coronavirus particle (0.07 µm). CONCLUSIONS: Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the Flat Epidural Filter for use as an anesthesia machine gas filter, our simple challenge test suggests that it could be used to effectively filter the anesthesia gas sampling line.","Brustowicz, Robert M; Yuki, Koichi",Paediatr. anaesth,296,22

We compiled a questionnaire to determine the physical and mental toll of this delay on elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients. Methods: All patients whose primary or revision total hip or knee arthroplasty was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic at a large academic-private practice were identified. An11-question survey was administered to these patients via email. All data was de-identified and stored in a REDCAP database. Results: Of 367 total patients identified, 113 responded to the survey. Seventy-seven percent of patients had their surgery postponed at least 5 weeks, and 20% were delayed longer than 12 weeks. Forty-one percent of patients reported an average VAS pain score greater than 7.5. Forty percent of respondents experienced increased anxiety during the delay. Thirty-four percent of patients felt their surgery was not elective. Sixteen percent experienced a fall during the delay, and 1 patient sustained a hip fracture. Level of pain reported was significantly associated with negative emotions, negative effects of delay, and whether patients felt their surgery was indeed elective. 76% reported trust in their surgeon's judgement regarding appropriate timing of surgery. Communication was listed as the number one way in which patients felt their surgeon could have improved during this time. Conclusion: Surgical delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased pain and anxiety many total joint arthroplasty patients. While the majority of patients maintained trust in their surgeon during the delay, methods to improve communication may benefit the patient experience in future delays.

The aim was ""to ascertain the characteristics of patients, uncertainty over diagnosis, or features of the emergency response to the pandemic that could be modified to mitigate against future excess deaths"". METHODS: Review of the entire pathway of care of patients whose death was registered in Salford during the 8 week period of the first wave (primary care, secondary care, 111 and 999 calls) in order to create a single record of healthcare prior to death. An expert panel judged avoidability of death against the National Mortality Case Record Review Programme scale. The panel identified themes using a structured judgement review format. RESULTS: There were 522 deaths including 197 in hospital, and 190 in care homes. 51% of patients were female, 81% Caucasian, age 79 ± 9 years. Dementia was present in 35%, COVID-19 was cause of death in 44%. Healthcare contact prior to death was most frequently with primary care (81% of patients). Forty-six patients (9%) had healthcare appointments cancelled (median 1 cancellation, range 1-9). Fewer than half of NHS 111 calls were answered during this period. 18% of deaths contained themes consistent with some degree of avoidability. In people aged &#8805;75 years who lived at home this was 53%, in care home residents 29% and in patients with learning disability 44% (n = 9). Common themes were; delays in patients presenting to care providers (10%), delays in testing (17%), avoidable exposure to COVID-19 (26%), delays in provider response (5%), and sub-optimal care (11%). For avoidability scores of 2 or 3 (indicating more than 50% chance of avoidability), 44% of cases had > 2 themes. CONCLUSIONS: The initial emergency response had unforeseen consequences resulting in late presentation, sub-optimal assessments, and delays in receiving care.

Whether disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) also impact T cell immune response to vaccination is unknown. MethodsIn 101 people with MS, we measured humoral responses via an immunoassay to measure IgG against the COVID-19 spike S1 glycoprotein in serum. We also measured T cell responses using FluoroSpot assay for interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) (Mabtech,Sweden) using cryopreserved rested PBMCs and then incubated in cRPMI with 1{micro}g/ml of pooled peptides spanning the entire spike glycoprotein (Genscript, 2 pools; 158 peptides each). Plates were read on an AID iSpot Spectrum to determine number of spot forming cells (SFC)/106 PBMCs. We tested for differences in immune responses across DMTs using linear models. FindingsHumoral responses were detected in 22/39 (56.4%) participants on anti-CD20 and in 59/63 (93.6%) participants on no or other DMTs. In a subset with immune cell phenotyping (n=88; 87%), T cell responses were detected in 76/88 (86%), including 32/33 (96.9%) participants on anti-CD20 therapies. AntiCD20 therapies were associated with an increase in IFN-{gamma} SFC counts relative to those on no DMT or other DMTs (for antiCD20 vs. no DMT: 425.9% higher [95%CI: 109.6%, 1206.6%] higher; p<0.001; for antiCD20 vs. other DMTs: 289.6% [95%CI: 85.9%, 716.6%] higher; p<0.001). InterpretationWe identified a robust T cell response in individuals on anti-CD20 therapies despite a reduced humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Among the reasons for the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is the role of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic carriers. Therefore diagnostic testing is central to contain the global pandemic. Up to now real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based molecular assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens is the current reference standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Based on current knowledge regarding the sensitivity of the molecular test, the highest positive detection rate is from lower respiratory tract specimens; alternatively it is possible to perform a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab. Nasopharyngeal swab is the preferred choice for SARS-CoV-2 testing since it seems to have a greater sensitivity; however the procedure is not always free of complications and an epistaxis can occur. Among patients with greatest risk of massive nosebleed there are HHT patients. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disease that leads to multiregional mucocutanous telangiectases and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Clinically, the presence of telangiectases in nasal mucosa is the cause of recurrent epistaxis. In HHT patients the execution of the nasopharyngeal swab can determine from little or no consequences to a massive epistaxis leading to the necessity of nasal packing generally followed by hospital admission. In HHT patients undergoing a diagnostic test to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 infection status, especially in those patients with frequent epistaxis with a history of anemia and repeated hospitalizations, it is therefore advisable to perform an oropharyngeal swab. This, compared to the nasopharyngeal swab, exposes to a lower risk of severe nosebleeds related treatments, such as blood transfusions or invasive procedures. According to the risk-benefit assessment and based on our experience, we consider that, despite a lower diagnostic sensitivity, oropharyngeal swab is preferable to nasopharyngeal swab for the diagnosis of SARS CoV-2 infection in patients with HHT.","Pagella, Fabio; Lizzio, Roberta; Ugolini, Sara; Spinozzi, Giuseppe; Maiorano, Eugenia; Suppressa, Patrizia; Sabbà, Carlo; Matti, Elina",Orphanet J Rare Dis,296,8

The present study aimed to develop a nomogram model to predict the survival of COVID-19 patients based on their clinical and laboratory data at admission. METHODS: COVID-19 patients who were admitted at Hankou Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China from January 12, 2020 to March 20, 2020, whose outcome during the hospitalization was known, were retrospectively reviewed. The categorical variables were compared using Pearson's &#967;2-test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables were analyzed using Student's t-test or Mann Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Then, variables with a P-value of &#8804;0.1 were included in the log-binomial model, and merely these independent risk factors were used to establish the nomogram model. The discrimination of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and internally verified using the Bootstrap method. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients (134 surviving and 128 non-surviving patients) were included in the analysis. Seven variables, which included age (relative risk [RR]: 0.905, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.868-0.944; P < 0.001), chronic heart disease (CHD, RR: 0.045, 95% CI: 0.0097-0.205; P < 0.001, the percentage of lymphocytes (Lym%, RR: 1.125, 95% CI: 1.041-1.216; P = 0.0029), platelets (RR: 1.008, 95% CI: 1.003-1.012; P = 0.001), C-reaction protein (RR: 0.982, 95% CI: 0.973-0.991; P < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, RR: 0.993, 95% CI: 0.990-0.997; P < 0.001) and D-dimer (RR: 0.734, 95% CI: 0.617-0.879; P < 0.001), were identified as the independent risk factors. The nomogram model based on these factors exhibited a good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.923-0.973).

Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 vasculopathy. Although initial reports suggested that endothelial injury was caused directly by the virus, recent studies indicate that endothelial cells do not express ACE2 - the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to gain entry into cells - or express it at low levels and are resistant to the infection. These new findings, together with the observation that COVID-19 triggers a cytokine storm capable of injuring the endothelium and disrupting its antithrombogenic properties, favor an indirect mechanism of endothelial injury mediated, locally, by an augmented inflammatory reaction to infected nonendothelial cells such as the bronchial and alveolar epithelium and, systemically, by the excessive immune response to infection.

This article reviews the possible pathophysiological mechanisms in pericardial involvement in COVID19 and pericardial manifestations of COVID19. It also summarizes the patients with pericarditis secondary to COVID19 and outlines the contemporary treatment strategies in this patient population. RECENT FINDINGS: A high degree of suspicion is required to identify the pericardial involvement in COVID19 patients. It is proposed that an underlying hyperinflammatory reaction in COVID19 leads to pericardial inflammation. Acute pericarditis with or without myocardial involvement is diagnosed on clinical presentation, serum inflammatory markers, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Multimodality imaging may also have an additional diagnostic value. Patients are usually managed medically, but some patients develop a life-threatening pericardial tamponade necessitating pericardial drainage. Pericardial involvement is an important clinical manifestation of COVID19 requiring a proper workup. Timely diagnosis and a specific management plan based on the presentation and concomitant organ involvement usually lead to a complete recovery.","Furqan, Muhammad M; Verma, Beni R; Cremer, Paul C; Imazio, Massimo; Klein, Allan L",Curr Cardiol Rep,296,24

Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. METHODS: Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. RESULTS: We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, Inhibitory Concentration50 (IC50), MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition. CONCLUSION: The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2.","Banerjee, Amrita; Santra, Dipannita; Maiti, Smarajit",J Transl Med,296,1

Members of the archaeal family Methanoperedenaceae (formerly ANME-2d) have been demonstrated to couple AOM to the reduction of nitrate, iron, and manganese. Here, comparative genomic analysis of 16 Methanoperedenaceae metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), recovered from diverse environments, revealed novel respiratory strategies acquired through lateral gene transfer (LGT) events from diverse archaea and bacteria. Comprehensive phylogenetic analyses suggests that LGT has allowed members of the Methanoperedenaceae to acquire genes for the oxidation of hydrogen and formate and the reduction of arsenate, selenate, and elemental sulfur. Numerous membrane-bound multiheme c-type cytochrome complexes also appear to have been laterally acquired, which may be involved in the direct transfer of electrons to metal oxides, humic substances, and syntrophic partners.IMPORTANCE AOM by microorganisms limits the atmospheric release of the potent greenhouse gas methane and has consequent importance for the global carbon cycle and climate change modeling. While the oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea and bacteria is well documented, several other potential electron acceptors have also been reported to support AOM. In this study, we identify a number of novel respiratory strategies that appear to have been laterally acquired by members of the Methanoperedenaceae, as they are absent from related archaea and other ANME lineages. Expanding the known metabolic potential for members of the Methanoperedenaceae provides important insight into their ecology and suggests their role in linking methane oxidation to several global biogeochemical cycles.","Leu, Andy O; McIlroy, Simon J; Ye, Jun; Parks, Donovan H; Orphan, Victoria J; Tyson, Gene W",mBio (Online),296,2

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective service evaluation between the 3rd March and the 5th May 2020 to describe and characterise the use of POCUS within an acute care pathway designed specifically for the assessment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A novel POCUS severity scale was formulated by assessing pleural and interstitial abnormalities within six anatomical zones (three for each lung). An aggregated score was calculated for each patient and evaluated as a marker of disease severity using standard metrics of discriminatory performance. RESULTS: POCUS was performed in the assessment of 100 patients presenting with suspected COVID-19. POCUS was consistent with COVID-19 infection in 92% (n = 92) of the patients assessed. Severity, as assessed by POCUS, showed good discriminatory performance to predict all-cause inpatient mortality, death or critical care admission, and escalated oxygen requirements (AUC .80, .80, 82). The risk of all-cause mortality in patients with scores in lowest quartile was 2.5% (95%CI 0.12- 12.95) compared with 42.9% (95CI 15.8 - 75.0%) in the highest quartile. POCUS assessed severity correlated with length of stay and duration of supplemental oxygen therapy. CONCLUSION: A simple aggregated score formed by the summating the degree of pleural and interstitial change within six anatomical lung zones showed good discriminatory performance in predicting a range of adverse outcomes in patients with suspected COVID-19.","Knight, T; Edwards, L; Rajasekaran, A; Clare, S; Lasserson, D",Acute Med,296,32

The aim of our mixed method study was to assess (a) how effective are virtual clinics vs face-to-face clinics in progressing patients' care and (b) what is patient satisfaction with virtual consultation methods. METHODS: Analysis of clinic data from patient databases for both virtual and face-to-face clinics was carried out. A patient satisfaction survey was carried out by 75 of the patients who had attended virtual clinics. RESULTS: There was statistically a significant difference (p value < 0.01) in the proportion of patients prescribed medical therapy, referred for Speech and Language Therapy (SALT) or listed for surgery in the virtual clinic by comparison to the face-to-face clinic. 75 patients completed the questionnaire. 98% of patients were satisfied overall with the virtual method of consultation. 84% believed they would still benefit from face-to-face review. 83% would like the option of a virtual type of clinic in the future. CONCLUSION: Our data clearly demonstrates that face-to-face clinics are superior to virtual clinics, with almost no patients progressed to surgery in virtual consultations. Despite this, virtual methods are still valuable, and many patients have meaningful progression of care. In current circumstances, patients have very high satisfaction with virtual consultations and certain groups have been identified as particularly benefiting. Going forward, an ideal clinic may be a hybrid of face-to-face and virtual appointments as clinically indicated.","Watters, Carolina; Miller, Benjamin; Kelly, Mairead; Burnay, Victoria; Karagama, Yakubu; Chevretton, Elfy",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,296,16

Our main aim was to obtain evidence to support the use of modified national early warning score (m-NEWS) as an interdisciplinary, common, and universal scoring scale to quickly recognize patients with a risk of clinical deterioration before admission and during hospitalization. As a secondary goal, we tried to find a score threshold that can trigger patients' immediate medical review as a part of an optimal triaging protocol for an emergency setting where healthcare resources are overloaded. We performed a retrospective observational study. We included in our study all patients treated for COVID-19 infection in surgical departments between 01 March 2020 and 16 April 2020. Patients with negative test results for SARS-COV-2 were excluded. m-NEWS was obtained twice a day. Patients' m-NEWS were analyzed in order to verify the correlation between m-NEWS (at admission and m-NEWS variation 24 h after admission) and outcome (positive outcome-survival, negative outcome-death, or intensive care unit (ICU) transfer). We included a population-based sample of 225 SARS-COV-2-infected patients. Overall, the average age at hospitalization was 71 (ranging from 40 to 95). 144 (64%) patients were males and 81 (36%) females. m-NEWS values lower or equal to 7 were associated with the majority of the ""recovered"" population (100/132 75.75%) and at the same time with the minority of the ""non-recovered"" population (25/93 26.88%). For our sample, age is statistically correlated to the outcome but a triage protocol based solely on this variable is less effective than m-NEWS, which showed to be a reliable and easy-to-use score for first patient evaluation. Our observations pave the way towards further studies aiming at optimizing territorial and community healthcare management protocols.","Tagliabue, Fabio; Schena, Daniele; Galassi, Luca; Magni, Matteo; Guerrazzi, Guglielmo; Acerbis, Andrea; Rinallo, Christina; Longhi, Daniel; Ronzani, Alberto; Mariani, Pierpaolo",SN Compr Clin Med,296,6

However, in some cases, these wires may remain in situ and are often considered as a contraindication for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in the future. Therefore, we aimed to provide data about safety and image quality of CMR in these patients. METHODS: This is a report on a subpopulation out of 88 patients after heart transplantation that were included in a prospective cohort study and underwent multiple CMR in their post-transplant course. During CMR, patients were monitored by electrocardiogram and all examinations were observed by a physician to document potential adverse events. Additionally, image quality was assessed by an imaging specialist. RESULTS: Nineteen of 88 patients included had temporary pacing wires in situ. These patients underwent a total of 51 CMR studies. No major adverse event and only one single, mild sensory event could be documented. All CMR studies showed preserved diagnostic image quality. Temporary pacing wires were visible in 100% of HASTE and cine sequences. In less than 50% of the examinations, temporary pacing wires were also visible in T1 and T2 mapping, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences, without any impairment of image quality. CONCLUSIONS: With a low event rate of only one mild adverse event during 51 CMR examinations (2%), CMR appears to be safe in patients with retained temporary epicardial pacing wires after heart transplantation. Moreover, image quality was not impaired by the presence of pacing wires.","Gatterer, Constantin; Stelzmüller, Marie-Elisabeth; Kammerlander, Andreas; Zuckermann, Andreas; Krssák, Martin; Loewe, Christian; Beitzke, Dietrich",J Cardiovasc Magn Reson,296,29

We evaluated the usefulness of genetic and serological tests conducted during a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing facility in Japan. METHODS: After the first identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive, facility- and/or unit-wide PCR testing from nasopharyngeal swabs was repeatedly performed in a three-unit facility including 99 residents with dementia and 53 healthcare personnel. Additionally, PCR testing was conducted separately for residents and staff with fever of &#8805;37.5 °C. Facility-wide serological testing, including rapid kit testing and quantitative assay, was conducted twice over 1 month apart. RESULTS: A total of 322 PCR and 257 antibody tests were performed. 37 (24.3%) of the 152 individuals (25/99 residents, 25.3%; 12/53 staff, 22.6%) were identified as PCR-positive. Seven residents died with a mortality of 7.1% (7/99). Among the 37 individuals, 10 (27.0%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. PCR positivity was concentrated on one unit (Unit 1) (20/30 residents, 66.7%; 9/14 staff, 64.3%). The other units showed a limited spread of infection. In unit-wide and separate tests, PCR positivity detection was highly prevalent (22.9 and 44.4%, respectively) in Unit 1, compared with that in the other units. Serological testing identified two additional infected residents with a negative PCR result and showed that no staff was newly identified as infected. CONCLUSIONS: Thorough PCR testing, in combination with comprehensive and separate tests, is critical for managing COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing facilities, particularly, in units considered an epicenter. Serological testing is also beneficial for tracing contacts, confirming the number of infected individuals, and authorizing the termination of the outbreak.","Chong, Yong; Tani, Naoki; Ikematsu, Hideyuki; Terazawa, Nobuto; Nakashima, Hitoshi; Shimono, Nobuyuki; Akashi, Koichi; Tanaka, Yosuke",BMC Infect Dis,296,26

Such mutations can occur in the spike (S) protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor and is cleaved by TMPRSS2. However, whether S mutations affect SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remains unknown. Here, we show that naturally occurring S mutations can reduce or enhance cell entry via ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus exhibits substantially lower entry than that of SARS-CoV S. Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural and binding analyses. Nevertheless, the D614G mutation does not affect neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses. Taken together, we conclude that the D614G mutation increases cell entry by acquiring higher affinity to ACE2 while maintaining neutralization susceptibility.

However, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the central nervous system remains unclear. Brain organoid models derived from human pluripotent stem cells are potentially useful for the study of complex physiological and pathological processes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as they recapitulate cellular heterogeneity and function of individual tissues. We identified brain organoid studies that provided insight into the neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect neurons, the extent of neurotropism was relatively limited. Conversely, choroidal epithelial cells consistently showed a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Brain organoid studies also elucidated potential mechanism for cellular entry, demonstrated viral replication, and highlighted downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, they suggest that the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 may be contributed by both direct neuronal invasion and indirect consequences of neuroinflammation. The use of high throughput evaluation, patient-derived organoids, and advent of ""assembloids"" will provide a better understanding and functional characterization of the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. With advancement of organoid technology, brain organoids offer a promising tool for unravelling pathophysiologic clues and potential therapeutic options for neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19.","Ng, Jing-Han; Sun, Alfred; Je, Hyunsoo Shawn; Tan, Eng-King",Neuroscientist,296,24

Attacks of microorganisms including viruses and bacteria can be counteracted with an efficient immune system and therefore, stimulation of body's defense mechanism against infections has been proven to be an effective approach. Polysaccharides, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, and lactones are the important phytochemicals, reported to be primarily responsible for immunomodulation activity of the plants. These phytochemicals may act as lead molecules for the development of safe and effective immunomodulators as potential remedies for the prevention and cure of viral diseases. Natural products are known to primarily modulate the immune system in nonspecific ways. A number of plant-based principles have been identified and isolated with potential immunomodulation activity which justify their use in traditional folklore medicine and can form the basis of further specified research. The aim of the current review is to describe and highlight the immunomodulation potential of certain plants along with their bioactive chemical constituents. Relevant literatures of recent years were searched from commonly employed scientific databases on the basis of their ethnopharmacological use. Most of the plants displaying considerable immunomodulation activity are summarized along with their possible mechanisms. These discussions shall hopefully elicit the attention of researchers and encourage further studies on these plant-based immunomodulation products as potential therapy for the management of infectious diseases, including viral ones such as COVID-19.","Alhazmi, Hassan A; Najmi, Asim; Javed, Sadique A; Sultana, Shahnaz; Al Bratty, Mohammed; Makeen, Hafiz A; Meraya, Abdulkarim M; Ahsan, Waquar; Mohan, Syam; Taha, Manal M E; Khalid, Asaad",Front Immunol,296,16

This, in turn, has led to a need to understand better the evidence underpinning such moves. Based on a review of existing reviews, this paper critically analyses the relevant literature related to intervention with children with communication disabilities drawing on the COM-B model. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Ten reviews were identified following a systematic searching of electronic databases. These were then coded according to both PRISMA criteria and the components of the COM-B model. Based on these findings, a critical analysis of the state of the tele-practice intervention literature is discussed and fed into evidence-based advice for practitioners transitioning to this mode of service delivery. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The COM-B mapping suggests that the existing literature has provided primary evidence for physical opportunity and reflective motivation (e.g., participants have the time to take part and the necessary materials, as well as a desire to do it). It has also focused on elements of social opportunity (e.g., having support and prompts from others to take part). However, there are significant gaps in the description and analysis of both physical and psychological capability components. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Whilst the evidence for tele-practice interventions for children and young people with communication disabilities is growing, it is also lacking a comprehensive framework to support its implementation. In times of rapid transitions, researchers and practitioners alike need to understand how to evaluate comprehensively the impact of changing the mode of intervention delivery. The COM-B model provides a powerful tool to reflect on the key elements for the successful design and implementation of tele-practice interventions. What this paper adds What is already known on this subject Tele-practice has been a feature of service delivery for speech and language therapists working with children and young people with speech and language disorders for many years, as it has in other areas of practice. This came into sharp focus during 2020 during the 'lock-down' following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic when most practice went online. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study set out to provide a framework for understanding service delivery, drawing on the COM-B behaviour change model. This is applied using a rapid review methodology to 10 systematic and narrative reviews of the existing literature published since 2005. The findings suggest that while most studies demonstrated efficacy, there was a lack of information regarding specific aspects of the model which would affect their implementation. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? It is anticipated that the paper has the potential to have a direct bearing on how tele-practice services for children and young people with speech and language disorders will be delivered in the future. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for practice and research in terms of the application of the COM-B model to tele-practice in speech and language therapy.","Law, James; Dornstauder, Melanie; Charlton, Jenna; Gréaux, Mélanie",Int J Lang Commun Disord,296,17

Placental pathology in the setting of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a topic of great interest as earlier studies have shown mixed results. OBJECTIVE: -To ascertain whether maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with any specific placental histopathology, and to evaluate the virus's propensity for direct placental involvement. DESIGN: -Placentas from 65 women with polymerase chain reaction-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent histologic evaluation using Amsterdam consensus group criteria and terminology. Another 85 placentas from women without SARS-CoV-2 constituted the negative control group. Sixty-four of the placentas from the SARS-CoV-2-positive group underwent immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. RESULTS: -Pathologic findings were divided into maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal vascular malperfusion, chronic inflammatory lesions, amniotic fluid infection sequence, increased perivillous fibrin, intervillous thrombi, increased subchorionic fibrin, meconium-laden macrophages within fetal membranes, and chorangiosis. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence of any specific placental histopathology between the SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative groups. There was no immunohistochemical evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in any of the 64 placentas that underwent staining for viral nucleocapsid protein. CONCLUSIONS: -Our study results and a literature review suggest that there is no characteristic histopathology in the majority of placentas from women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Likewise, direct placental involvement by SARS-CoV-2 is a rare event.","Levitan, Daniel; London, Viktoriya; McLaren, Rodney A; Mann, Justin David; Cheng, Ke; Silver, Michael; Balhotra, Kimen Singh; McCalla, Sandra; Loukeris, Kristina",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

These data are in line with the reduction in the hospital admissions rate for acute coronary syndrome observed during the COVID-19 outbreak, probably due to the patients' fears of being infected during a hospital stay. All these factors may have contributed to the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurrence increase observed during the same period. The OHCAs rate increase can recognize 2 great sets of causes: the infection-related and the pandemic-related ones. If the first recognizes different underlying mechanisms that can be dealt with more and more effectively as evidence accumulates, we must remember also the latter: the fear of in-hospital contagion and the willingness not to further burden the health system, which can prevent some citizens from the activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) even in the case of symptoms suspected for time-dependent diseases, resulting in at-home deterioration until the OHCA occurrence. Information campaigns during pandemic must focus also on the importance of EMS early activation in case of real need to prevent COVID-19 from being a disease that kills at home.","Baldi, Enrico; Savastano, Simone",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,296,1

Although multiple diagnostic methods utilize nasopharyngeal specimens, saliva specimens represent an attractive alternative as they can rapidly and safely be collected from different populations. While saliva has been described as an acceptable clinical matrix for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we used a novel sensitive RT-PCR/MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based assay (Agena MassARRAY®) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimens. The platform demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to matched patient upper respiratory specimens. We also evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the platform and determined the limit of detection of the assay to be 1562.5 copies/ml. Furthermore, across the five individual target components of this assay, there was a range in analytic sensitivities for each target with the N2 target being the most sensitive. Overall, this system also demonstrated comparable performance when compared to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva by the cobas® 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test (Roche). Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate matrix for SARS-CoV-2 detection on the novel Agena system as well as on a conventional real-time RT-PCR assay. We conclude that the MassARRAY® system is a sensitive and reliable platform for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva, offering scalable throughput in a large variety of clinical laboratory settings.","Hernandez, Matthew M; Banu, Radhika; Shrestha, Paras; Patel, Armi; Chen, Feng; Cao, Liyong; Fabre, Shelcie; Tan, Jessica; Lopez, Heidi; Chiu, Numthip; Shifrin, Biana; Zapolskaya, Inessa; Flores, Vanessa; Lee, Pui Yiu; Castañeda, Sergio; Ramírez, Juan David; Jhang, Jeffrey; Osorio, Giuliana; Gitman, Melissa R; Nowak, Michael D; Reich, David L; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto E",J. med. virol,296,20

There are several factors involved in the epidemic spreading such as the individual characteristics of each city/country. The true shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system such as most of the social systems. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate to analyze these systems due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamical properties. Therefore this study presents a new approach to model the COVID-19 epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent people, edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities. The model improves the traditional SIR and it is applied to study the Brazilian epidemic by analyzing possible future actions and their consequences. The network is characterized using statistics of infection, death, and hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or precautionary measures we remove layers and/or reduce the intensity of social contacts. Results show that even taking various optimistic assumptions, the current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to a critical scenario for the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000). If all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep increase, and the demand for ICU beds may surpass 3 times the country's capacity. This would surely lead to a catastrophic scenario, as our estimation reaches an average of 212,000 deaths even considering that all cases are effectively treated. The increase of isolation (up to a lockdown) shows to be the best option to keep the situation under the healthcare system capacity, aside from ensuring a faster decrease of new case occurrences (months of difference), and a significantly smaller death toll (average of 87,000).","Scabini, Leonardo F.

Different IoT technologies, viz., Blockchain, robotics, Big data analysis, and cloud computing, have developed a competitive AFSC at the global level. Competitive AFSC needs cautious incorporation of multi-tiers suppliers, specifically during dealing with globalised sustainability issues.

Whereas the classical definition relies on the time from exposure to time of first symptoms, a more practical working definition is the time from exposure to time of first live virus excretion. For COVID-19, average incubation period times commonly span 5-7 days which are generally longer than for most typical other respiratory viruses. There is considerable variability reported however for the late right-hand statistical distribution. A small but yet epidemiologically important subset of patients may have the late end of the incubation period extend beyond the 14 days that is frequently assumed. Conservative assumptions of the right tail end distribution favor safety, but pragmatic working modifications may be required to accommodate high rates of infection and/or healthcare worker exposures. Despite the advent of effective vaccines, further attention and study in these regards are warranted. It is predictable that vaccine application will be associated with continued confusion over protection and its longevity.

To achieve this, we used a time to event analysis to arrive at factors that could alter the length of hospital stay, aiding in planning additional beds for any future rise in cases. METHODS: Information about COVID-19 patients was collected between June and August 2020. The response variable was the time from admission to discharge of patients. Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the factors that were associated with the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 730 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 675 (92.5%) recovered and 55 (7.5%) were considered to be right-censored, that is, the patient died or was discharged against medical advice. The median length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized was found to be 7 days by the Kaplan Meier curve. The covariates that prolonged the length of hospital stay were found to be abnormalities in oxygen saturation (HR = 0.446, P < .001), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (HR = 0.742, P = .003), levels of D-dimer (HR = 0.60, P = .002), lactate dehydrogenase (HR = 0.717, P = .002), and ferritin (HR = 0.763, P = .037). Also, patients who had more than 2 chronic diseases had a significantly longer length of stay (HR = 0.586, P = .008) compared to those with no comorbidities.

A systematic review of the literature using PRISMA guidelines was. RESULTS: Out of 1195 papers reviewed for conditions in COVID-19 patients relevant to routine vascular surgery practice, 43 papers were included and analyzed. Venous thrombosis was found to be the most common COVID-19 associated pathology with a cumulative incidence of 25% at 7 days and 48% at 14 days. Additionally, D-dimer levels proved to be a good predictor, even in the early stages of the disease with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 88.5% and a negative predictive value of 94.7%. Patients in the ICU demonstrated a significantly higher risk of developing VTE, even when receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Although evidence of arterial thrombosis was less common (1% to 16.3%), its consequences were typically more serious, including limb loss and death even in young individuals (OR = 25, 95% CI). Finally, microangiopathy has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations from retinal microangiopathy to other more severe manifestations such as myocardial injury, pulmonary compromise and potential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pathophysiological pathway by which COVID-19 produces thrombosis is not completely clear, the incidence of both arterial and venous thrombosis is increased. D-dimer screening should be done in all COVID-19 patients, as a predictor of thrombotic complications.","Ulloa, Jorge H; Figueroa, Valentin; Cifuentes, Juan Sebastian; Pinto, Paula; Lurie, Fedor",Vasc Endovascular Surg,296,21

This study examines neurosurgical trauma patients' dispositions through two neighboring trauma centers to inform resource allocation. We conducted a retrospective review of the trauma registries for two Level 1 Trauma Centers in Santa Clara County, one academic and one community center, between February 1st and April 15th, 2018-2020. Events before a quarantine, implemented on March 16th, 2020, and events from 2018 to 19 were used for reference. Encounters were characterized by injuries, services, procedures, and disposition. Categorical variables were analyzed by the &#967;2 test, proportions of variables by z-score test, and non-parametric variables by Fisher's exact test. A total of 1,336 traumas were identified, with 31% from the academic center and 69% from the community center. During the post-policy period, relative to matching periods in years prior, there was a decrease in number of TBI and spinal fractures (24% versus 41%, p < 0.001) and neurosurgical consults (27% versus 39%, p < 0.003), but not in number of neurosurgical admissions or procedures. There were no changes in frequency of neurosurgery consults among total traumas, patients triaged to critical care services, or patients discharged to temporary rehabilitation services. Neurosurgical services were similarly rendered between the academic and community hospitals. This study describes neurosurgical trauma management in a suburban healthcare network immediately following restrictive quarantine during a moderate COVID-19 outbreak. Our data shows that neurosurgery remains a resource-intensive subspeciality, even during restrictive periods when overall trauma volume is decreased.","Zhang, Michael; Zhou, James; Dirlikov, Ben; Cage, Tene; Lee, Marco; Singh, Harminder",J Clin Neurosci,296,26

Initiatives such as the ""15-minutes city"" have been put in place to shift the attention from monocentric city configurations to polycentric structures, increasing the availability and diversity of local urban amenities. Ultimately they expect to increase local walkability and increase mobility within residential areas. While we know how urban amenities influence human mobility at the city level, little is known about spatial variations in this relationship. Here, we use mobile phone, census, and volunteered geographical data to measure geographic variations in the relationship between origin-destination flows and local urban accessibility in Barcelona. Using a Negative Binomial Geographically Weighted Regression model, we show that, globally, people tend to visit neighborhoods with better access to education and retail. Locally, these and other features change in sign and magnitude through the different neighborhoods of the city in ways that are not explained by administrative boundaries, and that provide deeper insights regarding urban characteristics such as rental prices. In conclusion, our work suggests that the qualities of a 15-minutes city can be measured at scale, delivering actionable insights on the polycentric structure of cities, and how people use and access this structure.","Graells-Garrido, Eduardo; Serra-Burriel, Feliu; Rowe, Francisco; Cucchietti, Fernando M; Reyes, Patricio",PLoS One,296,23

This study sought to determine the perceived value of virtual interviews for Pediatric Surgery Fellowship. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to the applicants and faculty at a university-affiliated, free-standing children's hospital with a Pediatric Surgery fellowship program that conducted one of three interview days using a virtual format. RESULTS: All applicants who responded to the survey had at least one interview that was converted to a virtual interview. Faculty (75%) and applicants (87.5%) preferred in-person interviews over virtual interviews; most applicants (57%) did not feel they got to know the program as well with the virtual format. Applicants and faculty felt that virtual interviews could potentially be used as a screening tool in the future (7/10 Likert) but did not recommend they be used as a complete replacement for in-person interviews (3.5-5/10 Likert). Applicants were more likely than faculty to report that interview type influenced their final rank list (5 versus 3/10 Likert).

Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms present at nearly 20% in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection.

Comprendre les mécanismes qui sous-tendent l'établissement d'une mémoire immunitaire contre ce virus est donc un enjeu crucial en terme de santé publique et de vaccination. Dans ce contexte, la caractérisation de la longévité et de la fonctionnalité de la réponse lymphocytaire B mémoire anti-SARS-CoV-2 est une question majeure, notamment pour évaluer la protection conférée par l'infection en cas de nouvelle exposition virale. Notre objectif était donc de caractériser la réponse lymphocytaire B mémoire après infection par le SARS-CoV-2. Nous avons suivi longitudinalement 2 cohortes de patients ayant eu une infection par le SARS-CoV-2 de gravité modérée (M-CoV, ambulatoires, n = 18) ou sévère (S-CoV, hospitalisés avec nécessité d'oxygénothérapie, n = 21), prélevés dans les semaines suivant le début des symptômes puis à 3 mois et 6 mois après l'infection. Notre stratégie expérimentale reposait sur 3 approches complémentaires : – l'étude couplée et en cellule unique du transcriptome, de la séquence des chaînes lourdes et légères des gènes d'immunoglobuline, de l'expression phénotypique de 20 marqueurs de surfaces et de la spécificité antigénique pour la protéine spike des lymphocytes B (LB) CD19 + IgD- de 4 patients S-CoV à M0 et M6 ;– la culture en cellule unique des LB spécifiques de la spike de ces mêmes patients dans un système permettant leur prolifération et leur différenciation en cellules sécrétrices d'anticorps afin d'obtenir la séquence de la chaîne lourde du gène d'immunoglobuline et la production de l'anticorps encodés par les LB pour tester leur réactivité en ELISA contre le domaine RBD de la protéine spike, contre la spike des coronavirus saisonniers HCoV-HKU1 et HCoV-OC43 ou bien de tester leur potentiel de neutralisation du SARS-CoV-2 in vitro ;– la validation de ces résultats sur l'ensemble de la cohorte en cytométrie de flux avec un panel permettant d'identifier les LB mémoires spécifiques de la spike. Nous avons pu mettre en évidence que la première vague précoce de plasmocytes (réaction extra-folliculaire) provenait essentiellement de la différentiation de lymphocytes B activés exprimant fortement le CD71. Ces plasmocytes étaient issus de LB naïfs mais aussi de LB mémoires préexistant et présentant une cross-réactivité avec la protéine spike des coronavirus saisonniers HCoV-OC43 et HCoV-HKU1. De façon synchrone, une réponse durable de type centre germinatif se mettait en place, permettant le développement d'un pool de LB mémoires spécifiques de la spike acquérant progressivement un phénotype de LB mémoire classique (CD19 + CD27 + IgD-CD71-). Ces lymphocytes B mémoires spécifiques persistaient jusqu'à 6 mois après l'infection, augmentant même chez les S-CoV et représentaient 1,95 % des LB mémoires circulants et 0,94 % chez les M-CoV (p = 0,004). Peu de ces cellules étaient en relation clonale avec les cellules ayant donné naissance à la vague plasmocytaire initiale. Les LB mémoires spécifiques de la spike présentaient une accumulation de mutations somatiques dans les gènes d'immunoglobuline avec le temps, caractéristique des cellules issues des centres germinatifs. Ces cellules comprenaient une part croissante de cellules reconnaissant le RBD entre M3 et M6, au détriment des cellules cross-réactives avec les coronavirus saisonniers : à 6 mois, 26,3 % des LB mémoires spécifiques de la spike reconnaissaient la région RBD de cette dernière, contre 11,1 % à M3. Un test de neutralisation in vitro a permis de confirmer que les anticorps encodés par ces LB mémoires spécifiques du RBD avaient une activité de neutralisation contre le SARS-CoV-2, dans 85 % des cas pour les S-CoV et 50 % pour les M-CoV. Notre travail met en évidence qu'une mémoire lymphocytaire B s'établit après infection par le SARS-CoV-2, et mature dans le centre germinatif pour cquérir des mutations somatiques. L'établissement de cette mémoire immunitaire capable de se réactiver et d'évoluer en cas de réinfection est une nouvelle encourageante dans la perspective vaccinale et l'apparition de nouveaux variants de la protéine RBD du SARS-CoV2.

With 17% of the world's population, India has so far had 13% of global COVID-19 infections and 8.5% of deaths. Maharashtra accounting for 9% of India's population, is the worst affected state, with 19% of infections and 33% of total deaths in the country until 23rd December 2020. Though a number of studies have examined the vulnerability to and spread of COVID-19 and its effect on mortality, no attempt has been made to understand its impact on mortality in the states of India. METHOD: Using data from multiple sources and under the assumption that COVID-19 deaths are additional deaths in the population, this paper examined the impact of the disease on premature mortality, loss of life expectancy, years of potential life lost (YPLL), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in Maharashtra. Descriptive statistics, a set of abridged life tables, YPLL, and DALY were used in the analysis. Estimates of mortality indices were compared pre- and during COVID-19. RESULT: COVID-19 attributable deaths account for 5.3% of total deaths in the state and have reduced the life expectancy at birth by 0.8 years, from 73.2 years in the pre-COVID-19 period to 72.4 years by the end of 2020. If COVID-19 attributable deaths increase to 10% of total deaths, life expectancy at birth will likely reduce by 1.4 years. The probability of death in 20-64 years of age (the prime working-age group) has increased from 0.15 to 0.16 due to COVID-19. There has been 1.06 million additional loss of years (YPLL) in the state, and DALY due to COVID-19 has been estimated to be 6 per thousand.

This study aimed to assess the mental health status of Bangladeshi university students during the lockdown period. Subject and methods: Through an online-based questionnaire, information was collected from 509 university students of Bangladesh from June 19, 2020, to June 28, 2020, using convenient sampling. K-means clustering was applied to organize students according to their psychological health score, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also conducted to determine the association among the student's activities and their mental health during the pandemic. In addition, these associations were examined through chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression. Results: Students were categorized into four categories where 4.32% had mild, 72.7% had moderate, 12.57% had moderately severe, and 10.41% suffered from severe mental health imbalance. The results showed that having family members affected by the coronavirus, facing insecurity, using social media, and smoking habits increased the mental health imbalances of students; in contrast, being worried about studying, future career, spending more time with family members, and participation in household chores reduced the mental health disturbances of students. On the other hand, the results of the ordinal logistic regression indicated that sleeping time and participation in household chores were preventive factors for students. Conclusion: This study reveals that a large proportion of University students of Bangladesh suffered from mental health disturbances during the lockdown period. Implementing mental health plans and providing job security, improved communication approaches toward family members, not flattening illusive news, and preoccupation in household activities may assist to enhance the mental health status of the university students. The authors believe that this study's findings will be helpful to expedite the rate of attaining the sustainable development goal associated with health status in Bangladesh.","Alam, Muhammad Khairul; Ali, Ferdous Bin; Banik, Rajon; Yasmin, Sabina; Salma, Nahid",Z Gesundh Wiss,296,19

Increasing access to modern methods of contraception can reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancy and decrease maternal mortality. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) offer high contraceptive efficacy as well as cost-efficacy, providing benefits for both women and healthcare systems. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) first became available in 1990 with the introduction of Mirena (LNG-IUS 20), a highly effective contraceptive which can reduce menstrual blood loss and provide other therapeutic benefits. The impact of the LNG-IUS on society has been wide ranging, including decreasing the need for abortion, reducing the number of surgical sterilisation procedures performed, as well as reducing the number of hysterectomies carried out for issues such as heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mirena can provide a treatment option for women with gynaecological issues such as HMB without organic pathology, minimising exposure to the hospital environment and reducing waiting times for surgical appointments. Looking to the future, research and development in the field of the LNG-IUS continues to expand our understanding of these contraceptives in clinical practice and offers the potential to further expand the choices available to women, allowing them to select the option that best meets their needs.","Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina; Kubba, Ali; Caetano, Cecilia; Faustmann, Thomas; Lukkari-Lax, Eeva; Heikinheimo, Oskari",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),296,32

Then these “optimal” policies are sought in the case of limited resources on behalf of a COVID-19 pandemic scenario. The amplitude of peak epidemics will often be minimized by executing strategies from the beginning of a pandemic, spreading the epidemics’ greatest impact over a longer time frame. Therefore, the timing and potency of control measures can reduce the pressure on the system during the top of the epidemic through the pandemic, decreasing the pressure on the healthcare infrastructure.

They often work long hours, face emotional stress, and are at a high risk of psychosocial and somatic illnesses. Nurses sometimes fall sick but work regardless, leading to presenteeism and subsequent risks to quality of care and patient safety due to the increased likelihood of patients falling, medication errors, and staff-to-patient disease transmission. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand presenteeism among frontline nurses and nurse managers in acute, primary, and long-term health care settings and to contribute to the development of future interventional studies and recommendations. METHODS: A qualitative study based on online focus group discussions will explore the perceptions of, attitudes to, and experiences with presenteeism among frontline nurses and nurse managers. Using a pilot-tested interview guide, 8 focus group discussions will involve nurses working in acute care hospitals, primary care settings, and long-term residential care facilities in Switzerland's French-speaking region and Portugal's Center region. The data collected will be examined using a content analysis approach via NVivo 12 QSR International software. RESULTS: The University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland's School of Health Sciences and the Polytechnic of Leiria's School of Health Sciences in Portugal have both approved funding for the study. The research protocol has been approved by ethics committees in both countries. Study recruitment commenced in February 2021. The results of the data analysis are expected by September 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This present study aims to gain more insight into the dilemmas facing nurses as a result of all causes of presenteeism among frontline nurses and nurse managers in different health care settings. The researchers will prepare manuscripts on the study's findings, publish them in relevant peer-reviewed journals, exhibit them in poster presentations, and give oral presentations at appropriate academic and nonscientific conferences. Regarding further knowledge transfer, researchers will engage with stakeholders to craft messages focused on the needs of nurses and nurse managers and on disseminating our research findings to deal with the issue of nursing presenteeism.

In the wake of this pandemic are patients, family members, and various types of care providers, all of whom share different levels of moral distress. Moral conflict occurs in disputes when individuals or groups have differences over, or are unable to translate to each other, deeply held beliefs, knowledge, and values. Such conflicts can seriously affect healthcare providers and cause distress during disastrous situations such as pandemics when medical and human resources are stretched to the point of exhaustion. In the current pandemic, most hospitals and healthcare institutions in the United States have not allowed visitors to come to the hospitals to see their family or loved ones, even when the patient is dying. The moral conflict and moral distress (being constrained from doing what you think is right) among care providers when they see their patients dying alone can be unbearable and lead to ongoing grief and sadness. This paper will explore the concepts of moral distress and conflict among hospital staff and how a system-wide provider wellness programme can make a difference in healing and health.","Anderson-Shaw, Lisa K; Zar, Fred A",J Bioeth Inq,296,23

A survey was performed to quantify this decrease and the impact on the management of myocardial infarction in Latin America. METHODS: A telematic survey was conducted for all countries in Latin America. Diagnostic catheterisations, coronary and structural interventions, as well as the incidence and delay to reperfusion therapy of myocardial infarction (STEMI), were recorded. Two periods were compared: from 24 February to 8 March 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and another 2­week period that varied according to country (COVID-19). RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 79 centres in 20 countries. There was a significant decrease in the number of diagnostic procedures (-65.2%), coronary interventions (-59.4%), structural therapeutics (-86.1%) and STEMI care (-51.2%). A decrease was noted in the incidence of STEMI, but also a delay in the time to STEMI reperfusion. While there was a variation in activity in interventional cardiology between countries, patient behaviour was rather homogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in healthcare activity has been noted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including STEMI care, with the risk of increased mortality and/or morbidity following STEMI. Healthcare providers should encourage patients with suspected symptoms of STEMI to call for emergency care to ensure rapid diagnosis and timely reperfusion treatment.","Mayol, J; Artucio, C; Batista, I; Puentes, A; Villegas, J; Quizpe, R; Rojas, V; Mangione, J; Belardi, J",Neth Heart J,296,1

Sixty-two COVID-19 patients in the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine and Loudi Center for Diseases Prevention and Control, from January to March 2020, were sampled as the novel coronavirus pneumonia infected group. One hundred and thirty-one cases from the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, including 67 healthy individuals and 64 non-COVID-19 inpatients, served as the noninfected group. Approximately every 5 days, sera from 20 cases were collected and analyzed three times, using an automatic biochemical analyzer, to detect serum MMP3 concentrations. Correlation was analyzed between MMP3 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Following normality tests, differences in serum MMP3 levels between the infected and noninfected group were analyzed via SPSS (version 25.0) software, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The MMP3 concentration was 44.44 (23.46 ~ 72.12) ng/mL in the infected group and 32.42 (28.16 ~ 41.21) ng/mL in the noninfected group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (Z = -2.799, P = .005 < .05). A positive correlation was found between MMP3 and interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß; r = .681, P = .000 < .05), and IL-6 (r = .529, P = .002 < .05). Serum MMP3 concentration, measured over three separate time points, were 55.98 (30.80 ~ 75.97) ng/mL, 34.84 (0.00 ~ 51.84) ng/mL, and 5.71 (0.00 ~ 40.46) ng/mL, respectively.

This is anticipated to result in long-term negative mental health effects on the population, with HCWs representing a particularly vulnerable group. The scope of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of a scalable mental health platform to provide services to large numbers of at-risk or affected individuals. The Mount Sinai Health System in New York City was at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The Center for Stress, Resilience, and Personal Growth (CSRPG) was created to address the current and anticipated psychological impact of the pandemic on the HCWs in the health system. The mission of the Center is to support the resilience and mental health of employees through educational offerings, outreach, and clinical care. Our aim was to build a mobile app to support the newly founded Center in its mission. METHODS: We built the app as a standalone digital platform that hosts a suite of tools that users can interact with on a daily basis. With consideration for the Center's aims, we determined the overall vision, initiatives, and goals for the Wellness Hub app, followed by specific milestone tasks and deliverables for development. We defined the app's primary features based on the mental health assessment and needs of HCWs. Feature definition was informed by the results of a resilience survey widely distributed to Mount Sinai HCWs and by the resources offered at CSRPG, including workshop content. RESULTS: We launched our app over the course of two phases, the first phase being a ""soft"" launch and the second being a broader launch to all of Mount Sinai. Of the 231 HCWs who downloaded the app, 173 (74.9%) completed our baseline assessment of all mental health screeners in the app. Results from the baseline assessment show that more than half of the users demonstrate a need for support in at least one psychological area. As of 3 months after the Phase 2 launch, approximately 55% of users re-entered the app after their first opening to explore additional features, with an average of 4 app openings per person. CONCLUSIONS: To address the mental health needs of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wellness Hub app was built and deployed throughout the Mount Sinai Health System. To our knowledge, this is the first resilience app of its kind. The Wellness Hub app is a promising proof of concept, with room to grow, for those who wish to build a secure mobile health app to support their employees, communities, or others in managing and improving mental and physical well-being. It is a novel tool offering mental health support broadly.","Golden, Eddye A; Zweig, Micol; Danieletto, Matteo; Landell, Kyle; Nadkarni, Girish; Bottinger, Erwin; Katz, Lindsay; Somarriba, Ricardo; Sharma, Vansh; Katz, Craig L; Marin, Deborah B; DePierro, Jonathan; Charney, Dennis S",JMIR Form Res,296,13

An appropriately tuned cationic pincer cobalt(I) complex featuring a central silylene donor reacts with CO2 to afford a bimetallic siloxane featuring two Co(II) centers with liberation of CO, and reaction with ethylene yields a similar bimetallic complex with an ethylene bridge. Experimental and computational studies suggest a plausible mechanism proceeding via [2+2]-cycloaddition to the silylene complex that is quite sensitive to steric environment.

METHODS: The sample comprised 3145 students from 43 universities in China who completed an online survey including PMT constructs as well as constructs added to PMT. The PMT constructs comprised motivation to have COVID-19 vaccination, threat appraisal, and coping appraisal. The extended PMT constructs comprised knowledge about mechanisms and information sources of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Perceived severity of COVID-19 was positively associated with motivation to have COVID-19 vaccination. Receiving information concerning COVID-19 vaccination from medical personnel was associated with greater self-efficacy, response efficacy, and knowledge, whereas receiving information concerning COVID-19 vaccination from coworkers/colleagues was associated with less response efficacy and knowledge. Receiving online information concerning COVID-19 vaccination was associated with greater response cost of vaccination efficacy and less knowledge.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the severity of the disease and the loss of smell and taste. In addition, we evaluated patients' smell and taste functions after recovery. METHODS: Between March and May 2020, 418 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were divided into 3 groups: home-quarantined, hospitalized, and intensive care patients. The disease, smell, and taste functions of patients were evaluated with visual analog scores before diagnosis of COVID-19, during the disease, and fourth week after recovery. The types of smell loss and types of taste flavor loss occurring during the disease were questioned. RESULTS: In all 3 groups, changes in smell and taste loss during the disease were statistically detected (Pâ=â0.001). The smell loss rates determined in groups 1 to 3 were 45%, 43.7%, and 31.2%, respectively. The taste loss rates determined in groups 1 to 3were 46.6%, 32.1%, and 31.2% respectively. The rate of patients with a total recovery of smell loss in groups 1 to 3 were 95.5%, 93.7%, and 100%, respectively (Pâ=â0.768). The rate of patients with a total recovery of taste loss in groups 1 to 3 were 97.1%, 91.4%, and 100%, respectively (Pâ=â0.423). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 causes significant loss of smell and taste in patients. The loss of smell and taste does not correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease. The loss of smell and taste improves at a high rate after the disease.","Bulgurcu, Suphi; Öztutgan, Turgut; Baz, Eyup; Yonem, Aysegül; Koç, Niyazi Günsu; Erkul, Evren; Çekin, Engin",J. craniofac. surg,296,29

The modifications introduced are designed to favour minimally invasive surgery. The positive results obtained with intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in the right colon and rectum prompt us to adapt these procedures to the left colon. We describe a 'don't touch the bowel' technique and outline the benefits to patients of the use of less surgically aggressive techniques and also to surgeons in terms of the lower emission of aerosols that might transmit the COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This was an observational study of intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in left colectomy. We describe the technical details of intracorporeal resection, end-to-end stapled anastomosis and extraction of the specimen through mini-laparotomy in the ideal location. RESULTS: We present preliminary results of 17 patients with left-sided colonic pathologies, 15 neoplasia and two diverticular disease, who underwent four left hemicolectomies, six sigmoidectomies and seven high anterior resections. Median operating time was 186 min (range 120-280). No patient required conversion to extracorporeal laparoscopy or open surgery. Median hospital stay was 4.7 days (range 3-12 days). There was one case of anastomotic leak managed with conservative treatment. CONCLUSION: Intracorporeal resection and end-to-end anastomosis with the possibility of extraction of the specimen by a mini-laparotomy in the ideal location may present benefits and also adapts well to the conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future comparative studies are needed to demonstrate these benefits with respect to extracorporeal anastomosis.","Serra-Aracil, Xavier; Mora-Lopez, Laura; Gomez-Torres, Irene; Pallisera-Lloveras, Anna; Serra-Pla, Sheila; Serracant, Anna; Garcia-Nalda, Albert; Pino-Perez, Oriol; Navarro-Soto, Salvador",Colorectal dis,296,20

We also aimed to investigate the moderating role of psychological resilience in this mediation. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of adults (18+ years old) was conducted using an online, multi-language, international survey between March 31 and May 15, 2020. Simple and moderated mediation analyses were performed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS, with perceived social isolation as an independent variable, change in perceived sleep quality (during vs. before the COVID-19 pandemic) as a dependent variable, depressed and anxious mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-4, PHQ-4) as a mediator, and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale, BRS) as a moderator. RESULTS: A convenience sample of 3816 participants (2692 = female) from 94 countries (47.4% USA) met criteria for inclusion in the analyses. Results showed that depressed and anxious mood mediated the relationship between perceived social isolation and change in perceived sleep quality. This mediation was moderated by resilience; the indirect effect of perceived social isolation on change in perceived sleep quality through depressed and anxious mood decreased as the level of resilience increased (index of moderated mediation = 0.008, SE = 0.003, 95%CI [0.001; 0.014]). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate benefits of psychological resilience in buffering negative effects of perceived isolation, suggesting potential benefits of developing targeted strategies to enhance resilience during times of significant crises.","Ben Salah, Arwa; DeAngelis, Briana N; al039,; Absi, Mustafa",Int. j. behav. med,296,24

This binding requires the RBD to undergo a conformational change from a closed to an open state. In the present study, a key pair of salt bridges formed by the side chains of K537 and E619, residues at the interfaces of SD1 and SD2, respectively, was identified to promote the opening of the RBD. Mutations of K537Q and E619D reduced their side chain lengths and eliminated this pair of salt bridges; as a result, the opening of the RBD was not observed in the MD simulations. Thus, blocking the formation of this pair of salt bridges is a promising approach for treating novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). FDA approved drug molecules were screened by their capabilities of blocking the formation of the key pair of salt bridges, achieved by their positional stabilities in the cavity containing the side chains of K537 and E619 formed in the interface between SD1 and SD2.

The key priority is to contain the epidemic and prevent the infection rate. In this context, many countries are now in some degree of lockdown to ensure extreme social distancing of entire population and hence slowing down the epidemic spread. Further, authorities use case quarantine strategy and manual second/third contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19 disease. However, manual contact tracing is time consuming and labor-intensive task which tremendously overload public health systems. In this paper, we developed a smartphone-based approach to automatically and widely trace the contacts for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Particularly, contact-tracing approach creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or officials of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach is not only providing awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID-19 carrier might not recall. Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for government officials on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the economic crisis. The dashboard used to predict the level of lockdown area based on collected positions and distance measurements of the registered users in the vicinity.

We aimed to describe the factors associated with COVID-19 deaths in the State of Tamil Nadu that has the highest COVID-19 case burden among the Indian states, and to compare deaths among COVID patients with and without comorbidities. METHODS: We analyzed the first 1000 COVID deaths (1 March to 26 June 2020) and 1000 recent deaths at the time of analysis (1-10 August 2020). We examined data on facility (public vs private), age, gender, duration of illness prior to and/or during hospitalizations, symptoms, comorbidities and cause of death. We used R statistical program to do the analysis. We compared deaths among patients with and without comorbidities using Wilcoxon rank sum test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: First, we found a shorter time interval from onset of symptoms to death in India than that was reported in the USA and China. Second, young adults without comorbidities had shorter survival from the time of onset of symptoms irrespective of their timing of hospitalization. Third, hypothyroidism is a COVID-19 associated co-morbidity. Longitudinal studies are needed to further assess the thyroid-COVID-19 link. CONCLUSION: As COVID-19 infection rates are accelerating rapidly in India, it is crucial to sensitize young adults while protecting the elderly and other vulnerable populations.","Koya, Shaffi F; Ebrahim, Shahul H; Bhat, Lekha D; Vijayan, Bindhya; Khan, Salman; Jose, Soji D; Pilakkadavath, Zarin; Rajeev, Premini; Azariah, Jinbert L",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),296,28

Infection is prevalent amongst the trauma population, but any effect of COVID-19 on trauma patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on a trauma population, hypothesizing increased mortality and pulmonary complications for COVID-19-positive (COVID) trauma patients compared to propensity-matched COVID-19-negative (non-COVID) patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of trauma patients presenting to 11 Level-I and II trauma centers in California between 1/1/2019-6/30/2019 and 1/1/2020-6/30/2020 was performed. A 1:2 propensity score model was used to match COVID to non-COVID trauma patients using age, blunt/penetrating mechanism, injury severity score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate. Outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 20,448 trauma patients were identified during the study period. 53 COVID trauma patients were matched with 106 non-COVID trauma patients. COVID patients had higher rates of mortality (9.4% vs 1.9%, p = 0.029) and pneumonia (7.5% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.011), as well as a longer mean length of stay (LOS) (7.47 vs 3.28 days, p < 0.001) and intensive care unit LOS (1.40 vs 0.80 days, p = 0.008), compared to non-COVID patients. CONCLUSION: This multicenter retrospective study found increased rates of mortality and pneumonia, as well as a longer LOS, for COVID trauma patients compared to a propensity-matched cohort of non-COVID patients. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and to elucidate the underlying pathways responsible for higher mortality in COVID trauma patients.","Yeates, Eric O; Grigorian, Areg; Schellenberg, Morgan; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Barmparas, Galinos; Margulies, Daniel; Juillard, Catherine; Garber, Kent; Cryer, Henry; Tillou, Areti; Burruss, Sigrid; Figueras, Ryan Arthur; Mladenov, Georgi; Brenner, Megan; Firek, Christopher; Costantini, Todd; Santorelli, Jarrett; Curry, Terry; Wintz, Diane; Biffl, Walter L; Schaffer, Kathryn B; Duncan, Thomas K; Barbaro, Casey; Diaz, Graal; Johnson, Arianne; Chinn, Justine; Naaseh, Ariana; Leung, Amanda; Grabar, Christina; Nahmias, Jeffry",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,296,10

METHODS: A 29-question anonymous online survey was sent by e-mail to members of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and the Italian Breast Cancer Study Group on April 3, 2020. Only medical oncologists (both those in training and specialists) were invited to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS: Out of 165 responding oncologists, 121 (73.3.%) worked in breast units. In the (neo)adjuvant setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted weekly paclitaxel (68.5% v 93.9%) and a dose-dense schedule for anthracycline-based chemotherapy (43% v 58.8%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the metastatic setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted first-line weekly paclitaxel for HER2-positive disease (41.8% v 53.9%) or CDK4/6 inhibitors for luminal tumors with less-aggressive characteristics (55.8% v 80.0%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. A significant change was also observed in delaying the timing for monitoring therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors, assessing treatment response with imaging tests, and flushing central venous devices.

Influenza vaccine uptake has remained low in most countries, including Switzerland. The aim of the study was to determine parents&rsquo; intentions towards influenza vaccination of their children, as well as themselves, and to assess regional differences. METHODS: Parents presenting to four paediatric emergency departments (Zurich, Bern, Bellinzona, Geneva) were asked to complete an online survey during and after the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to June 2020). The anonymised survey included demographic information, vaccination history and intentions to vaccinate against influenza, as well as attitudes towards future vaccination against COVID-19. RESULTS: The majority of children (92%; 602/654) were up-to-date on their vaccination schedule. In 2019/2020, 7.2% (47/654) were vaccinated against influenza. Children with chronic illnesses were more frequently vaccinated than healthy children (19.2% vs 5.6%; p = 0.002). For the coming winter season, 111 (17%) parents stated they plan to vaccinate their children against influenza, more than double the rate from last year, and 383 (59.2%) parents suggested they will vaccinate against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available. Regional differences between &ldquo;German&rdquo; and &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; Switzerland were found for parents&rsquo; intent to have their children vaccinated against influenza next season (Zurich and Bern 14.3%, Bellinzona and Geneva 27.2%, p &lt;0.001), but not for a hypothetical vaccination against COVID-19 (Zurich and Bern 59.1%, Bellinzona and Geneva 59.7%, p = 0.894). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial increase of parents&rsquo; intention to vaccinate their children against influenza, especially in hard-hit &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; Switzerland. The Swiss government and public health organisations can leverage these regional results to promote influenza vaccination among children for the coming seasons.","Seiler, Michelle; Goldman, Ran D; Staubli, Georg; Hoeffe, Julia; Gualco, Gianluca; Manzano, Sergio",Swiss Med Wkly,296,21

Thus, the development of new therapeutic approaches is urgently needed, and one alternative is to target the mechanisms of autophagy. Due to its multifaceted role in physiological processes, many questions remain unanswered about the possible advantages of inhibiting or activating autophagy. Based on a search of the literature in this field, a novel analysis has been made to highlight the relation between the mechanisms of autophagy in antiviral and inflammatory activity in contrast with those of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. The present analysis reveals a remarkable coincidence between the uncontrolled inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and autophagy defects. Particularly, there is conclusive evidence about the substantial contribution of two concomitant factors to the development of severe COVID-19: a delayed or absent type I and III interferon (IFN-I and IFN-III) response together with robust cytokine and chemokine production. In addition, a negative interplay exists between autophagy and an IFN-I response. According to previous studies, the clinical decision to inhibit or activate autophagy should depend on the underlying context of the pathological timeline of COVID-19. Several treatment options are herein discussed as a guide for future research on this topic.","García-Pérez, Blanca Estela; González-Rojas, Juan Antonio; Salazar, Ma Isabel; Torres-Torres, Carlos; Castrejón-Jiménez, Nayeli Shantal",,296,15

However, the evidence revealing the crisis is often anecdotal or limited in scope. In this unprecedented longitudinal research, we draw on data from the Australian journalism jobs market from January 2012 until March 2020. Using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques, we analyse two distinct data sets: job advertisements (ads) data comprising 3,698 journalist job ads from a corpus of over 6.7 million Australian job ads; and official employment data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Having matched and analysed both sources, we address both the demand for and supply of journalists in Australia over this critical period. The data show that the crisis is real, but there are also surprises. Counter-intuitively, the number of journalism job ads in Australia rose from 2012 until 2016, before falling into decline. Less surprisingly, for the entire period studied the figures reveal extreme volatility, characterised by large and erratic fluctuations. The data also clearly show that COVID-19 has significantly worsened the crisis. We can also tease out more granular findings, including: that there are now more women than men journalists in Australia, but that gender inequity is worsening, with women journalists getting younger and worse-paid just as men journalists are, on average, getting older and better-paid; that, despite the crisis besetting the industry, the demand for journalism skills has increased; and that the skills sought by journalism job ads increasingly include social media and generalist communications.","Dawson, Nik; Molitorisz, Sacha; Rizoiu, Marian-Andrei; Fray, Peter",,296,18

[...]choices are not purely objective and value-free;rather, they reflect one's view of the world and judgments about what sources of variation in health status are permissible.

Because the analysis and interpretation of surveillance data have real consequences for the subsequent implementation of public health interventions, it is critical that analyses be grounded in an antiracist approach that acknowledges the role of social and historical forces in shaping the distribution of disease.","Noppert, Grace A.

This study aimed to investigate the main challenges experienced by therapists during the transition from in-person to online therapy at the beginning of the pandemic and 3 months later, and the association between these challenges and therapists’ perception of the quality of the relationship with their online patients, and therapists’ attitudes and views about online therapy and its efficacy at these two timepoints. As part of a large-scale international longitudinal survey, we collected data from 1,257 therapists at two timepoints: at the start of COVID-19, when many therapists switched from providing in-person therapy to online therapy, as well as 3 months later, when they had had the opportunity to adjust to the online therapy format. At both timepoints, therapists reported on perceived challenges, quality of working alliance and real relationship, attitudes toward online therapy, and their views on online therapy’s efficacy compared to in-person therapy. Factor analysis of individual survey items at both timepoints identified four different types of challenges among this therapist sample: Emotional connection (feeling connected with patients, reading emotions, express or feel empathy), Distraction during sessions (therapist or patient), Patients’ privacy (private space, confidentiality), and Therapists’ boundaries (professional space, boundary setting). Older and more experienced therapists perceived fewer challenges in their online sessions. At baseline, all four types of challenges were associated with lower perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship (working alliance and real relationship), and more negative attitudes toward online therapy and its efficacy. After 3 months, perceived challenges with three domains – Emotional connection, Patients’ privacy, and Therapists’ boundaries significantly decreased – whereas challenges in the fourth domain – Distraction – increased. In our study, therapists’ concerns about being able to connect with patients online appeared to be the most impactful, in that it predicted negative attitudes toward online therapy and its perceived efficacy 3 months later, above and beyond the effect of therapists’ age and clinical experience. Clinical and training implications are discussed.","Békés, Vera; Aafjes-van Doorn, Katie; Luo, Xiaochen; Prout, Tracy A.; Hoffman, Leon",Front Psychol,296,16

In addition to HIV burden, the African continent has also a high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and has been experiencing recurring outbreaks of several other viral, bacterial, and parasitic epidemic diseases. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2 or Covid-19) pandemic outbreak is adding to the continent’s infectious diseases burden as experts are predicting that it will be here for a long time. One of the consequences of these infectious diseases is that antiviral and antibiotic compounds have become some of the most consumed pharmaceuticals on the continent. Many of these drugs have been frequently detected in surface waters across Africa. There is limited information available on the adverse effects of the mixtures of different types of pharmaceuticals in African aquatic environments on fish reproduction. The present study investigated the effects of the ARV drug nevirapine (NVP - 1.48 and 3.74 μg/L) and its mixture with the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (3.68 μg/L) and trimethoprim (0.87 μg/L) on O. mossambicus gonads using histopathological endpoints as biomarkers. The fish (n = 52) were exposed for 30 days in a static renewal system. Female O. mossambicus exposed to nevirapine (3.74 μg/L) and to NVP – antibiotic mixture recorded higher ovary indices. Statistically significant differences were found in female ovary indices between the fish exposed to NVP (3.74 μg/L) and the control fish (p = 0.002) as well as between the fish exposed to the NVP - antibiotic mixture and the control fish (p = 0.009). The main observed histopathological changes in the ovaries were increased vitellogenic oocyte atresia and vacuolation of the interstitial tissue in the fish exposed to NVP - antibiotic mixture. It is evident that the presence of NVP - antibiotics mixture in water triggered the observed histopathology in female fish ovaries. The detected abnormal high rate of atretic oocytes could result in impaired fish reproduction.","Nibamureke, U.M.C.; Wagenaar, G.M.",Chemosphere,296,16

We describe a successful initial experience implementing a virtual elective in interventional radiology (IR) and provide the course framework, student feedback, and potential improvements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A two-week virtual IR elective curriculum was created utilizing a combination of synchronous and asynchronous learning and the “flipped” classroom educational model. Students virtually participated in daily IR resident education conferences, resident-led case review sessions, and dedicated lectures. Asynchronous pre-learning material consisted of text and video correlating to lecture topics. Anonymous pre-course and post-course surveys were sent to all participating students (n=10). RESULTS: Ten students (100%) completed pre-course and seven (70%) completed post-course surveys. Enrolled students were considering residencies in surgery (50%), internal medicine (40%), interventional radiology (30%), and/or diagnostic radiology (30%). Students’ understanding of what IRs do and the procedures they perform (p<0.001), when to consult IR for assistance in patient management (p=0.005), and the number of IR procedures students could recall (p=0.015) improved after the course.

Objective: To identify the predictors associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Relevant articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched and extracted as of April 5, 2020. Data of interest were collected and evaluated for their compatibility for the meta-analysis. Cumulative calculations to determine the correlation and effect estimates were performed using the Z test. Results: In total, 19 papers recording 1,934 mild and 1,644 severe cases of COVID-19 were included. Based on the initial evaluation, 62 potential risk factors were identified for the meta-analysis. Several comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were observed more frequent among patients with severe COVID-19 than with the mild ones. Compared to the mild form, severe COVID-19 was associated with symptoms such as dyspnea, anorexia, fatigue, increased respiratory rate, and high systolic blood pressure. Lower levels of lymphocytes and hemoglobin; elevated levels of leukocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, high-sensitivity troponin, creatine kinase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin; and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also associated with severe COVID-19. Conclusion: More than 30 risk factors are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19. These may serve as useful baseline parameters in the development of prediction tools for COVID-19 prognosis.","Mudatsir, Mudatsir; Fajar, Jonny Karunia; Wulandari, Laksmi; Soegiarto, Gatot; Ilmawan, Muhammad; Purnamasari, Yeni; Mahdi, Bagus Aulia; Jayanto, Galih Dwi; Suhendra, Suhendra; Setianingsih, Yennie Ayu; Hamdani, Romi; Suseno, Daniel Alexander; Agustina, Kartika; Naim, Hamdan Yuwafi; Muchlas, Muchamad; Alluza, Hamid Hunaif Dhofi; Rosida, Nikma Alfi; Mayasari, Mayasari; Mustofa, Mustofa; Hartono, Adam; Aditya, Richi; Prastiwi, Firman; Meku, Fransiskus Xaverius; Sitio, Monika; Azmy, Abdullah; Santoso, Anita Surya; Nugroho, Radhitio Adi; Gersom, Camoya; Rabaan, Ali A.; Masyeni, Sri; Nainu, Firzan; Wagner, Abram L.; Dhama, Kuldeep; Harapan, Harapan",F1000Res,296,5

To inform the adaptation of a National Cancer Institute’s evidence-based cancer control program, HPV Vaccine Decision Narratives, and because of the rapidly changing information concerning consumption patterns of young adults, we elicited preferences and characteristics associated with women’s interest in various health information sources, specifically for HPV vaccination. We conducted 50 interviews with young Latina and Vietnamese women at two Planned Parenthood health centers in Southern California. Interview questions were guided by the Channel Complementarity Theory and focused on understanding the multiple communication channels women turn to for health, and the characteristics that motivate their use. Our results showed that Latina and Vietnamese women turn to many sources, from online and social media to school health classes, mothers, and doctors. Specific characteristics that motivate women’s online use of health information included immediacy and access, convenience and credibility. When receiving HPV vaccine information, privacy, avoiding information overload, interpersonal engagement, and receiving health information from trusted sources was important. Our study advances the prevention literature by elevating the role of platform delivery considerations and emphasizing preferences to effectively reach Latina and Vietnamese women, who are disproportionately burdened by HPV cancers and are less aware of HPV vaccine prevention. These results can be used to further inform the dissemination of this cancer control program. Adaptation of the program should include changes to its delivery, such that trusted sources are used, and dissemination is coordinated to send a consistent message across multiple communication methods.","Hopfer, Suellen; Duong, Huong T.; Garcia, Samantha; Tanjasiri, Sora P.",J Prim Prev,296,10

In this context, it could be useful to understand issues that people find most concerning and ways in which they cope with stress. In this study, we explored these questions with a sample of graduate and professional students. METHOD: Using open-ended assessments, we asked participants (n = 305) to identify their biggest challenge or concern (“top problem”), their most effective way of handling stress (“effective strategy”), and their most common way of handling stress (“common strategy”). We applied thematic analysis and evaluated whether participants’ strategies corresponded with evidence-based practices (EBPs). RESULTS: Participants frequently reported top problems relating to productivity (27% of sample), physical health (26%), and emotional health (14%). Distraction was the most frequently classified common strategy (43%), whereas behavioral activation was the most frequently identified effective strategy (50%). Participants who reported a common strategy classified as an EBP reported lower depressive and anxiety symptoms. In contrast, there was no evidence of an association between symptom levels and whether or not participants’ effective strategy was an EBP. Participants who reported the same strategy as both their common and effective strategy (29%) reported lower depressive symptoms than those whose common and effective strategies were different. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight stressors that students are experiencing and ways they are coping during the COVID-19 crisis. We discuss how these findings can inform mental health promotion efforts and future research on coping with stressors.","Wasil, Akash R.; Franzen, Rose E.; Gillespie, Sarah; Steinberg, Joshua S.; Malhotra, Tanvi; DeRubeis, Robert J.",Front Psychol,296,1

Holstein heifers (n = 1,811) derived from artificial insemination were categorized as (1) daughters of primiparous cows that, consequently, were nonlactating heifers during gestation (Prim-NoL; n = 787); (2) daughters of multiparous cows that did not have any clinical diseases in the previous lactation (Mult-NoCD; n = 638); and (3) daughters of multiparous cows that had at least one clinical disease in the previous lactation (Mult-CD; n = 386). Clinical diseases of the multiparous dams included retained placenta, metritis, mastitis, lameness, and digestive and respiratory problems. Data collected for evaluation of daughters included genotypic and phenotypic characteristics at birth, morbidity, reproductive performance, and culling from birth through 305 d in milk of first lactation. Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate the effect of the parity of the dam (Prim-NoL vs. Mult-NoCD + Mult-CD) and the effect of clinical disease occurrence in the previous lactation among multiparous dams (Mult-NoCD vs. Mult-CD). Compared with daughters of multiparous cows, daughters of Prim-NoL were lighter at birth (36 vs. 41 kg), had greater genetic merit for production traits (e.g., genomic estimated breeding value for milk yield: 875 vs. 746 kg), were less likely to leave the herd (17 vs. 28%) and to lose pregnancy as a heifer (9 vs. 14%), calved earlier (703 vs. 711 d old), were less likely to have clinical diseases as a first lactation cow (30 vs. 37%), and had reduced performance in the first lactation when considering their genetic merit (e.g., 305-d yield of energy-corrected milk: 11,270 vs. 11,539 kg). Compared with daughters of Mult-NoCD, daughters of Mult-CD were less likely to have digestive problems as a heifer (17 vs. 27%) and clinical disease as a first lactation cow (32 vs. 42%), but were also more likely to leave the herd as a heifer (32 vs. 25%) even though genetic merit for production traits were similar (e.g., genomic estimated breeding value for milk: 744 vs. 749 kg). In conclusion, both parity and health status of the dam in the previous lactation were associated with morbidity, survival, and performance of their daughters from birth through 305 d in milk of the first lactation and might represent factors affecting developmental programming of dairy heifers in utero.","Carvalho, M.R.; Aboujaoude, C.; Peñagaricano, F.; Santos, J.E.P.; DeVries, T.J.; McBride, B.W.; Ribeiro, E.S.",J Dairy Sci,296,1

Along with social distancing (SD) measures, contact tracing comprising find, track, trace and isolate (FTTI) policies are also being implemented. Here, we investigate FTTI policies in terms of their impact on the endemic equilibrium. We used a generative model, the dynamic causal 'Location', 'Infection', 'Symptom' and 'Testing' (LIST) model to identify testing, tracing, and quarantine requirements. We optimised LIST model parameters based on time series of daily reported cases and deaths of COVID-19 in England and based upon reported cases in the nine regions of England and in all 150 upper tier local authorities. Using these optimised parameters, we forecasted infection rates and the impact of FTTI for each area; national, regional, and local. Predicting data from early June 2020, we find that under conditions of medium-term immunity, a '40%' FTTI policy (or greater), could reach a distinct endemic equilibrium that produces a significantly lower death rate and a decrease in ICU occupancy. Considering regions of England in isolation, some regions could substantially reduce death rates with 20% efficacy. We characterise the accompanying endemic equilibria in terms of dynamical stability, observing bifurcation patterns whereby relatively small increases in FTTI efficacy result in stable states with reduced overall morbidity and mortality. These analyses suggest that FTTI will not only save lives, even if only partially effective, and could underwrite the stability of any endemic steady-state we manage to attain.","Moran, R.

This meta-analysis using individual patient data was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of anakinra treatment in patients with COVID-19. Methods Based on a pre-specified protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42020221491), a systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane, medRxiv.org, bioRxiv.org and clinicaltrials.gov databases for trials in COVID-19 comparing administration of anakinra with standard-of-care and/or placebo. Individual patient data from eligible trials were requested. The primary endpoint was the mortality rate and the secondary endpoint was safety. Findings Literature search yielded 209 articles, of which 178 articles fulfilled screening criteria and were full-text assessed. Aggregate data on 1185 patients from 9 studies were analyzed and individual patient data on 895 patients from 6 studies were collected. Most studies used historical controls. Mortality was significantly lower in anakinra-treated patients (38/342 [11.1%]) as compared with 137/553 (24.8%) observed in patients receiving standard-of-care and/or placebo on top of standard-of-care (137/553 [24.8%]); adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.51; p <0.001.

Although at lower risk for severe disease, some young adults experience serious illness, and asymptomatic or mild cases can result in sequelae such as myocardial inflammation (5). In the United States, approximately 45% of persons aged 18-22 years were enrolled in colleges and universities in 2019 (6). As these institutions reopen, opportunities for infection increase; therefore, mitigation efforts and monitoring reports of COVID-19 cases among young adults are important. During August 2-September 5, weekly incidence of COVID-19 among persons aged 18-22 years rose by 55.1% nationally; across U.S. Census regions,* increases were greatest in the Northeast, where incidence increased 144.0%, and Midwest, where incidence increased 123.4%.

The effects of different intervention strategies such as front door screening, quarantine unit for newly admitted patients, early testing of suspected infected people, and personal protective equipment for both medical staff and visitors were evaluated. The model suggested that the early testing (within eight hours) of infected cases and monitoring the quarantine ward for newly hospitalized patients are effective measures for decreasing the incidence of COVID-19 within a hospital (81.3% and 70% decrease of number of incident cases, respectively, during 60 days). Front door screening for detecting suspected cases had only 42% effectiveness. Screening for prohibiting the admission of COVID-19 patients was more effective than the measures for patients before emergency room or outpatient clinic.

They are perceived as the opinion leaders within their communities; therefore, their health-related beliefs and attitudes are deemed important for public health campaigns. This study aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy drivers among university students in the Czech Republic. Methods: a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out in the weeks before the unrestricted vaccine deployment to Czech adults. The questionnaire had 21 multiple-choice items stratified in 4 categories; demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related anamnesis and influenza vaccine experience, attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination, and the possible drivers of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy suggested by the WHO-SAGE. Results: out of the 1351 included students, 66.8% were females, 84.5% were Czech nationals, and 40.6% enrolled in healthcare programs. The overall COVID-19 vaccine acceptance level was 73.3%, 19.3% of participants were vaccine-resistant, and only 7.4% were vaccine-hesitant. Trust in the pharmaceutical industry, trust in healthcare providers, and perceived knowledge sufficiency predicted higher odds of vaccine acceptance. In contrast, media and social media, personal beliefs, immunity misconception, previous COVID-19 infection, and suspicions about novel vaccines and the local availability predicted higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: The findings of this study predict a fair probability to achieve community immunity (herd immunity) among the target population group. The primary prevention strategies in the Czech Republic need to be culturally sensitive and inclusive for foreign nationals.

Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) have been re-occurring every year since the first onset in 2013 with substantial losses across the hog production supply chain. Interestingly, a decreasing trend in PEDv incidence is visible. We assert that changes in human behaviors may underlie this trend. Disease prevention using biosecurity practices is used to minimize risk of infection but its efficacy is conditional on human behavior and risk attitude. Standard epidemiological models bring important insights into disease dynamics but have limited predictive ability. Since research shows that human behavior plays a driving role in the disease spread process, the explicit inclusion of human behavior into models adds an important dimension to understanding disease spread. Here we analyze PEDv incidence emerging from an agent-based model (ABM) that uses both epidemiological dynamics and algorithms that incorporate heterogeneous human decisions. We investigate the effects of shifting fractions of hog producers between risk tolerant and risk averse positions. These shifts affect the dynamics describing willingness to increase biosecurity as a response to disease threats and, indirectly, change infection probabilities and the resultant intensity and impact of the disease outbreak. Our ABM generates empirically verifiable patterns of PEDv transmission. Scenario results show that relatively small shifts (10% of the producer agents) toward a risk averse position can lead to a significant decrease in total incidence. For significantly steeper decreases in disease incidence, the model's hog producer population needed at least 37.5% of risk averse. Our study provides insight into the link between risk attitude, decisions related to biosecurity, and consequent spread of disease within a livestock production system. We suggest that it is possible to create positive, lasting changes in animal health by nudging the population of livestock producers toward more risk averse behaviors. We make a case for integrating social and epidemiological aspects in disease spread models to test intervention strategies intended to improve biosecurity and animal health at the system scale.","Bucini, Gabriela; Merrill, Scott C.; Clark, Eric; Moegenburg, Susan M.; Zia, Asim; Koliba, Christopher J.; Wiltshire, Serge; Trinity, Luke; Smith, Julia M.",Front Vet Sci,296,20

Recovery from acute respiratory failure (ARF) is usually determined by normalized arterial blood gases (ABGs), but the prevalence of persistent exercise-induced desaturation (EID) and dyspnea is still unknown. METHODS: We investigated the prevalence of EID in 70 patients with normal arterial oxygen at rest after recovery from ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients underwent a 6-min walking test (6MWT) before discharge from hospital. We recorded dyspnea score and heart rate during 6MWT. We also investigated the possible role of lung ultrasound (LU) in predicting EID. Patients underwent a LU scan and scores for each explored area were summed to give a total LU score. RESULTS: In 30 patients (43%), oxygen desaturation was >4% during 6MWT. These patients had significantly higher dyspnea and heart rate compared to non-desaturators. LU score >8.5 was significantly able to discriminate patients with EID. CONCLUSION: In SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, ABGs at discharge cannot predict the persistence of EID, which is frequent.

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing and miRNA inhibitors to screen possible miRNAs that can inhibit PRRSV infection on its target cell, porcine alveolar macrophages. We observed that miR-218 was downregulated upon virus infection, and knockdown of miR-218 significantly enhanced PRRSV replication. Overexpression of miR-218 resulted in a decrease in PRRSV replication, and this overexpression did not alter viral genomic RNA levels, but rather increased antiviral interferon signaling. Further analysis revealed that miR-218 regulated PRRSV replication by directly targeting porcine suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a JAK2 kinase inhibitor. Knockdown of the endogenous SOCS3 expression led to augmentation of type I interferon genes and resulted in decreased PRRSV replication, and vice versa. During PRRSV infection in vivo and in vitro, cellular miR-218 expression was downregulated and SOCS3 expression was upregulated, further supporting the inverse correlation between miR-218 and SOCS3 expression. The data on SOCS3 depletion in combination with miR-218 inhibition suggested that the antiviral activity of miR-218 required the SOCS3-mediated signaling pathway. Similarly, miR-218 negatively regulated PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, as well as the replication of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus in Vero and ST cells respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PRRSV-induced miR-218 downregulation serves to inhibit the type I interferon response and may provide a novel therapeutic target for treatment of PRRSV and other viral infections.","Zhang, Lin; Zhang, Lu; Pan, Yu; Gao, Junxin; Xu, Yunfei; Li, Xi; Tian, Zhijun; Chen, Hongyan; Wang, Yue",J Biol Chem,296,16

A genome sequence is the core of this virus which interferes with the normal activities of its counterparts within humans. Analysis of its genome may provide clues toward the proper treatment of patients and the design of new drugs and vaccines. Microsatellites are composed of short genome subsequences which are successively repeated many times in the same direction. They are highly variable in terms of their building blocks, number of repeats, and their locations in the genome sequences. This mutability property has been the source of many diseases. Usually the host genome is analyzed to diagnose possible diseases in the victim. In this research, the focus is concentrated on the attacker's genome for discovery of its malicious properties. RESULTS: The focus of this research is the microsatellites of both SARS and Covid-19. An accurate and highly efficient computer method for identifying all microsatellites in the genome sequences is discovered and implemented, and it is used to find all microsatellites in the Coronavirus-Covid-19 and SARS2003. The Microsatellite discovery is based on an efficient indexing technique called K-Mer Hash Indexing. The method is called Fast Microsatellite Discovery (FMSD) and it is used for both SARS and Covid-19. A table composed of all microsatellites is reported. There are many differences between SARS and Covid-19, but there is an outstanding difference which requires further investigation.

Methods: Patients followed in a single rheumatology department in France or registered on the Spondy+ platform, a secure e-health platform for spondyloarthritis patients, were invited to complete a questionnaire focused on their experiences around COVID19 symptoms, testing and medications access during the lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to report questionnaire’s results. Factors associated with COVID-19 or with treatment discontinuation were assessed by logistic regression. Results: We obtained 655 answers from the 2,081 contacted patients: 474 with spondyloarthritis, 129 with rheumatoid arthritis and 52 with psoriatic arthritis. The population was predominantly female (61.8%) with a mean age of 51.0 ± 13.4 years. Incidence of COVID-19 was 6.9% (95%CI: 5.1-9.2%)), including 12 confirmed and 33 highly-suspicious cases. No death was observed and five patients needed to be hospitalized. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of infection were SARS-CoV-2 exposure, younger age and non-smoking. More than 30% of the patients suspended or decreased the dosage of one of their drugs during the lockdown period. This was followed in 63.4% of them by increased disease activity. Modifications were mostly motivated by fear of contagion (79.3%). Conclusion: We did not observe any increase of incidence or severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering of the 3 most common CIRDs. This survey also adds evidence of the safety of anti-rheumatic drugs use regarding COVID-19.","Costantino, Félicie; Bahier, Léa; Tarancón, Luis Coronel; Leboime, Ariane; Vidal, François; Bessalah, Lamouri; Breban, Maxime; D’Agostino, Maria-Antonietta",Joint Bone Spine,296,1

In the present study, we aimed to identify novel protein receptor targets for TCDD using computational and in vitro validation experiments. Interestingly, results from computational methods predicted that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 (VEGFR1) could be one of the potential targets for TCDD in both mouse and humans. Results from molecular docking studies showed that human VEGFR1 (hVEGFR1) has less affinity towards TCDD compared to the mouse VEGFR1 (mVEGFR1). In vitro validation results showed that TCDD can bind and phosphorylate hVEGFR1. Further, results from molecular dynamic simulation studies showed that hVEGFR1 interaction with TCDD is stable throughout the simulation time. Overall, the present study has identified VEGFR1 as a novel target for TCDD, which provides the basis for further elucidating the role of TCDD in angiogenesis.","Chitrala, Kumaraswamy Naidu; Yang, Xiaoming; Busbee, Brandon; Singh, Narendra P.; Bonati, Laura; Xing, Yongna; Nagarkatti, Prakash; Nagarkatti, Mitzi",Sci Rep,296,16

We investigated their impacts on the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country and response performance measures. METHODS: We did a descriptive epidemiological study of all laboratory-confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and all patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New Zealand from Feb 2 to May 13, 2020, after which time community transmission ceased. We extracted data from the national notifiable diseases database and the national SARS-CoV-2 test results repository. Demographic features and disease outcomes, transmission patterns (source of infection, outbreaks, household transmission), time-to-event intervals, and testing coverage were described over five phases of the response, capturing different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Risk factors for severe outcomes (hospitalisation or death) were examined with multivariable logistic regression and time-to-event intervals were analysed by fitting parametric distributions using maximum likelihood estimation. FINDINGS: 1503 cases were detected over the study period, including 95 (6·3%) hospital admissions and 22 (1·5%) COVID-19 deaths. The estimated case infection rate per million people per day peaked at 8·5 (95% CI 7·6–9·4) during the 10-day period of rapid response escalation, declining to 3·2 (2·8–3·7) in the start of lockdown and progressively thereafter. 1034 (69%) cases were imported or import related, tending to be younger adults, of European ethnicity, and of higher socioeconomic status. 702 (47%) cases were linked to 34 outbreaks. Severe outcomes were associated with locally acquired infection (crude odds ratio [OR] 2·32 [95% CI 1·40–3·82] compared with imported), older age (adjusted OR ranging from 2·72 [1·40–5·30] for 50–64 year olds to 8·25 [2·59–26·31] for people aged ≥80 years compared with 20–34 year olds), aged residential care residency (adjusted OR 3·86 [1·59–9·35]), and Pacific peoples (adjusted OR 2·76 [1·14–6·68]) and Asian (2·15 [1·10–4·20]) ethnicities relative to European or other. Times from illness onset to notification and isolation progressively decreased and testing increased over the study period, with few disparities and increasing coverage of females, Māori, Pacific peoples, and lower socioeconomic groups. INTERPRETATION: New Zealand's response resulted in low relative burden of disease, low levels of population disease disparities, and the initial achievement of COVID-19 elimination.

METHODS: This paper uses data from a national sample of 728 gay and bisexual men collected from April 10 to May 10, 2020, to examine changes to sexual behavior in response to the first wave of the pandemic in the USA. We also assess whether behavior modifications are associated with exposure to statewide public health measures, including Stay-at-Home orders. RESULTS: Sexual minority men report significant changes to their sexual behavior and partner selection during the first wave. Nine out of 10 men reported having either one sexual partner or no sexual partner in the last 30 days at the time of interview, a decrease compared to just before the pandemic for nearly half of men surveyed. Reporting no sexual partners in the last 30 days was significantly predicted by increased exposure to a Stay-at-Home order. Sexual minority men also reduced interactions with casual partners, increased no-contact sexual behaviors (e.g., masturbation and virtual sex), and engaged in new strategies to reduce their risks of infection from partners. HIV-positive men were particularly likely to adopt strategies including avoiding casual partners and avoiding public transportation to meet sexual partners. CONCLUSION: Sexual minority men’s behavior changes during the first wave may have reduced the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their communities. Despite substantial changes in sexual behavior for most men in our sample during the initial first wave, we identify some concerns around the sustainability of certain behavioral changes over time and nondisclosure of COVID-19 symptoms to partners.","McKay, Tara; Henne, Jeff; Gonzales, Gilbert; Gavulic, Kyle A.; Quarles, Rebecca; Gallegos, Sergio Garcia",Sex Res Social Policy,296,24

During five months, an amount of 14,588 scientific publications about nCoV-2 and COVID-19 has been generated intensively (as indexed in Scopus on 31 May 2020). Such a knowledge outburst has created ample interest in understanding the research landscape of this newly configured area. This paper demonstrates on scientometric dimensions of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) research using quantifiable characteristics of the publication dataset. Findings reveal that the rate of publication growth (1600%) is very significant to a synergic response of the researchers to combat with the most extended sequence of an RNA virus. Indeed their response has geared up to an average of 100 articles per day. Many scholarly publishers have disclosed their preprint servers to make the publications available immediately, even by enabling Open Access. The scientific contents have published in more than 500 journals from 240 academic publishers. While the top-ten publishers occupied almost 70% of the articles, then about 25% of the studies were sponsored by 300 funding agencies. Among the notable journals Lancet, Nature, BMJ, JAMA, JMV, and NEJM are prominent. Findings also reveal that majority of the contributions have occurred in Medical Science, focusing on virology, immunology, epidemiology, pharmacology, public health, critical care, and emergency medicine. However, the closely associated terms are virus transmission, infection control, asymptomatic, quarantine, pneumonia, human, disease severity, clinical trials, viral pathogenesis, pandemic, risk, and mortality. The study suggests that academic hubs are located mostly in the USA, China, Italy, and the UK. Among the productive institutions; Huazhong Univ (China), Tongji Med. College (China), Harvard Med.

Hence, this study was undertaken to analyse factors impacting the choice of specialization and what impact does presence of role models as an intervention have on the attitudes of these young women on their overall career choice decisions. PURPOSE: This qualitative study was undertaken with the aim of understanding and analyzing the impact of role models on the overall shift in attitude of young women graduate students towards oral and maxillofacial surgery as a specialty. METHODS: Eleven women maxillofacial faculties from all over the country participated in this study conducted during the 2020 Pandemic. In this study, through the online teaching programme, the influence of women teaching faculties in the form of role models was statistically analysed on 103 attendees out of 140 who answered the survey questionnaire. The sessions were conducted on Zoom platform in the form of lectures of graduate course topics as defined by Dental Council of India. The overall attitudinal shift was then statistically analysed through Chi-square test. RESULT: Out of 140 students, 103 students responded to the survey questionnaire. Responses of these students were statistically analysed with Chi-square test. The p value <.05 confirmed the hypothesis that presence of role models does have an impact on the choice of specialization. CONCLUSION: The sample size of this was small and the period of follow-up was short, four months. In order to validate these results, larger cohort and longitudinal studies of long follow-up are needed.

To achieve this, 560 students of the Pedagogy degree were evaluated with two questionnaires: a questionnaire of satisfaction with the educational infrastructure and the teaching–learning process and a questionnaire on study techniques. Statistically significant differences were obtained, especially depending on the type of institution and the academic year. The students of private schools and earlier academic years were the ones who obtained the most satisfaction with the study techniques and with the infrastructure. Those from private centers also expressed more satisfaction with the teaching–learning processes. These results provide greater knowledge about the processes of self-regulation and external regulation of university learning and of their satisfaction with them, which can contribute to improving educational policies in Brazil.","Herrera Torres, Lucía; Souza-Soares de Quadros, Mara Rachel; Sánchez-Sánchez, Laura C.; Ramiro-Sánchez, Tamara",Int J Environ Res Public Health,296,1

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to gamma-coronaviruses and causes a costly respiratory viral disease in chickens. The role of wild birds in the epidemiology of IBV is poorly understood. In the present study, we examined 1,002 cloacal and faecal samples collected from 26 wild bird species in the Beringia area for the presence of CoVs, and then we performed statistical and phylogenetic analyses. We detected diverse CoVs by RT-PCR in wild birds in the Beringia area. Sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to IBV. These findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically. We concluded that CoVs are widespread among wild birds in Beringia, and their geographic spread and frequency is higher than previously realised. Thus, Avian CoV can be efficiently disseminated over large distances and could be a genetic reservoir for future emerging pathogenic CoVs. Considering the great animal health and economic impact of IBV as well as the recent emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS-coronavirus, it is important to investigate the role of wildlife reservoirs in CoV infection biology and epidemiology.","Muradrasoli, Shaman; Bálint, Ádám; Wahlgren, John; Waldenström, Jonas; Belák, Sándor; Blomberg, Jonas; Olsen, Björn",PLoS One,296,23

Its function has been recently described: it codes for immune-responsive gene 1 protein/cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase (IRG1/CAD), an enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid from cis-aconitic acid, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. Itaconic acid possesses specific antimicrobial properties inhibiting isocitrate lyase, the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, an anaplerotic pathway that bypasses the TCA cycle and enables bacteria to survive on limited carbon conditions. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying itaconic acid production through IRG1 induction in macrophages, we examined the transcriptional regulation of IRG1. To this end, we studied IRG1 expression in human immune cells under different inflammatory stimuli, such as TNFα and IFNγ, in addition to lipopolysaccharides. Under these conditions, as previously shown in mouse macrophages, IRG1/CAD accumulates in mitochondria. Furthermore, using literature information and transcription factor prediction models, we re-constructed raw gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for IRG1 in mouse and human macrophages. We further implemented a contextualization algorithm that relies on genome-wide gene expression data to infer putative cell type-specific gene regulatory interactions in mouse and human macrophages, which allowed us to predict potential transcriptional regulators of IRG1. Among the computationally identified regulators, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in macrophages significantly decreased the expression of IRG1/CAD at the gene and protein level, which correlated with a reduced production of itaconic acid. Using a synergistic approach of both computational and experimental methods, we here shed more light on the transcriptional machinery of IRG1 expression and could pave the way to therapeutic approaches targeting itaconic acid levels.","Tallam, Aravind; Perumal, Thaneer M.; Antony, Paul M.; Jäger, Christian; Fritz, Joëlle V.; Vallar, Laurent; Balling, Rudi; del Sol, Antonio; Michelucci, Alessandro",PLoS One,296,20

In particular, the extracellular domain of ACE2 interacts directly with the S1 tailspike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virion through a broad protein-protein interface. Although this interaction has been characterized by X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM, these structures do not reveal significant differences in ACE2 structure upon S1 protein binding. In this work, using several all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show persistent differences in ACE2 structure upon binding. These differences are determined with the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) machine learning method and validated using independent training and testing datasets, including long trajectories generated by D.

The gene encodes an apoprotein of 1581 amino acids with an Mr of about 178K. The open reading frame was cloned behind the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and its translation product was identified as the BEV P protein precursor by in vivo expression and immunoprecipitation. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a number of domains which are typical for type I membrane glycoproteins: an N-terminal signal sequence, a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. Eighteen potential N-glycosylation sites, two heptad repeat domains, and a possible “trypsin-like” cleavage site were identified. The mature P protein consists of two subunits and their electrophoretic mobility upon endoglycosidase F treatment strongly suggests that the predicted cleavage site is functional in vivo. The heptad repeat domains are probably involved in the generation of an intra-chain coiled-coil secondary structure; similar inter-chain interactions can play a role in P protein oligomerization. Using a sucrose gradient assay the P protein was indeed shown to form dimers. The intra- and inter-chain coiled-coil interactions may stabilize the elongated BEV peplomers.","Snijder, Eric J; Den Boon, Johan A; Spaan, Willy J.M; Weiss, Marianne; Horzinek, Marian C",Virology,296,20

Viral gene signatures in the spike, non-structural protein 3c, and membrane of the coronavirus genome have been shown to often correlate with disease manifestation. An “in vivo mutation transition hypothesis” is widely accepted and postulates that de novo virus mutation occurs in vivo giving rise to virulence. The existence of “distinct circulating avirulent and virulent strains” is an alternative hypothesis of viral pathogenesis. It may be possible that viral dynamics from both hypotheses are at play in the occurrence of FIP.

To do so, we conducted an online survey of California residents (n = 804) during active SIP restrictions (May 5–18, 2020). We asked respondents about changes to home occupancy patterns and household energy activities (e.g., cooking, electronics usage) due to SIP restrictions, as well as perspectives toward smart energy technologies. Households reported increased midday (10am–3pm) occupancy during SIP, and this increase is related to respondent and household characteristics, such as education and the presence of minors in the home. Examining change in the frequency of household activities during SIP, presence of minors and increased midday occupancy proved important. Finally, we considered relationships to intention to purchase smart home technologies, with the presence of minors and increased activity frequency relating to greater intention to purchase. These findings demonstrate how household activities and occupancy changed under COVID restrictions, how these changes may be related to energy use in the home, and how such COVID-related changes could be shaping perspectives toward smart home technology, potentially providing insight into future impacts on household practices and electricity demand.","Zanocco, C.; Flora, J.; Rajagopal, R.; Boudet, H.",Renewable & sustainable energy reviews,296,28

Para el diagnóstico virológico se realizó inmunofluorescencia y reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR) en aspirado nasofaríngeo. Se describen las características clínicas de los pacientes. Resultados Se describen un total de 76 niños hospitalizados con infección por rinovirus, lo que supuso el 25 % de los pacientes hospitalizados por procesos respiratorios o fiebre. El rinovirus fue el segundo agente viral identificado tras el virus respiratorio sincitial (29,9% de los hospitalizados). El 71,1 % de los pacientes fueron menores de 2 años. Los diagnósticos más frecuentes fueron sibilancias recurrentes en el 60,5 %, bronquiolitis en 23,7 %, neumonía en el 7,9 % e infección respiratoria de vías altas en el 5,3%. Presentaron fiebre de más de 38 °C el 57,9 % de los niños e infiltrado radiológico el 23,7%. Presentaron hipoxia el 43,4% de los niños. En niños mayores de 2 años el diagnóstico fue crisis asmática en 21 de los 22 casos. Conclusiones Los rinovirus se detectaron en un importante porcentaje de los niños hospitalizados a consecuencia de infección respiratoria, siendo precedidos en frecuencia sólo por el virus respiratorio sincitial. En nuestra serie es el agente viral más frecuentemente asociado con episodios de sibilancias recurrentes en niños mayores de 2 años, y el segundo en los más pequeños. Background Rhinovirus is a recognized cause of common cold and has been shown to cause asthma exacerbations in adults and children. The burden of rhinovirus infections in hospitalized children has not been described in Spain. Objective To describe confirmed rhinovirus infections in children hospitalized for respiratory tract infection in a secondary public hospital. Patients and methods We performed a prospective descriptive study in children admitted to hospital with fever or respiratory tract infection and with a positive isolation of rhinovirus in nasopharyngeal washings between September 2004 and July 2005. Virological diagnosis was made with direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washings. The clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed. Results There were 76 children with rhinovirus infection, representing 25 % of admissions in 304 children with fever or respiratory tract infection. Rhinovirus was the second most frequent viral agent identified after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (29.9 % of admissions). Fifty-four children (71.1%) were under 2 years of age. The most frequent clinical diagnoses were recurrent wheezing in 60.5 %, bronchiolitis in 23.7%, pneumonia in 7.9%, and upper respiratory tract infection in 5.3 %. Fever > 38 °C was present in 57.9% of the patients and radiologic infiltrate was found in 23.7%. Oxygen saturation less than 95% was found in 43.4% of the patients. Of 22 children aged more than 2 years, a diagnosis of asthmatic crisis was made in 21. Conclusions Rhinoviruses were frequently identified in hospitalized children with respiratory tract disease and were the second most common viruses after RSV. In our series, it was the most frequent cause of recurrent wheezing in hospitalized children and the second most common cause in infants.","Calvo Rey, C.; García García, M.ªL.; Casas Flecha, I.; Sánchez Mateos, M.

A data-driven modeling study.,14.174439,3.509994,2020-12-22,"Platelets are the primary cellular mediators of hemostasis and this function firmly acquaints them with a variety of inflammatory processes. For example, platelets can act as circulating sentinels by expressing Toll-like receptors (TLR) that bind pathogens and this allows platelets to effectively kill them or present them to cells of the immune system. Furthermore, activated platelets secrete and express many pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules that attract and capture circulating leukocytes and direct them to inflamed tissues. In addition, platelets can directly influence adaptive immune responses via secretion of, for example, CD40 and CD40L molecules. Platelets are also the source of most of the microvesicles in the circulation and these miniscule elements further enhance the platelet’s ability to communicate with the immune system. More recently, it has been demonstrated that platelets and their parent cells, the MK, can also uptake, process and present both foreign and self-antigens to CD8+ T-cells conferring on them the ability to directly alter adaptive immune responses. This review will highlight several of the non-hemostatic attributes of platelets that clearly and rightfully place them as integral players in immune reactions.","Maouia, Amal; Rebetz, Johan; Kapur, Rick; Semple, John W.",Transfus Med Rev,296,1

The role of fat distribution, particularly visceral fat (often linked to metabolic abnormalities), is still unclear. The adipose tissue represents a direct source of cytokines responsible for the pathological modifications occurring within adipose tissue in obese subjects. Adipokines are a crucial connection between metabolism and immune system: their dysregulation in obesity contributes to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and metabolic comorbidities. Therefore the increased amount of visceral fat can lead to a proinflammatory phenotypic shift. This review analyzes the interrelation between obesity and COVID-19 severity, as well as the cellular key players and molecular mechanisms implicated in adipose inflammation, investigating if adipose tissue can constitute a reservoir for viral spread, and contribute to immune activation and cytokines storm. Targeting the underlying molecular mechanisms might have therapeutic potential in the management of obesity-related complications in COVID-19 patients.","Gammone, Maria Alessandra; D’Orazio, Nicolantonio",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),296,1

Currently there are no adequate control strategies against circulating PEDV variants, making an urgent need to exploit effect antiviral therapies to compensate for vaccines. Here, we report that Aloe extract can hamper completely the proliferation of PEDV at a non-cytotoxic concentration of 16 mg/mL determined by CCK-8 assay in Vero and IPEC-J2 cells in vitro. Furthermore, time course analysis indicated the extract exerted its inhibition at the late stage of the viral life cycle. Moreover, we also confirmed that the extract can inactivated PEDV directly but did not act on the viral genome and S1 protein. Importantly, the extract at a relatively safety concentration of 100 mg/kg of body weight, which was confirmed in mice, could reduce virus load and pathological change in intestinal tract of pigs and protect newborn piglets from lethal challenge with highly pathogenic PEDV variant GDS01 infection, indicating that Aloe extract efficiently inhibited PEDV infection in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that the aqueous extract from the Aloe could inhibit PEDV replication in vitro and in vivo and might be a good target for drug development against PEDV.","Xu, Zhichao; Liu, Yuan; Peng, Peng; Liu, Yufang; Huang, Meiyan; Ma, Yehuan; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang",Vet Microbiol,296,26

The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of a physical education program (PEP) on locomotor, object control skills, and pre-literacy cognitive functions in a wide population of preschoolers and verify whether weight status could influence these abilities. In the context of the Training-to-Health Project, a sample of 1,029 preschoolers was recruited in kindergartens from the urban area of Palermo (Italy). Their gross motor and pre-literacy skills were tested before (PRE) and after (POST) following 16 weeks (2 h/week) of a PEP, which included ludic-motor activities aimed at developing body awareness and fundamental motor and perceptual-sensory skills. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess the skills before and after the intervention and to evaluate the effect of different categories of weight status on the examined variables. Regression analyses were conducted to confirm the hypothesized interrelationship between motor and pre-literacy skills in the considered sample. Both locomotor/object control and pre-literacy skills were significantly higher in children after the PEP (p < 0.05). We found 23% of overweight children and no significant difference between weight status classes in both PRE and POST PEP groups. In the POST group, higher locomotor and object control skills were mostly associated with better pre-literacy skills. This study shows that PEP was effective in improving both motor and pre-literacy skills in preschoolers independently from age and gender, while weight status did not affect these skills suggesting that this program can be administrated indifferently in children with different categories of weight status. Therefore, PEP could be a decisive education strategy to enhance motor and cognitive learning in preschool children and to achieve successful academic outcomes.","Battaglia, Giuseppe; Giustino, Valerio; Tabacchi, Garden; Alesi, Marianna; Galassi, Claudia; Modica, Carmen; Palma, Antonio; Bellafiore, Marianna",Front Sports Act Living,296,22

However, most reports lack data on the metabolic syndrome itself. This study investigated prospectively the relationship between respiratory deterioration and the presence of metabolic syndrome or abdominal adiposity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study analysing patients with respiratory symptoms who presented at a local emergency department in the Netherlands. The influence of abdominal adiposity—assessed by an increased waist–hip ratio—and metabolic syndrome on respiratory deterioration and the length of hospital stay were analysed with multivariable logistic regressions and Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: In total, 166 patients were analysed, of whom 86 (52%) tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome did not differ between patients with COVID-19 with and without the need for intubation or level of supportive care (37.5% vs 48.4%, p=0.338). In contrast, abdominal adiposity is an independent risk factor for respiratory distress in COVID-19, adjusted for metabolic syndrome, age, gender and BMI (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: This study shows that abdominal adiposity, and not the presence of metabolic syndrome, is associated with clinical deterioration in COVID-19. This prospective study provides further insight into the risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 based on a simple measurement as the waist and hip circumference.

The analysis of gene expression in persistently infected planthoppers might unveil the molecular basis of viral transmission. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the most accurate and sensitive method used for quantitative gene expression analysis. In order to normalize the resulting quantitative data, reference genes with constant expression during the experimental procedures are needed. RESULTS: Partial sequences of the commonly used reference genes actin (ACT), α1-tubulin (TUB), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1A), ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) and polyubiquitin C (UBI) from Delphacodes kuscheli, a planthopper capable of persistently transmitting the plant fijivirus Mal de Río Cuarto virus (MRCV), were isolated for the first time. Specific RT-qPCR primers were designed and the expression stability of these genes was assayed in MRCV-infective and naïve planthoppers using geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper tools. The overall analysis showed that UBI, followed by 18S and ACT, are the most suitable genes as internal controls for quantitative gene expression studies in MRCV-infective planthoppers, while TUB and EF1A are the most variable ones. Moreover, EF1A was upregulated by MRCV infection. CONCLUSIONS: A RT-qPCR platform for gene expression analysis in the MRCV-infected planthopper vector Delphacodes kuscheli was developed. Our work is the first report on reference gene selection in virus-infected insects, and might serve as a precedent for future gene expression studies on MRCV and other virus-planthopper pathosystems.","Maroniche, Guillermo A; Sagadín, Mónica; Mongelli, Vanesa C; Truol, Graciela A; del Vas, Mariana",Virol J,296,1

However, the virus’ pathogenesis remains unclear, and there is no cure for the disease. We investigated the dynamic changes of blood immune response in patients with COVID-19 at different stages by using 5’ gene expression, T cell receptor (TCR), and B cell receptors (BCR) V(D)J transcriptome analysis at a single-cell resolution. We obtained single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 341,420 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 185,430 clonotypic T cells and 28,802 clonotypic B cells from 25 samples of 16 patients with COVID-19 for dynamic studies. In addition, we used three control samples. We found expansion of dendritic cells (DCs), CD14+ monocytes, and megakaryocytes progenitor cells (MP)/platelets and a reduction of naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19, along with a significant decrease of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells (NKs) in patients in critical condition. The type I interferon (IFN-I), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and ferroptosis pathways were activated while the disease was active, and recovered gradually after patient conditions improved. Consistent with this finding, the mRNA level of IFN-I signal-induced gene IFI27 was significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 compared with that of the controls in a validation cohort that included 38 patients and 35 controls. The concentration of interferon-α (IFN-α) in the serum of patients with COVID-19 increased significantly compared with that of the controls in an additional cohort of 215 patients with COVID-19 and 106 controls, further suggesting the important role of the IFN-I pathway in the immune response of COVID-19. TCR and BCR sequences analyses indicated that patients with COVID-19 developed specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true size of the currently infected population, which is arguably the most critical number for public health policy decisions. We developed a machine learning framework to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in all 50 U.S. states and the 50 most infected countries from reported test results and deaths. Using published epidemiological parameters, our algorithm optimized slowly varying daily ascertainment rates and a time course of currently infected cases each day. Severe under-ascertainment of COVID-19 cases was found to be universal across U.S. states and countries worldwide. In 25 out of the 50 countries, actual cumulative cases were estimated to be 5–20 times greater than the confirmed cases. Our estimates of cumulative incidence were in line with the existing seroprevalence rates in 46 U.S. states. Our framework projected for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. that ~10% of the population has been infected once. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population was estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York this fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.","Noh, Jungsik; Danuser, Gaudenz",PLoS One,296,5

Surprisingly, we find that an uninfected, virus-immune guinea pig whose body is contaminated with influenza virus can transmit the virus through the air to a susceptible partner in a separate cage. We further demonstrate that aerosolized fomites can be generated from inanimate objects, such as by manually rubbing a paper tissue contaminated with influenza virus. Our data suggest that aerosolized fomites may contribute to influenza virus transmission in animal models of human influenza, if not among humans themselves, with important but understudied implications for public health.","Asadi, Sima; Gaaloul ben Hnia, Nassima; Barre, Ramya S.; Wexler, Anthony S.; Ristenpart, William D.; Bouvier, Nicole M.",Nat Commun,296,3

Increased morbidity and mortality is associated with older age, male gender, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and smoking. As COVID-19 spreads from coastal borders, both state to state and country to country, our understanding of its pathophysiology has evolved. Age and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) play especially important roles in COVID-19 progression. T2DM is an age-related disease associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and endothelial activation and dysfunction. This review evaluates the relationships and intersection between endothelial cell activation and dysfunction in T2DM and COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple injuries of the terminal bronchioles and alveolar blood-gas barrier and associated ultrastructural tissue remodeling. COVID-19 may unmask multiple vulnerabilities associated with T2DM including damage to the endothelial glycocalyx and multiple end-organ macro and microvascular diseases.

Scientific evidence is based on letters to the editor, clinical cases and case series, cross-sectional, and a few longitudinal studies. To date, it includes viral conjunctivitis, immune conjunctivitis, and oculomotor palsies (OCP) due to the novel coronavirus. Retinopathy is discussed, but no cases have been published yet. A viral conjunctivitis outbreak can be isolated or associated with the systemic picture, mainly pulmonary, before or after the onset of respiratory symptoms. It can be both unilateral and bilateral, follicles are typical, and duration is variable between 5 and 21 days. Immune-mediated conjunctivitis consists of eye redness, together with erythroderma and fever. It appears more frequently in children, and has been associated with a “Kawasaki-like” disease and toxic shock syndrome. OCP can present on its own, or as part of Miller-Fisher syndrome, along with ataxia, and hyporeflexia. Ophthalmologists have a considerable risk of developing COVID-19 due to close contact with the patient, exposure to tears and eye secretions, and the use of various pieces of equipment and devices susceptible to contamination.","Pérez-Bartolomé, F.; Sánchez-Quirós, J.",,296,20

HPV16 predominantly signs responsible for approximately 10% of all HNSCC and over 50% of tonsillar (T)SCCs. Prevalence rates depend on several factors, such as the geographical region where patients live, possibly due to different social and sexual habits. Smoking plays an important role, with non-smoking patients being mostly HPV-positive and smokers being mostly HPV-negative. This is of unparalleled clinical relevance, as the outcome of (non-smoking) HPV-positive patients is significantly better, albeit with standard and not with de-escalated therapies. The results of the first prospective de-escalation studies have dampened hopes that similar superior survival can be achieved with de-escalated therapy. In this context, it is important to note that the inclusion of p16(INK4A) (a surrogate marker for HPV-positivity) in the 8th TMN-classification has only prognostic, not therapeutic, intent. To avoid misclassification, highest precision in determining HPV-status is of utmost importance. Whenever possible, PCR-based methods, still referred to as the ""gold standard”, should be used. New diagnostic antibodies represent some hope, e.g., to detect primaries and recurrences early. Prophylactic HPV vaccination should lead to a decline in HPV-driven HNSCC as well. This review discusses the above aspects in detail.","Hoffmann, Markus; Quabius, Elgar Susanne",Viruses,296,13

However, quantitative studies that consider the global and economy-wide impacts of rerouting supply chains are limited. This study examines the economic and emissions impacts of reorganising supply chains, using Australia-China trade as an example. It augments the Hypothetical Extraction Method by replacing traditional Input-Output analysis with a Computable General Equilibrium analysis. The estimation results demonstrate that in both exports and imports, a trade embargo between Australia and China – despite being compensated for by alternative supply chains—will cause gross domestic production losses and emissions increases for both countries and the world overall. Moreover, even though all other economies gain from the markets left by China, many of them incur overall gross domestic production losses and emission increases. The finding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and India may also suffer from an Australia-China trade embargo, despite a gain in trade volume, suggests that no country should add fuel to the fire. The results suggest that countries need to defend a rules-based trading regime and jointly address supply chain challenges.","Shi, Xunpeng; Cheong, Tsun Se; Zhou, Michael",Front Public Health,296,26

We are especially interested in how the availability of medication could change the necessary quarantine measures for effective control of the disease. We model the transmission by extending the SEIR model to include asymptomatic, quarantined, isolated and medicated population compartments. We calculate the basic reproduction number R_0 and show that for R_0<1 the disease dies out and for R_0>1 the disease is endemic. Using sensitivity analysis we establish that R_0 is most sensitive to the rates of quarantine and medication. We also study how the effectiveness and the rate of medication along with the quarantine rate affect R_0. We devise optimal quarantine, medication and isolation strategies, noting that availability of medication reduces the duration and severity of the lock-down needed for effective disease control. Our study also reinforces the idea that with the availability of medication, while the severity of the lock downs can be eased over time some social distancing protocols need to be observed, at least till a vaccine is found. We also analyze the COVID-109 outbreak data for four different countries, in two of these, India and Pakistan the curve is still rising, and in he other two, Italy and Spain, the epidemic curve is now falling due to effective quarantine measures.

A lack of discussion, however, exists given the auditory–vestibular system involvement in CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the event rate (ER) of hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley) and World Health Organization updates were searched using combined keywords: ‘COVID-19,’ ‘SARS-CoV-2,’ ‘pandemic,’ ‘auditory dysfunction,’ ‘hearing loss,’ ‘tinnitus,’ ‘vestibular dysfunction,’ ‘dizziness,’ ‘vertigo,’ and ‘otologic symptoms.’ RESULTS: Twelve papers met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study. These papers were single group prospective, cross-sectional, or retrospective studies on otolaryngologic, neurologic, or general clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and had used subjective assessments for data collection (case histories/medical records). The results of the meta-analysis demonstrate that the ER of hearing loss (3.1%, CIs: 0.01–0.09), tinnitus (4.5%, CIs: 0.012–0.153), and dizziness (12.2%, CIs: 0.070–0.204) is statistically significant in patients with COVID-19 (Z ≤ −4.469, p ≤ 0.001).

Although privacy policies are designed to inform consumers, such policies have consistently been found to be confusing and lack transparency. OBJECTIVE This study aims to present consumer preferences for accessing privacy information; develop and apply a privacy policy risk assessment tool to assess whether existing HITs meet the recommended privacy policy standards; and propose guidelines to assist health professionals and service providers with understanding the privacy risks associated with HITs, so that they can confidently promote their safe use as a part of care. METHODS In phase 1, participatory design workshops were conducted with young people who were attending a participating headspace center, their supportive others, and health professionals and service providers from the centers. The findings were knowledge translated to determine participant preferences for the presentation and availability of privacy information and the functionality required to support its delivery. Phase 2 included the development of the 23-item privacy policy risk assessment tool, which incorporated material from international privacy literature and standards. This tool was then used to assess the privacy policies of 34 apps and e-tools. In phase 3, privacy guidelines, which were derived from learnings from a collaborative consultation process with key stakeholders, were developed to assist health professionals and service providers with understanding the privacy risks associated with incorporating HITs as a part of clinical care. RESULTS When considering the use of HITs, the participatory design workshop participants indicated that they wanted privacy information to be easily accessible, transparent, and user-friendly to enable them to clearly understand what personal and health information will be collected and how these data will be shared and stored. The privacy policy review revealed consistently poor readability and transparency, which limited the utility of these documents as a source of information. Therefore, to enable informed consent, the privacy guidelines provided ensure that health professionals and consumers are fully aware of the potential for privacy risks in using HITs to support health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS A lack of transparency in privacy policies has the potential to undermine consumers' ability to trust that the necessary measures are in place to secure and protect the privacy of their personal and health information, thus precluding their willingness to engage with HITs. The application of the privacy guidelines will improve the confidence of health professionals and service providers in the privacy of consumer data, thus enabling them to recommend HITs to provide or support care.","LaMonica, Haley M; Roberts, Anna E; Lee, Grace Yeeun; Davenport, Tracey A; Hickie, Ian B",Journal of medical Internet research,296,1

Animal-to-human transmission occurs upon exposure to rodent excreta and secretions, i.e. urine and saliva, and human-to-human transmission occurs via the bodily fluids of an infected person. To elucidate the seasonal drivers of LF epidemics, we employed a mathematical model to analyse the datasets of human infection, rodent population dynamics and climatological variations and capture the underlying transmission dynamics. The surveillance-based incidence data of human cases in Nigeria were explored, and moreover, a mathematical model was used for describing the transmission dynamics of LF in rodent populations. While quantifying the case fatality risk and the rate of exposure of humans to animals, we explicitly estimated the corresponding contact rate of humans with infected rodents, accounting for the seasonal population dynamics of rodents. Our findings reveal that seasonal migratory dynamics of rodents play a key role in regulating the cyclical pattern of LF epidemics. The estimated timing of high exposure of humans to animals coincides with the time shortly after the start of the dry season and can be associated with the breeding season of rodents in Nigeria.

The capacity of the virus to destroy the host cell by liberating its own DNA or RNA and replicating inside the host cell poses challenges in the development of antiviral therapeutics. In recent years, many new technologies have been explored for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral infections. Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the most promising technologies on account of its ability to deal with viral diseases in an effective manner, addressing the limitations of traditional antiviral medicines. It has not only helped us to overcome problems related to solubility and toxicity of drugs, but also imparted unique properties to drugs, which in turn has increased their potency and selectivity toward viral cells against the host cells. The initial part of the paper focuses on some important proteins of influenza, Ebola, HIV, herpes, Zika, dengue, and corona virus and those of the host cells important for their entry and replication into the host cells. This is followed by different types of nanomaterials which have served as delivery vehicles for the antiviral drugs. It includes various lipid-based, polymer-based, lipid–polymer hybrid–based, carbon-based, inorganic metal–based, surface-modified, and stimuli-sensitive nanomaterials and their application in antiviral therapeutics.

OBJECTIVES: To identify molecular characteristics of diseased lung epithelial and immune cells that may account for worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic lung diseases. METHODS: We analyzed the transcriptomes of 605,904 single cells isolated from healthy (79 samples) and diseased human lungs (31 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 82 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 18 non-IPF interstitial lung disease samples). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cellular distribution and relative expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2, TMPRSS2) was similar in disease and control lungs. Epithelial cells isolated from diseased lungs expressed higher levels of genes linked directly to efficiency of viral replication and the innate immune response. Unique ACE2-correlated gene sets were identified for each diagnosis group in the type II alveolar cells. Diseased lungs have a significant increase in the proportion of CD4, CD8 and NK cells compared to control lungs. Components of the interferon pathway, the IL6 cytokine pathway and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are upregulated in several diseased immune cell types. These differences in inflammatory gene expression programs highlight how chronic lung disease alters the inflammatory microenvironment encountered upon viral exposure to the peripheral lung. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic lung disease is accompanied by changes in cell-type-specific gene expression programs that prime the lung epithelium for and influence innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bui, Linh T.; Winters, Nichelle I.; Chung, Mei-I; Joseph, Chitra; Gutierrez, Austin J.; Habermann, Arun C.; Adams, Taylor S.; Schupp, Jonas C.; Poli, Sergio; Peter, Lance M.; Taylor, Chase J.; Blackburn, Jessica B.; Richmond, Bradley W.; Nicholson, Andrew G.; Rassl, Doris; Wallace, William A.; Rosas, Ivan O.; Jenkins, R.

The diagnosis is complicated by 30-50% of COVID-19 hospital admissions with negative nose/throat swabs negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, frequently after the first week of illness when SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses become detectable. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of combined rapid antibody point of care (POC) and nucleic acid assays for suspected COVID-19 disease in the emergency department. Methods We developed (i) an in vitro neutralization assay using a lentivirus expressing a genome encoding luciferase and pseudotyped with spike protein and (ii) an ELISA test to detect IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We tested two promising candidate lateral flow rapid fingerprick test with bands for IgG and IgM. We then prospectively recruited participants with suspected moderate to severe COVID-19 and tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in a combined nasal/throat swab using the standard laboratory RT-PCR and a validated rapid nucleic acid test. Additionally, serum collected at admission was retrospectively tested by in vitro neutralization, ELISA and the candidate POC antibody tests. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of the individual and combined rapid POC diagnostic tests against a composite gold standard of neutralisation and the standard laboratory RT-PCR. Results 45 participants had specimens tested for nucleic acid in nose/throat swabs as well as stored sera for antibodies. Serum neutralisation assay, SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG ELISA and the POC antibody test results were concordant. Using the composite gold standard, prevalence of COVID-19 disease was 53.3% (24/45). Median age was 73.5 (IQR 54.0-86.5) years in those with COVID-19 disease by our gold standard and 63.0 (IQR 41.0-72.0) years in those without disease. Median duration of symptoms was 7 days (IQR 1-8) in those with infection. The overall sensitivity of rapid NAAT diagnosis was 79.2% (95CI 57.8-92.9%) and 50.0% (11.8-88.2) at days 8-28. Sensitivity and specificity of the combined rapid POC diagnostic tests reached 100% (95CI 85.8-100) and 94.7% (95CI 74.0-99.0) overall. Conclusions Dual point of care SARS-CoV-2 testing can significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity, whilst maintaining high specificity. Rapid combined tests have the potential to transform our management of COVID-19, including inflammatory manifestations where nucleic acid test results are negative. A rapid combined approach will also aid recruitment into clinical trials and in prescribing therapeutics, particularly where potentially harmful immune modulators (including steroids) are used.","Mlcochova, P.; Collier, D.; Ritchie, A.

On the other hand, this idea left questioned how cerebral interstitial fluid is cleared of waste products. It was generally thought that clearance depends on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Not long ago, an anatomically and functionally discrete paravascular space was revised to provide a pathway for the clearance of molecules drained within the interstitial space. According to this model, CSF enters the brain parenchyma along arterial paravascular spaces. Once mixed with interstitial fluid and solutes in a process mediated by aquaporin-4, CSF exits through the extracellular space along venous paravascular spaces, thus being removed from the brain. This process includes the participation of perivascular glial cells due to a sieving effect of their end-feet. Such draining space resembles the peripheral lymphatic system, therefore, the term “glymphatic” (glial-lymphatic) pathway has been coined. Specific studies focused on the potential role of the glymphatic pathway in healthy and pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. This mainly concerns Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as hemorrhagic and ischemic neurovascular disorders; other acute degenerative processes, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus or traumatic brain injury are involved as well. Novel morphological and functional investigations also suggested alternative models to drain molecules through perivascular pathways, which enriched our insight of homeostatic processes within neural microenvironment. Under the light of these considerations, the present article aims to discuss recent findings and concepts on nervous lymphatic drainage and blood–brain barrier (BBB) in an attempt to understand how peripheral pathological conditions may be detrimental to the CNS, paving the way to neurodegeneration.","Natale, Gianfranco; Limanaqi, Fiona; Busceti, Carla L.; Mastroiacovo, Federica; Nicoletti, Ferdinando; Puglisi-Allegra, Stefano; Fornai, Francesco",Front Neurosci,296,3

This study investigates compliance with the Stay Home policy and exposure to COVID‐19 in Nigeria. A survey was conducted from April 4 to May 8, 2020 using a cross‐sectional mixed‐methods approach to elicit responses from 879 participants across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Descriptive, χ (2), and multiple regression tests were used to analyze survey data using SPSS, whereas NVivo v12 was used for thematic analysis of qualitative data. States with complete lockdown had 72.4% of respondents complying fully with the policy compared with 44.2% of respondents in zones with the partial lockdown. Market places, classified as high‐risk zones, were the most visited (n = 505; 71.0%). Though compliance was influenced by the nature of lockdown enforced (χ (2) = 70.385, df = 2; p < 0.05), being a female, a widow, and unemployed were associated with increased compliance. Exposure to COVID‐19 was associated with being married, unemployed, and having no income. Fear, anxiety, and misperception play major roles in compliance. The authors conclude that compliance is not uniform and a more nuanced and targeted approach is required as the government continues to respond to the COVID‐19 global pandemic.","Akeju, David O.; Adejoh, Samuel O.; Fakunmoju, Ayoola J.; Allsop, Matthew J.; Ebenso, Bassey; Tade, Titilayo; Okusanya, Babasola O.",World Med Health Policy,296,1

As our world becomes increasingly connected, emerging diseases pose a greater threat, requiring coordination at local, regional, and global levels. One Health is a multisectoral, transdisciplinary, and collaborative approach promoted to more effectively address these complex health threats. Despite strong advocacy for One Health, challenges for practical implementation remain. Here we discuss the value of the One Health approach for addressing global health challenges.

Gradual deterioration of the patient's fitness is resistant to nutritional intervention. The biochemical foundation of observed catabolism, detrimental protein, and energy balance is composite. However, the generalized inflammatory response plays a vital role. It is a kind of cytokine storm, which involves increased activity of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and INF-γ. Pharmacological treatment of cachexia consists mainly of progestagens and glucocorticosteroids. Still, the assessment of new options limiting the harmful impact of cachexia could be beneficial. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old antimalarial agents endowed with immunomodulatory properties. Being potent autophagy inhibitors, they could lead to some kind of intracellular starvation in both immunocompetent effector cells and cancer cells, thus limiting the harmful impact of CC. CQ/HCQ are also efficient in particular connective tissue disorders. They have gained special attention since the World Health Organization announced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. According to initial reports, people with a severe inflammatory reaction achieved significant benefits. Possibly they could not be attributed to the antiviral activity alone. It is worth noting that the cytokine storm in COVID-19, connective tissue disorders, and cancer cachexia share some similarities. Therefore, we hypothesize that low doses of CQ/HCQ may prove efficient in cancer cachexia.","Kiedrowski, Miroslaw; Kapala, Przemyslaw; Kiedrowska, Marlena; Skoczyńska, Anna; Czerw, Aleksandra; Deptała, Andrzej",Med Hypotheses,296,20

METHODS: Analyses focus on data collected during Spring 2020 from 29 eastern Quebec secondary schools that participated in the COMPASS study. Participants (n = 6052) self-reported their knowledge, perception of risk and preventive practices to do with the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using structural equation models based on gender and anxiety level. RESULTS: The majority of respondents reported adopting the recommended COVID-19 preventive measures. The results showed three paths leading to adolescents' adoption of these measures: pandemic knowledge; perception of risk related to COVID-19; and, in particular, discussions with relatives about preventive measures and what to do in case of infection. CONCLUSIONS: While most of the adolescent participants in this study appeared to comply with COVID-19 preventive measures, factors such as discussions with relatives emerge as elements to foster in order to improve adolescents' adoption of preventive measures.","Bacque Dion, Claude; Bélanger, Richard; Leatherdale, Scott T; Haddad, Slim",Health Promot.

Host-directed therapy (HDT) is an emerging approach in the field of anti-infectives. The strategy behind HDT is to interfere with host cell factors that are required by a pathogen for replication or persistence, to enhance protective immune responses against a pathogen, to reduce exacerbated inflammation and to balance immune reactivity at sites of pathology. Although HDTs encompassing interferons are well established for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis, novel strategies aimed at the functional cure of persistent viral infections and the development of broad-spectrum antivirals against emerging viruses seem to be crucial. In chronic bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis, HDT strategies aim to enhance the antimicrobial activities of phagocytes and to curtail inflammation through interference with soluble factors (such as eicosanoids and cytokines) or cellular factors (such as co-stimulatory molecules). This Review describes current progress in the development of HDTs for viral and bacterial infections, including sepsis, and the challenges in bringing these new approaches to the clinic.

Weaker evidence supports the use of NIPPV for patients with ARF due to asthma exacerbations, with postoperative ARF, pneumonia and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The relative contribution of different transmission routes remains subject to debate. Here, we show Syrian hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through intranasal, aerosol and fomite exposure. Different routes of exposure present with distinct disease manifestations. Intranasal and aerosol inoculation causes severe respiratory pathology, higher virus loads and increased weight loss. In contrast, fomite exposure leads to milder disease manifestation characterized by an anti-inflammatory immune state and delayed shedding pattern. Whereas the overall magnitude of respiratory virus shedding is not linked to disease severity, the onset of shedding is. Early shedding is linked to an increase in disease severity. Airborne transmission is more efficient than fomite transmission and dependent on the direction of the airflow.

However, little is known about the extent of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in racial and ethnic minorities and whether there are unique sociodemographic and cognitive correlates associated with vaccine hesitancy. Thus, the purpose of this study was to review all nationwide studies on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among African-Americans and Hispanics (the largest minority groups in the U.S.). A comprehensive review of the published literature was conducted to search for national studies and a final pool of 13 studies (n ​= ​107,841 participants) was included in this review. The overall pooled prevalence rate of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy for adult Americans across all studies was 26.3% (95%Ci ​= ​17.3–36.4). In contrast, the overall pooled prevalence rate of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy for African-Americans was 41.6% (95%Ci ​= ​34.4–48.9) and for Hispanics, it was 30.2% (95%Ci ​= ​23.2–37.7). The major predictors of vaccine hesitancy in African-Americans and Hispanics were: sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income, education, and household size); medical mistrust and history of racial discrimination; exposure to myths and misinformation, perceived risk of getting infected with COVID-19; beliefs about vaccines and past vaccine compliance, and concerns about the safety, efficacy, and side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines. Given the high COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rates in racial/ethnic minorities and the unique factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in African-Americans and Hispanics, several clinic-based and community-oriented practice recommendations have been included in this article.","Khubchandani, Jagdish; Macias, Yilda",Brain Behav Immun Health,296,10

Despite showing promising results, heterogeneity in past systematic reviews remains high. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and assess the association between patient outcomes and hospital-at-home interventions as a substitute for in-hospital stay for community-dwelling patients with a chronic disease who present to the emergency department and are offered at least 1 home visit from a nurse and/or physician. DATA SOURCES: Databases were searched from date of inception to March 4, 2019. The databases were Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, CINAHL, Health Technology Assessment, the Cochrane Library, OVID Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials in which the experimental group received hospital-at-home interventions and the control group received the usual in-hospital care. Patients were 18 years or older with a chronic disease who presented to the emergency department and received home visits from a nurse or physician. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Risk of bias was assessed, and a meta-analysis was conducted for outcomes that were reported by at least 2 studies using comparable measures. Risk ratios (RRs) were reported for binary outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Narrative synthesis was performed for other outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes of interest were patient outcomes, which included mortality, long-term care admission, readmission, length of treatment, out-of-pocket costs, depression and anxiety, quality of life, patient satisfaction, caregiver stress, cognitive status, nutrition, morbidity due to hospitalization, functional status, and neurological deficits. RESULTS: Nine studies were included, providing data on 959 participants (median age, 71.0 years [interquartile range, 70.0-79.9 years]; 613 men [63.9%]; 346 women [36.1%]). Mortality did not differ between the hospital-at-home and the in-hospital care groups (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.61-1.15; I(2) = 0%). Risk of readmission was lower (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95; I(2) = 31%) and length of treatment was longer in the hospital-at-home group than in the in-hospital group (mean difference, 5.45 days; 95% CI, 1.91-8.97 days; I(2) = 87%). In addition, the hospital-at-home group had a lower risk of long-term care admission than the in-hospital care group (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.74; I(2) = 0%). Patients who received hospital-at-home interventions had lower depression and anxiety than those who remained in-hospital, but there was no difference in functional status. Other patient outcomes showed mixed results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that hospital-at-home interventions represent a viable substitute to an in-hospital stay for patients with chronic diseases who present to the emergency department and who have at least 1 visit from a nurse or physician. Although the heterogeneity of the findings remained high for some outcomes, particularly for length of treatment, the heterogeneity of this study was comparable to that of past reviews and further explored.","Arsenault-Lapierre, Geneviève; Henein, Mary; Gaid, Dina; Le Berre, Mélanie; Gore, Genevieve; Vedel, Isabelle",JAMA Netw Open,296,24

Numerous strategies have been developed to harvest and remove these plant species from the environment. However it is still an open question as to which method is best suited to removing a particular invasive species and the impact of different lake conditions on the choice. One problem common to all harvesting methods is the need to assess the location and degree of infestation on an ongoing manner. This is a difficult and error prone problem given that the plants grow underwater and significant infestation at depth may not be visible at the surface. Here we detail efforts to monitor EWM infestation and evaluate harvesting methods using an autonomous surface vessel (ASV). This novel ASV is based around a mono-hull design with two outriggers. Powered by a differential pair of underwater thrusters, the ASV is outfitted with RTK GPS for position estimation and a set of submerged environmental sensors that are used to capture imagery and depth information including the presence of material suspended in the water column.

Our Centre is one of the largest UK Cancer Centers at the epicenter of the UK COVID-19 epidemic. The first COVID-19 positive cancer patient was reported on 29 February 2020. We analyzed data from 7-15 May 2020 for COVID-19 tests in our cancer patients. 2,647 patients attended for outpatient, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy appointments. 654 were swabbed for COVID-19 (25%). Of those tested, 9 were positive for COVID-19 (1.38%) of which 7 were asymptomatic. Cancer service providers will need to understand their local cancer population prevalence. The absolute priority is that cancer patients have the confidence to attend hospitals and be reassured that they will be treated in a COVID-19 managed environment.","Moss, Charlotte; Dolly, Saoirse; Russell, Beth; Lei, Mary; Ghosh, Sharmista; Papa, Sophie; Sullivan, Richard; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke; Rigg, Anne",Cancer Control,296,10

Additional cell receptors may be directly or indirectly involved, including integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrins contain several predicted short linear motifs (SLiMs) that may facilitate internalization of the virus as well as its subsequent propagation through processes such as autophagy. Here, we measured the binding affinity of predicted interactions between SLiMs in the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrin β(3) with proteins that mediate endocytic trafficking and autophagy. We validated that a class I PDZ-binding motif mediated binding of ACE2 to the scaffolding proteins SNX27, NHERF3, and SHANK, and that a binding site for the clathrin adaptor AP2 μ2 in ACE2 overlaps with a phospho-dependent binding site for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, we validated that an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in integrin β(3) bound to the ATG8 domains of the autophagy receptors MAP1LC3 and GABARAP in a manner enhanced by LIR-adjacent phosphorylation. Our results provide molecular links between cell receptors and mediators of endocytosis and autophagy that may facilitate viral entry and propagation.","Kliche, Johanna; Kuss, Hanna; Ali, Muhammad; Ivarsson, Ylva",Sci Signal,296,20

Stress is closely related to immunity. However, the immune response of frontline medical workers providing medical support for COVID-19 patients is unclear. Here, we reported the immune response of 76 frontline medical workers and 152 controls from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University. The frontline medical workers were involved in the care for Wuhan COVID-19 patients from February 8 to March 31, 2020 in Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The controls were medical workers of our hospital who had not been in contact with COVID-19 patients during the same period. Demographic and clinical data, including routine blood test data were extracted from the electronic health examination record and retrospectively analyzed. The post-stress frontline medical workers had higher lymphocyte (LYM) count compared with controls or pre-stress. However, the post-stress frontline medical workers had lower monocyte (MONO) count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and neutrophil (NEUT) ratio than controls or pre-stress. Interestingly, we found the differences were more significantly in female subgroup and nurse subgroup. Together, these data indicated that changes of immune response were found in frontline medical workers providing medical support for Wuhan COVID-19 patients, especially in females and nurses. Those maybe caused by psychological stress and we recommend to pay more attention to mental health of frontline medical workers, and provide appropriate psychological interventions for them.","Yang, Juanjuan; Wang, Qian; Zhang, Shuqun; Li, Zongfang; Jiang, Wei",Int Immunopharmacol,296,21

This pathway is particularly important during the perinatal period when women are at an elevated risk for depression. However, this relationship has not been explored in South Asia. This study estimates the association between ACEs and women’s (N = 889) depression at 36 months postpartum in rural Pakistan. METHOD: Data come from the Bachpan Cohort study. To capture ACEs, an adapted version of the ACE-International Questionnaire was used. Women’s depression was measured using both major depressive episodes (MDE) and depressive symptom severity. To assess the relationship between ACEs and depression, log-Poisson models were used for MDE and linear regression models for symptom severity. RESULTS: The majority (58%) of women experienced at least one ACE domain, most commonly home violence (38.3%), followed by neglect (20.1%). Women experiencing four or more ACEs had the most pronounced elevation of symptom severity (β = 3.90; 95% CL = 2.13, 5.67) and MDE (PR = 2.43; 95% CL = 1.37, 4.32). Symptom severity (β = 2.88; 95% CL = 1.46, 4.31), and MDE (PR = 2.01; 95% CL = 1.27, 3.18) were greater for those experiencing community violence or family distress (β = 2.04; 95%; CL = 0.83, 3.25) (PR = 1.77; 95% CL = 1.12, 2.79). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that ACEs are substantively distinct and have unique relationships to depression. They signal a need to address women’s ACEs as part of perinatal mental health interventions and highlight women’s lifelong experiences as important factors to understanding current mental health.

In light of the significantly increased risk of HIVAN in carriers of two APOL1 risk alleles, a role in HIV infectivity has been postulated in the mechanism of APOL1 associated kidney disease. Herein, we aim to explore the association between HIV viremia and APOL1 genotype. In addition, we investigated interaction between BK and JC viruria, CKD and HIV viremia. A total of 199 persons living with HIV/AIDS (comprising 82 CKD cases and 117 controls) from among the participants in the ongoing Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) Kidney Disease Research Network case control study have been recruited. The two APOL1 renal risk alleles (RRA) genotypes were associated with a higher risk of CKD (OR 12.6, 95% CI 3.89–40.8, p < 0.0001). Even a single APOL1 RRA was associated with CKD risk (OR 4.42, 95% CI 1.49–13.15, p = 0.007). The 2 APOL1 RRA genotypes were associated with an increased probability of having HIV viremia (OR 2.37 95% CI 1.0–5.63, p = 0.05). HIV viremia was associated with increased CKD risk (OR 7.45, 95% CI 1.66–33.35, P = 0.009) and with a significant reduction of JC virus urine shedding (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12–0.98, p = 0.046). In contrast to prior studies, JC viruria was not associated with CKD but was restricted in patients with HIV viremia, regardless of CKD status. These findings suggest a role of APOL1 variants in HIV infectivity and emphasize that JC viruria can serve as biomarker for innate immune system activation.","Kruzel-Davila, Etty; Sankofi, Barbara Mensah; Kubi Amos-Abanyie, Ernestine; Ghansah, Anita; Nyarko, Alexander; Agyemang, Seth; Awandare, Gordon A.; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Reiner-Benaim, Anat; Hijazi, Basem; Ulasi, Ifeoma; Raji, Yemi Raheem; Boima, Vincent; Osafo, Charlotte; May Adabayeri, Victoria; Matekole, Michael; Olanrewaju, Timothy O.; Ajayi, Samuel; Mamven, Manmak; Antwi, Sampson; Ademola, Adebowale D.; Plange-Rhule, Jacob; Arogundade, Fatiu; Akyaw, Priscilla Abena; Winkler, Cheryl A.; Salako, Babatunde L.; Ojo, Akinlolu; Skorecki, Karl; Adu, Dwomoa",Front Med (Lausanne),296,15

Here, we identify circulating virus-specific T cell responses during acute infection with functional, migratory and apoptotic patterns modulated by viral proteins and associated with clinical outcome. Disease severity is associated predominantly with IFNγ and IL-4 responses, increased responses against S peptides and apoptosis, whereas non-hospitalized patients have increased IL-12p70 levels, degranulation in response to N peptides and SARS-CoV-2-specific CCR7(+) T cells secreting IL-10. In convalescent patients, lung-T(RM) are frequently detected even 10 months after initial infection, in which contemporaneous blood does not reflect tissue-resident profiles.

In the transition, repurposing existing drugs remains the fastest cost-effective approach to alleviate the burden on health services, most particularly by reducing the incidence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe COVID-19. We undertook a computational repurposing approach to identify candidate therapeutic drugs to control progression towards severe airways inflammation during COVID-19. Molecular profiling data were obtained from public sources regarding SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial or endothelial cells, immune dysregulations associated with severe COVID-19 and lung inflammation induced by other respiratory viruses. From these data, we generated a protein-protein interactome modeling the evolution of lung inflammation during COVID-19 from inception to an established cytokine release syndrome. This predictive model assembling severe COVID-19-related proteins supports a role for known contributors to the cytokine storm such as IL1β, IL6, TNFα, JAK2, but also less prominent actors such as IL17, IL23 and C5a. Importantly our analysis points out to alarmins such as TSLP, IL33, members of the S100 family and their receptors (ST2, RAGE) as targets of major therapeutic interest. By evaluating the network-based distances between severe COVID-19-related proteins and known drug targets, network computing identified drugs which could be repurposed to prevent or slow down progression towards severe airways inflammation. This analysis confirmed the interest of dexamethasone, JAK2 inhibitors, estrogens and further identified various drugs either available or in development interacting with the aforementioned targets. We most particularly recommend considering various inhibitors of alarmins or their receptors, currently receiving little attention in this indication, as candidate treatments for severe COVID-19.","Desvaux, Emiko; Hamon, Antoine; Hubert, Sandra; Boudjeniba, Cheïma; Chassagnol, Bastien; Swindle, Jack; Aussy, Audrey; Laigle, Laurence; Laplume, Jessica; Soret, Perrine; Jean-François, Pierre; Dupin-Roger, Isabelle; Guedj, Mickaël; Moingeon, Philippe",PLoS One,296,20

We assessed longitudinal perceptions of these adjustments among clinical research professionals. METHODS We distributed an anonymous survey assessing experiences, perceptions, and recommendations regarding COVID-19-related clinical research adjustments to cancer clinical research office personnel in May 2020 and again in November 2020. Responses were compared using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS A total of 90 of 102 invited research personnel (88%) responded. Fifty-three (59%) reported participating in both initial and follow-up surveys. The proportion of respondents reporting personal experience with COVID-19-related adjustments increased over time, particularly for remote initial consent (29% v 4%), remote reconsent (24% v 9%), and remote study monitoring (36% v 22%). Perceived impact of COVID-19-related adjustments on data quality (P = .02) and patient experience (P = .002) improved significantly. However, perceived effect on patient safety (P = .02) and respondent's experience (P = .09) became less favorable.

As a result, many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass quarantines ('lock-downs') to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or semi-automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled-up community testing, has been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted such technology must overcome several challenges. Methods and analysis We will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID-19. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO Medical COVID information portal, OVID Global Health, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, BioRxiv, and arXiv for peer-reviewed and pre-print papers on automated or semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing of COVID-19, another respiratory disease with pandemic potential (limited to SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza), or Ebola, in human populations.

Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and digestive tract diseases, several coronaviruses are responsible for porcine diarrhea, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and emerging swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Those viruses have caused huge economic losses and are considered as potential public health threats. Porcine torovirus (PToV) and coronaviruses, sharing similar genomic structure and replication strategy, belong to the same order Nidovirales. Here, we developed a multiplex TaqMan-probe-based real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of PEDV, PDCoV, PToV, and SADS-CoV for the first time. Specific primers and TaqMan fluorescent probes were designed targeting the ORF1a region of PDEV, PToV, and SADS-CoV and the ORF1b region of PDCoV. The method showed high sensitivity and specificity, with a detection limit of 1 × 10(2) copies/μL for each pathogen.

Diseases such as epiglottitis and diphtheria may show diminished incidence but they have not gone away and their clinical features and essential management remain unchanged. Paradoxically, perhaps, some conditions such as Lemierre’s syndrome appear to be making a comeback. In these instances, clinicians need to be alert to these less common conditions, not only in regard to the disease itself but also to potentially serious complications.

The virion has the unique ability of forming a complex with lipoproteins, which is known as the lipoviroparticle. Lipoprotein components as well as the envelope proteins, E1 and E2, play a key role in virus entry into the hepatocyte. HCV entry is a complex multistep process involving sequential interactions with several cell surface proteins. The virus relies on glycosaminoglycans and possibly the low-density lipoprotein receptors to attach to cells. Furthermore, four specific entry factors are involved in the following steps which lead to virus internalization and fusion in early endosomes. These molecules are the scavenger receptor SRB1, tetraspanin CD81 and two tight junction proteins, Claudin-1 and Occludin. Although they are essential to HCV entry, the precise role of these molecules is not completely understood. Finally, hepatocytes are highly polarized cells and which likely affects the entry process. Our current knowledge on HCV entry is summarized in this review.","Belouzard, Sandrine; Cocquerel, Laurence; Dubuisson, Jean",Cent Eur J Biol,296,20

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage. Methods: Literatures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately. Results: Thirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). Patients who were administered statins after their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.61; OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75). The use of statins did not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.62; OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.88). Conclusion: Patients administered statins after COVID-19 diagnosis or non-ICU admitted patients were at lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users.","Chow, R.; Im, J.; Chiu, N.; Chiu, L.; Aggarwal, R.; Lee, J.; Choi, Y.-G.; Prsic, E.

Outcomes of surgical versus percutaneous and outcomes relative to tracheostomy timing were also analysed. Studies reporting outcome data on patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy were identified and screened by 2 independent reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items or Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Outcome data were analysed using a random-effects model. From 1016 unique studies, 39 articles reporting outcomes for a total of 3929 patients were included for meta-analysis. Weighted mean follow-up time was 42.03 ± 26 days post-tracheostomy. Meta-analysis showed that 61.2% of patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation [95%CI 52.6%-69.5%], 44.2% of patients were decannulated [95%CI 33.96%-54.67%], and cumulative mortality was found to be 19.23% [95%CI 15.2%-23.6%] across the entire tracheostomy cohort. The cumulative incidence of complications was 14.24% [95%CI 9.6%-19.6%], with bleeding accounting for 52% of all complications. No difference was found in incidence of mortality (RR1.96; p = 0.34), decannulation (RR1.35, p = 0.27), complications (RR0.75, p = 0.09) and time to decannulation (SMD 0.46, p = 0.68) between percutaneous and surgical tracheostomy. Moreover, no difference was found in mortality (RR1.57, p = 0.43) between early and late tracheostomy, and timing of tracheostomy did not predict time to decannulation. 10 confirmed nosocomial staff infections were reported from 1398 tracheostomies. This study provides an overview of outcomes of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients, and contributes to our understanding of tracheostomy decisions in this patient cohort.","Ferro, Ashley; Kotecha, Sanjeev; Auzinger, Georg; Yeung, Elizabeth; Fan, Kathleen",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,296,20

Consequently, investors feel pressured to find safe-haven investments during the pandemic crisis. Numerous studies have evaluated bitcoin's safe-haven properties during the COVID-19; however, the present study considered gold as a potential safe-haven for investors of renowned stock markets of Asia, Europe, and the US. The present investigation computed the ratio of gold to bitcoin (Gold_Bitcoin) and compared the safe-haven properties of gold in contrast to bitcoin. The present study analysed the Morlet Wavelet approach and found that most of the time during the COVID-19, gold investments proved to be more beneficial than bitcoin. Remarkably, the findings highlighted that the Gold_Bitcoin ratio increased in higher and lower frequencies combined with CAC40. In the long run, the return on investments in gold increased in contrast to bitcoin returns pooled with DAX30. Also, the Gold_Bitcoin ratio of the US stock market increased during the one-week and one-month cycles of January and August. Likewise, the Hang Seng Index caused the Gold_Bitcoin ratio to rise at a much higher frequency (i.e., the second half of January, the first half of February and April, and the first half of June and August), whereas IBEX35 surged Gold_Bitcoin at a lower frequency (i.e., during January, February, and August). In higher frequency bands, LSE increased the Gold_Bitcoin ratio (i.e., in February and March); nevertheless, Gold_Bitcoin showed a positive connection with FTSEMIB in the one-to-two month's frequency band (i.e., throughout January, February, and August). Interestingly, the returns on the Gold_Bitcoin ratio increased in the SSEC stock market in the high-frequency band (i.e., during March, May, and July 2020).","Shehzad, Khurram; Bilgili, Faik; Zaman, Umer; Kocak, Emrah; Kuskaya, Sevda",Resour Policy,296,33

Bat CoVs exhibit both extensive genetic diversity and a broad geographic range, indicative of a long-standing host association. Despite this, the respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission (host-jumping) in the evolution of bat coronaviruses are unclear. Using a phylogenetic approach we provide evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit clustering at the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed that cross-species transmission has been more common than co-divergence across coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts. Notably, however, an analysis of the CoV RNA polymerase phylogeny suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in short-term spill-over infections, with little evidence for sustained onward transmission in new co-roosting host species.","Leopardi, Stefania; Holmes, Edward C.; Gastaldelli, Michele; Tassoni, Luca; Priori, Pamela; Scaravelli, Dino; Zamperin, Gianpiero; De Benedictis, Paola",Infect Genet Evol,296,30

New studies investigating the tenacity of SARS-CoV-2 have highlighted its ability to persist on a myriad of surfaces for several days, including gowns and shoes. As a result, there is a global need for sterilization of a variety of potentially-contaminated items, ranging from clothing to personal protective equipment like face coverings. To this end, we have designed and constructed a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable sterilization system that uses ozone gas to inactivate viral particles. We sought to determine the efficacy of the system in the sterilization of viral particles as well as its ability to sterilize N95 respirators for reuse. N95 respirators inoculated with P22 bacteriophage and sterilized in the ozone system showed a 6-log10 reduction in viral load when treated at 25 ppm for 150 minutes. Further, N95 respirators treated with five 150-minute cycles at 35 ppm for a total concentration-time product (CT) of 26,250 ppm*min in the ozone system showed comparable filtration efficiency to untreated N95 respirators in a 50 to 200 nmr particulate challenge filtration test. Interestingly, the surgical N95 respirators tested showed complete inactivation of fluid resistance and degradation of the elasticity of polyisoprene straps after five cycles in the sterilization system. Taken together, these data suggest that while our ozone system may negatively affect certain protective aspects of surgical N95 respirators, it does effectively sterilize viral particles and can be utilized for a multitude of other use cases, including sterilizing polypropylene face coverings after potential SARS-CoV-2 contamination. In addition to providing long-term environmental benefits, deployment of this system during the ongoing pandemic reduces the risk of COVID-19 community transmission while conserving monetary resources otherwise spent on the continuous purchase of disposable face coverings.","Dave, N.; Pascavis, K.

This study evaluates the clinical and nutritional characteristics of severe and critically ill patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, and investigates the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted at West Campus of Union Hospital in Wuhan. Patients confirmed with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection by a nucleic acid‐positive test and identified as severe or critically ill, were enrolled in this study. Clinical data and outcomes information was collected and nutritional risk was assessed by using Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS). RESULTS: Totally, 413 patients were enrolled in this study, including 346 severe patients and 67 critically ill patients. Most patients, especially critically ill patients, had significant changes in nutrition‐related parameters and inflammatory markers. As for nutritional risk, the critically ill patients had significantly higher proportion of high NRS scores (P<0.001), which were correlated with inflammatory and nutrition‐related markers. Among 342 patients with NRS score ≥3, only 84 (25%) received nutritional support. The critically ill patients and the patients with higher NRS score had a higher risk of mortality and longer stay in hospital. In logistic regression models, one unit increased in NRS score was associated with the risk of mortality increased by 1.23 times (adjusted OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.10, 4.51, P = 0.026).

Some patients cannot get effective relief or suffer from serious sequelae. At present, people are studying the role of the innate immune system in viral encephalitis. Microglia, as resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS), can respond quickly to various CNS injuries including trauma, ischemia, and infection and maintain the homeostasis of CNS, but this response is not always good; sometimes, it will exacerbate damage. Studies have shown that microglia also act as a double-edged sword during viral encephalitis. On the one hand, microglia can sense ATP signals through the purinergic receptor P2Y12 and are recruited around infected neurons to exert phagocytic activity. Microglia can exert a direct antiviral effect by producing type 1 interferon (IFN-1) to induce IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression of themselves or indirect antiviral effects by IFN-1 acting on other cells to activate corresponding signaling pathways. In addition, microglia can also exert an antiviral effect by inducing autophagy or secreting cytokines. On the other hand, microglia mediate presynaptic membrane damage in the hippocampus through complement, resulting in long-term memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction in patients with encephalitis. Microglia mediate fetal congenital malformations caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. The gene expression profile of microglia in HIV encephalitis changes, and they tend to be a pro-inflammatory type. Microglia inhibited neuronal autophagy and aggravated the damage of CNS in HIV encephalitis; E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino (pelia) expressed by microglia promotes the replication of virus in neurons. The interaction between amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) produced by neurons and activated microglia during viral infection is uncertain. Although neurons can mediate antiviral effects by activating receptor-interacting protein kinases 3 (RIPK3) in a death-independent pathway, the RIPK3 pathway of microglia is unknown. Different brain regions have different susceptibility to viruses, and the gene expression of microglia in different brain regions is specific. The relationship between the two needs to be further confirmed. How to properly regulate the function of microglia and make it exert more anti-inflammatory effects is our next research direction.","Chen, Zhuangzhuang; Zhong, Di; Li, Guozhong",J Neuroinflammation,296,16

Also, comparative analyses have been made among these models by considering several important factors such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and type of optimizers with an aim to find the best suited model. The models have been validated on publicly available chest X-ray images and the best performance is obtained by ResNet-34 with an accuracy of 98.33%.

Rapid deployment in each system relied on readily available consumer-grade technology, given the existing familiarity to patients and clinicians and minimal infrastructure investment. Preliminary data from the academic medical center over one month suggested positive adoption with 631 inpatient video calls lasting an average (standard deviation) of 16.5 minutes (19.6) based on inclusion criteria. DISCUSSION: The threat of an imminent surge of COVID-19 patients drove three institutions to rapidly develop inpatient telemedicine solutions. Concurrently, federal and state regulators temporarily relaxed restrictions that would have previously limited these efforts. Strategic direction from executive leadership, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware, vendor engagement, and clinical workflow integration facilitated rapid deployment. CONCLUSION: The rapid deployment of inpatient telemedicine is feasible across diverse settings as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vilendrer, Stacie; Patel, Birju; Chadwick, Whitney; Hwa, Michael; Asch, Steven; Pageler, Natalie; Ramdeo, Rajiv; Saliba-Gustafsson, Erika A; Strong, Philip; Sharp, Christopher",J Am Med Inform Assoc,296,1

The proposed framework consists of three basic steps: preprocessing, feature selection, and applying different machine learning algorithms. The performance of the framework has taken into account different feature combinations. The simulation results show that the best performance is by integrating unigram, bigram, and trigram features.","Dashtipour, Kia; Taylor, William; Ansari, Shuja; Gogate, Mandar; Zahid, Adnan; Sambo, Yusuf; Hussain, Amir; Abbasi, Qammer H.; Imran, Muhammad Ali",Front Big Data,296,1

The aim of this study was to characterize the D614 G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, which may affect viral infectivity. METHODS: The effect of D614 G mutation on the structure and thermodynamic stability of S-protein was analyzed using DynaMut and SCooP. HDOCK and PRODIGY were used to model furin protease binding to the S-protein RARR cleavage site and calculate binding affinities. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to predict S-protein apo structure, S-protein–furin complex structure, and the free binding energy of the complex. RESULTS: The D614 G mutation in the G clade of SARS-CoV-2 strains introduced structural mobility and decreased thermal stability of S-protein (ΔΔG: −0.086 kcal/mol). The mutation resulted in a stronger binding affinity (K(d) = 1.6 × 10(−8)) to furin which may enhance S-protein cleavage. Results were corroborated by MD simulations demonstrating higher binding energy of furin to S-protein D614 mutant (−61.9 kcal/mol compared with -56.78 kcal/mol for wild-type S-protein). CONCLUSIONS: The D614 G mutation in the G clade induced the flexibility of S-protein, resulting in increased furin binding which may enhance S-protein cleave and infiltration of host cells. As such, SARS-CoV-2 D614 G mutation may result in a more virulent strain.","Mohammad, Anwar; Alshawaf, Eman; Marafie, Sulaiman K; Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Abubaker, Jehad; Al-Mulla, Fahd",Int J Infect Dis,296,9

The disease fulfills strict criteria of an antibody-mediated disease. Close to 90% of patients have antibodies directed towards the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on the post-synaptic surface of skeletal muscle and another 5% to the muscle-specific kinase, which is involved in concentrating the AChR to the muscle surface of the neuromuscular junction. Conventional treatments of intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange reduce autoantibody levels to produce their therapeutic effect, while prednisone and immunosuppressives do so by moderating autoantibody production. None of these treatments were specifically developed for MG and have a range of adverse effects. The extensive advances in monoclonal antibody technology allowing specific modulation of biological pathways has led to a tremendous increase in the potential treatment options. For MG, monoclonal antibody therapeutics target the effector mechanism of complement inhibition and the reduction of antibody levels by FcRn inhibition. Antibodies directed against CD20 and signaling pathways, which support lymphocyte activity, have been used to reduce autoantibody production. Thus far, only eculizumab, an antibody against C5, has reached the clinic. We review the present status of monoclonal antibody-based treatments for MG that have entered human testing and offer the promise to transform treatment of MG.","Alabbad, Sawsan; AlGaeed, Mohanad; Sikorski, Patricia; Kaminski, Henry J.",BioDrugs,296,16

Opportunities for greater independence were blocked because of the lockdown. Some of these young people experienced an increase in depression or other mental health difficulties. But more time at home due to public health restrictions also helped to deepen the relationship with caregivers. Service continuity is crucial, both in person and online, to support care leavers with intellectual disability and/or autism, as well as training and support to caregivers to continue with independent and interdependent living programmes at home. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: This study focuses on young people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism who, due to child welfare concerns, have grown up in children's residential care and are now transitioning out of care at the age of 18 years towards young adulthood. This transition is termed “care leaving” and the young people in transition “care leavers”. The care leaving transition can be particularly difficult for young people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism. These challenges can be magnified in a time of a global crisis like COVID‐19, which has resulted in countries being on lockdown and care leavers’ transitions being curtailed. Many mental health problems have emerged due to the COVID‐19 outbreak and resultant lockdown that may negatively impact on the care leaving transition of young people with intellectual disabilities. METHODS: Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with six care leavers with intellectual disabilities and their three caregivers in June 2020 in the Cape Peninsula region of South Africa to explore the impact of COVID‐19 on their transitional journeys. FINDINGS: Three core themes emerged from the analysis: young people evidenced regression of independence, rather than the expected growth in young adult independence, due to disruptions to routines and opportunities to move out into the world; some young people experienced an exacerbation or emergence of mental health problems, which impacted on their transition to young adulthood; and young people and their caregivers experienced a deepening of caregiver relationships, which enhanced the transition of the care leaver. CONCLUSIONS: Services must continue to facilitate progress towards independence and promote personal and caregiver well‐being. Support service for care leavers with intellectual disabilities should be essential services, offered in person or online while adhering to COVID‐19 regulations. Caregivers should be trained in continuing independent and interdependent living programmes for care leavers in their care, supported through in person or online training, mentoring and supervision. Service continuity is recommended to avoid the contraction of young people's social world at a time when it should be opening up.","Mupaku, Wendy M.; van Breda, Adrian D.; Kelly, Berni",Br J Learn Disabil,296,1

It was fought by the post-colonial people of the peninsula, and it culminated in the creation of two ideologically opposed states, but the three years’ military clash in East Asia (or the Far East) is often labelled simply as a “Forgotten War” in the West including North America. The ensuing ethnic division has been interpreted through the various geopolitical lenses of military strategy, politics, international relations, and power games. What about the situation of casualties? Which particular nations in the United Nations (UN) dispatched medical aid for the treatment of war victims? How did the Scandinavian allies participate the non-European war? What were their unique characteristics among non-military supporting nations? What legacy they left for the post-war Koreans? This paper explores the military-historical backgrounds by which each of the following Northern European nation, namely, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, decided to send unarmed skilled personnel to aid South Korea. The paper argues the social voluntarism of the neutral group in the critical insight that the field activities of Swedish Seojeon Byungwon, Danish Jutlandia, and Norwegian NORMASH individually promoted the Red Cross spirit of advanced humanitarianism on the top of mandatory duty, in giving special attention on children (orphans), women, civilians, POWs, and medical education, as well as the post-war collaboration for the initial Korean public health system in the 1960s.","Kim, David W.; Yang, Heung-Sook",East Asia (Piscataway),296,16

Low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) promotes inflammatory cervical remodeling, myometrium contractility and has been associated with shorter duration of labor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a cohort study of 136,661 deliveries 2013–2017, identified in the Swedish Pregnancy Register with prospectively collected pregnancy and labor characteristics. Information of duration of labor was retrieved from the electronic birth records and analyzed with Cox proportional hazard regressions according to previous or current thromboembolic disease (overall) with or without LMWH treatment with non-exposed as reference. RESULTS: The crude hazard ratio for vaginal delivery was not different between women with thromboembolic disease and women without thromboembolic disease (HR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.91–1.09). A lower hazard ratio for vaginal delivery was observed among women with venous thromboembolism (VTE) with concomitant LMWH use/treatment (adjusted HR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.76−0.98) compared to non-exposed, implying a longer duration of labor in these cases. CONCLUSION: Thromboembolic disease was not associated with shorter duration of labor and in presence of LMWH these women experienced longer duration of labor.","Hesselman, Susanne; Wikman, Anna; Hastie, Roxanne; Wikström, Anna-Karin; Bergman, Lina; Sandström, Anna",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol X,296,20

Besides interstitial pneumonia, a number of other clinical manifestations were noticed in COVID-19 patients. In particular, liver and spleen dysfunctions have been described both as complications of COVID-19 and as potential predisposing factors for severe COVID-19. Liver damage is rather common in COVID-19 patients, and it is most likely multifactorial, caused by the direct insult of SARS-CoV-2 to the liver by the cytokine storm triggered by the virus, by the use of hepatotoxic drugs, and as a consequence of hypoxia. Although generally mild, liver impairment has been found to be associated with a higher rate of intensive care unit admission. A higher mortality rate was reported among chronic liver disease patients. Instead, spleen impairment in patients with COVID-19 has been poorly described. The main anatomical changes are the architectural derangement of the B cell compartment, white pulp atrophy, and reduction or absence of lymphoid follicles, while, from a functional point of view, the IgM memory B cell pool is markedly depleted. The outcome of COVID-19 in asplenic or hyposplenic patients is yet to be defined. In this review, we will summarise the current knowledge regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver and spleen function, as well as the outcome of patients with a pre-existent liver disease or defective spleen function.","Cococcia, Sara; Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Santacroce, Giovanni; Achilli, Giovanna; Borrelli de Andreis, Federica; Di Sabatino, Antonio",World J Gastroenterol,296,24

To date, there are still no effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of COVID‐19. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to explore the possible mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in human lung cells. METHODS: Data interpretation was conducted by recruiting bioinformatics analysis, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways analysis using downloaded data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. RESULTS: The present study demonstrated that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection induces the upregulation of 14 interferon‐stimulated genes, indicative of immune, and interferon responses to the virus. Notably, genes for pyrimidine metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis are selectively enriched in human lung cells after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, suggesting that altered pyrimidine metabolism and steroid biosynthesis are remarkable, and perhaps druggable features after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Besides, there is a strong positive correlation between viral ORF1ab, ORF6, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in human lung cells, implying that ACE2 facilitates SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and replication in host cells probably through the induction of ORF1ab and ORF6.","Yang, Shaomin; Wu, Songbin; Yu, Zhijian; Huang, Jiabin; Zhong, Xia; Liu, Xiaodong; Zhu, Hua; Xiao, Lizu; Deng, Qiwen; Sun, Wuping",Immun Inflamm Dis,296,1

However, it is not known how plank exercises affect physical fitness and immunocyte function. This study analyzed the changes in physical fitness and immune cells of a middle-aged man after performing 4 weeks of elbow plank exercise. Materials and Methods: Elbow plank exercise was performed for approximately 20 min (resting time, around 10 min) a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The intensity was checked daily with ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). When the participant reached an intensity of RPE 15, RPE 16, and RPE 17 of the RPE 20 scale, 1 min of rest was given before repeating the process. Results: Compared with the pre-values, (1) all the physical fitness factors (muscle strength, muscle endurance, flexibility, and cardiopulmonary fitness) were increased after 4 weeks; (2) body weight, skeletal muscle mass, and the basal metabolic rate were increased, whereas body fat mass and fat percentage were decreased; and (3) although the variables of complete blood count were changed positively, some were not. Specifically, CD3, CD8, and CD56 were increased, whereas CD4, CD4/CD8, and cytotoxicity were decreased. These results show that elbow plank exercise can improve all factors of physical fitness and improve some of the immunocyte functions of a middle-aged man. Conclusions: This study confirmed that, although the elbow plank exercise of vigorous intensity for 4 weeks improved physical fitness, it was not effective in improving some immunocyte functions. Therefore, the exercise intensity of plank exercises for improving immunocyte functions should be reconsidered.","Park, Sang-Kyun; Lee, Ki-Soo; Heo, Seung-Jae; Jee, Yong-Seok",Medicina (Kaunas),296,1

Without a pharmaceutical solution, governments have been forced to implement regulations and public policies to control social behavior and prevent the spread of the virus. There is dramatic evidence of the social and economic effects of these measures and their disparate impact on vulnerable communities. Individuals living in urban informal settlements are in a structurally disadvantaged position to cope with a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the socioeconomic impact of the crisis brought by the pandemic in informal settlements in Chile. We use a three-wave panel study to compare the situation in informal settlements before and during the health crisis. We show that households living in informal settlements are paying a high toll. Their employment loss is dramatic, substantially larger than the loss reported in the general population, and has particularly affected the inmigrant population. We also find that the pandemic has triggered neighborhood cooperation within the settlements. Targeted government assistance programs have reached these communities; however, this group's coverage is not enough to counteract the magnitude of the crisis. Our results suggest that governments, the non-profit sector, and the community need to urgently provide economic support and protections to individuals living in informal settlements and consider this opportunity for long-term improvements in these marginalized communities.","Gil, D.; Dominguez, P.; Undurraga, E.

Women living with HIV who become pregnant or who acquire the virus during pregnancy are at risk of both maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality mainly if the virus is poorly controlled. Furthermore, there is a risk of vertical transmission to the fetus during pregnancy labour and postpartum through breastfeeding. Appropriate management must be instituted to reduce the consequences of HIV in pregnancy, ideally starting with preconception counselling and planning pregnancies when the viral load is minimum. During pregnancy, an appropriate combined anti-retroviral (cART) medication is mandatory with very close monitoring of the viral load, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts, blood counts, liver and kidney function tests. Planning delivery should not be different in women on cART and suppressed viral loads. However, special care must be taken to limit vertical transmission in those who present late and in whom viral load is unknown or not controlled at the time of delivery. Breastfeeding remains a potential source of infection for the baby and is being discouraged in high-income countries for women living with HIV; however, in low-income countries, the recommendation is exclusive breastfeeding. If breastfeeding must happen, it is best when viral load is suppressed, and cART continued until weaning. Serodiscordant couples present unique problems, and their management should begin with the planning of pregnancy. Emphasis should be on taking steps to prevent HIV transmission to the negative partner and vertical transmission to the new-born.","Chilaka, Victor N.; Konje, Justin C.",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,296,24

Automated tools are needed to remotely monitor all the pigs on the farm and provide early alerts to the farm caretaker for situations that need immediate attention. With this goal, we developed a sensor board that can be mounted on the ears of individual pigs to generate data on the animal’s activity, vocalization, and temperature. The generated data will be used to develop machine learning models to classify the behavioral traits associated with each animal over a testing period. A number of factors influencing the technology adoption by farm caretakers are also discussed. ABSTRACT: Precision swine production can benefit from autonomous, noninvasive, and affordable devices that conduct frequent checks on the well-being status of pigs. Here, we present a remote monitoring tool for the objective measurement of some behavioral indicators that may help in assessing the health and welfare status—namely, posture, gait, vocalization, and external temperature. The multiparameter electronic sensor board is characterized by laboratory measurements and by animal tests. Relevant behavioral health indicators are discussed for implementing machine learning algorithms and decision support tools to detect animal lameness, lethargy, pain, injury, and distress. The roadmap for technology adoption is also discussed, along with challenges and the path forward. The presented technology can potentially lead to efficient management of farm animals, targeted focus on sick animals, medical cost savings, and less use of antibiotics.","Pandey, Santosh; Kalwa, Upender; Kong, Taejoon; Guo, Baoqing; Gauger, Phillip C.; Peters, David J.; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin",Animals (Basel),296,21

The patients included 9 men and 3 women with a median age of 50 years (range 23–74), median Charlson Comorbidity Score of 2 (range 0–7), and median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score of 13 (range 5–33) at the time of IVIG. The IVIG total dose ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 g/kg (median 1.25 g/kg) distributed over 1–4 daily doses. The most common regimen received was 0.5 g/kg daily for 3 days. The median time to IVIG administration was 9 days (range 0–48 days) after admission. The median time from first IVIG dose administration to hospital discharge was 14 days (range 3–48). The 5 patients who received IVIG ≤4 days of admission demonstrated a significantly shorter length of hospital stay after treatment (median 7 days, range 3–14 days) than the 7 patients who received it >7 days after admission (median 33 days, range 8–48 days, p = 0.03, Mann-Whitney U test). These cases demonstrate that IVIG may improve the clinical state of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. Despite very high illness severity scores, all patients survived hospital discharge. No thrombotic events occurred and IVIG was well tolerated, despite most cases demonstrating very elevated D-dimer suggestive of active intravascular fibrinolysis. We believe that IVIG warrants immediate clinical trial evaluation in COVID-19 to confirm its role as a mainstay treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection as a means to reduce hospital stay and utilization of ICU resources, including mechanical ventilation, and potentially reduce mortality.","Herth, Felix J.F.; Sakoulas, George; Haddad, Fadi",Respiration,296,20
