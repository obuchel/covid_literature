29069,Oseltamivir/zanamivir: Lack of efficacy leading to fatal influenza A (H1N1) infection: case report,2013-01-17,"In this paper, we consider sentences that contain multiple in-text references (MIR) and their position in the rhetorical structure of articles. We carry out the analysis of MIR in a large-scale dataset of about 80,000 research articles published by the Public Library of Science in 7 journals. We analyze two major characteristics of MIR: their positions in the IMRaD structure of articles and the number of in-text references that make up a MIR in the different journals. We show that MIR are rather frequent in all sections of the rhetorical structure. In the Introduction section, sentences containing MIR account for more than half of the sentences with references. We examine the syntactic patterns that are most used in the contexts of both multiple and single in-text references and show that they are composed, for the most part, of noun groups. We point out the specificity of the Methods section in this respect.","Bertin, Marc; Atanassova, Iana",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149021/,755

They defined two stability notions, strongly stable noncrossing matching (SSNM) and weakly stable noncrossing matching (WSNM), depending on the strength of blocking pairs. They proved that a WSNM always exists and presented an [Formula: see text]-time algorithm to find one for an instance with n men and n women. They also posed open questions of the complexities of determining existence of an SSNM and finding a largest WSNM. In this paper, we show that both problems are solvable in polynomial time.

Data about the safety of propofol use during ECMO has been contradictory. We aimed to investigate associated risks of propofol use on oxygenator lifespan and to explore the effect of propofol use on oxygenator membranes when therapeutic anticoagulation was omitted. Adult respiratory ECMO patients who received propofol were retrospectively compared with those who did not, and outcomes were assessed by means of duration of oxygenator functionality before requiring an exchange, and number of exchanges during propofol use and/or ECMO support. Out of the 63patients included in the analysis, 46%received propofol during ECMO as part of sedation regimen. The use of propofol was not found to be associated with an increased incidence of oxygenator failure when compared with cohorts who did not receive propofol (21% propofol arm vs. 6% control, p = 0.13). When analyzed for anticoagulation omission effects, propofol did not increase the risk of oxygenator failure (p = 0.63). The only predictor that statistically predicted the risk of oxygenator failure was development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) during ECMO. The results of this study further support the previously reported safety of propofol utilization during respiratory ECMO even in the absence of anticoagulation.","Bakdach, Dana; Akkari, Abdelrauof; Gazwi, Khaled; Deloso, Ferdinand; Tan, Darwin; Ibrahim, Abdulsalam; Abdussalam, Ahmad; Hassan, Ibrahim",ASAIO J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326318/,755

When the length of the backtrack is large, the solver can end up reproducing many of the same decisions and propagations when it redescends the search tree. Different techniques have been proposed to reduce this potential redundancy, e.g., partial/chronological backtracking and trail saving on restarts. In this paper we present a new trail saving technique that is not restricted to restarts, unlike prior trail saving methods. Our technique makes a copy of the part of the trail that is backtracked over. This saved copy can then be used to improve the efficiency of the solver’s subsequent redescent. Furthermore, the saved trail also provides the solver with the ability to look ahead along the previous trail which can be exploited to improve its efficiency. Our new trail saving technique offers different tradeoffs in comparison with chronological backtracking and often yields superior performance. We also show that our technique is able to improve the performance of state-of-the-art solvers.","Hickey, Randy; Bacchus, Fahiem",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326469/,755

Flow-based programming is one of the programming paradigms. All of the processes and data are represented as nodes, and we connect processes and data with edges. We call the figure with nodes and edges graph because the figure looks like a planar graph. There is a lot of software implementing flow-based programming. However, there are few mathematical software based on a flow-based programming environment. So, we develop experimental interactive geometry software to generate kaleidoscope patterns based on flow-based programming. The software shows us some advantages of flow-based programming. First, it is easy to understand the procedure of construction. Second, flow-based programming is flexible. Third, flow-based programming has high extensibility.

37185,Tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate: Elevation in ALP: case report,2020-07-25,"BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is common during daily nursing procedures (DNPs) routinely performed on mechanically ventilated patients. The impact of automated ventilation on the incidence and severity of blood oxygen desaturation during DNPs remains unknown. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled crossover trial was carried out in a French intensive care unit to compare blood oxygen pulse saturation (SpO(2)) during DNPs performed on patients mechanically ventilated in automated and conventional ventilation modes (AV and CV, respectively). All patients with FiO(2) ≤ 60% and without prone positioning or neuromuscular blocking agents were included. Patients underwent two DNPs on the same day using AV (INTELLiVENT-ASV®) and CV (volume control, biphasic positive airway pressure, or pressure support ventilation) in a randomized order. The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent with SpO(2) in the acceptable range of 90–95% during the DNP. RESULTS: Of the 265 included patients, 93% had been admitted for a medical pathology, the majority for acute respiratory failure (52%). There was no difference between the two periods in terms of DNP duration, sedation requirements, or ventilation parameters, but patients had more spontaneous breaths and lower peak airway pressures during the AV period (p < 0.001). The percentage of time spent with SpO(2) in the acceptable range during DNPs was longer in the AV period than in the CV period (48 ± 37 vs. 43 ± 37, percentage of DNP period; p = 0.03). After adjustment, AV was associated with a higher number of DNPs carried out with SpO(2) in the acceptable range (odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.6; p = 0.001) and a lower incidence of blood oxygen desaturation ≤ 85% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.85; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: AV appears to reduce the incidence and severity of blood oxygen desaturation during daily nursing procedures (DNPs) in comparison to CV.

37397,Clozapine/tocilizumab: Various toxicities: 3 case reports,2020-08-01,"Without clear federal mandates protecting the rights of transgender and gender nonconforming people, local governments are drafting their own legislation that either protects or limits these populations’ rights. This leaves street-level bureaucrats situated in between competing auspices, conflicting mandates, and a constrained sense of self-determination when they are tasked with applying emerging legislation in a policy gray area. This paper considers the policy logic of an intersectional approach to LGBTQ policy, as well as the implementation barriers street-level bureaucrats may face when operationalizing LGBTQ policy in a politically complex environment. First, we use a piece of local legislation designed by transgender and LGB youth as an implementation case study focused on policy logic and policy triggers. Second, we employ thematic analysis for analyzing open-ended responses to 281 surveys completed by teachers and other school staff after training around implementation of a new district-wide policy anchored in an intersectional approach. Beyond normative, protracted implementation timelines, even when front-line workers were in full support of LGBTQ rights, tension still surfaces around the internalization of bureaucracy, fear of disciplinary sanctions, a perception of competing rights, and ambivalence with mediating between personal, familial, and youth agency. Even when using equity-focused policy approaches, stakeholders can expect to encounter implementation barriers with street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) while trying to influence higher orders of government through local advocacy and action. Altering the discourse on gender identity remains difficult in the current political environment surrounding LGBTQ rights.

37406,Hydroxychloroquine: Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis: case report,2020-08-01,"Intermediate filaments (IFs) play key roles in cell mechanics, signaling and homeostasis. Their assembly and dynamics are finely regulated by posttranslational modifications. The type III IFs, vimentin, desmin, peripherin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), are targets for diverse modifications by oxidants and electrophiles, for which their conserved cysteine residue emerges as a hot spot. Pathophysiological examples of these modifications include lipoxidation in cell senescence and rheumatoid arthritis, disulfide formation in cataracts and nitrosation in endothelial shear stress, although some oxidative modifications can also be detected under basal conditions. We previously proposed that cysteine residues of vimentin and GFAP act as sensors for oxidative and electrophilic stress, and as hinges influencing filament assembly. Accumulating evidence indicates that the structurally diverse cysteine modifications, either per se or in combination with other posttranslational modifications, elicit specific functional outcomes inducing distinct assemblies or network rearrangements, including filament stabilization, bundling or fragmentation. Cysteine-deficient mutants are protected from these alterations but show compromised cellular performance in network assembly and expansion, organelle positioning and aggresome formation, revealing the importance of this residue. Therefore, the high susceptibility to modification of the conserved cysteine of type III IFs and its cornerstone position in filament architecture sustains their role in redox sensing and integration of cellular responses. This has deep pathophysiological implications and supports the potential of this residue as a drug target.","Viedma-Poyatos, Álvaro; Pajares, María A.; Pérez-Sala, Dolores",Redox Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381704/,755

Gathering information from the recent literature, results showed that there are number of causes around such stigma that include misinformation, feeling of insecurity, fear of responsibility, administrative malfunction, and lack of trust on treatment. These causes of stigma have number of forms such as humor-prone stigma, residential stigma, organizational stigma, community-stigma, and apathetical stigma.

However, there are limited data on the effect of different oxygen regimens on survival and neurological disability in HIE patients. METHODS: We undertook a post-hoc analysis of the 166 patients with suspected HIE enrolled in a trial comparing conservative oxygen therapy with usual oxygen therapy in 1000 mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The primary endpoint for the current analysis was death or unfavourable neurological outcome at day 180. Key secondary outcomes were day 180 mortality, and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Patients with HIE allocated to conservative oxygen spent less time in the ICU with an SpO(2) ≥ 97% (26 h [interquartile range (IQR) 13–45 vs. 35 h [IQR 19–70], absolute difference, 9 h; 95% CI − 21.4 to 3.4). A total of 43 of 78 patients (55.1%) assigned to conservative oxygen and 49 of 72 patients (68.1%) assigned to usual oxygen died or had an unfavourable neurological outcome at day 180; odds ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.3–1.12; P = 0.1 adjusted odds ratio 0.54; 95% CI 0.23–1.26; P = 0.15. A total of 37 of 86 patients (43%) assigned to conservative oxygen and 46 of 78 (59%) assigned to usual oxygen had died by day 180; odds ratio 0.53; 95% CI 0.28–0.98; P = 0.04; adjusted odds ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.25–1.23; P = 0.15. Cause-specific mortality was similar by treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative oxygen therapy was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in death or unfavourable neurological outcomes at day 180.

38146,Dexamethasone: Lack of efficacy: case report,2020-08-22,"BACKGROUND: Radiological examinations of COVID-19 positive patients play a vital role in early diagnosis and assessment of disease course, as most COVID-19 infected patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic CT imaging patterns. Asymptomatic infected individuals, called “asymptomatic carrier or transmitter”, who are the infectious sources of SARS-CoV-2, and some of them progress rapidly, even resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high case-fatality rate. Our study is a prospective study and aims to be familiar with the CT imaging features of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 44 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia between March 20, 2020 and May 23, 2020 were enrolled. All patients had a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or recent travel history. All patients had no symptoms. The predominant feature of CT findings in this cross-sectional study was ground-glass opacity (GGO) (41, 93%) with peripheral (34, 77.3%) distribution, bilateral location (20, 45.5%) with lower lobe predominance (left lower lobe 72% and right lower lobe 50%). CONCLUSION: CT imaging of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia has highly characteristics findings. Since asymptomatic patients are the asymptomatic transmitter, and some patients can progress rapidly in the short term, it is essential to early diagnose asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. CT scan has great sensitivity in screening and detecting patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ali, Rasha Mostafa Mohamed; Ghonimy, Mai Bahgat Ibrahim",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432457/,755

38348,Norepinephrine: Lack of efficacy: case report.,2020-08-29,"This paper is written as the world faces economic recovery after the Covid pandemic collapse. It also responds to the article in Sustainable Earth by Peter Hancock ‘In Praise of Civicide’ by creating a more hopeful vision of the future. Peter suggests the only hope is in psychological mind-sets that can change behaviour as nothing else will stop the path to destruction from present growth in population, the economy and technology. Rather than seeing inevitable civicidal elements, as devised in the IPAT model used by Peter and many others to explain global environmental destruction, the paper reassesses the fundamentals of this model developed by Paul and Anne Ehrlich in the 1960's. As the global economy has collapsed and environmental impacts improved everywhere, the Hancock argument based on IPAT would seem to have support. The paper shows how it is possible to grow again in the three IPAT factors if the world moves beyond sustainable development which just minimises impact to regenerative development which reclaims environmental impacts. If all three elements combine to create uncontrolled growth as was happening in the 60’s to 80’s then civicide is inevitable, but not if they change to regenerative development. The three stages of exploitive, sustainable and regenerative development turn IPAT from being negative to positive about civilization. These choices are very stark in the 2020’s. The technological possibilities of a regenerative future are outlined and the fundamentals needed for a sustainable earth are sketched, providing some evidence of hope for using the present pandemic and economic collapse as the basis for regenerating civilization not praising civicide.","Newman, Peter",Sustain Earth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7443615/,755

Previous studies on OmpA usually focus on its interaction with the host cells and its role in vaccine development. However, the impact of OmpA on the virulence of S. maltophilia to host cells and the effects on apoptosis remain unclear. In this study, we exposed purified recombinant S. maltophilia OmpA (rOmpA) to HEp-2 cells and investigated the effects of OmpA on epithelial cell apoptosis. Morphologic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that HEp-2 cells stimulated with rOmpA multiple apoptosis features, including nuclear roundness and pyknosis, chromatin aggregation, and phosphatidylserine eversion. We found that rOmpA regulated the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-xL in HEp-2 cells, leading to changes in mitochondria permeability and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factors into the cytoplasm. These subsequently activate the caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway that promote apoptosis. We also observed that rOmpA enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species and increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels in HEp-2 cells. Collectively, our data suggested that rOmpA induced epithelial cells apoptosis via mi-tochondrial pathways.

Physical exercise is considered important for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) to slow down disease progression and maintain abilities and quality of life. However, people with PD often experience barriers to exercises that causes low-level adherence to exercise plans and programs. Virtual Reality (VR) is an innovative and promising technology for motor and cognitive rehabilitation. Immersive VR exergames have potential advantages by allowing for individualized skill practice in a motivating interactive environment without distractions from outside events. This paper presents an immersive virtual reality (VR) exergame aiming at motor training on fingers and hand-and-eye coordination. The results from the usability study indicate that immersive VR exergames have potential to provide motivating and engaging physical exercise for people with PD.

The analytical focus of this paper is on two key survey questions related to specific barriers and opportunities (most critical use-cases) for adopting mHealth/mRehab interventions. We present response data to these two questions segmented by clinical specialty – physical, occupational, speech and recreation therapy – to identify possible variation between and among these rehabilitation professions. This analysis provides a detailed map of the terrain of clinician expectations and experiences for the adoption and implementation of mHealth/mRehab interventions in the United States, and possibly other countries. Results show substantial support for mRehab interventions and technologies across all four clinical specialties. The most frequently identified barriers to effective use of mobile and internet technologies to support patients remotely focused on patients (ability to learn and use the technology, and internet access), not clinicians. The was more variability among clinical specializations regarding best use-cases. Tracking patient adherence to prescribed activities and supporting patients in the home and community were the most frequently cited best use cases across the whole sample.","Morris, John; Thompson, Nicole; Wallace, Tracey; Jones, Mike; DeRuyter, Frank",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479793/,755

Quantitative and qualitative data are reported on user experiences with mHealth apps to map the behavior, interests and needs of people with specific types of disability (physical, cognitive, sensory, emotional/psychological, and speech). Summary results are presented for all respondents and each disability type. Slightly more than half of the participants in this sample (53.2%) reported using mHealth apps. Fitness and exercise apps were the mHealth apps most used by respondents with disabilities, followed by hospital/clinical portal apps. Symptom and disease management apps are the least commonly used, even though these would seem to be important for people with chronic conditions. Text-based responses regarding unmet needs for mHealth apps can be sorted into accessibility needs and functionality needs. In general, respondents with sensory limitations were more likely to identify accessibility needs. However, all disability groups identified both types of unmet needs. These results can help inform research and development efforts to provide mHealth apps that meet the needs of people with disabilities.","Lippincot, Ben; Thompson, Nicole; Morris, John; Jones, Mike; DeRuyter, Frank",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479794/,755

Therefore, this article proposes a new framework of cascaded deep learning classifiers to enhance the performance of these CAD systems for highly suspected COVID-19 and pneumonia diseases in X-ray images. Our proposed deep learning framework constitutes two major advancements as follows. First, complicated multi-label classification of X-ray images have been simplified using a series of binary classifiers for each tested case of the health status. That mimics the clinical situation to diagnose potential diseases for a patient. Second, the cascaded architecture of COVID-19 and pneumonia classifiers is flexible to use different fine-tuned deep learning models simultaneously, achieving the best performance of confirming infected cases. This study includes eleven pre-trained convolutional neural network models, such as Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG) and Residual Neural Network (ResNet). They have been successfully tested and evaluated on public X-ray image dataset for normal and three diseased cases. The results of proposed cascaded classifiers showed that VGG16, ResNet50V2, and Dense Neural Network (DenseNet169) models achieved the best detection accuracy of COVID-19, viral (Non-COVID-19) pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia images, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of our cascaded deep learning classifiers is superior to other multi-label classification methods of COVID-19 and pneumonia diseases in previous studies. Therefore, the proposed deep learning framework presents a good option to be applied in the clinical routine to assist the diagnostic procedures of COVID-19 infection.","Karar, Mohamed Esmail; Hemdan, Ezz El-Din; Shouman, Marwa A.",Complex Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7507595/,755

The aim of this work was to calculate the costs of strabismus surgery at a university hospital and to assess the remuneration of costs for outpatient procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Of all strabismus surgeries at the Hanover Medical School in the years 2018 and 2019, relevant surgical data, such as patient age, number of muscles operated on, incision to suture time, attendance time of the surgeons and anesthetists as well as the nursing staff, were evaluated based on the clinics own information system. During this process, the costs for personnel, material, room rental charges and overheads were computed applying cost unit accounting. RESULTS: A total of 302 operations (inpatient proportion 92.1%) were carried out in most cases with the patient under general anesthesia. The mean patient age was 31 years (median 26 years), with 33 patients being children under 6 years of age. On average 1.84 muscles were treated per intervention. The mean incision to suture time was 51.5 min, mean anesthesia time was 85 min, the attendance time of surgical as well as anesthesia nursing staff each accounted for 104 min, the additional time in the postanesthesia care unit added 66 min. Average personnel costs originating from the overall process amounted to 642.14 €, with the addition of 109.23 € for material and medication (surgery and anesthesia) and costs for cleaning and room rental (including overheads) of 178.71 €. Therefore, the overall costs of an average strabismus surgery in our collective added up to 930.08 € (minimum 491.01 €, maximum 1729.29 €). Cost accounting of subgroups yielded substantially higher costs for anesthesia in children as well as for higher numbers of muscles operated on due to different treatment duration (37 min for 1 muscle to 72 min for 3 muscles) and anesthesia time, especially in children <6 years of age (on average 22 min longer than adults and children >5 years; the differences being 11 min for 1 muscle, 25 min for 2 muscles and 30 min for 3 or more muscles). The pure costs of a strabismus surgery at this clinic seem on average to exceed the revenues for strabismus surgery in the outpatient sector calculated by the German uniform evaluation benchmark (EBM) by about a factor of 2. CONCLUSION: It could be shown that the purely economically calculated costs for strabismus surgery at a university clinic are significantly higher than the revenues achieved in the outpatient sector according to paragraph 115b, section 1, of the Social Security Act V (SGB V). Under these circumstances, such operations cannot be performed in a cost-effective manner.","Framme, C.; Gottschling, J.; Kuiper, T.; Lobbes, W.; Palmaers, T.; Brockmann, D.; Lagrèze, W.

Summed to this problem is the still undervalued accountability of economic and environmental sustainability in most nations. Many densely population settled cities around the world account for up to 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions mainly because of their substantial use of energy for buildings, industries, and transportation. Continued increases in urbanization are also driving more exposure to air pollution, water shortages, and waste-related risks to the population. This research aimed to show key connections between the multi-sectoral and interdependent determinants of health. The method followed a systematic review of primary and secondary data on various topics, including global health, environmental health indicators, socio-economic factors, and linkages between economic and environmental sustainability. Literature determines by 2050, 66% of the world's population projected to inhabit urban areas mostly. In 2012, the global burden of disease study by using the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) metric estimated that 23% of global deaths were attributable to the environment. DALYs metric compares years of life lost due to mortality and years of life lost due to disability by a specific cause, including the burden of risk factors, diseases, lifestyles, or individual's socio-economic status. Leading causes globally due to road traffic injuries, interpersonal violence, and suicide, take a substantial toll on those socio-economic factors. Health is a crucial attribute of human development in the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) achievable by scaling up the implementation of these goals in universal, holistic, and inclusive pathways. Hence, advancing sustainability policies to prosperous, healthier humanity. KEY MESSAGES: Public health's diverse components attained when there is a shared vision in the multidisciplinary teams to disease prevention and health promotion of all individuals that make up societies. Research and science communication should translate both the ideas of scientific progress and its implications for policies, economies and people's lifestyle choices.","Negrón-Martínez, E",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543532/,755

For over two months of stay-at-home, houses became the only place where people slept, ate, worked, practiced sports, and socialized. As consolidated evidence exists on housing as a determinant of health, it is of great interest to explore the impact that COVID-19 response-related lockdown measures had on mental health and wellbeing. METHODS: We conducted a large web-based survey on 9261 subjects in Northern Italy, one of the Regions most heavily hit by the pandemic in Europe. Participants were recruited among university staff, faculty and students. The questions included socio-demographic features of the participants; international evaluation scales designed to recognize depressive-, anxiety- and sleep-related symptoms, impulsivity, quality of life; architectural parameters investigating housing physical characteristics. RESULTS: As emerges from our analysis poor housing is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms during lockdown. In particular, living in apartments < 60 m2, with poor quality view and indoor area is associated with, respectively, 1.31 (95CI), 1.368 (95CI), and 2.253 (95CI) time the risk of moderate/severe and severe depressive symptoms. Subjects reporting worsened working performance from home were over four times more likely to also report depression (OR = 4.28, 95%CI). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest housing played a major role in influencing people mental health and wellbeing during COVID-19 pandemic. We argue strengthened multi-interdisciplinary approach involving urban planning, public mental health, environmental health, epidemiology, and sociology, is needed to inform the planning implementation and monitoring of housing policies centered on population health. KEY MESSAGES: COVID-19 lockdown mitigation measures strongly impacted on Mental Health. Living in apartments < 60 m2, with poor quality view and indoor area significatively increase the risk of moderate and severe depressive symptoms.","Morganti, A; Brambilla, A; Amerio, A; Aguglia, A; Odone, A; Costanza, A; Signorelli, C; Serafini, G; Amore, M; Capolongo, S",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543536/,755

Therefore, this study aimed to compare the long-term outcomes and aortic reintervention rates between open repair and TEVAR in patients with descending thoracic aortic pathologies. METHODS: Between January 2002 and December 2017, 230 patients with descending thoracic aortic pathologies underwent surgery. Of these, 136 patients were included in this retrospective study: 45 patients (10, 2, and 33 with dissection, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and pseudoaneurysm, respectively) underwent open repair and 91 patients (27, 1, and 63 with dissection, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and pseudoaneurysm, respectively) underwent TEVAR. The primary end points were in-hospital mortality, and short-term complications. The secondary end points were long-term mortality and reintervention rates. Based on the propensity score matching (PSM), 35 patients who underwent open repair were matched to 35 patients who underwent TEVAR (ratio = 1:1). RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 70.2 ± 51.9 months. Shorter intensive care unit and hospital stay were seen in the TEVAR group than in the open repair group before and after PSM (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, in-hospital mortality, and spinal cord ischemia were not significantly different among the two groups (before PSM: p = 0.068 and p = 0.211, respectively; after PSM: p = 0.303 and p = 0.314, respectively). The cumulative all-cause death and aorta-related death showed no significant differences between the two groups (before PSM: p = 0.709 and p = 0.734, respectively; after PSM: p = 0.888 and p = 0.731, respectively). However, aortic reintervention rates were higher in the TEVAR group than in the open repair group before and after PSM (p = 0.006 and p = 0.013, respectively). CONCLUSION: The TEVAR group was superior in short-term recovery outcomes but had higher reintervention rates compared to the open repair group. However, there were no significant differences in long-term survival between the two groups.","Son, Shin-Ah; Jung, Hanna; Cho, Joon Yong",BMC Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607549/,755

More critically, mounting socio-ecological pressures are compounded by increasing climate change and enduring social vulnerabilities, thereby challenging traditional policies and paradigms of growth and sustainability. Drawing on previous studies of inclusive development and community well-being, this research paper frames and extends the phenomenon of over-tourism from a political economic perspective. Based on a historical account of small island tourism development, an in-depth case study of Aruba is presented. Recognized internationally as the ‘One Happy Island’ and one of the most tourism-dependent small island economies, the findings yield a contextualized understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of over-tourism, and identify the main antecedents and effects of over-tourism. The study discusses the evolving economic disconnectedness, environmental decay, social inequality, and institutional failures. The findings describe the role of institutional capture and policy drift which stem primarily from political as well as market forces, and have resulted in a gradual marginalization of community well-being and agency. The paper proposes an extended conceptualization of over-tourism in small island tourism economies by explicitly recognizing that the crux of the over-tourism conundrum in SITE is political in nature and institutional by nurture. Recommendations are provided for transitioning towards community-driven development by building capabilities and pathways for innovation, internalization, and institutionalization in order to strengthen the resilience of small island tourism development.","Peterson, Ryan R.",Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7643527/,755

41999,Heparin/warfarin: Upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding: 2 case reports,2020-11-14,"Over the past few decades, access to abundant and easily available fossil sources aided in remarkable advancements in technologies and rapid urbanization. The unparalleled growth in population and migration of rural residents to the urban areas have transformed cities to hotspots for major anthropogenic activities, seminal contact points between natural and socio-economic activities, and areas responsible for generation of more than 80% of gross domestic product (GDP). This has placed cities at a crossroad of facing environmental grand challenges posed by population expansion, climate change, and depleting resources. Ushered by these problems, cities are directing the course of waste utilization towards sustainable production and consumption strategies by adopting the principles of circular economy (CE). This organic waste generated in huge quantities can be considered as a valuable resource in the urban biocycles. The present article highlights the importance of looping back this biogenic organic waste (domestic) to a certain extent in a decentralized way. It offers an eco-centric view to adopt circular urban food practices by constructing and operating a keyhole garden (KHG) as a case study. This approach works in synergy with nature and adopts the principles of biomimicry and cradle to cradle, wherein waste is reintroduced into the system as input resources or is metamorphosed to valuable materials. It underlines the role of CE approaches to spark this transformation and strategically direct the flow of valuable domestic waste resources to close the urban nutrient loops in a decentralized and regenerative approach. While the solutions to close the loop and recycle wastes address the end of pipe problems, the community-based innovation strategies aim at building resilience, producing food more locally, limiting the use of fertilizers, conserving water, and also combating climate change.

Diabetes mellitus is one of commonest noncommunicable diseases associated with worsening clinical status in COVID-19 patients. SUMMARY: The aim of this review was to evaluate the receptors and pathogenetic link between diabetes and COVID-19. Both disease conditions involve inflammation with the release of inflammatory markers. The roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme molecule and dipeptidyl peptidase were explored to show their involvement in COVID-19 and diabetes. Pathogenetic mechanisms such as impaired immunity, microangiopathy, and glycemic variability may explain the effect of diabetes on recovery of COVID-19 patients. The effect of glucocorticoids and catecholamines, invasion of the pancreatic islet cells, drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19, and the lockdown policy may impact negatively on glycemic control of diabetic patients. The outcome studies between diabetic and nondiabetic patients with COVID-19 were also reviewed. Some drug trials are still ongoing to determine the suitability or otherwise of some drugs used in diabetic patients with COVID-19, such as dapagliflozin trial and linagliptin trial.","Ugwueze, Chidiebere V.; Ezeokpo, Basil Chukwuma; Nnolim, Bede I.; Agim, Emmanuel A.; Anikpo, Nnamdi C.; Onyekachi, Kenechukwu E.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649685/,755

42010,Norepinephrine/vasopressin: Lack of efficacy: case report,2020-11-14,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent of pneumonia cases in China. This virus is spread by coughing or sneezing and can infect other persons by on contacting mucous membranes. SARS-Cov-2 most frequent serious manifestation is pneumonia. Chest computed tomography in COVID-19 patients usually shows ground-glass opacities that may be accompanied by consolidation lesions. Early diagnosis of the disease and rapid isolation of the patient is of great importance. So far, confirmation of COVID-19 infection is made by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens. Recent research reported that the sensitivity of computed tomography in diagnosing COVID-19 is 98% while RT-PCR sensitivity is 71%. Herein, we compare the sensitivity of both chest CT and RT-PCR in diagnosing COVID-19 at initial patient presentation through a meta-analysis study. MAIN BODY: Using MEDLINE database a systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant published studies within from November 2019 to April 2020. Only articles with full text were examined to determine eligibility and extract data by two reviewers. It was decided to include studies mentioning sensitivity of chest CT scan and sensitivity of RT-PCR and both done at the same time. RESULTS: Potentially relevant 15,300 studies were identified in our search in MEDLINE whose titles were quickly reviewed. Potentially eligible studies missing any of the forementioned inclusion criteria were excluded. This process left 7 eligible articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were thus included in the meta-analysis and used for further analyses. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis study showed that chest CT may be beneficial in early detection of cases of COVID-19. Imaging, in adjunct to clinical and laboratory findings, should be used for monitoring of disease course, until further evidence is available.","Mahmoud, Heba; Taha, Mohamed Shehata; Askoura, Anas; Aleem, Mohammed; Omran, Azza; Aboelela, Soha",Egypt J Otolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649892/,755
42013,Norepinephrine: Hyperglycaemia: case report,2020-11-14,"BACKGROUND: There are noticeable gaps in knowledge regarding the cost and effectiveness of integrated medical and behavioral services for older adults with HIV. Their lifespan is close to the population’s level but their quality of life has sharply declined due to depression and substance use. Mental health disorders are widespread among an aging population with HIV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to build a decision analytic model to evaluate medical interventions with and without mental health treatment using primary data of 139 older adults with HIV and health outcomes from the literature. METHODS: We tracked the progression of depression and cumulative deaths among older adults with HIV using a Markov model with 50 annual cycles through three health states. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty in estimating the parameters and around the model’s assumptions. RESULTS: An integrated medical and behavioral care system is cost effective at a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY compared with medical care only. The incremental cost was $516,452 and the incremental effectiveness was 38.8 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,316 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate and efficacious referrals to integrated medical + behavioral services, either in the same facility or connected to their primary care doctor, are instrumental to reverse loses in quality of life and avoid premature death. If mental health is left unattended, HIV would progress, causing declines in quality of life and ultimately triggering premature death. Reliable data on the cost and effectiveness of different types of HIV integrated services are needed.","DelaCruz, Juan J.; Brennan-Ing, Mark; Kakolyris, Andreas; Martinez, Omar",Pharmacoecon Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649900/,755

We redefined nursing-home- and hospital-associated infections (NHAI) group by revising existing HCAP risk factors. The NHAI group comprised nursing home residents with a poor functional status, or recent (past 90 days) hospitalization or recent (past 180 days) antibiotic therapy. Our aim was to determine whether respiratory microbiota profiles are related to newly defined NHAI group in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. METHODS: The 180 endotracheal aspirates (ETAs) from 60 mechanically ventilated ICU patients (NHAI group, n = 24; non-NHAI group, n = 36) were prospectively collected on days 1, 3 and 7 in a university hospital. The bacterial community profiles of the ETAs were explored by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A phylogenetic-tree-based microbiome association test (TMAT), generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), the Wilcoxon test and the reference frame method were used to analyze the association between microbiome abundance and disease phenotype. RESULTS: The relative abundance of the genus Corynebacterium was significantly higher in the pneumonia than in the non-pneumonia group. The microbiome analysis revealed significantly lower α-diversity in the NHAI group than in the non-NHAI group. In the analysis of β-diversity, the structure of the microbiome also differed significantly between the two groups (weighted UniFrac distance, Adonis, p < 0.001). The abundance of Corynebacterium was significantly higher, and the relative abundances of Granulicatella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Veillonella were significantly lower, in the NHAI group than in the non-NHAI group. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota signature of the ETAs distinguished between patients with and without risk factors for NHAI. The lung microbiome may serve as a therapeutic target for NHAI group.","Baek, Min-gyung; Woo, Seong Ji; Kim, Nam Eun; Baek, Chaeyun; Won, Sungho; Kim, Youngmi; Lee, Jae Jun; Yi, Hana; Hong, Ji Young",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720271/,755

Its clinical impact in immunocompetent children and in the context of coinfections remains unclear in Tunisia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: HAdV‐ARIs were studied in hospitalized patients from birth to the age of 5 years from 2013 to 2014. Clinical and demographic characteristics, coinfections, and molecular characterization of HAdV were established. RESULTS: HAdV‐positivity was detected in 114/583 specimens (19.6%) including 6.1% single infections and 93.9% coinfections. Adenoviral coinfections mostly comprised human Rhinovirus (50.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (34.2%), human Respiratory Syncytial virus A/B (29.8%), and human Coronaviruses (21.9%). HAdV infection was predominant in the pediatric population (25.0% vs 10.0% in neonates, P < .001) and peaked in February 2014 (21.1%). HAdV severity of pediatric cases is characterized by low saturation of oxygen (<94%, 33.8%, P = .05) and long duration of oxygen support (≥5 days, 32.7%, P = .02). Severe HAdV infections were described with S. pneumoniae coinfection, which seemed to increase the risk of death. HAdV genotyping identified HAdV‐C as the most common species. Severe ARIs were observed in all HAdV‐identified types. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that sequences were variable suggesting the circulation of different HAdV strains sharing more similarities to strains circulating in Europe or Asia than those from Africa. CONCLUSION: This first molecular study of HAdV in Tunisia demonstrated that it has an important role in severe ARIs with HAdV‐C being the most common species.

This population is often immunosuppressed, susceptible to neurological complications, and requiring of frequent cancer care, all of which may confer vulnerability to poorer outcomes after infection. METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from structured electronic medical record elements, clinical note text and laboratory RESULTS: Each source was identified, integrated and analyzed using the Palantir Foundry platform (Syntropy), part of the Context Engine Data Management System through the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) IRB approved D3CODE initiative. The population of interest was patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who had been seen at the Brain and Spine Center for nervous system tumors. RESULTS: 8,177 ambulatory patients were seen at the Brain and Spine Center from 3/1/20–9/1/20. COVID status was known for 1,753 (21%). Sixty-one (0.7%) were COVID-19 positive. Of these, 17 had primary nervous system tumors. Seven (41%) were treated in the emergency department or hospital for infection. Two were symptomatic but did not require further care. Eight were asymptomatic. Nine (53%) had alterations in cancer management within one week of COVID-19 diagnosis – delayed surgery (3), delayed/interrupted chemotherapy (2), delayed/interrupted radiation (2), cancer treatment discontinued (2). Eight patients (47%) had no clear impact of infection on their cancer treatment, three were on surveillance. Three (18%) unique patients had neurological symptoms attributed to/exacerbated by COVID-19 – encephalopathy (2), seizure (2), stroke (1). CONCLUSION: No deleterious effects of alterations in cancer management after COVID-19 infection have been identified thus far, though longitudinal follow up is warranted. Our results suggest that COVID-19 infection frequently incurs medical complications or alterations in cancer treatment. The potential impacts of COVID-19 on our vulnerable neuro-oncology patient population should be further explored, and attention to these potential implications for our patients is warranted by treating clinicians.","Aaroe, Ashley; Harrison, Rebecca; Majd, Nazanin; O’Brien, Barbara; Weathers, Shiao-Pei; Loghin, Monica; Kamiya-Matsuoka, Carlos; Yung, W K Alfred; de Groot, John; Woodman, Karin",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650364/,755
43082,Antineoplastics: Neutropenia: 31 case reports,2020-12-12,"COVID-19 has caused ongoing interruptions to healthcare systems worldwide, shifting care to virtual platforms, and placing significant economic and logistical burdens on clinical practice. The pandemic has created uncertainty in delivering the standard of care, both in areas of cancer diagnosis and treatment, especially within neuro-oncology. Due to the pandemic, care and operational planning goals have shifted to infection prevention, modifying recommendations to decrease viral transmission and increasing telemedicine use, potentially creating a burden on implementing evidence-based medicine. These dynamics have since begun to redefine traditional practice and research regimens, impacting the comprehensive care that cancer patients can and should receive; and the enduring consequences for the delivery of healthcare. The impact of COVID-19 on oncology practice and trials might endure well beyond the short- to mid-term of the active pandemic. Therefore, these shifts must be accompanied by improved training and awareness, enhanced infrastructure, and evidence-based support to harness the positives and offset the potential negative consequences of the impacts of COVID-19 on cancer care. To address these paradoxical effects, we will conduct iterative, qualitative (face-to-face/video conference) interviews with neuro-oncology clinical and research professionals and adult brain tumor patients receiving care during the pandemic. We will capture unique aspects of oncology care: the lived, subjective, situated, and contingent accounts of patients and medical professionals, especially during a pandemic. We will also specifically compare the impact of telehealth during the pandemic on delivery of care to complex neuro-oncology patients. A summary of this in-depth, qualitative approach will result in a sophisticated understanding of neuro-oncology care on the frontline at a time of crisis, as experienced during a pandemic, to articulate best practices for future implementation.","Cort, Nicole; Broom, Alex; Kenny, Katherine; Page, Alexander; Durling, Jennifer; Brown, Casey; Lipp, Eric; Ashley, David; Walsh, Kyle; Johnson, Margaret; Khasraw, Mustafa",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650400/,755

43453,Multiple drugs: Diarrhoea and prolonged viral shedding: 2 case reports,2020-12-19,"Spontaneous hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients poses a diagnostic challenge. Hypoglycemia in malignancy has several etiologies; an extremely rare mechanism is the Warburg effect causing excess lactate production and avid glucose consumption. We describe the clinical course of a 52-year-old man admitted for chest wall mass and severe but asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Laboratory workup was obtained for insulin vs noninsulin-mediated hypoglycemia, and biopsy of the chest wall mass and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) scan were performed. D10 infusion and intravenous/oral steroids started for severe hypoglycemia. Chemotherapy was initiated after biopsy, and blood glucose (BG) and lactate levels followed with clinical response in tumor size and changes in PET/CT. Investigations were significant for venous BG in the 40s (Ademolus Classification of Hypoglycemia grade 2 hypoglycemia), plasma insulin of less than 2 µU/mL (2-20 µU/mL), C-peptide of 0.2 ng/mL (0.8-6.0 ng/mL), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) of 113 ng/mL (333-967 ng/mL), serum lactate of 16 mmol/L (0.5-2 mmol/L), and albumin of 2.3 g/dL (3.4-5.4 g/dL). Biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and PET revealed highly FDG-avid disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, but no FDG uptake was seen in the brain. Hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis improved remarkably after chemotherapy. PET/CT at 4 weeks showed complete metabolic response with reappearance of physiological FDG uptake in the brain. Noninsulin-mediated hypoglycemia was likely due to the combination of profound malnutrition and rapid glucose use by cancer cells. The patient presented with exaggerated Warburg effect (hyper-Warburgism), evident by extreme glucose consumption, severe lactic acidosis, and large tumor burden on PET/CT.

44223,Anakinra/tocilizumab: Primary biliary cholangitis: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has precipitated a global health crisis. In an effort to decrease person-to-person transmission, societal-level non-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs) to maintain social distancing have been enacted. As SARS-CoV-2 shares similar routes of transmission with other respiratory viruses, implementation of these NPIs may have decreased transmission for multiple viral pathogens. We compared influenza and respiratory syncytial (RSV) rates in prior seasons to rates during the 2019 - 2020 season at two large academic centers in Atlanta and Boston. METHODS: The clinical records were queried for adults with respiratory virus testing conducted at the Emory Healthcare system and associated clinics in Atlanta and the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Healthcare System in Boston. Total cases for influenza A and B, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed for each week of the past 5 seasons (07/01/2015-05/30/2020) for the Atlanta and Boston sites. Systematic changes in viral infection rates were calculated using viral reproduction rates, R(t), between consecutive weeks. R(t) is the ratio of the number of positive cases in one week to the number of positive cases in the previous week. We used statistical bootstrapping to determine whether R(t) for influenza and RSV were lower in 2019–2020 following the introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Analyses were conducted using R (v 4.0.0). Absolute respiratory virus activity by season, Boston (panel A) v. Atlanta (panel B) [Image: see text] RESULTS: For the 2019–2020 Atlanta season, R(t) < 1 (which reflects steady decline in infection rates) occurred at week 28 for influenza A, week 33 for influenza B, and week 35 for RSV, which corresponded with the increase of SARS-Cov-2 cases. The R(t) of these viruses stayed at or near 1 during weeks 33–35 in prior seasons, and R(t) was greater than 1 up to week 47. Data from MGB sites showed similar trends with a sudden decline in R(t) to < 1 at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. CONCLUSION: We note decreased transmission of influenza and RSV during a time window where widespread movement restrictions and social distancing were imposed to control COVID-19. This trend was most pronounced for influenza A in Atlanta and influenza B in Boston. These data suggest that NPIs can have important effects across multiple pathogens.

44245,Lactulose/rifaximin: Lack of drug effect: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: The VA initiated an antimicrobial stewardship program in 2011, which includes participation in the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Antimicrobial Use Option, educational webinars, training programs for antimicrobial stewards, required staffing & reporting, and quality improvement initiatives, that has led to ongoing decreases in antimicrobial therapy nationwide. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, there are several factors that may contribute increases in antimicrobial use (increased presentations of lower respiratory tract infection, concern for bacterial co-infection with SARS-CoV-2, etc.). We sought to compare patterns of antibacterial use in the VA from January – May 2020 with corresponding time periods in prior years. METHODS: Data on antibacterial use from 2015 – 2020 were extracted from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse for acute inpatient care units in 84 VA facilities (facilities which provide limited acute inpatient services were excluded). To control for seasonal effects, only data from January to May for each year were included in the analysis. Days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 days-present (DP) were calculated and stratified by CDC-defined antibiotic classes. RESULTS: From 2015 – 2019, total antibiotic use from January to May decreased by a mean of 9.1 DOT/1000 DP per year. In contrast, from 2019 to 2020, antibiotic use over the same months increased by 26.4 DOT/1000 DP (Table). Increases were observed in all drug classes except for a decrease in narrow spectrum ß-lactam antibiotics. Total antibiotic DOT in 2020 increased by 27.9 and 7.3 DOT/1000 DP in facilities in the highest and lowest terciles of use in 2019 (Figure).

The degree to which this increase reflects potentially appropriate use in the setting of increased patient vulnerability and provider uncertainty, inappropriately decreased provider thresholds for initiating or continuing therapy, or stresses on the structure and staffing of antimicrobial stewardship programs requires further study.

44248,Acetylcysteine: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Outpatient antibiotic stewardship is an emerging area of interest. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unique restrictions such as social distancing and an increase in telemedicine visits. The effects on outpatient antimicrobial prescription needs further exploration. METHODS: We investigated the outpatient antimicrobial prescription trend pre (January 5 to March 14 2020) and post (March 15 to May 31 2020) COVID-19 restrictions at the Veteran’s Affairs Maryland Health Care System. We compared prescribing characteristics pre and post restrictions using Chi-squared and Mann Whitney U tests. Segmented regression analysis was used to compare antimicrobial prescriptions per 1000 encounters, with a control group from the same weeks in 2019. RESULTS: There were 3,881 total antibiotics prescribed for 382501 encounters during the 16 weeks in 2020. Post-restrictions, there was a significant decrease in encounters and antibiotics per week with mean difference of -15241 and -147, for encounters and antibiotics, respectively. The mean antibiotics per 1000 encounters was slightly higher in the post-restriction group, but without statistical significance by this analysis (10.1 vs 10.4, p-value 0.48). Other notable changes post-prescription described in the Table was a decrease in macrolide and an increase in trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; urgent care prescriptions decreased, while primary care prescription increased; and refill prescriptions were less common, while mail prescriptions were more common. On regression analysis, we found a significant level change of +2.7 antibiotics per 1000 encounters (p=0.02) immediately after restrictions were placed, without any significant change in trend (Figure). This translates to an additional 243 antibiotics prescribed during the post-restriction weeks. This was in comparison to data from 2019 which had no significant level or trend change during the same weeks. Table 1.

44263,Adalimumab: Disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculous pericardial tamponade: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infection with COVID-19 has been associated with coagulopathy and inflammation. This prothrombotic state has been identified in the literature as an indicator of poor prognosis and those with COVID-19 who receive anticoagulation therapy may have better outcomes. Due to this prothrombotic state, patients who are currently receiving anticoagulation therapy for other indications prior to infection with COVID-19 may have better outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective case control study conducted at an inner city hospital. Patients were eligible if they were hospitalized between March 15, 2020 and May 15, 2020 and had confirmed infection due to COVID-19. Patients were matched by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by chronic kidney disease (CKD) state. This study evaluated morality in patients who were receiving long term anticoagulation therapy prior to infection with COVID-19 compared to those who were not. RESULTS: Of the 436 patients hospitalized with confirmed infection due to COVID-19, 400 were eligible for analysis. Twenty-two were on anticoagulation therapy prior to admission. Among those patients, 68% were male and 32% were female. The majority of the patients were greater than 60 years of age (82%). Comorbidities were present in 21 patients and were as follows: HTN (95%), CKD (67%), DM (57%), obesity (36%). Of the 22 patients, five expired due to COVID-19 infection compared to 52 patients from the 149-patient matched cohort [z-score 1.13, p = 0.26; odds ratio (OR) 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69–4.71]. CONCLUSION: Prior long-term anticoagulation use does not appear to have a protective effect in patients with COVID-19 infection. Studies with larger sample size will be needed to answer this important question.

44274,Multiple drugs: Off-label use in coronavirus disease 2019 and increase in the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2: 5 case reports,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Nursing home (NH) populations are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. A March 2020 NH survey indicated improvements in pandemic planning when compared to a similar survey in 2007. We surveyed NHs to evaluate how well pandemic preparedness plans and infection prevention strategies met the reality of COVID-19. METHODS: The first COVID-19 case in Michigan was reported March 10, 2020. In the setting of 46,088 cases and 4,327 deaths statewide as of May 1, we disseminated an online survey to state department-registered NHs to describe their experience of the initial pandemic wave. Responses were collected May 1–12, during which the state averaged 585 cases/day. We were particularly interested in NH preparedness, challenges, testing capacity, and adaptations made. RESULTS: Of 452 NHs contacted, 145 opened the survey and 143 (32%) responded. A majority (68%) indicated that their facility’s pandemic response plan addressed > 90% of issues they experienced; 29% reported their plan addressed most but not all anticipated concerns (Table 1). As the pandemic evolved, all facilities (100%) provided additional staff education on proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use. 66% reported experiencing shortages of PPE and other supplies. Half of all facilities (50%) lacked sufficient resources to test asymptomatic residents or staff; only 36% were able to test all residents and staff with suspected COVID-19 infection. Half (52%) considered their communication regarding COVID-19 with nearby hospitals “very good.” The majority of facilities (55%) experienced staffing shortages, often relying on remaining staff to work additional hours and/or contracted staff to fill deficits (Table 2). NH staff resignations increased, with 63% of NHs experiencing resignations; staff with greater bedside contact were more likely to leave, including nurses and nurse assistants. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: While most NHs had a plan to respond to COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, many facilities experienced a lack of available resources, less than ideal communication lines with local hospitals, lack of testing capacity and insufficient staff. These shortcomings indicate potential high-yield areas of improvement in pandemic preparedness in the NH setting.

Modern health policy emphasizes appropriate health services utilization. However, the relationship between accessibility, capability, and appropriateness of ED use is unknown. Thus, this study aimed to examine the effect of hospital ED regionalization policy and categorization of hospital emergency capability policy (categorization policy) on patient-appropriate ED use. METHODS: Taiwan implemented a nationwide three-tiered hospital ED regionalization and categorization of hospital emergency capability policies in 2007 and 2009, respectively. We conducted a retrospective observational study on the effect of emergency care policy intervention on patient visit. Between 2005 and 2011, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database recorded 1,835,860 ED visits from 1 million random samples. ED visits were categorized using the Yang-Ming modified New York University-ED algorithm. A time series analysis was performed to examine the change in appropriate ED use rate after policy implementation. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2011, total ED visits increased by 10.7%. After policy implementation, the average appropriate ED visit rate was 66.9%. The intervention had no significant effect on the trend of appropriate ED visit rate. CONCLUSIONS: Although regionalization and categorization policies did increase emergency care accessibility, it had no significant effect on patient-appropriate ED use. Further research is required to improve data-driven policymaking.

There is limited data on the efficacy of TPE in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). METHODS: Study group consisted of patients who underwent TPE for ALF due to yellow phosphorous poisoning (YPP) between 2015 and 2019. Demographic data and biochemical parameters were recorded before and after TPE. Overall survival and transplant-free survival (based on King’s College Hospital Criteria [KCHC]) were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-three patients underwent TPE for ALF due to YPP. Most of them were young males. Overall survival was 34 (79.06%). In our study population, 20 patients fulfilled KCHC (Group A) and 23 did not fulfill KCHC (Group B). Both the groups showed significant improvement in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and international normalized ratio (INR) after TPE (p < 0.05). In Group B, there was significant improvement in ammonia after TPE (p < 0.05) and all 23 patients (100%) survived after TPE. In Group A, 4 underwent liver transplantation (LT), 7 survived without LT, and the remaining 9 died without LT. Mean survival after completing TPE was 41.2 ± 44.5 days in Group A and 90 days in Group B. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.001). There was statistically significant difference in post-TPE values of INR (p = 0.012) and ammonia (p = 0.011) between non-survivors and survivors. Adverse events such as hypotension (11.62%) and minor allergic reaction (4.65%) were managed conservatively. CONCLUSION: TPE is an effective procedure in ALF due to YPP, not fulfilling KCHC for LT. In KCHC fulfilled group, though it shows LT-free survival benefit, there is requirement of prospective, large volume, multi-center study to assess its efficacy.

Among them, back-shoring (i.e., relocation to the home country) and near-shoring (relocation to the home region) are two of the alternatives attracting growing interest from scholars. This paper aims to shed new light on the variables influencing the choice made between these two alternatives. As requested in the extant literature, a contingency approach is adopted, focusing attention on the footwear industry. Given the exploratory nature of the paper, evidence from 41 back-shoring and near-shoring strategies are analysed, comparing data from Spanish and Italian companies. Collected data are adapted to test hypotheses concerning three sets of variables: firms’ characteristics, motivations for the second degree relocation and its barriers. Collected data show that firm’s size directly influences the chosen alternative since larger companies prefer to near-shore instead of back-shore. When considering motivations, while the “made in” effect does not influence the firm’s choice, availability of skilled contractors and/or government aids induces companies to relocate to the home country instead of the home region. Finally, companies fearing encountering barriers, in terms of skilled contractors’ availability and/or (re-)development of internal manufacturing competences, will prefer the back-shoring rather than the near-shoring option. The study is focused on two countries (Spain and Italy) where the manufacturing sector (and the footwear industry within it) is still relevant to the local economy. Findings cannot be generalized to countries/industries where the local industry has been totally dismantled, without a previous in-depth analysis. The findings obtained offer managers useful insights on the elements that should be carefully evaluated when considering back- and near-shore alternatives. Additionally, valuable insights are provided for policy makers that plan to design industrial policies supporting back-reshoring policy initiatives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in the extant literature addressing variables influencing the choice between back- and near-shoring alternatives.","Merino, Fernando; Di Stefano, Cristina; Fratocchi, Luciano",Oper Manag Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787603/,755

Due to the subtype of triple-negative breast cancer, preoperative dose-dense epirubicin–cyclophosphamide chemotherapy was started. PEG-G was administered on day 3 after the first cycle of epirubicin–cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. On day 11, she had a fever (39.4 °C) and an elevated C-reactive protein level (27.1 mg/dL). Emergency computed tomography revealed diffused wall thickening of the aortic arch without any other signs of infection. Despite administering antibiotics, her general condition and laboratory findings deteriorated until day 18. Based on these observations, she was diagnosed with PEG-G-induced aortitis. Antibiotics were discontinued, and she was treated with prednisolone thereafter. Subsequently, her clinical symptoms and laboratory findings improved around day 39.

Current literature on the perceived helpfulness of online reviews has overlooked the effect of these non-voted reviews. Additionally, current studies lack the cross-cultural perspective to help analyze the influence of cultural factors during an analysis of online reviews in an e-commerce platform. This study proposes a novel cross-cultural framework using online consumer reviews from a global e-commerce retailer to investigate these shortcomings. Our study has twofold contributions: firstly, we identified the significant predictors (such as review-title, review sentiments, star rating, social context, and temporal features) of the count of helpful votes received by online reviews – both voted and non-voted. Secondly, we identified a strong moderating effect of national culture on these predictors during the perception and evaluation of global consumers’ reviews. We also performed a quantile regression across the entire distribution of the count of helpful votes. Findings from our study will guide reviewers who publish helpful and comprehensive reviews.

We find clear evidence of entrepreneurial activities in the strategic recourse to Presidency’s Cabinet and the Secretary General and in the introduction of a new Social Scoreboard. Furthermore, we show that such socialisation process is congruent to the expected impact of European Pillar of Social Rights, which indeed contributes to strengthen an already ongoing incremental trend. Our analysis contributes to better qualify the socialisation process by highlighting its characteristics and the role of politics. These findings are particularly important to understand whether the Social Pillar left a legacy to the current Commission’s social agenda and to the EU responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, and whether these changes open a new window of opportunity to further reform the Semester.","Vesan, Patrik; Corti, Francesco; Sabato, Sebastiano",Comp Eur Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7811384/,755

In effect, the lockdown provided the impetus for the uptake and spreading of practices that were previously peripheral, particularly in relation to market exchanges. The study also identified a variety of coping strategies, as well as the importance of social support in the form of food aid, financial assistance, and institutional livelihood assistance. Finally, it discusses the importance of diversity in food sources, the role of local food systems, and governance implications for foregrounding social-ecological resilience in short-term response and long-term recovery.","Manlosa, Aisa O.; Hornidge, Anna-Katharina; Schlüter, Achim",Maritime Studies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7811386/,755

Eine Antwort darauf ergibt sich durch folgende Überlegung. Betrachten wir die norditalienische Region Lombardei, in der es bekanntlich zu einem Engpass bei der intensivmedizinischen Versorgung kam. Nehmen wir an, Deutschland hätte (nur) über die Intensivbettenzahl der Lombardei verfügt (korrigiert für deren Einwohnerzahl). Wäre es unter dieser Voraussetzung zu einer Überlastung der Intensivstationen gekommen? Die Region Lombardei hat 10 Mio. Einwohner und verfügte im März nach Ausbau der Bettenkapazität über 1202 Intensivbetten 1 . In Deutschland lag der Höchststand an COVID-19-Intensivpatienten bei 2922 am 17. April 2 . Umgerechnet auf die Bevölkerungszahl der Lombardei hätte sich somit ein Bedarf an 365 (2922/8) Intensivbetten ergeben. Dies entspricht einer Beanspruchung von 30% (365/1202). Es wäre jedoch wahrscheinlich nicht machbar gewesen, durch Verschiebung planbarer Eingriffe und andere Maßnahmen 30% der Intensivbetten für COVID-19-Patienten freizuhalten. Der Grund liegt darin, dass bereits alle Intensivbetten durch Nicht-COVID-19-Patienten belegt wären (selbst bei Korrektur für die Einwohnerzahl). So gab es am 26.4. (d. h. einen Tag vor Empfehlung des Bundesgesundheitsministeriums Elektiveingriffe wiederaufzunehmen 3 ) einen Bedarf an 1980 Intensivbetten für Nicht-COVID-19-Patienten (korrigiert für die Differenz der Einwohnerzahl) 4 .

Crisis of historical perspective indicates lack of integrated worldview and concept about emancipated future, while crisis of theory addresses the fundamental problem of theoretical categories in expressing relations between elements and factors of reality. Categories of mode of existence (Marx, Khosravi) and mode of collaboration (Blunden) are proposed in order to solve these crises. Based on the mutual appropriation of mode of existence and mode of collaboration, I have tried to formulate three modes of existence of projects (class-project, project, and life-project) which can explain the totality of a social reality. These crises and proposed categories have been elaborated in this article, in critical dialogue with some theoretical frameworks like feminist account of intersectionality and German-Scandinavian Critical Psychology’s main concept: conduct of everyday life.","Rezvani, Sohrab",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869419/,755

In the lockdown period, cities and public spaces became completely empty and new urban landscapes substituted the previous ones, transforming the private in public. Children, young and elder people were those who mainly had problems: to them, real life was negated at the time of their life in which this is more important. In Italy, the second country after China which was interested by the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, the reopening of all the public spaces happened after 2 months of closure. This allowed again “in presence” social interactions, although in respect of the physical distance, confirming the importance of these places for all people. Starting from these premises, the aim of this paper is to present the results of a study carried in the framework of the Horizon 2020 research project Urban Maestro, New Governance Strategies for Urban Design, of the ISMed-National Research Council post Covid research, and of the INU Community Public Space, the last two initiatives coordinated by the author. The objective is to identify the relationships between theory and practice of the Charter of Public Space after 10 years of its creation, and verify its validity, in particular, in this Covid-19 emergency period. The Charter of Public Space was adopted during the second Biennial of Public Space held in Rome in 2013 and presented at the Quito Habitat 3 Conference in 2016. In those events many principles were used for the New Urban Agenda discussion concerning quality of public spaces. To achieve the goal of the research, an original method of analysis was created and about thirty case studies were collected, nine of which will be illustrated in this paper. The cases were selected because they follow many principles of the Charter and are then characterized by quality of design and flexibility of use. Accordingly, the update of some principles of the Charter was necessary to meet the new Covid-19 pandemic needs.","Sepe, Marichela",Urban Des Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869426/,755

The prevalence of DNA replication is significant for an evolutionary transition at the beginning of life. DNA replication proteins are those proteins which support the process of replication and are also reported to be important in drug design and discovery. This information depicts that DNA replication proteins have a very important role in human bodies, however, to study their mechanism, their identification is necessary. Thus, it is a very important task but, in any case, an experimental identification is time-consuming, highly-costly and laborious. To cope with this issue, a computational methodology is required for prediction of these proteins, however, no prior method exists. This study comprehends the construction of novel prediction model to serve the proposed purpose. The prediction model is developed based on the artificial neural network by integrating the position relative features and sequence statistical moments in PseAAC for training neural networks. Highest overall accuracy has been achieved through tenfold cross-validation and Jackknife testing that was computed to be 96.22% and 98.56%, respectively. Our astonishing experimental results demonstrated that the proposed predictor surpass the existing models that can be served as a time and cost-effective stratagem for designing novel drugs to strike the contemporary bacterial infection.","Amin, Arqam; Awais, Muhammad; Sahai, Shalini; Hussain, Waqar; Rasool, Nouman",Int J Pept Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869428/,755

This article seeks to understand how mining firms have reshaped their strategies to ensure financial sustainability while also meeting external expectations of increasing shared-value outcomes by assessing how firms are deploying buffers and bridges. Firms use buffers when they seek to protect core business activities from supply-side and demand-side volatilities by shifting their overall business strategy and bridges to conform with external expectations of improving shared-value outcomes. The article constructs a case study using five sets of data to assess (i) what supply and demand shocks firms are facing; (ii) how they are reshaping their strategies and undertaking activities to protect the firm from these shocks; (iii) what challenges firms face with reaching shared-value outcomes; and (iv) how firms are undertaking activities to improve shared-value outcomes. This article finds that although buffering activities have been successful at increasing the financial sustainability of mining activities, bridging activities have been less successful given that royalties are vulnerable to maladministration, the impact of corporate social investments often short-lived, and insular and local procurement is limited to low-value-added activities, particularly in the context of mechanization. This article seeks to contribute to the body of literature on how extractive firms are responding to supply and demand shocks and argues that a paradigm shift may be necessary in which traditional bridging activities become part of protecting core business activities to ameliorate the risk of losing a firm’s social license to operate.","Baskaran, Gracelin",Miner Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869759/,755

The third-order changes will have more profound implications for future services beyond the simple digitalization of service routines. Although third-order changes may occur much later, preparation is critical because the first-order adoption and the second-order adaptation may form a basis for the third-order metamorphosis. We hope that this theoretical lens is useful in providing foresight for the changes in the nature of services in the post-pandemic. As an exemplary analysis, the first-, second-, and third-order changes are extracted from the six cases of service transformation presented in this volume, and contrasted with each other.

Everyday technology such as a touchscreen tablet has great potential to support person‐centred care. Aims: We aimed to support the adoption of tablets for hospitalized people with dementia to connect with families and friends. METHODS: A patient‐oriented research approach was employed to co‐produce the toolkit. We are a transdisciplinary team, including a medical student, physicians, nurses, patients, and family partners. We facilitated staff focus groups (n = 3), and conducted stakeholders' interviews (n = 4) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of users' needs. The sample included ten patients, ten family members, 40 staff members, nurses, care workers, physicians, and unit clerks (n = 40). The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided the research design and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: A toolkit was developed based on participants’ perspectives on what needs to be in place to support successful adoption. We developed a mobile tablet with one mechanical arm and one leg on wheels. Participants reported impacts: (a) it puts a smile on the patient’s face, (b) it alleviates anxiety and worries on both sides, and (c) it reduces responsive behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual framework CFIR provides helpful guidance in identifying barriers to implementation. Working with users including patient and family partners to explore possible solutions was key to our success. Future research should engage patient and family partners to seek proactive strategies to address obstacles to advance the science of technology implementation.","Hung, Lillian",Alzheimers Dement,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883122/,755

In this work, we investigate the impact of different CPU frequency scaling techniques such as ondemand, performance, and powersave on the power and energy consumption of multi-core based computer infrastructure. We apply these techniques in PAMPAR, a parallel benchmark suite implemented in PThreads, OpenMP, MPI-1, and MPI-2 (spawn). We measure the energy and execution time of 10 benchmarks, varying the number of threads. Our results show that although powersave consumes up to 43.1% less power than performance and ondemand governors, it consumes the triple of energy due to the high execution time. Our experiments also show that the performance governor consumes up to 9.8% more energy than ondemand for CPU-bound benchmarks. Finally, our results show that PThreads has the lowest power consumption, consuming less than the sequential version for memory-bound benchmarks. Regarding performance, the performance governor achieved 3% of performance over the ondemand.","Garcia, Adriano M.; Serpa, Matheus; Griebler, Dalvan; Schepke, Claudio; Fernandes, Luiz G.

50902,Epinephrine: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-03-27,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Clostridium perfringens (Cp) is a bacterium that causes necrotic enteritis in chickens and is responsible for an economic loss of about 6 billion U.S. dollars in the poultry industry worldwide. Consumption of Cp contaminated chicken meat causes foodborne illnesses in humans. Although Cp can be controlled in chickens by administering antibiotics through feed and water, the ban on the antibiotics owing to concerns on antibiotic resistance has created the need to identify alternative control approaches. As vaccination could be used as an alternative, we used electron beam irradiation (eBeam) to kill the bacterium and use the killed cells as vaccine to control the colonization of Cp in broiler chickens. In this study, we exposed three different strains of Cp to eBeam irradiation and used them as a vaccine to day-18 embryos. After the embryos hatched, the birds in each treatment were segregated into two groups for live Cp challenge at two time points. The results indicate that the vaccine effectively controlled the colonization of all three strains of Cp when challenged with live Cp, indicating that the vaccinated birds had acquired immunity. The current approach can reduce Cp colonization in chickens, thereby reducing economic loss. ABSTRACT: Clostridium perfringens (Cp) is a Gram-positive anaerobe that is one of the causative agents of necrotic enteritis (NE) in chickens, which leads to high mortality. Owing to the ban of administering antibiotics in feed to chickens, there has been an increase in the number of NE outbreaks all over the world, and the estimated loss is approximately 6 billion U.S. dollars. The best alternative method to control NE without antibiotics could be vaccination. In this study, we exposed three different strains of Cp to electron beam (eBeam) irradiation to inactivate them and then used them as a killed vaccine to control the colonization of Cp in broiler chickens. The vaccine was delivered to 18-day old embryos in ovo and the chickens were challenged with the respective vaccine strain at two different time points (early and late) to test the protective efficacy of the vaccine. The results indicate that an effective eBeam dose of 10 kGy inactivated all three strains of Cp, did not affect the cell membrane or epitopes, induced significant levels of IgY in the vaccinated birds, and further reduced the colonization of Cp strains significantly (p < 0.0001) in late challenge (JGS4064: 4 out of 10; JGS1473: 0 out of 10; JGS4104: 3 out of 10). Further studies are necessary to enhance the efficacy of the vaccine and to understand the mechanism of vaccine protection.","Jesudhasan, Palmy R.; Bhatia, Sohini S.; Sivakumar, Kirthiram K.; Praveen, Chandni; Genovese, Kenneth J.; He, Haiqi L.; Droleskey, Robert; McReynolds, Jack L.; Byrd, James A.; Swaggerty, Christina L.; Kogut, Michael H.; Nisbet, David J.; Pillai, Suresh D.",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998924/,755
50914,Voriconazole: Lack of efficacy during treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: 2 case reports,2021-03-27,"Human herpesviruses are a ubiquitous family of viruses that infect individuals of all ages and are present at a high prevalence worldwide. Herpesviruses are responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from skin and mucosal lesions to blindness and life-threatening encephalitis, and some of them, such as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), are known to be oncogenic. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that some herpesviruses may be associated with developing neurodegenerative diseases. These viruses can establish lifelong infections in the host and remain in a latent state with periodic reactivations. To achieve infection and yield new infectious viral particles, these viruses require and interact with molecular host determinants for supporting their replication and spread. Important sets of cellular factors involved in the lifecycle of herpesviruses are those participating in intracellular membrane trafficking pathways, as well as autophagic-based organelle recycling processes. These cellular processes are required by these viruses for cell entry and exit steps. Here, we review and discuss recent findings related to how herpesviruses exploit vesicular trafficking and autophagy components by using both host and viral gene products to promote the import and export of infectious viral particles from and to the extracellular environment. Understanding how herpesviruses modulate autophagy, endolysosomal and secretory pathways, as well as other prominent trafficking vesicles within the cell, could enable the engineering of novel antiviral therapies to treat these viruses and counteract their negative health effects.","Tognarelli, Eduardo I.; Reyes, Antonia; Corrales, Nicolás; Carreño, Leandro J.; Bueno, Susan M.; Kalergis, Alexis M.; González, Pablo A.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7999576/,755

Infection with S. aureus induced caspase recruitment domain and membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like domain protein 3 (CARMA3) expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. The heat-killed bacteria failed to trigger IRF3 phosphorylation and upregulation of CARMA3 expression. However, overexpression of CARMA3 did not affect phosphorylation of TBK1 or IRF3 in RAW264.7 cells, J774A.1 macrophages, and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. In conclusion, S. aureus infection induces STING/TBK1/IRF3-mediated IFN-β production in a CARMA3-independent manner.","Zhou, Yang; Zhao, Shasha; Gao, Xiao; Jiang, Songhong; Ma, Jialu; Wang, Rui; Li, Qing; Qin, Leiying; Tong, Zhizi; Wu, Junwei; Zhao, Jianjun",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000617/,755

To study the chemical determinant for antimicrobial activity essential oils (EOs), five Centaurea species were analyzed including: C. scoparia, C. calcitrapa, C. glomerata, C. lipii and C. alexandrina. Conventional hydro-distillation (HD) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), as new green technologies, were compared for the extraction of essential oils. GC/MS analysis identified 120 EOs including mostly terpenoid except from C. lipii and C. alexandrina in which nonterpenoids were the major constituents. Major terpenoids included spathulenol, caryophyllene oxide and alloaromadendrene oxide-2. To probe antibacterial activity, potential EO inhibitors of a bacterial type II DNA topoisomerase, DNA gyrase B were screened via an in silico molecular docking approach. Spathulenol and alloaromadendrene oxide-2 possessed the best binding affinity in the ATP- binding pocket of Gyrase B enzyme. Principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were used for sample classification and revealed that sesquiterpenes contributed the most for accessions classification. In vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger for all EOs were also evaluated. EOs from C. lipii, C. glomerata and C. calcitrapa exhibited significant MIC against S. aureus with an MIC value of 31.25 µg/mL.","Reda, Eman H.; Shakour, Zienab T.

Although LFA has been successfully used in different applications, its use is still limited when high sensitivity is required, especially in the diagnosis of an early-stage condition. The limit of detection (LOD) is clearly related to the signal-generating system used to achieve the visual readout, in many cases involving nanoparticles coupled to a biomolecule, which, when combined, provides sensitivity and specificity, respectively. While colloidal gold is currently the most-used label, other detection systems are being developed. Carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) demonstrate outstanding features to improve the sensitivity of this technology by producing an increased contrast in the paper background. Based on the necessity of sensitivity improvement, the aim of this work is a comparative study, in terms of analytical performance, between commercial streptavidin gold nanoparticles (streptAv-AuNPs) and avidin carbon nanoparticles (Av-CNPs) in a nucleic acid lateral flow assay. The visual LOD of the method was calculated by serial dilution of the DNA template, ranging from 0.0 to 7 pg μL(−1)/1.5 × 10(4) CFU mL(−1)). The LFA achieved visual detection of as low as 2.2 × 10(−2) pg μL(−1) using Av-CNPs and 8.4 × 10(−2) pg μL(−1) using streptAv-AuNPs. These LODs could be obtained without the assistance of any instrumentation. The results demonstrate that CNPs showed an increased sensitivity, achieving the nanomolar range even by visual inspection. Furthermore, CNPs are the cheapest labels, and the suspensions are very stable and easy to modify.","Porras, Juan Carlos; Bernuz, Mireia; Marfa, Jennifer; Pallares-Rusiñol, Arnau; Martí, Mercè; Pividori, María Isabel",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000918/,755
50928,Azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine: QTc interval prolongation: case report,2021-03-27,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The recommended management of marginally resectable or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas is an attempt of neoadjuvant therapy. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited in low-grade tumors, sarcomas with chemoresistant pathology or in unfit patients. There is a growing evidence on hypofractionated radiotherapy in soft tissue sarcomas, but its efficacy may be limited by radioresistance that is frequently associated with chemoresistance. Regional hyperthermia is a potent and minimally invasive radiosensitizer. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with regional hyperthermia in aforementioned clinical situations. Our findings indicate that proposed combination is feasible while maintaining good short-term local efficacy and tolerance. It could serve as a basis for further studies on radiotherapy with hyperthermia in soft tissue sarcomas. ABSTRACT: Introduction: Management of marginally resectable or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas (STS) in patients who are not candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to chemoresistant pathology or contraindications remains a challenge. Therefore, in these indications, we aimed to investigate a feasibility of 10x 3.25 Gy radiotherapy combined with regional hyperthermia (HT) that could be followed by surgery or 4x 4 Gy radiotherapy with HT. Materials and methods: We recruited patients with locally advanced marginally resectable or unresectable STS who (1) presented chemoresistant STS subtype, or (2) progressed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or (3) were unfit for chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the feasibility of the proposed regimen. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled. All patients received the first part of the treatment, namely radiotherapy with HT. Among them, 14 received the second part of radiotherapy with HT whereas 13 patients underwent surgery. Three patients did not complete the treatment protocol. The feasibility criteria were fulfilled in 90% of patients. Two patients developed distant metastases. One patient died due to distant progression. One patient developed rapid local recurrence after surgery. Conclusions: Hypofractionated radiotherapy with HT is a feasible treatment for marginally resectable or unresectable STS in patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy. Results of this clinical trial support the further validation of RT and HT combinations in STS.","Spałek, Mateusz Jacek; Borkowska, Aneta Maria; Telejko, Maria; Wągrodzki, Michał; Niebyłowska, Daria; Uzar, Aldona; Białobrzeska, Magdalena; Rutkowski, Piotr",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000962/,755

Of them, 7590 (3·2%) were confirmed as COVID‐19 positive, and 227 (3·0%) confirmed COVID‐19 positive patients died. No significant increase in the presence of specific skin diseases or exposure to biologics was observed in the COVID‐19 positive group. The presence of skin diseases and exposure to biologics also did not seem to affect clinical outcomes (the severity of COVID‐19 infection) or mortality (likelihood of dying from COVID‐19). This study showed that underlying skin diseases or exposure to relevant biologics did not appear to increase susceptibility to coronavirus disease, or mortality from coronavirus disease.

In almost a year, COVID-19 has disrupted people's lives in Iran and caused minor to large damages in various aspects of citizens' lives. The outbreak of the disease in the metropolis of Tehran, given that it is the capital of Iran, is however more worrying than other cities in Iran. Therefore, the importance of this research is that it tries to provide hypotheses that explain the reason for the increase in the incidence of the disease by emphasizing the role of place in some districts of Tehran and by statistical analysis and preparing a questionnaire and questions from the elite and Executive experts and citizens in different districts of Tehran have been trained. The results showed that there was a direct positive correlation between the role of place (economic, cultural, political and environmental) in the 22 districts of Tehran and the increased population and increased number of coronavirus-infected people. According to the evaluation of the performance (role) of each district in Tehran, districts 11, 12, 17 and 20 had the most economic places (bazaar and mall), as a result the number of coronavirus-infected people was higher in these districts. The political places are in the next place. The districts where most political places were located were 8 and 11.

51833,Ibrutinib: Rebound effect in the form of respiratory deterioration following the discontinuation of ibrutinib: case report,2021-04-24,"BACKGROUND: Vascular angiopathy is suggested to be the major cause of silent hypoxia among COVID-19 patients without severe parenchymal involvement. However, pulmonologists and clinicians in intensive care units become confused when they encounter acute respiratory deterioration with neither severe parenchymal lung involvement nor acute pulmonary embolism. Other radiological vascular signs might solve this confusion. This study investigated other indirect vascular angiopathy signs on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and involved a novel statistical analysis that was performed to determine the significance of associations between these signs and the CT opacity score of the pathological lung volume, which is calculated by an artificial intelligence system. RESULTS: The study was conducted retrospectively, during September and October 2020, on 73 patients with critical COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU with progressive dyspnea and low O(2) saturation on room air (PaO(2) < 93%). They included 53 males and 20 females (73%:27%), and their age ranged from 18 to 88 years (mean ± SD=53.3 ± 13.5). CT-pulmonary angiography was performed for all patients, and an artificial intelligence system was utilized to quantitatively assess the diseased lung volume. The radiological data were analyzed by three expert consultant radiologists to reach consensus. A low CT opacity score (≤10) was found in 18 patients (24.7%), while a high CT opacity score (>10) was found in 55 patients (75.3%). Pulmonary embolism was found in 24 patients (32.9%); three of them had low CT opacity scores. Four other indirect vasculopathy CTPA signs were identified: (1) pulmonary vascular enlargement (57 patients—78.1%), (2) pulmonary hypertension (14 patients—19.2%), (3) vascular tree-in-bud pattern (10 patients—13.7%), and (4) pulmonary infarction (three patients—4.1%). There were no significant associations between these signs and the CT opacity score (0.3205–0.7551, all >0.05). Furthermore, both pulmonary vascular enlargement and the vascular tree-in-bud sign were found in patients without pulmonary embolism and low CT-severity scores (13/15–86.7% and 2/15–13.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary vascular enlargement or, less commonly, vascular tree-in-bud pattern are both indirect vascular angiopathy signs on CTPA that can explain the respiratory deterioration which complicates COVID-19 in the absence of severe parenchymal involvement or acute pulmonary embolism.","khalifa, Mohamed Hossameldin; Samir, Ahmed; Baess, Ayman Ibrahim; Hendawi, Sara Samy",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8053744/,755

Moving away from an instrumental conception of digital media, we focus on their (mis)functions and the related (dis)satisfactions. We argue that dating apps’ key function and significance is not that of offering a means through which to find a potential partner, but rather of engaging the subject’s desire without the need for an actual relationship with another person. Applying Lacanian theory to the analysis of empirical data, we dwell on the microphysics of enjoyment of dating apps to analyse the ways in which they activate, exploit and turn the subject’s desire. We maintain that dating apps entail a libidinal economy that operates independently of the app’s obvious function of connecting individuals: they act seductively, engaging the subject’s desire in a pulsating dynamic of loss and gain, promise and frustration, thus becoming an affective object in their own right and offering a way for the subject to cope with the demand to enjoy typical of late capitalism. In a cultural atmosphere in which having a vibrant dating life becomes an imperative, thus foreclosing the space for desire to emerge, dating apps can be a way to respond to such injunctions without confronting the anxiety of an embodied encounter.","Bandinelli, Carolina; Bandinelli, Arturo",Psychoanal Cult Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8054116/,755

Competitive esports present an opportunity for people with SCI to remotely engage in a community. The aim of this study is to discuss barriers to esports participation for people with SCI, present adaptive solutions to these problems, and analyze self-reported changes in social connection. Materials and Methods: We presented a descriptive data collected in the process of a quality improvement initiative at Mount Sinai Hospital. In 2019, seven individuals with cervical SCI and quadriplegia participated in a special interest group on esports. Group scores were then analyzed for evidence of between subjects variability using a single sample t-test. A Pearson's correlation was conducted to determine the relationship between social connectedness and demographic data. Results: All players experienced functional limitations as a result of their injury but managed to design personalized gaming setups with adaptive equipment that allowed them to successfully compete in esports. All players reported a positive change in perceived social connectedness (p < 0.001) after participating in the special interest group. Score on Social Connectedness Scale negatively correlated with Time since injury (years). Discussion: It is feasible to create adaptive gaming setups that can be used by people with differing degrees and severity of SCI in a competitive esports environment. Technology and adaptive competitive esports have a potential to improve social connectedness and inclusion in people with quadriplegia.

52551,Multiple drugs: Various toxicities: case report,2021-05-08,"Most widely used testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) products can be inconvenient and cumbersome topical and invasive injectable requiring dose adjustments to attain efficacy. In a pivotal study, a recently approved oral TRT only 26% of patients did not require any dose adjustment. Typically, patients start on a sub-therapeutic dose with gradual dose increases to attain efficacy resulting in additional visit(s) to clinic and pharmacy. Physician research data (N=402) suggested it typically takes 3-6 months of titrations to reach an efficacious dose for majority of patients, a significant barrier in effecting a switch without a period of “efficacy gap”. The requirement of additional visit(s) presents significant challenges for new and current patients desiring to start and to switch to a convenient TRT option, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Recent reports suggest increase of disease severity/mortality in men with low testosterone is possibly due to underlying co-morbidities commonly associated with male hypogonadism. There remains a need for an effective, safe, and easy to use and prescribe product that does not require dose titration. TLANDO is a “triglyceride-free” oral single strength TRT with single dose designed to lymphatically deliver effective and safe levels of testosterone regardless of meal fat content. Moreover, dose titration is prone to some inherent titration decision errors and requires understanding of often complex titration rules. The objective is to assess whether TLANDO, an oral TRT without requiring dose titration, safely restores effective testosterone (T) levels in hypogonadal men. An open-label, single-arm, multicenter study (NCT03242590) was performed with TLANDO in hypogonadal males (N=95). Subjects received orally 225 mg twice a day testosterone undecanoate (TU) for 24 days without dose adjustment. Efficacy was evaluated by % of subjects who achieved daily T Cavg within the eugonadal range. Using 450mg daily dose without dose adjustment, 80% of subjects (95% CI of 72% to 88%) achieved a T Cavg in the normal range and safely restored with mean T Cavg of 476±184 ng/dL post steady state. T restoration was comparable to other non-oral TRT products. TLANDO was well tolerated with no deaths, no drug-related severe AEs, and no hepatic AEs. In conclusion, effective T restoration using TLANDO, an easy to use and prescribe oral TRT option, was confirmed. Minimal AEs were reported with no hepatic AEs. Upon approval, TLANDO will be the first convenient TRT option without requiring dose adjustments; therefore, enabling selection of an efficacious dose from the start of therapy. TLANDO is well suited for new or existing TRT patients desiring a convenient oral option.","Papangkorn, Kongnara; Vangara, Kiran; Bruno, Benjamin J; Kim, Kilyoung; Chidambaram, Nachiappan; DelConte, Anthony; Patel, Mahesh; Carson III, Culley C; Goldstein, Irwin; Kaminetsky, Jed; Miner, Martin; Khera, Mohit; Dobs, Adrian Sandra",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090132/,755

These communities exhibit higher prevalence of chronic preventable disease including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and obesity. DM2 and obesity have been linked to higher morbidity and mortality in the setting of COVID-19 infection (1). Methods: We query data collected from 521 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection admitted to an inner-city community hospital in Brooklyn, New York between March 20 2020 and May 15 2020. Demographics, pre-infection medical comorbidities, laboratory data at admission and clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Results: Patients were 61 years on average (+/-17.2), 42.8% were female, 53.9% were Hispanic and 33% were African-American. Most common comorbidities included: hypertension (62%), chronic kidney disease (20.8%), diabetes (45 %). Mean BMI was 29.9 (+/- 8.2). Among patients with no prior diagnosis of diabetes mean A1c was 5.8% (+/-1.2) and 8.7 (+/-2.5) amongst those with a previous diagnosis of diabetes. Patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and a previous diagnosis of DM2 had significantly higher prevalence of CKD and HTN. Amongst those with T2DM, 19.1% presented with DKA.

The population studied had a larger proportion of African-American, Hispanic and younger patients compared to national averages; these differences are related to the demographics of the communities served by our hospital. Obesity is a negative prognostic factor in the course of Covid-19 infection in comparison to normal-weight patients. Obesity is a proinflammatory condition, associated with high levels of prothrombotic factors including angiotensin-II, also elevated in COVID-19. Understanding that link may yield valuable knowledge on the role obesity plays in numerous disease states beyond COVID-19. References:(1). Sabin ML, et al. Lancet. 2020;395(10232): 1243–44.(2).

52557,Tocilizumab: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome following off-label treatment: 4 case reports,2021-05-08,"Background: There are several known viral triggers of ketosis-prone diabetes, including SARS-1 and HHV-8(1,2). SARS-COV-2 can bind ACE-2 receptors on the beta-cell causing destruction and acute impairment of insulin secretion(3). There is accruing evidence to suggest that COVID-19 infection can worsen preexisting diabetes or induce new disease(4). Clinical Case: A 40-year-old Hispanic male presented to the ER complaining of fatigue, polyuria, and polydipsia. A screening COVID-19 PCR was positive but he denied URI symptoms. His admission labs were notable for hyperglycemia (434 mg/dL; n 71–99), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.1 [n 7.35–7.45]; HCO3 3 mmoL/L [n 21–32]), increased anion gap (27 mmoL/L; n < 12) and elevated HbA1c (7.9%; n < 5.7%). The patient’s fructosamine was also high (464 umol/L; n 200–285) and discordant from his HbA1c. There was no evidence of pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, renal impairment or hepatic dysfunction. The patient had no known medical problems, did not drink alcohol to excess, and reported good access to nutrition. He had a strong family history of T2DM, but his BMI (23.3 kg/m(2)) and lipid panel were normal. The DKA was managed in the medical ICU using fluids and IV insulin per protocol. The patient required 180 units of IV insulin/24-hours (2.5 units/kg/day) to maintain blood glucose 180–250 mg/dL. After 48-hours of IV insulin, he was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin and prescribed multiple daily injections at discharge. There were concerns about possible T1DM and/or glucose toxicity leading to further diagnostics. His GAD-65 (<5 [IU]/mL; n 0–5 [IU]/mL) and IA-2 (<5.4 U/mL; n <5.4 U/mL) antibodies were negative but his c-peptide was suppressed (0.64 ng/mL; n 0.8–3.85). The patient was reevaluated at three months post-discharge. His glycemic control and insulin requirements had improved but repeat c-peptide level was undetectable. He was thought to have beta-cell failure and referred to a diabetologist. Conclusion: This is a case of absolute insulin deficiency persisting for at least three months most likely attributable to acute COVID-19 infection. References: 1. Yang JK, Lin SS, Ji XJ, Guo LM.

52559,Antivirals/immunosuppressants: Various toxicities: 3 case reports,2021-05-08,"Introduction: In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, characterized by a picture of atypical pneumonia composed of fever, dry cough and progressive dyspnea. Autopsy analyzes of patients with Covid-19 were performed, and hyperactivation of cytotoxic T cells was observed, suggesting an increase in humoral-type immunological signaling, where interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a mediator present that can fit as a potential critical agent for exacerbation of inflammatory conditions. In addition, not only interleukin-6, but also serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin have been recognized as strong predictors of COVID-19 severity. Recent studies have shown that the use of liraglutide has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. Thus, the present case report discusses the possible anti-inflammatory properties of the antidiabetic drug liraglutide (Saxenda), in Covid-19. Clinical Case: JCMS, 45 years, male, married, obese grade 2 (BMI: 38.2), sought medical service on August 18, 2020, bringing a positive result of the RT-PCR test for Covid-19, performed in last day. The patient was in good general condition, reporting mild headache and adynamia. He was prescribed to start a treatment with Saxenda (6mg/ml - started 0.6mg/day at week 1, with a gradual increase up to 3mg/day at week 5); Jardiance (25mg / day); Fluimicil (600mg); Ivermectin (6mg) and Colchicine (0.5mg every 12 hours). In addition, collection of laboratory tests was requested. Examination results: IL6: <1.5 pg/mL; Ferritin: 819 ng/ml; C-reactive protein: 5.1mg/L. On August 24, the patient was tachycardic (HR 120–140 bpm) associated with headache and fever (38 °C). Azithromycin (500mg), dexamethasone (4mg) and dipyrone (1g) were prescribed. Collection of laboratory tests was requested. Examination results: IL6: 9.3 pg/mL; Ferritin: 1085 ng/ml; C-reactive protein:23.9mg/L. On September 3, the patient was in good general condition, eupneic, afebrile, with no complaints to declare. On September 6, the collection of laboratory tests was requested. Examination results: IL6: <1.5 pg/mL; Ferritin: 687 ng/ml; C-reactive protein: 1.7mg/L. Conclusion: Based on the described report, it is possible to observe a good clinical and laboratory evolution of the patient with Covid-19 who, among the drugs used, made use of liraglutida. Diabetes and obesity are considered significant risk factors for morbidity and mortality by COVID-19, since they are a condition of low-grade chronic inflammation and in these conditions, inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6 and ferritin have strong signs of alteration. Thus, the possible beneficial effect of the administration of liraglutide in obese patients is highlighted, as a potential anti-inflammatory effect, especially in the COVID-19 era.","Hanada, Taliê Zanchetta Buani; Knack, Rafael Silvestre; Knack, Renata Silvestre",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090259/,755
52562,Nilotinib: QTc prolongation: 2 case reports,2021-05-08,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have surpassed one million worldwide with limited treatment modalities, and physicians are relying on alternative methods, such as Vitamin D supplementation, to prevent or halt disease progression without direct evidence. Research has proven that vitamin D supplementation can prevent inflammation based on its role in innate immune response; however, there have been limited studies regarding vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19. We aimed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D insufficient patients was associated with fewer severe COVID-19 outcomes, defined as mechanical ventilation or death. Methods: Retrospective study that analyzed data from all adult patients admitted to our tertiary care center between March 2020 and July 2020 with a positive RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level measured within 90 days prior to the index admission. Patients with 25(OH)D <30 ng/mL were considered vitamin D insufficient and patients ordered for least one weekly dose of ≥1,000 units of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol were considered supplemented. Supplemented vitamin D insufficient patients were compared to non-supplemented vitamin D insufficient patients in terms of severe COVID-19 disease as defined by mechanical ventilation or death. Results: 129 COVID-19 patients with a vitamin D level <30 ng/mL were identified, with a median vitamin D level of 21.4 ng/mL. A total of 43 patients (33.3%) had severe COVID-19 outcomes. 65 (50.4%) patients with vitamin D insufficiency were supplemented and 64 (49.6%) were not supplemented. Vitamin D supplementation with ≥1,000 units (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.28 - 1.40; p=0.25), ≥5,000 units (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.26 - 1.23; p=0.15), or ≥50,000 units (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.42–2.20, p=0.92) weekly had no statistically significant effect on severe COVID-19 outcomes. The odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes in supplemented patients were non-significantly reduced at lower cutoff values for vitamin D insufficiency (<20 ng/mL and <12 ng/mL) for all supplementation amounts. Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation in patients with vitamin D insufficiency did not significantly reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes; however, vitamin D supplementation was associated with non-statistically significant reduced odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes at lower cutoff values of vitamin D level. These results demonstrate that Vitamin D supplementation may have a protective effect against severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with lower baseline levels of vitamin D.","Levitus, Corinne; Chekuri, Sweta; Assa, Andrei; Mohrmann, Laurel; Zindman, Alexandra; Tabatabaie, Vafa; Toscano, Fabrizio; Ahmed, Masud; Baron, Sarah W",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090274/,755
52563,"Tocilizumab: Elevated liver enzyme levels, superinfections and thrombocytopenia: 15 case reports",2021-05-08,"Introduction: Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy is the first-line treatment of Graves’ hyperthyroidism. Agranulocytosis, although rare, is a life-threatening condition associated with ATD therapy. For patients who recovered from ATD-induced agranulocytosis, surgery or radioiodine (RAI) therapy are adequate options to restore the patient’s euthyroid state. Here we report a case of ATD-related agranulocytosis where lithium therapy was used before RAI to control thyrotoxicosis and prevent worsening of hyperthyroidism. Case Report: A 74-year-old female with a previous history of hypertension presented with a 2-month history of weight loss (12 lbs), palpitations and shortness of breath. She was afebrile with a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 149/80, a fine tremor and a moderate diffuse goiter. She had a normal eye exam. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated TSH <0.01 uIU/mL (0.35-5.5), FT4 3.11 ng/dL (0.51-1.65) and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) 40 (<1,0 U/L), consistent with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves’ disease. She was started on methimazole (MMI) 15mg and metoprolol. After four weeks, symptoms resolved and thyroid function tests (TFT) improved. However, after two months of treatment, she was hospitalized for fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain. White blood cell count (WBC) was 650/μL, and neutrophil count was 90/μL. A diagnosis of gastroenteritis and agranulocytosis was made and MMI was stopped. After seven days, symptoms resolved, the neutrophil count was 2200/ul and TFT were acceptable (FT4 1.25, ng/dL TT3 1.67 ng/ml, TSH < 0.02 uIU/mL). She was discharged without ATDs and a RAI dose of 20 mCi was scheduled. However, RAI therapy had to be postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. After 3 weeks, TFT worsened and therapy with lithium carbonate 300 mg TID was started as the patient refused thyroidectomy. Lithium was initiated 12 days before RAI therapy and was maintained 7 days after the procedure. No side effects associated with lithium treatment were reported. TFT 7 days after RAI were FT4 1.43, ng/dL TT3 2.05 ng/ml and TSH < 0.02 uIU/mL. One month later, the patient was euthyroid without need for thyroid medication and remains on follow up. Discussion: Serum thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations usually increase after RAI therapy for Graves’ disease, a worrisome fact in patients with increased risk for cardiovascular complications. Previous studies report that pre-RAI treatment with lithium prevents changes in serum TH concentrations and enhances RAI therapy’s effectiveness. Here, treatment with lithium was used to control thyrotoxicosis and prevent further increase in TH levels associated with RAI therapy. Lithium is particularly suitable for patients with ATD-related side effects before definitive therapy (radioiodine or thyroidectomy). The antithyroid effect of lithium in this setting should be further studied.","Fantin, Esther H; Goemann, Iuri Martin",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090305/,755
52565,Azd-1222: Thrombocytopenia and intracranial venous sinus thrombosis: 3 case reports,2021-05-08,"Background: Previous studies have shown that telemedicine is an effective alternative method for health care delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely stimulated expansion of telemedicine across the country. This study aimed to determine characteristics of telehealth visit and short term HbA1c outcome in patients with diabetes mellitus in endocrinology clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A single center retrospective chart review was conducted in all patients seen in endocrinology clinic for diabetes mellitus between 5/27/2020–7/20/2020. Data were extracted from electronic medical record. The primary research question is percentage of patients who achieved HbA1C ≤ 8% at 3 month follow up. Secondary research questions are characteristic of patients and clinic visits, diabetic technology usage, 3 month follow up mean HbA1c and HbA1c change. This project was approved by the institutional review boards. Results: Two hundred and six diabetic patients were seen: 72 (35%) in person, 49 (24%) phone visit, and 85 (41%) VDO visit. Mean age for patients adopted in person visit was 57 (SD 15) years, phone visit was 68 (SD 13) years and VDO visit was 54 (SD 18) years, p <0.001. Male percentage for in person, phone and VDO visit was 44%, 59% and 61% respectively, p 0.09. New consult visit percentage for in person, phone and VDO visit was 7%, 2% and 5% respectively, p 0.46. Percentage of patients using insulin pump or continuous glucose monitoring for in person, phone and VDO visit was 33%, 43% and 54%, respectively, p 0.03. Baseline HbA1c was done in 89% (64/72) in person, 45% (22/49) phone and 52% (44/85) VDO visit. Among patients who had baseline HbA1c, average HbA1c was 8.6% (SD 1.8) for in person visit, 8.0% (SD 1.1) for phone visit and 8.1% (SD 1.8) for VDO visit, p 0.25. At 3 months, HbA1c was done in 38% of patients who had in person visit, 36% phone visit, and 43% VDO visit. Among patients who had 3 month follow up HbA1c, HbA1c ≤ 8% was achieved in 50%, 61% and 69% for in person, phone and VDO respectively, p 0.56. Mean 3 month follow up HbA1c was 8.1% (SD 1.3), 7.7% (SD 0.9) and 7.8% (SD 1.6) for in-person, phone and VDO visit respectively, p 0.47. Comparing mean HbA1c in patients who had both baseline and 3 month follow up HbA1c, changes were significant for in person visit 9.1% to 8.1% (p 0.01) and VDO visit 8.7% to 7.6% (p 0.01). No significant change in 3 month follow up HbA1c was observed in phone visit, 7.7% to 7.6% (p 0.88). Conclusions: This retrospective study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, no differences in short term HbA1c outcome (3 month follow up mean HbA1c and percentage of patients who achieved HbA1c ≤ 8%) were observed among patients who adopted in-person and telehealth visit. Patients who adopted phone visit appeared to be older; and there was more diabetic technology usage (insulin pump or continuous glucose monitoring) among patients who adopted telehealth (phone and VDO) compared to in person visit.","Krahmer, Robert; Thongprayoon, Charat; Ruanpeng, Darin",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090322/,755
52566,Multiple drugs: Acute kidney injury and off label use: 3 case reports,2021-05-08,"Purpose: To evaluate if COVID-19 apps address risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, race, gender, sexual orientation, language. Background: In 2019, there were 204 Billion app downloads and 3.7 billion downloads of ehealth apps. COVID-19 affects ethnic minority patients with diabetes, hypertension, and other risk factors. Spanish is the second most commonly used language after English in the U.S.. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans are at an increased risk of COVID-19. LGBTQ+ communities are also at higher risk for COVID due to historically poor access to healthcare. Methods: The search term, “COVID,” in Google Play store and Apple App store was used to find the most popular COVID-19 apps. App inclusion criteria: 1) Contains COVID-19 information and/or COVID symptom tracker, 2) Marketed and designed for the general public, 3) Free, 4) Android (DROID): 100,000+ Downloads; Apple (iOS): highest star ratings.

52570,Heparin: Worsening of intracranial haemorrhage and gastrointestinal-bleeding : 2 case reports,2021-05-08,"In March 2020, the infection COVID-19 spread as a pandemic emergence. Among multiple biological and environmental factors, hypovitaminosis D is a credible candidate. The aim of this study is to shed light on the pathogenic role of vitamin D deficiency in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and in the aggressive immune and inflammatory response by the host. We retrospectively analyzed the biochemical panel of immune system markers and the tandem mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS-MS) measured vitamin D, in the serum samples of patients with SARS-CoV-2 studied in all aspects of clinical relevant parameters. RESULTS between 18th March and 20th April 2020 we enrolled 29 consecutive patients with COVID-19. They were 17 (58.6%) males and 12 (41.4) females, and the median age was 79 (69–88) years. Mean 25OHD was 17.3±2.1 ng/ml, with a median of 15.7 1 ng/ml (i.r. 6.7–25). Twenty-five patients (86.2%) had 25OHD levels <30 ng/ml, 18 patients (62.0%) had 25OHD levels <20 ng/ml and 10 patients (34.5%) had severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml). In the group of patients with severe disease (ARDS, cardiovascular complications, CID) 69.2% (n=9/13) of patients presented hypovitaminosis D (<20 ng/ml). All patients who dead for COVID-19 during hospitalization (n=6) had 25OHD≤30 ng/ml and 5/6 had 25OHD≤20 ng/ml. IL-6 and CRP were measured in all patients and were considered surrogate markers of cytokines storm. The majority of patients had levels of IL-6 (n=22, 75.8%) and CRP (n=25, 86.2%) above the upper limit of the reference range of our laboratory (IL6 6.59 and CRP 1 mg/dl) and the median was IL 6=16.1 (i.r. 7.3–36.3) and CRP=6.67 (2.64–11.52). Patients with 25OHD <20 ng/ml had higher levels of IL-6 (p=0.004; 19.9 vs 10.4) and CRP (p=0.009, 9.85 vs 1.40) and did not differ for the other clinical and biochemical variables. If we considered as 25OHD cut-off the mean value in our population (17.3 ng/ml), patients with lower levels of 25OHD had higher age (p=0.033) and higher levels of IL6 (p=0.016), CRP (p=0.04), troponin (p=0.04) and D-dimer (p=0.017), compared to the others. An inverse correlation was found between 25OHD levels and IL-6, CRP, and troponin. In a univariate regression analysis hypovitaminosis D (<20 ng/ml) was a predictive factor for IL6 (expressed as LnIL6) levels (β=0.57, P=0.003) and for PCR levels (β=0.42, P=0.034). We also performed a multivariate regression analysis with hypovitaminosis D (<20 ng/ml), sex, BMI, age (<70 years) and ARDS as independent variables. Notably, hypovitaminosis D (β=0.49, P<0.02), BMI (β=0.4, P=0.04) and ARDS (β=0.44, P=0.02) were confirmed to be significant variables for IL6 (expressed as LnIL6) level prediction. In the same multivariate model hypovitaminosis D (β=0.49, P=0.034) was confirmed as independent predictor of CRP levels. In conclusion, hypovitaminosis D is related to the negative prognostic inflammatory status in patients with SARS-Cov2.","Saponaro, Federica",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090354/,755

A sequential simulation session was implemented to improve and assess FiY1 preparedness towards approaching deteriorating patients. METHOD: 12 FiY1 doctors participated in the session containing three sequential major stations: complex new admission, ward-based management, and acute deterioration. Participants interpreted investigations, performed examinations, created management plans, and escalated using a pager. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in preparedness for giving treatment (median(IQR): pre-simulation 3(3-4) vs. post-simulation 4(4-4.75); p = 0.04) and paperwork (2(2-3.75) vs. 4(3.25-4.75); p = 0.03). Following four weeks of FiY1 participants demonstrated significant improvement in preparedness for giving treatment (median(IQR): pre-simulation 3(3-4) vs. post-FiY1 4.5(4-5); p = 0.01), communication and teamworking (4(3.25-4.75) vs. 5(5-5.75); p = 0.01), and paperwork (2(2-3.75) vs. 5(5-5); p = 0.01). The FiY1 programme improved integration within teams and facilitated training whilst medical school placements left participants feeling apprehensive and unprepared to practice.

53414,Epoprostenol: Exacerbation of thrombocytopenia : case report,2021-05-22,"BACKGROUND: The definitive management of acute cholecystitis is laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the same admission if the patient is fit. As the Covid-19 pandemic emerged, evidence suggested adverse outcomes for asymptomatic Covid positive patients undergoing surgery, including increased mortality risk. Risks to theatre staff were also highlighted. This prompted changes in acute cholecystitis management guidelines. METHOD: The audit aim was to assess the impact of guideline change on clinical outcomes and readmission rate for acute cholecystitis. The revised Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (AUGIS) guidelines were the gold standard. All inpatient admissions for acute cholecystitis during the 4-week peak of the pandemic (17/04/2020 – 14/05/2020) were included. RESULT: 24 patients were admitted with acute cholecystitis. 10 patients (41.7%) were managed with antibiotics alone, 4 patients (16.6%) underwent cholecystostomy. 12 patients (50%) were discharged within 3 days. Lack of clinical progress/ongoing symptoms was the indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 5 cases (20.8%). 5 conservatively managed patients (20.8%) were readmitted with ongoing cholecystitis or pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS: 19 patients (80%) were managed non-surgically in accordance with AUGIS guidelines. However conservative management was not always appropriate. We recommend that laparoscopic cholecystectomy should remain a management option for acute cholecystitis during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.","Asarbakhsh, M; Lazarus, N; Lykoudis, P",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135815/,755
53421,Norepinephrine: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-05-22,"INTRODUCTION: Delivery of surgical services during the Covid-19 pandemic has required the use of enhanced PPE in the operating theatre. We sought to evaluate the impact of this change on surgeon workload and intraoperative patient outcomes. METHOD: Surgeons performing as primary operator completed an online procedure-specific questionnaire on workload ratings for each operative case, using an extension of the validated Surgeon Task Load Index (SURG-TLX) tool (reported on a 20-point scale), together with operative details. Local approval was obtained at individual sites. Data was analysed in Stata SE v16. RESULTS: 118 responses (17 surgeons, 7 specialties) were collected from June to September 2020. 77.1% used enhanced PPE. There was no association between enhanced PPE use and overall workload (p = 0.151) as measured with SURG-TLX, although surgeons wearing enhanced PPE commonly reported finding individual procedures harder than expected (37% vs 0%, p < 0.001). Communication was rated worse when using enhanced PPE use (MD -4.38, 95%CI -6.74 to 02.03; p < 0.001). There was no association between enhanced PPE use and intraoperative complications (p = 0.745). CONCLUSIONS: The use of enhanced PPE is not associated with complications or increased surgeon workload assessed by SURG-TLX. It is, however, associated with difficulty in communicating, and subjectively experiencing more procedural challenge than anticipated.","Gysling, S; Maresca, G; Brooks, A; Patel, A; Caruana, E",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135824/,755
53422,Amiodarone: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-05-22,"Trauma & Orthopaedics (T&O) has taken a backseat during COVID-19. As the focus has shifted to care of COVID patients, other specialties have adjusted their daily working. At our local hospital, the dedicated Orthopaedic ward was absorbed into the Intensive Care department, necessitating migration to a smaller, shared working space. This project looked at ways of increasing clinical efficiency, patient safety and education within the T&O department. Members of the T&O department at The Princess Alexandra Hospital were invited to attend daily trauma meetings virtually via Microsoft Teams. In addition, the impact of moving to a larger, dedicated meeting space was assessed. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires were delivered to assess response. Post-intervention questionnaires revealed a significant improvement in the perception of ability to see XRs (p < 0.001), quality of handover (p = 0.018), ability to discuss and formulate management plans (p = 0.002), social distancing (p < 0.001), location (p = 0.002) and trauma meetings overall (p < 0.000). The educational value of trauma meetings did not improve as anticipated, however. Virtual Trauma Meetings are a useful adjunct, allowing clinicians safely contribute to clinical care. In addition, the location of daily trauma meetings is an important factor to consider, both for the safety of patients and for the safety of clinicians.","Hasan, R; Dhir, R",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135825/,755

Our aim was to explore the degree of impact caused by the pandemic on higher general surgical trainees. METHOD: All higher general surgical trainees in a single UK deanery were invited to participate in an online, voluntary, anonymous survey via SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: 64 (72.7%) of the trainees responded. 39.1% were ST3/4, 29.7% were ST5/6, 20.3% were ST7/8 and 10.9% were out of training (maternity & research). Thirty-five (55.6%) worked in district general hospitals. Forty (68.9%) trainees felt that they had fewer opportunities to be primary surgeon. Forty-two (67.7%) trainees did not have access to laparoscopic simulation trainers. Fifty-two (88.1%) trainees had their courses and 2 (3.4%) had their FRCS part 2 exam postponed. 16 (27.1%) trainees reported they had been off-sick, with a median of 7 days off (range 3-35 days). Thirty-three (55.9%) trainees felt more stressed due to the pandemic and 35 (59.4%) had symptoms of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on all aspects of higher surgical training. The most noticeable impact has been on the reduction in the confidence in laparoscopic and endoscopic skills.","Khan, K S; McLellan, M; Galbraith, N J; Lannigan, A; Mahmud, S; Stewart, B",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135832/,755

Conventional sample preparation techniques for the extraction of lipids from biological matrices like human plasma are based on liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). However, these methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and can show poor reproducibility and selectivity on lipid extraction. A novel, solid-phase extraction (SPE) approach was demonstrated to extract lipids from human plasma using a lipid extraction SPE in both cartridge and 96-well-plate formats, followed by analysis using a combination of targeted and untargeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The Lipid Extraction SPE method was compared to traditional LLE methods for lipid class recovery, lipidome coverage, and reproducibility. The novel SPE method used a simplified protocol with significant time and labor savings and provided equivalent or better qualitative and quantitative results than traditional LLE methods with respect to several critical performance metrics; recovery, reproducibility, and lipidome coverage.","Apffel, Alex; Zhao, Limian; Sartain, Mark J.",Metabolites,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147762/,755

The accepted hypothesis is that unknown environmental factors induce α-synuclein accumulation in the brain via the enteric nervous system. Material and Methods: Monoclonal antibodies made against recombinant α-synuclein protein or α-synuclein epitope 118–123 were applied to the antigens of 180 frequently consumed food products. The specificity of those antibody-antigen reactions was confirmed by serial dilution and inhibition studies. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool sequence matching program was used for sequence homologies. Results: While the antibody made against recombinant α-synuclein reacted significantly with 86/180 specific food antigens, the antibody made against α-synuclein epitope 118–123 reacted with only 32/180 tested food antigens. The food proteins with the greatest number of peptides that matched with α-synuclein were yeast, soybean, latex hevein, wheat germ agglutinin, potato, peanut, bean agglutinin, pea lectin, shrimp, bromelain, and lentil lectin. Conclusions: The cross-reactivity and sequence homology between α-synuclein and frequently consumed foods, reinforces the autoimmune aspect of Parkinson’s disease. It is hypothesized that luminal food peptides that share cross-reactive epitopes with human α-synuclein and have molecular similarity with brain antigens are involved in the synucleinopathy. The findings deserve further confirmation by extensive research.","Vojdani, Aristo; Lerner, Aaron; Vojdani, Elroy",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147930/,755

While we concur with the focus of the paper on moving away from a central emphasis on profit maximization, we differ in how we believe this can be achieved. We critique the SET approach put forward from three key positions: (a) the SET approach and the application of virtue ethics; (b) the SET approach and the use of the marketing mix to operationalize it in practice; and, (c) the missing systemic and institutional barriers which we believe render SET problematic both theoretically and in practical terms. We conclude by suggesting that instead of utilising normative ethical theories to address socio-ecological challenges marketing researchers turn to other perspectives, such as ecofeminism.","Prothero, Andrea; McDonagh, Pierre",AMS Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8161340/,755

Herein, we review interfacial wetting states related to switchable wettability on superwettable materials, including several classical wetting models and liquid adhesive behaviors based on the surface of natural creatures with special wettability. This review mainly focuses on the recent developments of the smart surfaces with switchable wettability and the corresponding regulatory mechanisms under external stimuli, which is mainly governed by the transformation of surface chemical composition and geometrical structures. Among that, various external stimuli such as physical stimulation (temperature, light, electric, magnetic, mechanical stress), chemical stimulation (pH, ion, solvent) and dual or multi-triggered stimulation have been sought out to realize the regulation of surface wettability. Moreover, we also summarize the applications of smart surfaces in different fields, such as oil/water separation, programmable transportation, anti-biofouling, detection and delivery, smart soft robotic etc. Furthermore, current limitations and future perspective in the development of smart wetting surfaces are also given. This review aims to offer deep insights into the recent developments and responsive mechanisms in smart biomimetic surfaces with switchable wettability under external various stimuli, so as to provide a guidance for the design of smart surfaces and expand the scope of both fundamental research and practical applications.","Li, Shuyi; Fan, Yuyan; Liu, Yan; Niu, Shichao; Han, Zhiwu; Ren, Luquan",J Bionic Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193597/,755
54314,Clobetasol/prednisone: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-06-12,"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition remains a challenging problem in hospitals, especially among geriatric patients. The background and causes are actually well known but still underestimated in clinical practice. AIM AND METHODS: This study evaluated possible differences in rates of malnutrition risk and malnutrition in geriatric patients living at home and geriatric patients living in residential nursing homes. For this purpose, data from a total of 4 surveys (3 times nutritionDay plus 1 additional survey) were combined and evaluated. In this secondary analysis, 258 patients 65 years and older are included. Malnutrition risk is determined by the malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST) and malnutrition by the ESPEN criteria. RESULTS: Of the patients 86.0% (n = 222) live at home and 14.0% (n = 36) in residential nursing homes. The patients living in nursing homes have a higher morbidity and need of care. Indicators for the increased morbidity are a larger number of nights spent in the clinic in the last 12 months (mdn 10.0 vs. 5; p 0.007), higher number of daily drug intake (mdn 9.0 vs. 7.0; p 0.002) and greater limitations in walking abilities (mdn 3.0 vs. 1.0; p < 0.001). They are significant older (median 86.0 vs. 78.0; p < 0.001) and show a higher percentage of manifest malnutrition (35.7%; n = 10 vs. 20.1%; n = 40; p 0.062). CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients living at home and in residential nursing homes show high rates of malnutrition. A malnutrition screening at the beginning and during hospital stay is urgently required in every case as this is the only way to identify those affected. In addition, regular screening in outpatient departments as well as in nursing homes is also necessary.","Graeb, Fabian; Wolke, Reinhold",HeilberufeScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193600/,755

Methods: This study was performed in three referral centers of COVID-19 in Iran, and six patients with the diagnosis of GBS were enrolled. Patients enrolled in the study with acute progressive weakness according to the demyelinating or axonal variant of GBS, according to Uncini's criteria. Results: Four of our patients had axonal polyneuropathy, two patients had demyelinating polyneuropathy, and one patient required mechanical ventilation. All our patients had a favorable response to treatment. In one patient, the GBS symptoms recurred four months after the first episode. Conclusion: Limited case reports suggest a possible association between GBS and COVID-19.

54339,Dexamethasone: Pulmonary aspergillosis and mucormycosis: case report,2021-06-12,"The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2), is expressed at levels of greatest magnitude in the small intestine as compared to all other human tissues. Enterocyte ACE2 is co-expressed as the apical membrane trafficking partner obligatory for expression and activity of the B(0)AT1 sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter. These components are assembled as an [ACE2: B(0)AT1](2) dimer-of-heterodimers quaternary complex that putatively steers SARS-CoV-2 tropism in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI clinical symptomology is reported in about half of COVID-19 patients, and can be accompanied by gut shedding of virion particles. We hypothesized that within this 4-mer structural complex, each [ACE2: B(0)AT1] heterodimer pair constitutes a physiological “functional unit.” This was confirmed experimentally by employing purified lyophilized enterocyte brush border membrane vesicles that were exposed to increasing doses of high-energy electron radiation from a 16 MeV linear accelerator. Based on established target theory, the results indicated the presence of Na(+)-dependent neutral amino acid influx transport activity functional unit with target size mw = 183.7 ± 16.8 kDa in situ in intact apical membranes. Each thermodynamically stabilized [ACE2: B(0)AT1] heterodimer functional unit manifests the transport activity within the whole ∼345 kDa [ACE2: B(0)AT1](2) dimer-of-heterodimers quaternary structural complex. The results are consistent with our prior molecular docking modeling and gut-lung axis approaches to understanding COVID-19. These findings advance the understanding of the physiology of B(0)AT1 interaction with ACE2 in the gut, and thereby potentially contribute to translational developments designed to treat or mitigate COVID-19 variant outbreaks and/or GI symptom persistence in long-haul Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC).","Stevens, Bruce R; Ellory, J Clive; Preston, Robert L",Function (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194517/,755

AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in hospitalizations for non-COVID-19 related conditions. We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac operations and interventions undertaken in England.

RESULTS: Over the 3 months of ‘lockdown’, total numbers and mean reductions in weekly rates (n [-%]), compared with the same time period in 2019, were: coronary artery bypass grafting (-2507 [-64%]); percutaneous coronary intervention (-5245 [-28%]; surgical (-1324 [-41%]) and transcatheter (-284 [-21%]) aortic valve replacement; mitral valve replacement; implantation of pacemakers (-6450 [-44%]), cardiac resynchronization therapy with (-356 [-42%]) or without (-491 [-46%] defibrillation devices, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (-501 [-45%]); atrial fibrillation ablation (-1902 [-83%]), and other ablations (-1712 [-64%]) (all p < 0.001). Over this period, there were 21,038 fewer procedures than in the reference period in 2019 (p < 0.001). These changes paralleled reductions in hospitalizations for MI (-10,794 [-27%]) and HF (-63,058 [-28%]) (both p < 0.001).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study in which we analyzed the management and associated perioperative complications rate in patients aged over 65 years who attended a tertiary hospital in Spain with hip fracture during the COVID-19 first alarm status decree . We compared the results with a cohort of similar patients treated during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 102 hip fractures were recorded in 2019, with a mean age of 85 years. 87.5% were treated surgically in our hospital, with mean waiting time of 4.6 days and mean stay of 11.3 days. In 2020, 107 hip fractures were recorded, with a mean age of 86 years. A total of 74.6% underwent surgery in our center, with a mean waiting time of 2.8 days and a mean hospital stay of 10.9 days. The rate of major complications and exitus was 8.9% and 6.7% respectively in 2019, and 9.4% and 7.8% in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The number of hip fractures increased despite the declaration of the state of alarm in comparison with the decrease in the rest of the trauma emergencies.

Based on Hofstede’s model and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), we examine the effects of cultural dimensions (individualism-collectivism and uncertainty tolerance) as well as subjective norms (parents’ and peers’ attitudes towards geographic mobility) on readiness for geographic job-related mobility in samples of German and Spanish business management students ahead of graduation from university. The study involved administering a survey questionnaire to 273 third- and fourth-year business management students of two large universities (one in Germany and another in Spain). Cross-cultural measurement invariance of the measures was confirmed, allowing for comparison of scores across the groups. We found that German students had generally a larger geographical mobility, whose readiness was predicted by parents’ and peers’ perceived attitude and uncertainty tolerance. Readiness for geographic mobility was also higher when social or material incentives are offered, yet geographic mobility readiness for career incentives and for social incentives was predicted by vertical individualism and horizontal collectivism, respectively. This study is one of the first to examine geographic mobility readiness among undergraduate management students in the two countries, who by nature of their training are expected to be mobile.

However, the common sign test has serious drawbacks such as loss of information by considering solely signs of observations but not their magnitudes, various problems related to handling of ties in the data, and the lack of embedding uncertainty regarding the fraction of underlying quantile. To address these issues, we present an extended sign test based on fuzzy categories and fuzzy formulated hypotheses that improves the generality, versatility, and practicability of the common sign test. This generalized test procedure is neat in theory and practice and avoids disadvantages that are often associated with fuzzy tests (e.g., a considerably higher complexity of the underlying model, a fuzzy test decision, and a possibilistic instead of a probabilistic interpretation of test results). In addition, we perform a comprehensive case study on COVID‐19 in HIV‐infected individuals with a focus on human body temperature and related measurement problems. The results of the study clearly indicate that fuzzy categories and fuzzy hypotheses improve the performance of the sign test.","Chukhrova, Nataliya; Johannssen, Arne",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250505/,755

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of hollow structured materials applied in targeting recognition, smart response, and drug release, and we have addressed the possible chemical factors and reactions in these three processes. The advantages of hollow nanostructures are summarized as follows: hollow cavity contributes to large loading capacity; a tailored structure helps controllable drug release; variable compounds adapt to flexible application; surface modification facilitates smart responsive release. Especially, because the multiple physical barriers and chemical interactions can be induced by multishells, hollow multishelled structure is considered as a promising material with unique loading and releasing properties. Finally, we conclude this review with some perspectives on the future research and development of the hollow structures as drug carriers.

Adopting a gendered approach, this paper draws on the empirical case of Quarry Road West, an informal settlement located in Durban, and uses a qualitative methodology. Residents have access to Community Ablution Blocks, free shared sanitation facilities provided by the eThekwini Municipality. This paper argues that restricted access to the facilities undermines perceptions of privacy and health and negatively impacts women individually and in the community. Furthermore, this paper evaluates civic responses to inadequate infrastructure in the form of participation, protest and state-directed actions. As such, it examines how women-state relationships are embedded in public infrastructure, and limitations in regards to infrastructure shape interactions and engagements with the state, their experiences of citizenship, actualisation of rights and identities.","Wiltgen Georgi, Neele; Buthelezi, Sibongile; Meth, Paula",Urban Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8271341/,755

The article was written in three steps. In the first step, the leading author (John Traxler) has identified the relevant themes. In the second step, proponents of each position have freely responded to the themes (futures studies, Stuart Connor; postdigital theory, Sarah Hayes and Petar Jandrić; mobilities, John Traxler). In the third step, the responses have been collectively (re)mixed and edited, identifying complementary and conflicting concepts and ideas. The article was initiated a month before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it was completed over one and a half years later. Thusly, responses and analyses have included the pandemic experience without explicitly focusing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The paper concludes with drawing together contributions, seeking underlying commonalities and differences, and looking for trends, convergence, and change. Epistemically, the three positions discussed in this paper are far from commensurable. Yet they are compatible and complementary, in a postdigital dialogue, in a sense that they all need each others’ inputs on the road to a better understanding of our current condition, and the road to a better future.","Traxler, John; Connor, Stuart; Hayes, Sarah; Jandrić, Petar",Postdigit Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8273853/,755

METHODS: Ten patients were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients presented gastric varices, according to the Sarin classification, at high risk of bleeding, and not otherwise manageable. Patients with portal vein thrombosis were excluded. All patients were treated with a combination of PTO and BRTO. In all cases the gastric varices were embolized with glue, combined with coils or not, with an occlusion balloon inflated into the shunt. In 7 cases, embolization was immediate; in the remaining 3 the balloon remained inflated for 4 h and in 2 of them embolization of the shunt was required. Technical success was defined as complete obliteration of the gastric varices observed during a contrast-enhanced computed tomography study and endoscopy within 1 month following treatment. Clinical success was defined as absence of bleeding of gastric varices during the follow-up period. Major and minor complications during the follow up were recorded. RESULTS: Twelve sessions of combined PTO and BRTO procedures were performed in 10 patients; in 2 patients a new combined treatment was required during the follow up. Technical and clinical success was 100%. Neither major nor minor procedure-related complications were observed. CONCLUSION: Combined PTO and BRTO therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of gastric varices that cannot be managed otherwise.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Carnevale, Aldo; Tosetti, Giulia; D’Amico, Mario; Giganti, Melchiore; Mura, Vincenzo La; Bonelli, Cristian; Renzulli, Matteo; Lampertico, Pietro; Primignani, Massimo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Ann Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8276367/,755

Although fibroblast activation is a critical component of the fibrotic process, the direct effects of eCIRP on fibroblasts have never been examined. We studied eCIRP’s role in the induction of inflammatory phenotype in pulmonary fibroblasts and its connection to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. We found that eCIRP causes the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and differentially expression-related pathways in a TLR4-dependent manner in pulmonary fibroblasts. Our analysis further showed that the accessory pathways MD2 and Myd88 are involved in the induction of inflammatory phenotype. In order to study the connection of the enrichment of these pathways in priming the microenvironment for pulmonary fibrosis, we investigated the gene expression profile of lung tissues from mice subjected to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis collected at various time points. We found that at day 14, which corresponds to the inflammatory-to-fibrotic transition phase after bleomycin injection, TLR4, MD2, and Myd88 were induced, and the transcriptome was differentially enriched for genes in those pathways. Furthermore, we also found that inflammatory cytokines gene expressions were induced, and the cellular responses to these inflammatory cytokines were differentially enriched on day 14. Overall, our results show that eCIRP induces inflammatory phenotype in pulmonary fibroblasts in a TLR4 dependent manner. This study sheds light on the mechanism by which eCIRP induced inflammatory fibroblasts, contributing to pulmonary fibrosis.","Bolourani, Siavash; Sari, Ezgi; Brenner, Max; Wang, Ping",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8342891/,755
56620,Methylprednisolone: Lack of efficacy: case report,2021-08-07,"Recent evidence suggests an association between endometrial cancer and the understudied bacterial species Porphyromonas somerae. This association was demonstrated in previous work that indicated a significantly enriched abundance of P. somerae in the uterine microbiome of endometrial cancer patients. Given the known associations of the Porphyromonas genus and oral cancer, we hypothesized that P. somerae may play a similar pathogenic role in endometrial cancer via intracellular activity. Before testing our hypothesis, we first characterized P. somerae biology, as current background data is limited. These novel characterizations include growth curves in liquid medium and susceptibility tests to antibiotics. We tested our hypothesis by examining growth changes in response to 17β-estradiol, a known risk factor for endometrial cancer, followed by metabolomic profiling in the presence and absence of 17β-estradiol. We found that P. somerae exhibits increased growth in the presence of 17β-estradiol of various concentrations. However, we did not find significant changes in metabolite levels in response to 17β-estradiol. To study direct host-microbe interactions, we used in vitro invasion assays under hypoxic conditions and found evidence for intracellular invasion of P. somerae in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. We also examined these interactions in the presence of 17β-estradiol but did not observe changes in invasion frequency. Invasion was shown using three lines of evidence including visualization via differential staining and brightfield microscopy, increased frequency of bacterial recovery after co-culturing, and in silico methods to detail relevant genomic and transcriptomic components. These results underscore potential intracellular phenotypes of P. somerae within the uterine microbiome. Furthermore, these results raise new questions pertaining to the role of P. somerae in the progression of endometrial cancer.","Crooks, Taylor A.; Madison, Joseph D.; Walsh, Dana M.; Herbert, William G.; Jeraldo, Patricio R.; Chia, Nicholas; Cliby, William A.; Kaufmann, Scott H.; Walther-Antonio, Marina R.

While machine learning (ML) is a powerful predictive tool, determining the proper algorithm to apply across diverse data sets is challenging. AutoPrognosis (AP) is a novel method that uses automated ML framework to incorporate the best performing stages of prognostic modeling into a single well-calibrated algorithm. We aimed to compare various ML methods to AP in predictive performance of complications after TKA. METHODS: Thirty-eight preoperative patient demographics and clinical features from all primary TKAs performed at California-licensed hospitals between 2015 and 2017 were evaluated as predictors of major complications after TKA. Traditional logistic regression (LR), various other ML methods (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Random Forest), and AP were used for model building to determine discriminative power (area under receiver operating curve), calibration (Brier score), and feature importance. RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2017, there were a total of 156,750 TKAs with 1109 (0.7%) total major complications. AP had the highest discriminative performance with area under receiver operating curve 0.679 compared with LR, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Random Forest (0.617, 0.601, 0.662, 0.657, and 0.545, respectively). AP (Brier score 0.007) had similar calibration as the other ML methods (0.006, 0.006, 0.022, 0.007, and 0.008, respectively). The variables that are most important for AP differ from those that are most important for LR. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional ML algorithms, AP has superior discriminative ability with similar calibration and suggests nonlinear relationships between variables in outcomes of TKA.","Devana, Sai K.; Shah, Akash A.; Lee, Changhee; Roney, Andrew R.; van der Schaar, Mihaela; SooHoo, Nelson F.",Arthroplast Today,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349766/,755

56754,AZD-1222: Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia: case report,2021-08-14,"This study presents the efficiency of the wind-driven optimisation (WDO) approach in solving non-convex economic dispatch problems with point-valve effect. The best economic dispatch for a power system is one wherein the system can generate energy at a low cost. The calculation of the generating cost is subject to a number of constraints, such as the power demand for the entire system and the generation limit for each generator unit in the system. In addition, the system should also produce low power loss. The WDO optimisation technique is developed based on the concept of natural wind movement, which serves as a stabiliser to equalise the inequality of air pressure in the atmosphere. One major advantage of WDO over other techniques is its search accuracy. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in two systems, namely, the 10-generator and 40-generator systems. Both systems were tested in a Matlab environment. To highlight the capabilities of WDO, the results using this proposed technique are compared with the results obtained using flower pollination algorithm, moth flame optimisation, particle swarm optimisation and evolutionary programming techniques to determine the efficiency of the proposed approach in solving economic dispatch. The simulation results show the capability of WDO in determining the optimal power generation value with minimum generation cost and low rate of power loss.","Ramli, Nur Fariza; Kamari, Nor Azwan Mohamed; Abd Halim, Syahirah; Zulkifley, Mohd Asyraf; Sahri, Mohd Saiful Mohd; Musirin, Ismail",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8350280/,755

OBJECTIVE: To summarize available information on the prevalence and factors contributing to medication adherence in women with gestational diabetes from the biological and psychosocial perspectives. METHODS: A literature search on adherence in gestational diabetes was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Directory of Open Access Journals for studies published on the topic. The Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews was used to explore and summarize the evidence. RESULTS: A total of 2395 studies were retrieved of which 13 fully met the eligibility criteria. The studies were reported in Zimbabwe (n = 5), Iran (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), South India (n = 1), the United States of America (n = 4), and one multinational study covering Australia, Europe, North and South America. The main types of antidiabetic medications used were insulin (n = 6), metformin (n = 4), and glyburide (n = 2). The prevalence of adherence ranged from 35.6% to 97%, with the assessment tool being self-report measures (n = 8). The main factors associated with nonadherence included worsening pregnancy symptoms, side effects of medications, perceived risks, mental health symptoms, poor social support, and socioeconomic status. Recommendations that evolved from the studies to improve adherence included education, counselling, improved support networks, and social interventions, while the main reported interventional study employed continuous education on the impact of adherence on perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: Medication nonadherence in gestational diabetes seems to be influenced by multiple factors with some educational interventions positively impacting adherence behaviours. Thus, future research in women with gestational diabetes could consider interventions from a multifactorial perspective to improve therapeutic outcomes.","Asiedu-Danso, Michelle; Kretchy, Irene A.; Sekyi, Jeremiah Kobby; Koduah, Augustina",J Diabetes Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363457/,755

The barriers they face to gain access to traditional sources of funding are pushing social enterprises to reinforce their business models and rely more on commercial activities, and this fact increases the risk of mission drift and can weaken accountability towards beneficiaries of the social mission in favor of dominant stakeholders such as funders or clients of the commercial activities. Our research attempts to analyze whether partnerships between social enterprises and nonprofits strengthen accountability to beneficiaries without hindering accountability to other stakeholders, thus allowing both social and economic objectives to operate together. Based on a survey with a sample of social enterprises partnering with nonprofits, results reveal that as the partnership moves along a collaboration continuum to a transformational stage, accountability to beneficiaries is encouraged, whereas accountability to other types of stakeholders is also improved or, at least, not affected.","Sanzo-Pérez, Maria José; Rey-García, Marta; Álvarez-González, Luis Ignacio",Rev Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8364834/,755

Cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage and neuropathy are the main cause of high mortality rates among individuals with diabetes. One effective therapeutic approach for controlling hyperglycemia associated with type-2 diabetes is to target alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, enzymes that catalyzes starch hydrolysis in the intestine. At present, approved inhibitors for these enzymes are restricted to acarbose, miglitol and voglibose. Although these inhibitors retard glucose absorption, undesirable gastrointestinal side effects impede their application. Therefore, research efforts continue to seek novel inhibitors with improved efficacy and minimal side effects. Natural products of plant origin have been a valuable source of therapeutic agents with lesser toxicity and side effects. The anti-diabetic potential through alpha-glucosidase inhibition of plant-derived molecules are summarized in this review. Eight molecules (Taxumariene F, Akebonoic acid, Morusin, Rhaponticin, Procyanidin A2, Alaternin, Mulberrofuran K and Psoralidin) were selected as promising drug candidates and their pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity were discussed where available.

This study used the survey method of data collection, through a self-administered questionnaire. Partial least square structural equation modelling method was used to analyse the result of the sample of 209 professionals of primary health care providers in Northern Portugal. Our findings reveal that cognitive style plays a significant role in intrapreneurship and innovation outputs, which are mediated by intrapreneurship. In particular, health care professionals with the rational cognitive style are likely to be more of a intrapreneur and innovative as compared to those with a intuitive cognitive style. Promoting intrapreneurship is crucial for successful innovation outputs. This study reveals that an understanding of the cognitive style of the health care professionals can help managers allocate appropriate individuals to different healthcare tasks. Our primary contribution to theory has been to highlight the importance of cognitive styles in intrapreneurship and innovation within the context of primary health care organizations.","Marques, Carla S.; Lopes, Cândido; Braga, Vitor; Ratten, Vanessa; Santos, Gina",Int Entrep Manag J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8369144/,755

Upon introduction to a revolutionizing China, the renowned Hungarian poet Sándor Petőfi’s poetry was celebrated as an exemplar of patriotic verse and was fervently accepted and reacted to as a resounding battle call. Efforts to introduce the poet’s works to Chinese readers were pioneered by the country’s progressive writers and leading intellectuals of the time under the auspices of renowned publishers. Since China embarked on its modernization journey, the motive of seeking historical relevance of literary works has been receding into the background, resulting in a dwindling zeal for revolution-themed works. Petőfi’s most widely memorized piece “Liberty and Love” started to receive alternative interpretations that gradually undermined its historical reading and obscured its genuine authorship, thus working to subvert and subjugate the original. Drawing from documented sources and published literature, the paper presents various Chinese translations of the famous lines and, in a comparative analysis, seeks possible explanations for the sweeping preference for a more domesticated yet less faithful version. To account for the changes in the interpretation and evaluation of the preferred translation, the paper then explores the linguistic factors that may have played a part in shaping the poem’s translation and reception among Chinese readers. In summarizing the major findings of the case study, the paper further reflects on the role of language in the translation of literary works and how it may serve to shape the landscape of world literature. This focused analysis aims to help demystify the Hungarian poet’s less well-understood popularity among Chinese readers. Going beyond the analysis of a particularistic case, the discussion offers implications for weaving the precious lines from minoritized languages into the rich tapestry of world literature.","Chen, Ningyang",Neohelicon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380295/,755

The diffusion mechanism has extremely depended on the properties of the structure. OBJECTIVES: The present paper studies why diffusion processes not following integer-order differential equations, and present novel meshless method for solving. diffusion problem on surface numerically. METHODS: The variable- order time fractional diffusion equation (VO-TFDE) is developed along with sense of the Caputo derivative for [Formula: see text]. An efficient and accurate meshfree method based on the singular boundary method (SBM) and dual reciprocity method (DRM) in concomitant with finite difference scheme is proposed on three-dimensional arbitrary geometry. To discrete of the temporal term, the finite diffract method (FDM) is utilized. In the spatial variation domain; the proposal method is constructed two part. To evaluating first part, fundamental solution of (VO-TFDE) is transformed into inhomogeneous Helmholtz-type to implement the SBM approximation and other part the DRM is utilized to compute the particular solution.

Our objective was to study the distinguishing characteristics, overlaps and their use in the literature between three concepts of T1D: depression, diabetes distress (DD) and diabetes burnout (DB). METHODS: A scoping review (PRISMA guidelines) performed in three databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Web of Science) with the keywords: T1D, depression, diabetes and burnout, from January 1990 to June 2021. We selected original studies with participants with T1D, which reported depression, DD, or DB. We extracted information about the concepts, their sub-concepts and screening tools. FINDINGS: Of the 4763 studies identified, 201 studies were included in the study. Seventy-three percent, 57% and 45% of sub-concepts do not overlap in depression, DD, and DB, respectively. We observed overlap between depression (27%)/DD (27%) and between DD (20%)/DB (50%). INTERPRETATION: A number of sub-concepts distinguish depression and DD. Overlaps between concepts suggest that a more precise definition is still lacking. DB is still a relatively new concept and more research is needed to better understand how it can present itself differently, in order to personalize care in comparison to those having DD.","Kiriella, Dona A.; Islam, Sumaiya; Oridota, Olutobi; Sohler, Nancy; Dessenne, Coralie; de Beaufort, Carine; Fagherazzi, Guy; Aguayo, Gloria A.",EClinicalMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408521/,755

In so doing, the aim is to prove the existence of both spatial and temporal asymmetries of pure contagion effects. Firstly, a new empirical framework is proposed in order to define a spatial contagion index using the conditional cumulative distribution function as a parameter to estimate a conditional copula. This methodology enables us to estimate a dynamic conditional copula, providing information about how the market sent pure contagion effects and when. Secondly, in addition to detecting the direction of contagion, the real-time contagion effect is determined, enabling us to calculate the delay of contagion effects (spillover) between financial markets. The present empirical results show the existence of both spatial and temporal asymmetry for bilateral contagion effects for 16 mature and emerging stock markets during the 2001–2018 period. This proves the importance of taking temporal asymmetry into account when we want to detect the contagion effect of every crisis and to estimate the period of pure contagion relating to investors’ behaviors. Finally, these findings highlight the fact that contagion effects were more intensive during the subprime crisis than they were during the European debt crisis.","Miled, Wafa; Ftiti, Zied; Sahut, Jean-Michel",Ann Oper Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408567/,755

Over the past several years, NUM has witnessed a decline in sex workers willing to access police as part of their recovery journeys after experiencing victimisation. In 2012, 28% of those reporting to NUM chose to engage with the legal system; in 2020, this was down to 7.7% amongst off-street independent workers. Statistics for 2021 indicate a continuation of this downward trend. Furthermore, anonymous consent to share information with police also declined from 95% in 2012 to 69% in 2020. METHODS: NUM conducted a survey of 88 sex working members in 2020. This information combined with our data on victimisation provides insights of the factors that deter sex workers from involving police as part of their justice-seeking efforts. RESULTS: Survey results reveal that sex workers feel alienated and untrusting of police and courts. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of sex workers not sharing information about dangerous individuals with police and choosing not to participate in court processes signal significant flaws in our legal system regarding safe and inequitable access and pose dangers for all of us.","Bowen, Raven; Hodsdon, Rosie; Swindells, Kerri; Blake, Charlotte",Sex Res Social Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8409698/,755

The wearable IoT device plays a key role in medical applications, and the antenna is a key part of it. Loading the presented antenna on the body models showed a frequency detuned with the gain and efficiency reduced from 1. 28 to −9 dB and 90% to 10%. In addition, the SAR did not meet the safety health requirement defined by the FCC or ICNIRP standards. Therefore, an “Artificial Magnetic Conductor” structure (AMC) is added to the C-shaped antenna to overcome these problems. The AMC acts as shielding material between the human skin and the presented antenna because of its 0° reflection phase, which mimics the action of the Perfect Magnetic Conductor (PMC). The overall size of the proposed design was 54 × 54 × 3.9 mm(3). Numerical and experimental findings indicated that integrating the AMC structures with a C-shaped antenna was robust for body deformation and load. The C-shaped antenna worked equally well with the AMC, whether positioned in free space or on the chest or the arm of the human body. The integrated antenna with AMC structures has excellent performances. The gain and efficiency without loading on the chest were 6.49 dB and 84%, respectively. While for loaded on the chest were 6.21 dB and 81%, respectively. It also decreased the back radiation and raised the Front to Back Ration (FBR) by 13.8 dB. SAR levels have been reduced by more than 90% between the FCC and ICNIRP standards compared to the C-shaped antenna alone, which does not comply with the standards. As a result, the C-shaped integration with AMC structures is highly suitable for assembly in any wearable system.

Human AChE (hAChE) is a target of nerve agent and pesticide organophosphorus compounds that covalently attach to the catalytic Ser203 residue. Reactivation of inhibited hAChE can be achieved with nucleophilic antidotes, such as oximes. Understanding structural and electrostatic (i.e. protonation states) determinants of the catalytic and reactivation processes is crucial to improve design of oxime reactivators. Here we report X-ray structures of hAChE conjugated with a reversible covalent inhibitor 4K-TMA (4K-TMA:hAChE) at 2.8 ​Å resolution and of 4K-TMA:hAChE conjugate with oxime reactivator methoxime, MMB4 (4K-TMA:hAChE:MMB4) at 2.6 ​Å resolution, both at physiologically relevant room temperature, as well as cryo-crystallographic structure of 4K-TMA:hAChE at 2.4 ​Å resolution. 4K-TMA acts as a substrate analogue reacting with the hydroxyl of Ser203 and generating a reversible tetrahedral hemiketal intermediate that closely resembles the first tetrahedral intermediate state during hAChE-catalyzed acetylcholine hydrolysis. Structural comparisons of room temperature with cryo-crystallographic structures of 4K-TMA:hAChE and published mAChE complexes with 4K-TMA, as well as the effect of MMB4 binding to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the 4K-TMA:hAChE complex, revealed only discrete, minor differences. The active center geometry of AChE, already highly evolved for the efficient catalysis, was thus indicative of only minor conformational adjustments to accommodate the tetrahedral intermediate in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). To map protonation states in the hAChE active site gorge we collected 3.5 ​Å neutron diffraction data paving the way for obtaining higher resolution datasets that will be needed to determine locations of individual hydrogen atoms.","Gerlits, Oksana; Blakeley, Matthew P.; Keen, David A.; Radić, Zoran; Kovalevsky, Andrey",Curr Res Struct Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8435639/,755

We aimed to investigate COVID-19 risk in people with asthma. METHODS: We used UK Biobank data from all participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 (n=107 412 (17 979 test positive)). Baseline questions at baseline defined ever asthma and asthma medications. Baseline Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV(1)) was categorized into quartiles. Logistic regression modelled relationships between asthma, and asthma categories (age at onset, medications, FEV(1) quartiles), and risk of SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We investigated modification by sex, ethnic group, smoking, and BMI. RESULTS: There was a reduced risk of a positive test associated with with early-onset asthma (<13 years), (OR 0.91(95% CI 0.84, 0.99). This was found for early-onset asthmatics in males (OR 0·87 [95% CI: 0·78, 0·98]), non-smokers (0·87 [0·78, 0·98]), overweight/obese (0.85 [0.77, 0.93]), and non-Black participants (0·90 [0·82, 0.98]).

CONCLUSION: Amongst males, non-smokers, overweight/obese, and non-Black participants, having early-onset asthma was associated with lower risk of a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We found no evidence of a protective effect from asthma medication. Early-onset asthmatics of normal weight and with better lung function may have lifestyle differences placing them at higher risk. Further research is needed to elucidate the contribution of asthma pathophysiology and different health-related behaviour, across population groups, to the observed risks.","Lodge, Caroline J.; Doherty, Alice; Bui, Dinh; Cassim, Raisa; Lowe, Adrian J.; Agusti, Alvar; Russell, Melissa A.; Dharmage, Shyamali C.",ERJ Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449950/,755
58077,Convalescent-anti-SARS-CoV-2-plasma: Transfusion-related acute lung injury following off-label use: case report,2021-09-25,"Hard economic times often force a greater number of families to turn to public benefits and programs for financial help. These larger safety net caseloads are more diverse than those of strong economic times, including families who are brand-new to the safety net as well as families who, under different economic circumstances, may have needed only short-term assistance. These families may differ from traditional recipients in terms of characteristics and circumstances. To understand how the New Jersey single-parent Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) caseload changed in response to COVID-19 between April of 2019 and April of 2020, we conducted a two-step cluster analysis that identified six different types of families. Compared to the April 2019 (pre-pandemic) caseload, we found that the number of the TANF participants increased in April 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Interestingly, we also found that the largest proportional increases in the caseload were driven by single jobless adults who are older, have at least a high school education, do not have a disability, and have fewer and older children, while the largest declines were driven by single adults with a job. Taken together, it seems that single adults with relatively better demographic circumstances are having a harder time finding jobs, and so turned to or remained on TANF in April 2020. In response to the pandemic, some, but not all, states have relaxed or temporarily suspended TANF work requirements and time limits. Our findings suggest that such changes in TANF requirements reflect empirical changes in the caseload and merit further attention, particularly in terms of federal and state budget strain.","Lee, Annie S.; Seith, David; Roman, Jessica L.; Taylor, Joanne; Riordan, Annette; Seehra, Amman; Hetling, Andrea",J of Pol Practice & Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450173/,755

METHODS We designed a three-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) device that connects to a smart phone application for measuring pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) using PPG probes that are simultaneously clipped onto to the ear, index finger, and big toe, respectively. Validation was performed through a clinical study with 100 participants (age 20 to 77) at a research hospital in Nagpur, India. Study subjects were stratified by age and divided into three groups corresponding to the disease severity: Coronary Arterial Disease (""CAD""), hypertensive (""Pre-CAD""), and Healthy. MAIN RESULTS PWV values derived from the Ear-Toe measurements increased monotonically as a function of disease severity and age, with median values of 14.2 m/s for the older-patient CAD group, 12.2 m/s for the younger-patient CAD group, 11.6 m/s for the older-patient Pre-CAD group, 10.2 m/s for the younger-patient Pre-CAD group, 9.7 m/s for the older healthy controls, and 8.4 m/s for the younger healthy controls. Using just two simple features, the PTT and patient height, we demonstrate a machine learning prediction model for CAD with a median accuracy of 0.83 (AUC). SIGNIFICANCE This work demonstrates the ability to predict atherosclerosis and CAD using a simple low-cost multi-site PPG tool that is powered by a mobile phone and does not require any electrocardiogram (ECG) reference. Furthermore, this method only requires a single anthropometric measurement, which is the patient's height.","Ouyang, Victoria; Ma, Botong; Pignatelli, Niccolo; Sengupta, Shantanu; Sengupta, Partho; Mungulmare, Kunda; Fletcher, Richard Ribón",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abad48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764197/,755

A perspective from the United States of America.",2020-05-13,"The COVID-19 pandemic, despite the restrictions and preventive measures applied, has rapidly spread and reached Poland. The adaptation to the dynamically changing epidemiological situation requires a prompt implementation of effective preventive measures. The aim of the publication is to provide current knowledge to all persons involved in the preventive care system, i.e., employees, employers and professionals of occupational medicine, about the epidemiological situation related to SARS‑CoV- 2, as well as recommendations and possible solutions. In order to analyze these issues, a review of literature was conducted based on medical research databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, and the Web of Science Core Collection. The literature was supplemented with studies found on websites of the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization. Data on the cases of and deaths due to COVID-19 come from reports provided by the Ministry of Health, data published on the websites of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and ourworldindata.org. By the time of submitting the publication, 34 154 cases and 1444 deaths due to coronavirus had been recorded in Poland. Data from published studies suggest that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplets or through contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. Therefore, in the absence of an effective vaccine, preventive actions are based mainly on strategies that minimize the risk of pathogen transmission. In addition to discussing the current epidemiological situation, diagnostic procedures, risk groups and COVID-19 characteristics, the paper presents recommendations and proposed solutions for employers and employees regarding the prevention of SARS‑CoV- 2, along with currently applicable laws and recommendations on employee prophylactic examinations during the pandemic. Subsequently, COVID-19 was discussed in the aspect of an occupational disease and other health threats related to the pandemics. The epidemiological situation regarding coronavirus indicates the need to take immediate and effective actions to minimize infection transmission among employees, and to develop procedures for a quick and effective ability to locate the COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces.

184499,Evaluation of tongue as a complementary sample for the diagnosis of parvoviral infection in dogs and cats.,2007,"Once-useful traits that no longer contribute to fitness tend to decay over time. Here, we address whether the expression of mating-related traits that increase the fitness of sexually reproducing individuals but are likely less useful or even costly to asexual counterparts seems to exhibit decay in the latter. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is a New Zealand freshwater snail characterized by repeated transitions from sexual to asexual reproduction. The frequent coexistence of sexual and asexual lineages makes P. antipodarum an excellent model for the study of mating-related trait loss. We used a mating choice assay including sexual and asexual P. antipodarum females and conspecific (presumed better choice) vs. heterospecific (presumed worse choice) males to evaluate the loss of behavioral traits related to sexual reproduction. We found that sexual females engaged in mating behaviors with conspecific mating partners more frequently and for a greater duration than with heterospecific mating partners. By contrast, asexual females mated at similar frequency and duration as sexual females, but did not mate more often or for longer duration with conspecific vs. heterospecific males. These results are consistent with a scenario where selection acting to maintain mate choice in asexual P. antipodarum is weak or ineffective relative to sexual females and, thus, where asexual reproduction contributes to the evolutionary decay of mating-related traits in this system.","Stork, Sydney; Jalinsky, Joseph; Neiman, Maurine",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447504,755

The purpose of this article is to review the spectrum of the various neurological manifestations and underlying associated pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients. Method: We conducted a review of the various case reports and retrospective clinical studies published on the neurological manifestations, associated literature, and related pathophysiology of COVID-19 using PUBMED and subsequent proceedings. A total of 118 articles were thoroughly reviewed in order to highlight the plausible spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID 19. Every article was either based on descriptive analysis, clinical scenarios, correspondence, and editorials emphasizing the neurological manifestations either directly or indirectly. We then tried to highlight the significant plausible manifestations and complications that could be related to the pandemic. With little known about the dynamics and the presentation spectrum of the virus apart from the respiratory symptoms, this area needs further consideration. Conclusion: The neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 such as Encephalitis, Meningitis, acute cerebrovascular disease, and Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) are of great concern. But in the presence of life-threatening abnormal vitals in severely ill COVID-19 patients, these are not usually underscored. There is a need to diagnose these manifestations at the earliest to limit long term sequelae. Much research is needed to explore the role of SARS-CoV-2 in causing these neurological manifestations by isolating it either from cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissues of the deceased on autopsy. We also recommend exploring the risk factors that lead to the development of these neurological manifestations.","Ahmed, Muhammad Umer; Hanif, Muhammad; Ali, Mukarram Jamat; Haider, Muhammad Adnan; Kherani, Danish; Memon, Gul Muhammad; Karim, Amin H.; Sattar, Abdul",Front.

647997,Multiple drugs: Various toxicities: case report,2021-01-23,"Social distancing policies have been implemented around the world to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These measures have included temporary restrictions on mass gatherings and the closure of public facilities, limiting the pursuit of leisure activities such as travel while allowing more time for at-home pursuits, including creative activities such as gardening and painting. Previous research has demonstrated the benefits of physical activity for psychological well-being during COVID-19, but less attention has been given to the potential benefits of creative pursuits, such as arts and music. The present study investigated changes in the pursuit of creative, non-creative, and physical leisure activities and the relationship between engaging in leisure, the motivations for and barriers to pursuing these activities, and psychological well-being during COVID-19. A total of 3,827 participants from 74 countries completed an online leisure activities questionnaire and the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index. Logistic regression indicated that gender, age, social distancing adherence, and employment status significantly predicted leisure engagement during COVID-19. Compared to sports and outdoor pursuits, participation in creative activities was generally more likely to increase during this period, while participation in non-creative activities was less likely to increase. Multiple linear regression indicated that maintaining or increasing time on leisure activities significantly predicted well-being during COVID-19, with increased time spent on home crafts and artisanship, fine arts, musical and performing arts engagement, sports and outdoor pursuits, niche and IT interests, and language activities each predicting higher well-being outcomes. Motivations such as seeking creative expression and mental stimulation, keeping fit, and maintaining social connections also predicted higher well-being. These findings suggest that participation in both physical and creative leisure activities may offer protective benefits for well-being during COVID-19, and that strategies to promote engagement in creative activities should also be considered in future guidance for mental health during periods of lockdown or isolation.","Morse, K.

662619,Deficiency of eIF4B Increases Mouse Mortality and Impairs Antiviral Immunity,2021-09-10,"Background: Covid-19 pandemic by the new coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 has produced devastating effects on the health care system, affecting also cancer patient care. Data about COVID-19 infection in cancer patients are scarce, and they point out a higher risk of complications due to the viral infection in this population. Moreover, cancer treatments could increase viral complications, specially those treatments based on the use of immunotherapy with checkpoints antibodies. There are no clinical data about the safety of immune check point antibodies in cancer patients when they become infected by SARS-CoV-2. As checkpoint inhibitors, mainly anti PD-1 and anti CTLA-4 antibodies, are an effective treatment for most melanoma patients, avoiding their use during the pandemic could lead to a decrease in the chances of curing melanoma. Methods: In Spain we have started a national registry of melanoma patients infected by SARS-Cov-2 since April 1st, 2020. A retrospective analysis of patients included in the Spanish registery has been performed weekly since the activation of the study. Interim analysis shows unexpected findings about cancer treatment safety in SARS-Cov-2 infected melanoma patients, so a rapid communication to the scientific community is mandatory Results: Fifty patients have been included as of May 17th, 2020. Median age is 69 years (range 6 to 94 years), 27 (54%) patients are males and 36 (70%) patients have stage IV melanoma. Twenty-two (44%) patients were on active anticancer treatment with anti PD-1 antibodies, 16 (32%) patients were on treatment with BRAF plus MEK inhibitors and 12 (24%) patients were not on active cancer treatment. COVID-19 episode has been resolved in 43 cases, including 30 (70%) patients cured, four (9%) patients that have died due to melanoma progression, and nine (21%) patients that have died from COVID-19. Mortality rates from COVID-19 according to melanoma treatment type were 16%, 15% and 36% for patients on immunotherapy, targeted drugs, and for those that were not undergoing active cancer treatment, respectively. Conclusion: These preliminary findings show that the risk of death in those patients undergoing treatment with anti PD-1 antibodies does not exceed the global risk of death in this population.

A recent Deep Transitions framework has provided a comprehensive theory of the co-evolutionary patterns of multiple socio-technical systems over the last 250 years. However, so far the framework has not been subjected to systematic empirical exploration. In this paper we address this gap by exploring the co-evolutionary model linking niche-level dynamics, transitions in single systems and ‘great surges of development’, as conceptualized by Schot and Kanger (2018) [1]. For this purpose, we conduct a case study on the historical evolution of mass production in the Transatlantic region from 1765 to 1972. Instead of focusing on dominant technologies or common practices the development of mass production is understood as the emergence of a meta-regime, i.e. a set of mutually aligned rules guiding production activities in multiple socio-technical systems. The results broadly confirm the overall model but also enable to extend the Deep Transitions framework by uncovering new mechanisms and patterns in the variation, diffusion and contestation of meta-regimes.","Kanger, Laur; Sillak, Silver",Technol Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921848/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101393; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X20303328?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160791X20303328,755
