METHODS: All included patients with COPD received mechanical ventilation (MV) and were ready to wean from MV. After patients passed the 30 min spontaneous breathing trail (SBT), extubation was considered to be feasible, and the right DE measured by ultrasound at 0 min, 5 min, and 30 min of SBT were named as DE(0), DE(5), and DE(30), respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients succeeded extubation; 12 patients failed. The area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC(ROC)) of DE(30) and ΔDE(30−5) (the variation between 30 and 5 min) were 0.762 and 0.835; a cutoff value of DE(30) > 1.72 cm and ΔDE(30−5) > 0.16 cm were associated with a successful extubation with a sensitivity of 76% and 84%, a specificity of 75% and 83.3%, respectively. The predictive probability equation of the DE(30) plus ∆DE(30−5) was P = 1/[1 + e(−(−5.625+17.689×∆DE)(30−5)(+1.802×DE)(30)())], a cutoff value of P > 0.626 was associated with a successful extubation with the AUC(ROC) of 0.867, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 83.3%. CONCLUSION: The combination of DE(30) and ∆DE(30−5) could improve the predictive value and could be used as the predictor of extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated patients with COPD.","Zhang, Xia; Yuan, Jing; Zhan, Yong; Wu, Jingyi; Liu, Biaohu; Zhang, Peng; Yu, Tao; Wang, Zhen; Jiang, Xiaogan; Lu, Weihua",Ir J Med Sci,609,1

The deletion of UL132 (ΔUL132) from the HCMV genome results in a pronounced deficit in virus yield, with an approximately 2-log decrease in the production of infectious virus compared to the wild-type (WT) virus. Characterization of the ΔUL132 mutant virus indicated that it was less infectious with a high particle-to-infectious unit ratio and an altered composition of virion proteins compared to the WT virus. In addition, the viral assembly compartment (AC) failed to form in cells infected with the ΔUL132 mutant virus. The expression of gpUL132 in trans rescued the defects in the morphogenesis of the AC in cells infected with the ΔUL132 mutant virus and in infectious virus production. Furthermore, using cell lines expressing chimeric proteins, we demonstrated that the cytosolic domain of gpUL132 was sufficient to rescue AC formation and WT levels of virus production. Progeny virions from ΔUL132-infected cells expressing the cytosolic domain of gpUL132 exhibited particle-to-infectious unit ratios similar to those of the WT virus. Together, our findings argue that gpUL132 is essential for HCMV AC formation and the efficient production of infectious particles, thus highlighting the importance of this envelope protein for the virus-induced reorganization of intracellular membranes and AC formation in the assembly of infectious virus.","Wu, Hui; Kropff, Barbara; Mach, Michael; Britt, William J.",mBio,609,22

To overcome these limitations, new FMD vaccines must ensure improved safety with non-oil-based adjuvants, a broad spectrum of host defenses within/between serotypes, and the simultaneous induction of cellular and humoral immunity. We designed a novel, immune-potent, recombinant protein rpHSP70-AD that induces robust cellular immunity and elicits a broad spectrum of host defenses against FMD virus (FMDV) infections. We demonstrated that an oil emulsion-free vaccine containing rpHSP70-AD mediates early, mid-term, and long-term immunity and drives potent host protection against FMDV type O and A, suggesting its potential as an FMD vaccine adjuvant in mice and pigs. These results suggest a key strategy for establishing next-generation FMD vaccines, including novel adjuvants.","Jo, Hyundong; Kim, Bong Yoon; Park, So Hui; Kim, Hyun Mi; Shin, Sung Ho; Hwang, Seong Yun; Kim, Su-Mi; Kim, Byounghan; Park, Jong-Hyeon; Lee, Min Ja",NPJ Vaccines,609,22

The use of lung separation techniques carries the risk of airway injuries which range from minor complications like postoperative hoarseness and sore throat to rare and potentially devastating tracheobronchial mucosal injuries like bronchus perforation or rupture. With few case reports to date, bronchial rupture with the use of endobronchial blockers is indeed an overlooked complication. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old male patient with a left upper lobe lung adenocarcinoma underwent a left upper lobectomy with a Fuji Uniblocker® as the lung separation device. Despite an atraumatic insertion and endobronchial blocker balloon volume within manufacturer specifications, an intraoperative air leak developed, and the patient was found to have sustained a left mainstem bronchus rupture which was successfully repaired and the patient extubated uneventfully. Unfortunately, the patient passed on in-hospital from sepsis and other complications. CONCLUSION: Bronchial rupture is a serious complication of endobronchial blocker use that can carry significant morbidity, and due care should be exercised in its use and placement. Bronchoscopy should be used during insertion, and the volume and pressure of the balloon kept to the minimum required to prevent air leak. Bronchial injury should be considered as a differential in the presence of an unexplained air leak.

It is paramount to understand both the pathophysiology of dPH (and associated right ventricular failure) and the complications related to a high-risk intubation before attempting the procedure. There are few recommendations in this area and the literature, guiding these recommendations, is limited to expert opinion and very few case reports/case series. This review will discuss the complex pathophysiology of dPH, the complications associated with intubation, the debates surrounding induction agents, and the available options for the intubation procedure, with specific emphasis on the emerging role for awake fiberoptic intubation. All patients should be evaluated for candidacy for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygen as a bridge to recovery, lung transplantation, or pulmonary endarterectomy prior to intubation. Only an experienced proceduralist who is both comfortable with high-risk intubations and the pathophysiology of dPH should perform these intubations.","Vahdatpour, Cyrus A.; Ryan, John J.; Zimmerman, Joshua M.; MacCormick, Samuel J.; Palevsky, Harold I.; Alnuaimat, Hassan; Ataya, Ali",Heart Fail Rev,609,1

As the developing brain is extremely inaccessible in mammals, cerebral organoids (COs) provide a unique way to investigate neural development and related disorders. The aim of this study was to utilize hyperpolarized (13)C NMR to investigate the metabolism of COs in real-time, in a non-destructive manner. The enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined by quantifying the rate of [1-(13)C]lactate production from hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate. Organoid development was assessed by immunofluorescence imaging. Organoid viability was confirmed using (31)P NMR spectroscopy. A total of 15 organoids collated into 3 groups with a group total weight of 20–77 mg were used in this study. Two groups were at the age of 10 weeks and one was at the age of 33 weeks. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated in both age groups, and the LDH activity rate was found to be 1.32 ± 0.75 nmol/s (n = 3 organoid batches). These results suggest that hyperpolarized NMR can be used to characterize the metabolism of brain organoids with a total tissue wet weight of as low as 20 mg (<3 mm(3)) and a diameter ranging from 3 to 6 mm.","Sapir, Gal; Steinberg, Daniel J.; Aqeilan, Rami I.; Katz-Brull, Rachel",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),609,1

Traditional and conventional blood tests are recommended for screening the suspected patients; however, applying these tests could have health side effects and expensive cost. The goal of this study was to establish a simple and reliable predictive model based on the risk factors associated with diabetes using a decision tree algorithm. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was used in this study. A total of 10,436 participants who had a health check-up from January 2017 to July 2017 were recruited. With appropriate data mining approaches, 3454 participants remained in the final dataset for further analysis. Seventy percent of these participants (2420 cases) were then randomly allocated to either the training dataset for the construction of the decision tree or the testing dataset (30%, 1034 cases) for evaluation of the performance of the decision tree. For this purpose, the cost-sensitive J48 algorithm was used to develop the decision tree model. RESULTS: Utilizing all the key features of the dataset consisting of 14 input variables and two output variables, the constructed decision tree model identified several key factors that are closely linked to the development of diabetes and are also modifiable. Furthermore, our model achieved an accuracy of classification of 90.3% with a precision of 89.7% and a recall of 90.3%. CONCLUSION: By applying simple and cost-effective classification rules, our decision tree model estimates the development of diabetes in a high-risk adult Chinese population with strong potential for implementation of diabetes management.","Pei, Dongmei; Yang, Tengfei; Zhang, Chengpu",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,609,1
43277,43277,43277,A plea for program evaluation in a pandemic,16.967272,1.5290046,2020-12-07,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation services are an important driver of the high costs of intensive care. An optimal interaction between a patient and a ventilator is therefore paramount. Suboptimal interaction is present when patients repeatedly demand, but do not receive, breathing support from a mechanical ventilator (> 30 times in 3 min), also known as an ineffective effort event (IEEV). IEEVs are associated with increased hospital mortality prolonged intensive care stay, and prolonged time on ventilation and thus development of real-time analytics that identify IEEVs is essential. To assist decision-making about further development we estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of real-time analytics that identify ineffective effort events. METHODS: We developed a cost-effectiveness model combining a decision tree and Markov model for long-term outcomes with data on current care from a Greek hospital and literature. A lifetime horizon and a healthcare payer perspective were used. Uncertainty about the results was assessed using sensitivity and scenario analyses to examine the impact of varying parameters like the intensive care costs per day and the effectiveness of treatment of IEEVs. RESULTS: Use of the analytics could lead to reduced mortality (3% absolute reduction), increased quality adjusted life years (0.21 per patient) and cost-savings (€264 per patient) compared to current care. Moreover, cost-savings for hospitals and health improvements can be incurred even if the treatment’s effectiveness is reduced from 30 to 10%. The estimated savings increase to €1,155 per patient in countries where costs of an intensive care day are high (e.g. the Netherlands). There is considerable headroom for development and the analytics generate savings when the price of the analytics per bed per year is below €7,307. Furthermore, even when the treatment’s effectiveness is 10%, the probability that the analytics are cost-effective exceeds 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing real-time analytics to identify ineffective effort events can lead to health and financial benefits. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to continue assessment of the effectiveness of the analytics in clinical practice and validate our findings. Eventually, their adoption in settings where costs of an intensive care day are high and ineffective efforts are frequent could yield a high return on investment.","Bakker, Lytske; Vaporidi, Katerina; Aarts, Jos; Redekop, William",Cost Eff Resour Alloc,609,24

PNS development is a highly specified process where each sensilla originates from a single sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell. One of the major genetic orchestrators of PNS development is Senseless, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor (Sens). Sens is both necessary and sufficient for SOP differentiation. Senseless expression and SOP number are regulated by the microRNA miR-9a. However, the reciprocal dynamics of Senseless and miR-9a are still obscure. By coupling single-molecule FISH with immunofluorescence, we are able to visualize transcription of the mir-9a locus and expression of Sens simultaneously. During embryogenesis, we show that the expression of mir-9a in SOP cells is rapidly lost as Senseless expression increases. However, this mutually exclusive expression pattern is not observed in the third instar imaginal wing disk, where some Senseless-expressing cells show active sites of mir-9a transcription. These data challenge and extend previous models of Senseless regulation and show complex co-expression dynamics between mir-9a and Senseless. The differences in this dynamic relationship between embryonic and larval PNS development suggest a possible switch in miR-9a function. Our work brings single-cell resolution to the understanding of dynamic regulation of PNS development by Senseless and miR-9a.","Gallicchio, Lorenzo; Griffiths-Jones, Sam; Ronshaugen, Matthew",G3 (Bethesda),609,22

Mobile payment banking system in Kenya exists since 2007, even before digital era began in India. Payments banks in India, as a concept, envisioned in 2014, nevertheless showing lot of promising growth because of the mobile penetration in India. There are lot of similarities in the intention of both the initiatives, as they mainly focus on financial inclusion for economically poor society and rural population. M-Pesa by Safaricom had made an implausible change in Kenya, improving the labor class and rural people access to banking, reducing time spent on transactions and simplifying the process by just making cell phones as their banks. India until first decade of 20(th) century, was mainly dependent on postal service for rural areas as banking solution, but now rapidly moving to digital era with payment banks as a mobile enabled banking solution. The paper explains the Indian service providers like Paytm, Airtel, Jio, and Indian postal service who had already established in India were able to move to Payment bank services quicker because of the base they had established in the last decade. The paper utilizes the secondary data information extracted from published reports and reports from Reserve Bank of India, Central Bank of Kenya and other independent organizations like FSD Maps, Statista and GSMA to arrive at a comparison between the payments systems in both the countries.","Arthi, M.

I first identify two features of the liberal answer to the question of emergency powers: conceptually, it is premised on the normative duality of normalcy and exception; institutionally, it pivots on the identification of institutional sovereignty that judges the state of exception. I then explain why this paradigm falters with the blurring of normalcy and exception. Drawing on the role of ‘theatricality’ in Hannah Arendt’s political theory, I suggest that making the public ‘see’ the role of judgment in the current undeclared emergency regime underpin the re-constitutionalization of emergency powers. Recast in constitutional mindset, the judiciary is expected to act as the institutional catalyst for forming the public judgment on the ongoing state of emergency.","Kuo, Ming-Sung",Constitutionalism Under Extreme Conditions,609,7

Virtual classrooms enable the combination of computer-based learning with interactive expert instruction and feedback. They may optimise resources and increase accessibility, facilitating larger-scale training whilst producing a similar educational benefit. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of virtual BSS classroom training compared to both non-interactive video and face-to-face teaching. METHOD: 72 medical students will be randomly assigned to three equal intervention groups based on year group and surgical skill confidence. Interventions will be implemented following an instructional video. Group A will practice independently, Group B will receive face-to-face training, and Group C will receive virtual classroom training. The assessed task will be to place three interrupted sutures with hand tied knots. Pre- and post-intervention Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) will be blind marked by two experts. Change in confidence, time to completion and a granular performance score will be measured. Feasibility and accessibility will also be assessed. RESULTS: Significant improvement in OSATS within groups will be indicative of intervention quality. Difference in improvement between groups will determine relative performance. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this will be the largest randomised control trial investigating virtual BSS classroom training. It will serve as a comprehensive appraisal of the suitability of virtual BSS classroom training as an alternative to face-to-face training. The findings will assist the development and implementation of further resource-efficient virtual BSS training programs during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future.","Nathan, Arjun; Fricker, Monty; Hanna, Nancy; Asif, Aqua; Patel, Sonam; Georgi, Maria; Hang, Kien; Sinha, Amil; Mullins, Will; Lamb, Benjamin; Sridhar, Ashwin; Kelly, John; Collins, Justin; Patel, Sonam",BJS Open,609,1

We can achieve better clinical outcomes in patients by diagnosing sepsis earlier. Procalcitonin (PCT), an inflammatory biomarker, has shown promising results in this regard. Therefore, this systematic review was done to assess the use of PCT in diagnosing and predicting severe outcomes in patients admitted to ICU and to assess if introducing PCT as a routine biochemical tool in hospitals would be helpful to achieve better clinical course in ICU patients. To identify relevant articles, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and references of included articles. Eligible studies were identified by two investigators independently and data were extracted. Original articles that evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum PCT levels in predicting sepsis, the severity of sepsis, and mortality among adult patients admitted to ICU were included in this study. A total of 2,063 citations were identified by the search, among which 10 studies (five prospective cohort, three retrospective cohort, one cross-sectional, and one case-control study) met the inclusion criteria. Most studies showed moderate-to-low risk of bias which was evaluated using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. All studies showed a positive correlation between initial PCT levels and detecting mortality resulting from sepsis, six studies found PCT helpful in detecting sepsis, and four studies evaluated the role of PCT in detecting severity in patients with sepsis. One study found area under the curve of serum PCT level for predicting 28-day mortality to be 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-0.94; p < 0.001) in adults and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92; p < 0.001) in the elderly having an optimal cut-off level of serum PCT of 0.2 ng/mL in both the adult and elderly groups, with a sensitivity of 81 and 75% and specificity of 81.7 and 80.4%, respectively. PCT has shown promising results in detecting sepsis and its clinical course. For early diagnosis and management of sepsis, severe sepsis, and mortality in patients admitted to the ICU for a more favorable clinical outcome, PCT can be used.","Malik, Mushrin; Sreekantan Nair, Archana; Illango, Janan; Siddiqui, Nabeel; Gor, Rajvi; Fernando, Ransirini W; Hamid, Pousette",,609,16

BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a major public health crisis of great risk to patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. Heart failure (HF) is a deadly chronic disease, a leading cause of hospitalizations worldwide and a great detriment to patients’ quality of life. HF therapy guidelines suggest prescribing physical activity to improve long-term outcomes. Self- or government- imposed behavioral modifications in response to COVID-19 ranging from avoiding social interactions to outright restrictions of movement (lockdowns) could compromise regular PA in HF patients, who constitute an extremely high-risk group. PURPOSE: Investigate the effect of the national lockdown in Greece 23rd March – 4th May 2020) on the PA levels of patients suffering from HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). METHODS: HFrEF patients with CIEDs were included in the study. Participants answered the Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ) regarding the period before, during and after the 42-day national lockdown. CIED-derived daily activity levels for the corresponding periods were recorded through CIED telemetry. The differences in PAQ- and CIED-derived PA levels and sedentary time before, during and after the lockdown period were investigated. RESULTS: 67 HFrEF patients participated in the study (mean age 69 ± 10.2y, 85% male). Activity levels fell in 55 (82%) of patients. The median PAQ-derived PA level decreased by 28% during lockdown, from 840.5 (944) METmin/week to 602 (1054) METmin/week during the lockdown (p = 0.01). A 53% increase was observed after the lockdown, to 924 (1214) METmin/week (p = 0.004). The CIED-derived activity level was 2.38 (1.3) hours/day pre-lockdown, 1.78 (1.1) hours/day during the lockdown (25% decrease, p < 0.001) and 2.69 (1.5) hours/day post-lockdown (51% increase, p < 0.001). Time spent on sedentary activities also increased to 9 (3) hours per day during the lockdown, up from 6.5 (4) hours before lockdown (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: All measures examined in this study indicate that the COVID-19 lockdown period was associated with a significant decrease in HFrEF patients’ PA. All efforts must be made on the part of clinicians and public health organizations to promote safe exercise in this subgroup of the population that is particularly vulnerable to the effects of a sedentary lifestyle.","Tsarouchas, A; Bakogiannis, C; Mouselimis, D; Lazaridis, C; Kelemanis, I; Theofillogiannakos, EK; Pagourelias, ED; Papadopoulos, CE; Fragakis, N; Vassilikos, VP",Eur J Prev Cardiol,609,1

This study aimed to compare outcomes of IBD patients undergoing surgery in COVID-19-treatment and COVID-19-free hospitals. METHODS: Retrospective study involving patients undergoing IBD surgery in seven centres (six COVID-19-treatment hubs and one COVID-free hospital) across 5 European countries during the period of highest reduction of elective activity due to the first peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Predictive variables of the risk of moderate-to-severe postoperative complications were analysed using logistic regression analysis. Considering the large number of regressors and the risk of over-fitting due to the small number of events, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used. RESULTS: Of the 91 patients (59 males, 64.8%) with Crohn’s disease (54, 59.3%) or ulcerative colitis (37, 40.7%), 66 (72.5%) had surgery in a COVID-19-treatment hospital, while 25 (27.5%) were treated in the COVID-19-free centre. A higher proportion of COVID-19-treatment patients required urgent surgery (48.4% vs 24%, p=0.035), did not discontinue the biologic therapy (15.1% vs. 0%, p=0.039), underwent surgery without a SARS-CoV-2 test (19.7% vs. 0%, p=0.0033), and were admitted to intensive care postoperatively (10.6% vs. 0%, p=0.032). Three patients (4.6%) of the COVID-19-treatment group had a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the hospital course. Use of steroids at surgery (Odds ratio [OR]=4.10, 95% CI 1.14–15.3, p=0.03), presence of comorbidities (OR=3.33, 95% CI 1.08–11, p=0.035), and Crohn’s disease (vs. ulcerative colitis, OR=3.82, 95% CI 1.14–15.4, p=0.028) were associated with risk of moderate-to-severe postoperative complications. The admission to a COVID-19-treatment hospital was not associated with higher risks of complications (OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.54–10.4, p=0.30) CONCLUSION: Although a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the postoperative period represented a concrete risk in IBD patients undergoing surgery in COVID-19-treatment hospitals, the study showed that IBD patients can undergo surgery regardless of the COVID-19-status of the referral centre. The study also showed the lack of standardized practice for IBD patients requiring surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Rottoli, M; Pellino, G; Tanzanu, M; Baldi, C; Frontali, A; Carvello, M; Foppa, C; Kontovounisios, C; Tekkis, P; Colombo, F; Sancho-Muriel, J; Matteo, F; Danelli, P; Celentano, V; Spinelli, A; Panis, Y; Sampietro, G; Poggioli, G",J Crohns Colitis,609,24

The flipped classroom design organizes learning in such a way that the lower‐order thinking such as memorization is expected at the individual student level in the form of homework and the higher‐order thinking including application and analysis occurs in the classroom in the presence of the instructor. With the sudden onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic, instructors and students were given no time to adjust to the remote educational set up. Flipped teaching, like most other instructional modalities, had to be transformed into an online platform. The present study assessed the effectiveness of FT in a remote setting in a graduate‐level physiology course (n=33). The course content included lecture videos, slides, and reading assignments which were made available on BlackBoard, the Learning Management System. Students were expected to have reviewed the assigned content prior to the virtual synchronous sessions. During the synchronous meeting, a question‐answer (Q&A) session allowed students to review the content yet again. Followed by the Q&A session, an individual quiz, containing lower‐order questions, was given to assess student preparation. Soon after the review of the quiz, students in small groups (4‐5 students per group) were allowed to use breakout rooms to complete a set of questions which were designed at the higher order of Bloom's taxonomy and expected students to apply knowledge, analyze or synthesize their collaborative responses. The answers to these questions were reviewed during the first part of the following synchronous session where students were selected randomly to answer these questions which prompted them to come prepared. Student surveys were administered at the beginning and the end of the course to assess their knowledge gain, perception of the remote FT format, and confidence in completing the course. Based on the survey results, it was found that the students adjusted well to the remote course setting (p<0.001) and their confidence in completing the course successfully increased from the beginning to the end of the semester (p<0.05). Students also found that the collaborative activities (93.55%) and the in‐class discussions (96.77%) were effective and were well adjusted to the synchronous computerized exams (90.32%) and the individual in‐class assessments (80.65%).

HBV core protein (HBc) contains an arginine-rich domain (ARD) at its carboxyl terminus. This ARD domain of HBc 149-183 is known to be important for viral replication but not known to have a structure. Recently, nucleocapsid proteins of several viruses have been shown to contain nucleic acid chaperone activity, which can facilitate structural rearrangement of viral genome. Major features of nucleic acid chaperones include highly basic amino acid residues and flexible protein structure. To test the nucleic acid chaperone hypothesis for HBc ARD, we first used the disassembled full-length HBc from Escherichia coli to analyze the nucleic acid annealing and strand displacement activities. To exclude the potential contamination of chaperones from E. coli, we designed synthetic HBc ARD peptides with different lengths and serine phosphorylations. We demonstrated that HBc ARD peptide can behave like a bona fide nucleic acid chaperone and that the chaperone activity depends on basic residues of the ARD domain. The loss of chaperone activity by arginine-to-alanine substitutions in the ARD can be rescued by restoring basic residues in the ARD. Furthermore, the chaperone activity is subject to regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at the HBc ARD. Interestingly, the HBc ARD can enhance in vitro cleavage activity of RNA substrate by a hammerhead ribozyme. We discuss here the potential significance of the HBc ARD chaperone activity in the context of viral DNA replication, in particular, at the steps of primer translocations and circularization of linear replicative intermediates. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis B virus is a major human pathogen. At present, no effective treatment can completely eradicate the virus from patients with chronic hepatitis B. We report here a novel chaperone activity associated with the viral core protein. Our discovery could lead to a new drug design for more effective treatment against hepatitis B virus in the future.","Chu, Tien-Hua; Liou, An-Ting; Su, Pei-Yi; Wu, Huey-Nan; Shih, Chiaho",Journal of virology,609,12

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficiency of using a new LigaSure(®) vessel sealing system (LigaSure(®) Small Jaw Instrument; Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA). METHODS We evaluated 83 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between July 2009 and June 2012. The patients were allocated to two groups, which underwent thyroid surgery using either the LigaSure(®) Small Jaw Instrument or conventional techniques. We investigated the duration of operation, estimated blood loss, pathological characteristics, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. As for duration of operation and estimated blood loss, we also performed analyses by subgroups according to the extent of thyroid resection, as either total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy. RESULTS The study groups showed no significant differences in age, sex, indications, extent of operation and estimated blood loss. Complication rates for recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, hypoparathyroidism, hematoma, and wound infection did not differ between groups, except for temporary hypoparathyroidism. Operation time was significantly shorter in the LigaSure(®) Small Jaw Instrument group than in the conventional group for all extents of thyroid resection. CONCLUSION Use of the LigaSure(®) Small Jaw Instrument seems likely to reduce the operating time for thyroid surgery without increasing estimated blood loss or the frequency of postoperative complications compared to conventional techniques.","Kuboki, Akihito; Nakayama, Tsuguhisa; Konno, Wataru; Goto, Kazutaka; Nakajima, Itsuo; Kanaya, Hiroaki; Hirabayashi, Hideki; Haruna, Shin-Ichi","Auris, nasus, larynx",609,8

METHODS This is a prospective, single-centre, three-arm randomised trial. A total of 99 eyes of 99 patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the 360° incision group (n=34), the upper-180° incision group (n=34) and the lower-180° incision group (n=31). Intraocular pressure (IOP), number of medications and complications were evaluated until 12 months after surgery. Surgical success (with or without medication) was defined as IOP ≤21 mmHg and ≥20% IOP reduction (criterion A) or IOP ≤15 mmHg and ≥20% IOP reduction (criterion B). RESULTS The mean IOP (±SD) in all eyes was reduced from 18.6 (5.9) mmHg with 3.1 (1.1) medications to 13.7 (3.4) mmHg (20.8% reduction; p<0.001) with 1.4 (1.3) medications (p<0.001) at postoperative 12-month. Each group produced comparable mean reductions in both IOP and the number of medications throughout 12 months of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival analyses showed no significance among these three groups for criterion A and criterion B. Postoperative hyphema with niveau formation occurred significantly more in the 360° group than in the lower-180° group (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS The different extents and locations of Schlemm's canal incisions during suture trabeculotomy ab interno for OAG, including the 360° incision, the upper-180° incision and the lower-180° incision, do not affect both the IOP reduction and the medications throughout 12 months of follow-up.

DESIGN Cross-sectional. SETTING Community sample. PARTICIPANTS The sample consisted of 223 Black, White, and Asian middle- to older-aged men and women residing in the Pittsburgh, PA area. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS Two nights of in-home PSG; 9 nights of wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries; retrospective sleep questionnaires; and measures of sociodemographic, psychosocial, and adiposity characteristics. RESULTS All measures of sleep duration differed significantly, with modest associations between PSG-assessed and retrospective questionnaire-assessed sleep duration. Individuals estimated their habitual sleep duration about 20-30 minutes longer by questionnaire and their prospective sleep diaries compared with both PSG- and actigraphy-assessed sleep duration. Persons reporting higher hostility had smaller associations between PSG-assessed sleep duration and other methods compared with those with lower hostility; those reporting more depressive symptoms and poorer overall health had smaller associations between actigraphy-assessed sleep duration and questionnaire and diary measures. Apnea-hypopnea index was not related to differences among estimates of sleep duration. CONCLUSIONS PSG, actigraphy, diary, and retrospective questionnaire assessments yield different estimates of sleep duration. Hostility, depressive symptoms, and perceptions of poor health were associated with the magnitude of differences among some estimates. These findings may be useful in understanding the health consequences of short or long self-reported sleep duration and for guiding investigator decisions about choices of measures in specific populations.","Matthews, Karen A; Patel, Sanjay R; Pantesco, Elizabeth J; Buysse, Daniel J; Kamarck, Thomas W; Lee, Laisze; Hall, Martica H",Sleep health,609,20

The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown on sleep patterns and sleep quality in adolescents and young adults. METHODS An online survey was conducted in June 2020 with adolescents and young adults (n = 498) aged 12-25 years. Participants had to answer questions on sleep, first retrospectively, referring to the time prior to the pandemic, and then referring to the time during the pandemic. RESULTS A pronounced shift towards later sleep combined with an increase in sleep duration was found during the pandemic. However, these changes in sleep habits were more pronounced in adolescents than in young adults and seem to occur mostly during weekdays compared to weekends. During the pandemic, teens also reported an improvement in daytime sleepiness and subjective sleep quality, while young adults reported an increase in sleep difficulties associated with sleep onset difficulties, nocturnal and early morning awakenings, and nightmares. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 related lockdown seems to have had a beneficial effect on sleep in adolescents. In young adults, benefits are not as obvious. These results support that later school start times would be beneficial for adolescents. However, in young adults it could be important to investigate the effects of other situational or interindividual factors (stress, lifestyle habits, employment, etc.).","Ramos Socarras, Laura; Potvin, Jérémie; Forest, Geneviève",Sleep medicine,609,8

They are generally biocompatible, nontoxic, and easy to synthesize and modify. Three decades after the discovery of the first CPPs, ~2,000 CPP sequences have been identified, and many more predicted. Nevertheless, the field has a strong commitment to authenticate new, more efficient, and specific CPPs.Areas covered: Although a scattering of CPPs have been found by chance, various systematic approaches have been developed and refined over the years to directly aid the identification and depiction of new peptide-based delivery vectors or therapeutics. Here, the authors give an overview of CPPs, and review various approaches of discovering new ones. An emphasis is placed on in silico methods, as these have advanced rapidly in recent years.Expert opinion: Although there are many known CPPs, there is a need to find more efficient and specific CPPs. Several approaches are used to identify such sequences. The success of these approaches depends on the advancement of others and the successful prediction of CPP sequences relies on experimental data.","Porosk, Ly; Gaidutšik, Ilja; Langel, Ülo",Expert opinion on drug discovery,609,1

We test the hypothesis that listeners with hearing loss' difficulties with comprehension and processing of syntactically complex sentences are due to the processing of degraded input interfering with the successful processing of complex sentences. Method We performed a neuroimaging study with a sentence comprehension task, varying sentence complexity (through subject-object order and verb-arguments order) and cognitive demands (presence or absence of a secondary task) within subjects. Groups of older subjects with hearing loss (n = 20) and age-matched normal-hearing controls (n = 20) were tested. Results The comprehension data show effects of syntactic complexity and hearing ability, with normal-hearing controls outperforming listeners with hearing loss, seemingly more so on syntactically complex sentences. The secondary task did not influence off-line comprehension. The imaging data show effects of group, sentence complexity, and task, with listeners with hearing loss showing decreased activation in typical speech processing areas, such as the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. No interactions between group, sentence complexity, and task were found in the neuroimaging data. Conclusions The results suggest that listeners with hearing loss process speech differently from their normal-hearing peers, possibly due to the increased demands of processing degraded auditory input. Increased cognitive demands by means of a secondary visual shape processing task influence neural sentence processing, but no evidence was found that it does so in a different way for listeners with hearing loss and normal-hearing listeners.","Vogelzang, Margreet; Thiel, Christiane M; Rosemann, Stephanie; Rieger, Jochem W; Ruigendijk, Esther","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",609,1

This information is important since successful vaccination through the stimulation of protective immune responses could be a mechanism to prevent viral contamination of semen and subsequent wide spread viral dissemination. Even control of the infection by shortening the duration of viral shedding and lowering the viral load in semen would lessen the chances of viral dissemination through this route. This review will highlight the current knowledge of immunity in the male reproductive tract and summarize 'antiviral' as well as 'proviral' factors in semen such as cytokines, cells, antibodies, antimicrobial peptides, enzymes, hormones and growth factors. These factors must provide a fine balance between 'immunosuppression' in semen needed to protect sperm viability and 'immunocompetency' to prevent pathogen contamination.

Non-infected women with a confirmed pregnancy over 30th gestational week were consecutively included. A patient-reported non-validated questionnaire formed by the expert committee that includes 15 specific questions was used. Non-infected, pregnant women over 30th gestational week who applied to the outpatient clinic were consecutively included. A total of 213 women were enrolled, 37 were excluded: 7 for being in the first trimester, 3 were illiterate, and 27 were Syrian refugees having difficulties in translation.Results: A total of 172 pregnant women were included. Overall, four women refused to participate to the survey (1.9%). The mean age was 27.5 ± 5.3 years. Median gestational week and parity were 35 ± 11 weeks and 1 ± 2, respectively. Pregnant women were observed to trust the authorities (65%) and the healthcare staff (92.4%), and their respect was increased (82.5%) during the outbreak. Majority of the women (87.2%) comply with the self-quarantine rules. Half of the women (52%) reported that they felt vulnerable and predominantly were concerned (80%). Approximately one-third of the women constantly keep thinking that they may get infected (35.5%) or they might get infected during/following the delivery or their baby might get infected after being born (42%). Half of the women (50%) were reported that they either had no idea about or think the breastfeeding is not safe during the outbreak. About 45% of the women were confused or had doubts about if the mode of delivery may be affected by the pandemic. Greater part of the participants does not know if COVID-19 might cause birth defects (76%) or preterm birth (64.5%).

The health systems are facing significant challenges in carrying out the diagnosis and treatment of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children. Levofloxacin is suitable for treating infectious diseases in various systems but limited in children due to arthropathy issues in weight-bearing joints. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in children with macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS We retrospectively enrolled six confirmed cases of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia who were admitted in the paediatric respiratory ward of Shandong provincial hospital Affiliated to Shandong first Medical University between 1st January 2020 and 29th February 2020. Levofloxacin was given to the patients through the intravenous or oral route as per the following dosages :<5 years, 8-10 mg/kg q12 h; >5 years, 8-10 mg/kg, qd for 10 days. The clinical data were collected and analysed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The average age of the enrolled cases was six years and nine months (range, four years, and seven months to eleven years and seven months). All cases were found to be drug-resistant and were treated with azithromycin combined with antibacterial drugs. Levofloxacin was used in the patient's refractory to macrolide antibiotics. The temperature of five cases returned to normal 1-2 days after treatment with levofloxacin, and the imaging of the four cases showed expected improvements. The gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological manifestations, joint symptoms, blood parameters, liver and kidney functions, and exercise conditions of the children were closely monitored. The follow-up time of the patients ranged from one week to five months. No drug-related adverse reactions were observed in patients during treatment or during follow-up. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The clinical symptoms and imaging significantly improved after treatment with levofloxacin, and no drug-related adverse reactions were observed. Levofloxacin proved to be an effective and safe drug in the treatment of children with macrolide-resistant mycoplasma pneumonia. This study will provide a reference for evaluating the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in the paediatric population.","Dai, Fang-Fang; Liu, Feng-Qin; Chen, Xing; Yang, Juan; Wang, Ke; Guo, Chun-Yan",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,609,12

This study aims to examine the outcomes and cost of direct ward admission following primary cranial vault remodeling for sagittal synostosis. METHODS An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was undertaken of the records of all patients who underwent primary cranial vault remodeling for isolated sagittal craniosynostosis from 2009 to 2015 at a single pediatric hospital. Patient demographics, perioperative course, and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS One hundred ten patients met inclusion criteria with absence of other major medical problems. Average age at operation was 6.7 months, with a mean follow-up of 19.8 months. Ninety-eight patients (89 percent) were admitted to a general ward for postoperative care, whereas the remaining 12 (11 percent) were admitted to the intensive care unit for preoperative or perioperative concerns. Among ward-admitted patients, there were four (3.6 percent) minor complications; however, there were no major adverse events, with none necessitating intensive care unit transfers from the ward and no mortalities. Average hospital stay was 3.7 days. The institution's financial difference in cost of intensive care unit stay versus ward bed was $5520 on average per bed per day. Omitting just one intensive care unit postoperative day stay for this patient cohort would reduce projected health care costs by a total of $540,960 for the study period. CONCLUSION Despite the common practice of postoperative admission to the intensive care unit following cranial vault remodeling for sagittal craniosynostosis, the authors suggest that postoperative care be considered on an individual basis, with only a small percentage requiring a higher level of care.

However, in the long-term follow-up, weight loss failure and intractable severe reflux after primary LSG can necessitate further surgical interventions. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the safety and the efficiency of revisional sleeve gastrectomy (ReSG). SETTING Private hospital. METHODS From October 2008 to October 2014, 61 patients underwent ReSG. All patients with failure after primary LSG underwent radiologic evaluation, and an algorithm of treatment was proposed. RESULTS Sixty-one patients (54 women, 7 men; mean age 40.8 yr) with a body mass index (BMI) of 39.4 kg/m² underwent ReSG. The primary LSG was performed for mean BMI of 46.2 kg/m² (range 35.4-77.9). The mean interval time from the primary LSG to ReSG was of 37.5 months (9-80 mo). The indication for ReSG was insufficient weight loss in 28 patients (45.9%), weight regain in 29 patients (47.5%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in 4 patients. In 42 patients the gastrografin swallow results were interpreted as primary dilation and in the remaining 19 cases as secondary dilation. The computed tomography (CT) scan volumetry was obtained in 38 patients with mean gastric volume of 436.3 cc (275-1056 cc). All cases were completed by laparoscopy with no intraoperative incidents. The mean operative time was 39 minutes (range 29-70 min) and the mean hospital stay was 3.5 days (range 3-16 d). One perigastric hematoma and 2 cases of gastric stenosis were recorded. The mean BMI decreased to 29.2 kg/m(2) (range 20.2-37.5); the mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 58.5% (±25.3) (P<.0004) for a mean follow-up of 20 months (range 6-56 mo). CONCLUSION The ReSG may be a valid option for failure of primary LSG. Further prospective clinical trials are required to compare the outcomes of ReSG with those of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or duodenal switch for weight loss failure after LSG.","Nedelcu, Marius; Noel, Patrick; Iannelli, Antonio; Gagner, Michel",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,609,24

The goal of this work is to determine whether VSV inhibits the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which are thought to serve as mRNA export factors. Confocal microscopy experiments showed that hnRNPA1, hnRNPK, and hnRNPC1/C2, but not hnRNPB1 or lamin A/C, are relocalized to the cytoplasm during VSV infection. We determined whether protein import is inhibited by VSV by transfecting cells with a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagged with either the M9 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) or the classical NLS. These experiments revealed that both the M9 NLS and the classical NLS are functional during VSV infection. These data suggest that the inhibition of protein import is not responsible for hnRNP relocalization during VSV infection but that hnRNP export is enhanced. We found that hnRNPA1 relocalization was significantly reduced following the silencing of the mRNA export factor Rae1, indicating that Rae1 is necessary for hnRNP export. In order to determine the role of hnRNPA1 in VSV infection, we silenced hnRNPA1 in HeLa cells and assayed three aspects of the viral life cycle: host protein synthesis shutoff concurrent with the onset of viral protein synthesis, replication by plaque assay, and cell killing. We observed that host shutoff and replication are unaffected by the reduction in hnRNPA1 but that the rate of VSV-induced apoptosis is slower in cells that have reduced hnRNPA1. These data suggest that VSV promotes hnRNPA1 relocalization in a Rae1-dependent manner for apoptotic signaling.","Pettit Kneller, Elizabeth L; Connor, John H; Lyles, Douglas S",Journal of virology,609,7

High-dose oral celecoxib was started 3 h after operation in intercostal nerve block group or after withdrawal of epidural analgesia in epidural analgesia group. The primary endpoint was postoperative pain and adverse events, and the secondary endpoint was the length of the analgesic procedure and physiological function on postoperative day 1. RESULTS This study was closed before accumulating the necessary sample size. We eventually analyzed 21 patients undergoing intercostal nerve block and 22 patients undergoing epidural analgesia. Although the incidence of postoperative adverse events and postoperative complications was comparable between the groups, the incidence of procedure-related troubles was significantly higher in the epidural analgesia group than in the intercostal nerve block group. The length of the analgesic procedure was significantly shorter in the intercostal nerve block group than in the epidural analgesic group. The postoperative pain during postoperative days 0-7, as evaluated by a visual analog scale, was not significantly different between the groups. Likewise, postoperative physiological function, as evaluated by vital capacity and walking distance, was not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION Although our limited sample size compromised our ability to draw definitive conclusions, intercostal nerve block followed by high-dose oral celecoxib seems to be an option for patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer.","Ueda, Kazuhiro; Hayashi, Masataro; Murakami, Junichi; Tanaka, Toshiki; Utada, Koji; Hamano, Kimikazu",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,609,17

However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. METHODS Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was ""access to technology and systems,"" which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was ""collecting and sharing of information,"" which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar ""barriers to uptake"": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required.","Hunter, Inga; Elers, Phoebe; Lockhart, Caroline; Guesgen, Hans; Singh, Amardeep; Whiddett, Dick",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,609,17

Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination therapy is currently tested for curing Covid-19, with promising results. However, the molecular mechanism of action of this combination is not established yet. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we show that both drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells. We reveal unexpected molecular similarity between azithromycin and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, azithromycin interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site shared by azithromycin and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine molecules can saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor ACE-2. Taken together, these data show that azithromycin is directed against the virus, whereas hydroxychloroquine is directed against cellular attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where the most efficient therapeutic intervention probably stands. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination therapy in patients with Covid-19. Incidentally, our data suggest that the conserved Q-134/F-135/N-137 triad could be considered as a target for vaccine strategies.","Fantini, Jacques; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",International journal of antimicrobial agents,609,1

However, the precise sequence of events involving these organs remains to be established. Furthermore, whether an impaired gut-brain-BM axis is a cause or consequence of HTN is actively under investigation. This will be extremely important for translation of this fundamental knowledge to novel, innovative approaches for the control and management of HTN. Therefore, our objectives are to summarize the latest hypothesis, provide evidence for and against the impaired gut, BM and brain interactions in HTN and discuss perspectives and future directions. RECENT FINDINGS Hypertensive stimuli activate autonomic neural pathways resulting in increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic cardiovascular modulation. This directly affects the functions of cardiovascular-relevant organs to increase blood pressure. Increases in sympathetic drive to the gut and BM also trigger sequences of signaling events that ultimately contribute to altered GM, increased gut permeability, enhanced gut- and brain-targeted pro-inflammatory cells from the BM in perpetuation and establishment of HTN. SUMMARY In this review, we present the mechanisms involving the brain, gut, and BM, whose dysfunctional interactions may be critical in persistent neuroinflammation and key in the development and establishment of HTN.","Li, Jing; Raizada, Mohan K; Richards, Elaine M",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,609,1

The identification of factors that enhance cardiac repair by the restoration of the vascular network is, therefore, of great significance. Here, we show that the transcription factor Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is increased in stressed cardiomyocytes and induces a cardioprotective cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis after ischemia. Single-cell sequencing indicates ZEB2 to be enriched in injured cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of ZEB2 results in impaired cardiac contractility and infarct healing post-myocardial infarction (post-MI), while cardiomyocyte-specific ZEB2 overexpression improves cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac function. We identified Thymosin β4 (TMSB4) and Prothymosin α (PTMA) as main paracrine factors released from cardiomyocytes to stimulate angiogenesis by enhancing endothelial cell migration, and whose regulation is validated in our in vivo models. Therapeutic delivery of ZEB2 to cardiomyocytes in the infarcted heart induces the expression of TMSB4 and PTMA, which enhances angiogenesis and prevents cardiac dysfunction. These findings reveal ZEB2 as a beneficial factor during ischemic injury, which may hold promise for the identification of new therapies.","Gladka, Monika M; Kohela, Arwa; Molenaar, Bas; Versteeg, Danielle; Kooijman, Lieneke; Monshouwer-Kloots, Jantine; Kremer, Veerle; Vos, Harmjan R; Huibers, Manon M H; Haigh, Jody J; Huylebroeck, Danny; Boon, Reinier A; Giacca, Mauro; van Rooij, Eva",Nature communications,609,1

Specifically, energy-based devices and lasers require special consideration, as they may emit plume which has been shown to contain tissue debris and aerosolized biological materials. Prior studies have shown transmission of viruses and bacteria via plume (i.e., HIV and papillomavirus). The purpose of this study was to evaluate plume characteristics of the Er:YAG resurfacing laser (Sciton; Palo Alto, CA) and compare it to the Morpheus8 fractional radiofrequency device (InMode; Lake Forest, CA). METHODS Five patients who underwent aesthetic resurfacing and/or skin tightening of the face and neck were treated with the Er:YAG (Sciton Joule, Palo Alto, CA) and/or fractional radiofrequency (Morpheus8, Lake Forest, CA) between April 1 and May 11, 2020. Data collected included patient demographics, past medical history, treatment parameters, adverse events, particle counter data, as well as high magnification video equiptment. Patients were evaluated during treatment with a calibrated particle meter (PCE; Jupiter, FL). The particle meter was used at a consistent focal distance (6-12 inches) to sample the surrounding environment during treatment at 2.83 L/min to a counting efficiency of 50% at 0.3 µm and 100% at >0.45 µm. Recordings were obtained with and without a smoke evacuator. RESULTS Of our cohort (n = 5), average age was 58 years old (STD ±7.2). Average Fitzpatrick type was between 2 and 3. Two patients received Er:YAG fractional resurfacing in addition to fractional radiofrequency during the same treatment session. Two patients had fractional radiofrequency only, and one patient had laser treatment with the Er:YAG only. There were no adverse events recorded. The particle counter demonstrated ambient baseline particles/second (pps) at 8 (STD ±6). During fractional radiofrequency treatment at 1-mm depth, the mean recording was 8 pps (STD ±8). At the more superficial depth of 0.5 mm, recordings showed 10 pps (STD ±6). The Er:YAG laser resurfacing laser had mean readings of 44 pps (STD ±11). When the particle sizes were broken down by size, the fractional radiofrequency device had overall smaller particle sizes with a count of 251 for 0.3 µm (STD ±147) compared with Er:YAG laser with a count of 112 for 0.3 µm (STD ±84). The fractional radiofrequency did not appear to emit particles >5 µm throughout the treatment, however, the Er:YAG laser consistently recorded majority of particles in the range of 5-10 µm. The addition of the smoke evacuator demonstrated a 50% reduction in both particles per second recorded as well as all particle sizes. CONCLUSION Re-evaluation of the plume effect from aesthetic devices has become important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies are required to characterize viability of COVID-19 viability and transmissibility in plume specimens. Based on this pilot study, we recommend that devices that generate little to no plume such as fractional radiofrequency devices be used in Phase I reopening of practice while devices that generate a visible plume such as Er:YAG laser resurfacing devices be avoided and only used with appropriate personal protective equipment in addition to a smoke evacuator in Phase IV reopening.","Dayan, Erez; Theodorou, Spero; Jay Burns, A; Katz, Bruce; Dover, Jeffrey S",Lasers in surgery and medicine,609,27

Real-time PCR and western blotting revealed that NEAT1 and ARHGAP26 were upregulated, and miR-1277-5p was downregulated in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH cells in a certain of concentration- and time- dependent manner. MPP+ induced apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells, as evidenced by decreased cell viability and Bcl-2 expression, and elevated apoptosis rate and levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, which were examined by MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blotting. Moreover, commercial assay kits indicated that inflammatory response and oxidative stress were provoked in response to MPP+, due to promoted contents of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, malondialdehyde, and lactate dehydrogenase, accompanied with suppressed superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels. Notably, MPP+-induced apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress in SK-N-SH cells were mitigated by NEAT1 knockdown and/or miR-1277-5p overexpression. Moreover, silencing of miR-1277-5p could abrogate the suppression of NEAT1 deficiency on MPP+-induced cell injury. Similarly, upregulating miR-1277-5p-elicited neuroprotection in MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cells was reversed by ARHGAP26 restoration. Dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated a direct interaction between miR-1277-5p and NEAT1 or ARHGAP26.

Despite the shutdown measures being in place, northern China still suffered severe haze episodes (HE) that are not yet fully understood, particularly how the source emissions changed. Thus, the meteorological conditions and source emissions in processing five HEs occurred in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area were investigated by analyzing a comprehensive real-time measurement dataset including air quality data, particle physics, optical properties, chemistry, aerosol lidar remote sensing, and meteorology. Three HEs recorded before the shutdown began were related to accumulated primary pollutants and secondary aerosol formation under unfavorable dispersion conditions. The common ""business as usual"" emissions from local primary sources in this highly polluted area exceeded the wintertime atmospheric diffusive capacity to disperse them. Thus, an intensive haze formed under these adverse meteorological conditions such as in the first HE, with coal combustion to be the predominant source. Positive responses to the shutdown measures were demonstrated by reduced contributions from traffic and dust during the final two HEs that overlapped the Spring and Lantern Festivals, respectively. Local meteorological dispersion during the Spring Festival was the poorest among the five HEs. Increased residential burning plus fireworks emissions contributed to the elevated PM2.5 with the potential of enhancing the HEs.

This undermines patient safety and creates a potential source of major morbidity and mortality. Understanding the factors that influence prescribing behaviour may allow development of interventions to reduce PIP. The aim of this study is to apply the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to explore barriers to effective prescribing for older adults in the ambulatory setting. METHODS A scoping review was performed based on the five-stage methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. From 30 Aug 2018 to 5 Sep 2018, we conducted our search on PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science. We also searched five electronic journals, Google and Google Scholar to identify additional sources and grey literature. Two reviewers applied eligibility criteria to the title and abstract screening, followed by full text screening, before systematically charting the data. RESULTS A total of 5731 articles were screened. Twenty-nine studies met the selection criteria for qualitative analysis. We mapped our results using the 14-domain TDF, eventually identifying 10 domains of interest for barriers to effective prescribing. Of these, significant domains include physician-related factors such as ""Knowledge"", ""Skills"", and ""Social/Professional Role and Identity""; issues with ""Environmental Context and Resources""; and the impact of ""Social Influences"" and ""Emotion"" on prescribing behaviour. CONCLUSION The TDF elicited multiple domains which both independently and collectively lead to barriers to effective prescribing for older adults in the ambulatory setting. Changing the prescribing climate will thus require interventions targeting multiple stakeholders, including physicians, patients and hospital/clinic systems. Further work is needed to explore individual domains and guide development of frameworks to aid guide prescribing for older adults in the ambulatory setting.","Lau, Sabrina; Lun, Penny; Ang, Wendy; Tan, Keng Teng; Ding, Yew Yoong",BMC geriatrics,609,1

METHODS We systematically researched in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases observational studies describing COVID-19 in children and/or adolescents until April 11, 2020. Data regarding clinical and radiological features were extracted from eligible studies and meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling. RESULTS We examined 19 eligible studies for a total of 2855 children and/or adolescents with COVID-19. Approximately 47% of subjects had fever (95% confidence interval [CI] 22-72%; I2 = 98.6%), 37% cough (95%CI 15-63%; I2 = 98.6%), 4% diarrhea (95%CI 0-12%; I2 = 92.2%), 2% nasal congestion (95%CI 0-7%; I2 = 87.7%), 1% dyspnea (95%CI 0-7%; I2 = 91.5%) and 0% abdominal pain (95%CI 0-1%; I2 = 76.3%).

METHODS We searched five electronic databases and the grey literature up to end of September 2020. Prospective longitudinal studies that described the association between ENDS/ENNDS use, and subsequent tobacco use in those aged < 20 years who were non-smokers at baseline were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to assess risk of bias. Data were extracted by two reviewers and pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. We generated unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) describing associations between ENDS/ENNDS and tobacco use. FINDINGS A total of 36 publications met the eligibility criteria, of which 25 were included in the systematic review (23 in the meta-analysis) after exclusion of overlapping studies. Sixteen studies had high to moderate risk of bias. Ever users of ENDS/ENNDS had over three times the risk of ever cigarette use (ARR 3·01 (95% CI: 2·37, 3·82; p<0·001, I2: 82·3%), and current cigarette use had over two times the risk (ARR 2·56 (95% CI: 1·61, 4·07; p<0·001, I2: 77·3%) at follow up.

Serious games provide an original, engaging, and potentially effective way of disseminating COVID-19 IPC guidelines. Escape COVID-19, a serious game designed to teach COVID-19 IPC practices, was previously validated in nursing home personnel. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to identify the factors facilitating or impeding the intention of changing IPC behavior after playing the Escape COVID-19 serious game in a larger and more heterogeneous population after national rollout. METHODS This fully-automated prospective web-based study, compliant with the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES), was conducted in all 3 main language regions of Switzerland. After creating an account on a specific web platform, participants were asked to fill in a short demographic questionnaire before accessing the serious game. A second questionnaire was then displayed and had to be completed to obtain a course completion certificate, which was the only incentive given to the potential participants. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants reporting they were willing to change their IPC behavior. Secondary outcomes were the IPC areas affected by this willingness and the presumed evolution in the use of specific personal protective equipment items. The elements associated with the intention of changing IPC behavior, or lack thereof, were also assessed. Other secondary outcomes were the subjective perceptions regarding length, difficulty, meaningfulness and usefulness of the serious game, impression of engagement and of boredom while playing it, and willingness to recommend its use to friends or colleagues. RESULTS From March 9th to June 9th 2021, a total of 3227 accounts were created on the platform and 1104 participants (34.2%) completed the post-game questionnaire. A total of 509 participants (46.1%) answered that they intended to change their IPC behavior after playing the game. Among the others, most (86%, 512/595) answered that they were already applying these guidelines. Participants who followed the German version were less likely to intend to change their IPC behavior (OR 0.48 [95%CI 0.24 to 0.96], P=.038) and found the game less engaging (P<.001). Conversely, participants aged 53 years or older had a stronger intention of changing IPC behavior (OR 2.07 [95%CI 1.44 to 2.97], P<.001). CONCLUSIONS ""Escape COVID-19"" is a useful tool to enhance correct IPC measures on a national scale, even after 2 COVID-19 pandemic waves. However, its impact was affected by language, age category, and previous educational training, and adaptations should be performed to enhance its impact on specific populations.

Here we show that a nickel-molybdenum nanoalloy with tetragonal MoNi4 phase can catalyze the HOR efficiently in alkaline electrolytes. The catalyst exhibits a high apparent exchange current density of 3.41 milliamperes per square centimeter and operates very stable, which is 1.4 times higher than that of state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. With this catalyst, we further demonstrate the capability to tolerate carbon monoxide poisoning. Marked HOR activity was also observed on similarly designed WNi4 catalyst. We attribute this remarkable HOR reactivity to an alloy effect that enables optimum adsorption of hydrogen on nickel and hydroxyl on molybdenum (tungsten), which synergistically promotes the Volmer reaction.","Duan, Yu; Yu, Zi-You; Yang, Li; Zheng, Li-Rong; Zhang, Chu-Tian; Yang, Xiao-Tu; Gao, Fei-Yue; Zhang, Xiao-Long; Yu, Xingxing; Liu, Ren; Ding, Hong-He; Gu, Chao; Zheng, Xu-Sheng; Shi, Lei; Jiang, Jun; Zhu, Jun-Fa; Gao, Min-Rui; Yu, Shu-Hong",Nature communications,609,24

As of April 22, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take its toll, with >2.6 million confirmed infections and >183,000 deaths. Dire projections are surfacing almost every day, and policymakers worldwide are using projections for critical decisions. Given this background, we modeled unobserved infections to examine the extent to which we might be grossly underestimating COVID-19 infections in North America. METHODS We developed a machine-learning model to uncover hidden patterns based on reported cases and to predict potential infections. First, our model relied on dimensionality reduction to identify parameters that were key to uncovering hidden patterns. Next, our predictive analysis used an unbiased hierarchical Bayesian estimator approach to infer past infections from current fatalities. RESULTS Our analysis indicates that, when we assumed a 13-day lag time from infection to death, the United States, as of April 22, 2020, likely had at least 1.3 million undetected infections. With a longer lag time-for example, 23 days-there could have been at least 1.7 million undetected infections. Given these assumptions, the number of undetected infections in Canada could have ranged from 60,000 to 80,000. Duarte's elegant unbiased estimator approach suggested that, as of April 22, 2020, the United States had up to >1.6 million undetected infections and Canada had at least 60,000 to 86,000 undetected infections. However, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data feed on April 22, 2020, reported only 840,476 and 41,650 confirmed cases for the United States and Canada, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We have identified 2 key findings: (1) as of April 22, 2020, the United States may have had 1.5 to 2.029 times the number of reported infections and Canada may have had 1.44 to 2.06 times the number of reported infections and (2) even if we assume that the fatality and growth rates in the unobservable population (undetected infections) are similar to those in the observable population (confirmed infections), the number of undetected infections may be within ranges similar to those described above. In summary, 2 different approaches indicated similar ranges of undetected infections in North America. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level V.

Because data regarding the impact on patients with breast cancer are urgently needed, we aimed to provide a preliminary estimate of the impact of COVID-19 on time to treatment initiation (TTI) for patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer cared for at a large academic center. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of patients with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, a time period during which care was affected by COVID-19, and an unaffected cohort diagnosed between January 1, 2018 and May 15, 2018. Outcomes included patient volume, TTI, and initial treatment modality. Adjusted TTI was compared using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS Three hundred sixty-six patients were included. There was an 18.8% decrease in patient volume in 2020 (n = 164) versus 2018 (n = 202). There was no association between time of diagnosis (pre-COVID-19 or during COVID-19) and adjusted TTI (P = .926). There were fewer in situ diagnoses in the 2020 cohort (P = .040). There was increased use of preoperative systemic therapy in 2020 (43.9% overall, 20.7% chemotherapy, and 23.2% hormonal therapy) versus 2018 (16.4% overall, 12.4% chemotherapy, and 4.0% hormonal therapy) (P < .001). CONCLUSION TTI was maintained among patients diagnosed and treated for breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic at a single large academic center. There was a decrease in patient volume, specifically in patients with in situ disease and a shift in initial therapy toward the use of preoperative hormonal therapy.","Hawrot, Kathryn; Shulman, Lawrence N; Bleiweiss, Ira J; Wilkie, Elizabeth J; Frosch, Zachary A K; Jankowitz, Rachel C; Laughlin, Amy I",JCO oncology practice,609,17

Avoidance of laparoscopy was recommended, to reduce aerosol generation and risk of virus transmission. Evidence on the safety profile of laparoscopy during the pandemic is lacking. This study compares patient outcomes and risk to staff from laparoscopic and open gastrointestinal operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Single-centre retrospective study of gastrointestinal operations performed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic, comorbidity, perioperative and survival data were collected from electronic medical records and supplemented with patient symptoms reported at telephone follow up. Outcomes assessed were: patient mortality, illness among staff, patient COVID-19 rates, length of hospital stay and postdischarge symptomatology. RESULTS A total of 73 patients with median age of 56 years were included; 55 (75%) and 18 (25%) underwent laparoscopic and open surgery, respectively. All-cause mortality was 5% (4/73), was related to COVID-19 in all cases, with no mortality after laparoscopic surgery. A total of 14 staff members developed COVID-19 symptoms within 2 weeks, with no significant difference between laparoscopic and open surgery (10 vs 4; p=0.331). Median length of stay was shorter in the laparoscopic versus the open group (4.5 vs 9.9 days; p=0.011), and postdischarge symptomatology across 15 symptoms was similar between groups (p=0.135-0.814). CONCLUSIONS With appropriate protective measures, laparoscopic surgery is safe for patients and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The laparoscopic approach maintains an advantage of shorter length of hospital stay compared with open surgery.","Hadjittofi, C; Seraj, S S; Uddin, A; Ali, Z J; Antonas, P L; Fisher, R J; Parekh, K P; Lovett, B; Ahmad, A",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,609,19

In a response to this, we aimed to evaluate the knee arthroscopy learning curve among medical students and orthopaedic residents. METHODS An arthroscopy simulator was used to compare the learning curves of two groups. Medical students with any prior knowledge of arthroscopy (n=24) were compared to a residents group (n=16). Analyzed parameters were ""time to complete a task,"" assessment of the movement of tools and values scoring damage to the surrounding tissues. RESULTS After several repetitions, both groups improved their skills in terms of time and movement. Residents were on average faster, had less camera movement, and touched the cartilage tissue less often than did students. Students showed a steeper improvement curve than residents for certain parameters, as they started from a different experience level. CONCLUSION The participants were able to reduce the time to complete a task. There was also a decrease in possible damage to the virtual surrounding tissues. In general, the residents had better mean values, but the students had the steeper learning curve. Particularly less experienced surgeons can especially train their hand-eye coordination skills required for arthroscopy surgery.

Furthermore, it is critical to respect the continuing importance of flexible laryngoscopy in diagnosis. Safely managing airways during the pandemic requires thoughtful multidisciplinary planning.

Reductions in manpower due to officer illness and the need to social distance to suppress spread of the disease restricts the ability of police to fully engage with the public and deliver full services. Changes to policing strategies may affect residents’ feelings of safety and their relationships with police. The purpose of this study is to understand high crime area residents’ experiences with police and safety during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The current study draws on household surveys of residents across three high crime, disadvantaged neighborhoods in St. Louis County, Missouri. We implemented three methods. First, we synthesized qualitative feedback about the impact on safety and policing. Second, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests compared pre-pandemic assessments of policing and safety measures to measures collected during the pandemic. Finally, we employed multinomial regression to examine how perceived changes in policing affected residents’ change in safety during the pandemic. Findings: Residents saw police less and engaged with police less during the pandemic. They reported hearing gunshots more often. Reduced police presence in neighborhoods led to mixed effects on safety, largely decreasing residents’ feelings of safety. However, two factors that consistently improved safety were positive encounters with police and police being less involved with minor offenses. Originality/value: This is the first study that assesses the pandemic impact on residents’ perceptions of safety and police in disadvantaged, high crime contexts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Nouri, S.; Kochel, T.

Of particular need are the N95 medical face respirators that filter 95% of all airborne particles at and above 0.3 um in diameter, many of which use meltblown microfibers of charged polypropylene (e.g, the 3M 8200). An intensive search is underway to find reliable methods to lengthen the useful life of these normally disposable units. It is currently believed that these masks and respirators cannot be cleaned with 70 to 75% alcohol-water solutions, as past wet/dry experiments show that filtration efficiency can drop by ~40% after the first such treatment. This has been interpreted as the liquids disrupting the surface charge on the fibers and has led to a recent CDC/NIOSH advisory against using alcohol for their decontamination. We have replicated the drop in efficiency after alcohol treatment. However, we find that the efficiency can be recovered by more effective drying, which we achieve with a vacuum chamber. Drying at pressures of < ~6 mBar (0.6 kPa) restores the measured filtering efficiency to within 2% or so of the pre-washing value, which we have sustained for 5 cleaning-drying cycles so far in three models of N95 masks. The mechanism seems to be the removal of water molecules adsorbed on the fiber surfaces, a hypothesis which is supported by two independent observations: (A) the filtering efficiency increases non-linearly with the weight loss during drying, and (B) filtration efficiency shows an abrupt recovery as the vacuum pressure drops from 13 to 6 mBar, the range physically attributable to the removal of adsorbed water. These results are not compatible with the electrostatic discharge hypothesis, and rather suggest that water molecules adsorbed to the fiber surface are reducing the filtration efficiency via surface tension interactions (e.g., wicking between the fibers and coating their surfaces with a film). Such a degradation mechanism has two implications: (A) Respirators decontaminated by a soak in 70% v/v ethanol regain their filtration efficiency once they are fully dry. We employ vacuum chambers in this study, which are inexpensive and commonly available. (B) This mechanism presents the possibility that mask filtration performance may be subject to degradation by other sources of moisture, and that the mask would continue to be compromised even if it appears dry. The mask would need to be vacuum-dried to restore its performance. This study introduces a number of methods which could be developed and validated for use in resource-limited settings. As the pandemic spreads to rural areas and developing nations, these would allow for local efforts to decontaminate, restore, monitor, and test medical masks.","Nazeeri, A. I.; Hilburn, I.

Yet the focus on emergency liquidity assistance tends to obscure the broader significance of swap lines for US monetary governance. As this article shows, swap lines have historically played a crucial and evolving role in structuring and facilitating specific practices of offshore Eurodollar liquidity production in the interest of US monetary policy. A key contemporary example can be found in the uptake of swap lines during the Covid-19 market turmoil in early 2020: swap lines alleviated offshore dollar funding conditions to such an extent that they also triggered reverse inflows of dollar liquidity back into the US. More than simply providing a backstop to the global system, these swap interventions effectively restructured cross-border financial flows in a way that afforded the Fed greater control over domestic markets. Yet as the capacity to influence global liquidity conditions appears increasingly crucial to the Federal Reserve’s control over domestic monetary conditions, these interventions pose broader questions about its role in managing instable and evolving cross-border credit relations that link domestic and global markets. © 2021 The Author(s).

In Part I, we begin by identifying a class of social processes which are simultaneously important in applications and difficult to predict using existing methods. It is shown that these processes can be modeled within a multi-scale, stochastic hybrid system framework that is sociologically sensible, expressive, illuminating, and amenable to formal analysis. Among other advantages, the proposed modeling framework enables proper characterization of the interplay between the intrinsic aspects of a social process (e.g., the appeal of a political movement) and the social dynamics which are its realization; this characterization is key to successful social process prediction. The utility of the modeling methodology is illustrated through a case study involving the global SARS epidemic of 2002-2003. Part II of the paper then leverages this modeling framework to develop a rigorous, computationally tractable approach to social process predictive analysis.","Colbaugh, Richard; Glass, Kristin",,609,22

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the necessity of contact-free interactions on public and shared devices, thus in this work, we aim to propose a model for evaluating contact-free interaction techniques, which can accurately measure the difficulty of eye tracking applications and can be adapted to children, users with disabilities, and elderly without requiring the acquisition of physiological sensory data. We tested the IDEA model using data from a three-part user study with 33 participants that compared two eye tracking selection techniques, dwell-time, and a multi-modal eye tracking technique using voice commands.","Parisay, M.; Poullis, C.; Kersten-Oertel, M.","Hucapp: Proceedings of the 16th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - Vol. 2: Hucapp",609,9

Industry convergence, the key to digital transformation, entails, for firms, both various opportunities for innovation and the crisis of falling behind. Therefore, from the perspective of firms, it is critical to examine how digital transformation affects their industries and products as well as how they perceive and respond to digital transformation. This is ultimately a matter of how firms survive and maintain sustainable growth in this great upheaval of digital transformation. Based on the understanding of the concept of digital transformation, this study explores how high-growth firms perceive various aspects of digital transformation. The findings show that digital transformation involves a change of firms based on constant innovation, not simply the acceptance of technology, and that there is a large digital divide that depends on the firm size and industry type. Based on the above, this study derives implications in terms of the innovation activities of firms to ensure that digital transformation does not serve as a handicap and barrier for firms. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 fear among health workers in Nepal during the early phase of pandemic. Methods A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the month of April-May 2020 among 475 health workers directly involved in COVID-19 management. The Fear Scale of COVID 19 (FCV-19S) was used to measure the status of fear. Scatter plots were used to observe the relationship between fear and other psychological outcomes: anxiety, depression and insomnia. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with COVID fear. Results COVID-19 fear score was moderately correlated with anxiety and depression, and weakly correlated with insomnia (p<0.001). Nurses (AOR=2.29; 95% CI: 1.23-4.26), health workers experiencing stigma (AOR=1.83; 95% CI: 1.12-2.73), those working in affected district(AOR=1.76; 95% CI: 1.12-2.77) and presence of family member with chronic diseases (AOR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.01-2.25) was associated with higher odds of developing COVID-19 fear as compared to other health workers, health workers not experiencing stigma, working in non-affected district and not having family member with chronic diseases respectively. Conclusion Nurses, health workers facing stigma, those working in affect district and having family member with chronic diseases were more at risk of developing COVID-19 fear. It is thus recommended to improve work environment to reduce fear among health workers, employ stigma reduction interventions, and ensure personal and family support for those having family member with chronic diseases.","Khanal, Pratik; Devkota, Navin; Dahal, Minakshi; Paudel, Kiran; Mishra, Shiva Raj; Joshi, Devavrat",bioRxiv,609,25

Objectives: To compare mortality and hospitalization of COVID-19 patients with RDs and those without. Methods: We included for this study all the Mexican patients with RDs and COVID-19 registered from April 17th to October 30th, 2020 in the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry. We compare clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with RDs and COVID-19 to patients with COVID-19 that were selected randomly from the Mexican Epidemiology database (1:3). A logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for confusion variables. Results: We included 322 patients with COVID-19 and RDs and 969 controls without RDs. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics and comorbidities of both groups. Bivariate analysis showed that patients with RDs had higher mortality, were older, and were more frequently hospitalized. Comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and renal diseases were also more frequent in patients with RDs. In the multivariate analysis, having a RD was no longer associated with mortality (Figure 1). Conclusion: Patients with RDs had higher comorbidities, hospitalizations, and mortality than the general population in the bivariate analysis. However, adjusted multivariate analysis showed that the odds for mortality were not increased because of having a RD. These findings suggest that the increased mortality of Mexican patients with RDs may be explained by the higher frequency of comorbidities in this population.","Martínez-Martínez, M.

The current study examines students' answers to identify their satisfaction in ESP online courses. The study's research questions were divided into four categories: the effectiveness of online ESP learning, the availability of learning material used by ESP instructors, the evaluation of ESP teachers' results, the effectiveness of online testing, and students' difficulties with ESP distance learning. A descriptive statistical method was used to validate the study. The statistics package JASP was used for data analysis. The authors chose observation, literature analysis, a questionnaire provision, and descriptive data analysis as the research tools. The study results show that students are primarily pleased with ESP courses taught online, students fulfil the expected progress in ESP learning performance. It is revealed that the main problems that influence and impact online ESP learning during COVID-19 are related to technical, academic, and communication challenges. Student satisfaction surveys may lead to changes in ESP online learning activities that may, in turn, boost students' outcomes.

We use an extensive suite of parsec-scale galaxy merger simulations (stellar mass ratio = 2.5:1), which employs the""Feedback In Realistic Environments-""model (fire-2). This framework resolves star formation, feedback processes, and the multi-phase structure of the ISM. We focus on the galaxy-pair stages of interaction. We find that close encounters substantially augment cool (HI) and cold-dense (H2) gas budgets, elevating the formation of new stars as a result. This enhancement is centrally-concentrated for the secondary galaxy, and more radially extended for the primary. This behaviour is weakly dependent on orbital geometry. We also find that galaxies with elevated global star formation rate (SFR) experience intense nuclear SFR enhancement, driven by high levels of either star formation efficiency (SFE) or available cold-dense gas fuel. Galaxies with suppressed global SFR also contain a nuclear cold-dense gas reservoir, but low SFE levels diminish SFR in the central region. Concretely, in the majority of cases, SFR-enhancement in the central kiloparsec is fuel-driven (55% for the secondary, 71% for the primary) -- whilst central SFR-suppression is efficiency-driven (91% for the secondary, 97% for the primary). Our numerical predictions underscore the need of substantially larger, and/or merger-dedicated, spatially-resolved galaxy surveys -- capable of examining vast and diverse samples of interacting systems -- coupled with multi-wavelength campaigns aimed to capture their internal ISM structure.","Moreno, Jorge; Torrey, Paul; Ellison, Sara L.; Patton, David R.; Bottrell, Connor; Bluck, Asa F.

Here, we demonstrate that the plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are predominant IFN-I/{lambda} source by sensing SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. We show that sensing of viral RNA by pDCs requires sustained cell adhesion with infected cells. In turn, the pDCs restrict viral spread by a local IFN-I/{lambda} response directed toward SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. This specialized function enables pDCs to efficiently turn-off viral replication, likely by a concentrated flux of antiviral effectors at the contact site with infected cells. Therefore, we propose that pDC activation is essential to locally control SARS-CoV-2-infection. By exploring the pDC response in patients, we further demonstrate that pDC responsiveness correlates with the severity of the disease and in particular that it is impaired in severe COVID-19 patients. Thus, the ability of pDCs to respond to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells could be a key to understand severe cases of COVID-19.","Venet, M.; Sa Ribeiro, M.; Decembre, E.; Bellomo, A.; Joshi, G.; Villard, M.; Cluet, D.; Perret, M.; Pescamona, R.; Paidassi, H.; Walzer, T.; Allatif, O.; Belot, A.; trouillet-assant, S.; Ricci, E.; DREUX, M.",,609,12

Recombinant proteins represent the most reliable and safe vaccine approach but generally require a suitable adjuvant for robust and durable immunity. We used the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence and in silico structural modelling to design a recombinant spike protein vaccine (Covax-19™). A synthetic gene encoding the spike extracellular domain (ECD) was inserted into a baculovirus backbone to express the protein in insect cell cultures. The spike ECD was formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant and first tested for immunogenicity in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. The Advax-SM adjuvanted vaccine induced high titers of binding antibody against spike protein that were able to neutralise the original wildtype virus on which the vaccine was based as well as the variant B.1.1.7 lineage virus. The Covax-19 vaccine also induced potent spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cells with a dominant Th1 phenotype, and this was shown to be associated with cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing of spike labelled target cells in vivo. Ferrets immunised with Covax-19 vaccine intramuscularly twice 2 weeks apart made spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and were protected against an intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus 2 weeks after the second immunisation. Notably, ferrets that received two 25 or 50μg doses of Covax-19 vaccine had no detectable virus in their lungs or in nasal washes at day 3 post-challenge, suggesting the possibility that Covax-19 vaccine may in addition to protection against lung infection also have the potential to block virus transmission.

This study examined whether daily school-supervised basal insulin injections reduced the risk of morning ketosis in youth with high HbA1c. We hypothesized that glargine and degludec would reduce the risk of ketosis, and explored whether the prolonged action of degludec protects from ketosis after 2-4 days unsupervised injections. After a 2-4 week run-in, youth (10-18y) on injections with A1c ≥ 8.5% were randomized to supervised administration of either degludec or glargine for 4 months.

While the development of a vaccine requires a lot of time, a fast countermeasure could be the use of defective interfering particles (DIPs) for antiviral therapy. IAV DIPs are usually characterized by a large internal deletion in one viral RNA segment. Consequentially, DIPs can only propagate in presence of infectious standard viruses (STVs), compensating the missing gene function. Here, they interfere with and suppress the STV replication and might act “universally” against many IAV subtypes. We recently reported a production system for purely clonal DIPs utilizing genetically modified cells. In the present study, we established an automated perfusion process for production of a DIP, called DI244, using an alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) system for cell retention. Viable cell concentrations and DIP titers more than 10-times higher than for a previously reported batch cultivation were observed. Further, we investigated a novel tubular cell retention device for its potential for continuous virus harvesting into the permeate. Very comparable performances to typically used hollow fiber membranes were found during the cell growth phase. During the virus replication phase the tubular membrane, in contrast to the hollow fiber membrane, allowed 100% of the produced virus particles to pass through. To our knowledge, this is the first time a continuous virus harvest was shown for a membrane-based perfusion process. Overall, the process established offers interesting possibilities for advanced process integration strategies for next-generation virus particle and virus vector manufacturing. Key points An automated perfusion process for production of IAV DIPs was established DIP titers of 7.40E+9 plaque forming units per mL were reached A novel tubular cell retention device enabled continuous virus harvesting","Hein, Marc D.; Chawla, Anshika; Cattaneo, Maurizio; Kupke, Sascha Y.; Genzel, Yvonne; Reichl, Udo",bioRxiv,609,16

The proposed method first enhances the image by using fuzzy logic which improvises the pixel intensity and suppresses background noise. This improvement enhances the X-ray image quality which is generally not performed in conventional methods. The pre-processing image enhancement is achieved by modeling the fuzzy membership function in terms of intensity and noise threshold. After this enhancement we use a block based method which divides the image into smooth and detailed regions which forms a feature set for feature extraction. After feature extraction we insert a hashing layer after fully connected layer in the neural network. This hash layer is advantageous in terms of improving the overall accuracy by computing the feature distances effectively. We have used a regularization parameter which minimizes the feature distance between similar samples and maximizes the feature distance between dissimilar samples.

For the first time, genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10−8) were identified for many common infections. The associations were mapped to genes with key roles in acquired and innate immunity (HLA, IFNA21, FUT2, ST3GAL4, ABO, IFNL4, LCE3E, DSG1, LTBR, MTMR3, TNFRSF13B, TNFSF13B, NFKB1, CD40) and in regulation of embryonic developmental process (TBX1, FGF, FOXA1 and FOXN1). Several missense mutations were also identified (in LCE5A, DSG1, FUT2, TBX1, CDHR3, PLG, TNFRSF13B, FOXA1, SH2B3, ST5 and FOXN1). Missense mutations in FUT2 and TBX1 were implicated in multiple infections. We applied fine-mapping analysis to dissect associations in the human leukocyte antigen region, which suggested important roles of specific amino acid polymorphisms in the antigen-binding clefts. Our findings provide an important step toward dissecting the host genetic architecture of response to common infections.","Tian, Chao; Hromatka, Bethann S.; Kiefer, Amy K; Eriksson, Nicholas; Tung, Joyce Y; Hinds, David A.",bioRxiv,609,23

This is possible thanks to machine learning algorithms applied to publicly available database of confirmed corona cases, recovered cases and death toll. In this purpose, we separate i) the total cases into 14 groups corresponding to 14 incubation periods, ii) the recovered cases into 406 groups corresponding to a combination of incubation and recovery periods, and iii) the death toll into 406 groups corresponding to a combination of incubation and decease periods. In this paper, we focus on recovery and decease periods and their correlation with the incubation period. The estimated mean recovery period we obtain is 22.14 days (95% Confidence Interval(CI): 22.00 to 22.27), and the 90th percentile is 28.91 days (95% CI: 28.71 to 29.13), which is in agreement with statistical supported studies. The bimodal gamma distribution reveals that there are two groups of recovered individuals with a short recovery period, mean 21.02 days (95% CI: 20.92 to 21.12), and a long recovery period, mean 38.88 days (95% CI 38.61 to 39.15). Our study shows that the characteristic of the decease period and the recovery period are alike. From the bivariate analysis, we observe a high probability domain for recovered individuals with respect to incubation and recovery periods. A similar domain is obtained for deaths analyzing bivariate distribution of incubation and decease periods.","Paul, S.; Lorin, E.",,609,26

Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have recently shown excellent performance in PLI prediction. However, the performance is highly dependent on protein and ligand features utilized for the DNN model. Moreover, in current models, the deciphering of how protein features determine the underlying principles that govern PLI is not trivial. In this work, we developed a DNN framework named SSnet that utilizes secondary structure information of proteins extracted as the curvature and torsion of the protein backbone to predict PLI. We demonstrate the performance of SSnet by comparing against a variety of currently popular machine and non-machine learning models using various metrics. We visualize the intermediate layers of SSnet to show a potential latent space for proteins, in particular to extract structural elements in a protein that the model finds influential for ligand binding, which is one of the key features of SSnet. We observed in our study that SSnet learns information about locations in a protein where a ligand can bind including binding sites, allosteric sites and cryptic sites, regardless of the conformation used. We further observed that SSnet is not biased to any specific molecular interaction and extracts the protein fold information critical for PLI prediction. Our work forms an important gateway to the general exploration of secondary structure based deep learning, which is not just confined to protein-ligand interactions, and as such will have a large impact on protein research while being readily accessible for de novo drug designers as a standalone package.","Verma, Niraj; Qu, Xingming; Trozzi, Francesco; Elsaied, Mohamed; Karki, Nischal; Tao, Yunwen; Zoltowski, Brian; Larson, Eric C.; Kraka, Elfi",bioRxiv,609,13

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered as a dynamical system, where objects represent geographical locations (e.g., states) whose daily confirmed cases of infection evolve over time. Outbreak at one location may influence another location as people travel between these locations, forming a graph. Thus, how to model and predict the complex dynamics for these systems becomes a critical research problem. Existing work on modeling graph-structured data mostly assumes a static setting. How to handle dynamic graphs remains to be further explored. On one hand, features of objects change over time, influenced by the linked objects in the interaction graph. On the other hand, the graph itself can also evolve, where new interactions (links) may form and existing links may drop, which may in turn be affected by the dynamic features of objects. In this paper, we propose coupled graph ODE: a novel latent ordinary differential equation (ODE) generative model that learns the coupled dynamics of nodes and edges with a graph neural network (GNN) based ODE in a continuous manner. Our model consists of two coupled ODE functions for modeling the dynamics of edges and nodes based on their latent representations respectively. It employs a novel encoder parameterized by a GNN for inferring the initial states from historical data, which serves as the starting point of the predicted latent trajectories. Experiment results on the COVID-19 dataset and the simulated social network dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Huang, Z.; Sun, Y.; Wang, W.","27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2021",609,29

Materials and Methods: Mr. MAPP system uses a Kinect V2 RGB-D camera to capture the patient, generates a live interactive 3D model, and incorporates it into a virtual exergame. Mr. MAPP mirrors their preserved limb and allows participants to visualize their amputated limb virtually and perform their prescribed exercise program. Mr. MAPP creates a digital diary of their therapy sessions by recording game performance and errors. Ten consecutive patients with history of limb loss and phantom pain were targeted for this pilot study. They received a Mr. MAPP system and a laptop for home use for 1-month. Outcome measures including pain intensity and pain interference measured on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) as well as functional outcomes measured on Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) were obtained at baseline, and after 1-month. Results: Seven participants were enrolled, out of which four completed the study. The study was temporarily suspended due to restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 public health emergency. In-game performance data showed a trend towards improvement in most participants. Compared to baseline, NRS and MPQ scores at 1-month showed no clear trends. PSFS scores improved for 1 participant and remained unchanged for others. Conclusion: Gamified home exercises performed via a novel, mixed-reality system, Mr. MAPP, using which virtual mirror therapy was delivered, is feasible and has potential to improve pain and pain related function in patients with lower limb amputations and phantom limb pain.","Annaswamy, T.

As the probability of being infected by the virus increases with an increase in the number of people gathered in an indoor space, methods for reducing its spread indoors are urgently required. In this study, a classroom with 25 students was considered as an indoor space, and an attempt was made to devise a method to reduce the concentration of the viruses generated indoors more effectively. Through numerical analysis, the age of air inside the classroom was compared and analyzed when both the air cleaner and natural ventilation were used. The age of air varied locally in the classroom depending on the position of the air cleaner, confirming its importance in effectively removing particles possibly containing viruses generated indoors. When the air cleaner flow rate was doubled, the age of air was almost halved, implying that the concentration of the particles including viruses generated indoors can be reduced efficiently by increasing the air cleaner flow rate. Natural ventilation performed by completely opening the windows and doors of the classroom reduced the age of air. It was observed that the operation of the air cleaner along with open windows and doors of the classroom reduced the concentration of the particles including viruses generated indoors more effectively. More specifically, when both natural ventilation and air cleaner were applied, the age of air decreased by almost 50% compared with the only air cleaner case and by about 22% compared with the only natural ventilation case.

The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) after twelve days of its administration in healthcare personnel (HCP) of a Health Department. METHODS A case-control study was made. HCP with suspected COVID-19 and HCP close contacts of COVID-19 cases were included between January 27 and February 7, 2021. They were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2; those with positive PCR were considered cases and those with negative PCR were considered controls. The crude (VE) and adjusted (VEa) vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 cases and their 95% confidence interval were calculated using the formula VE = (1-Odds ratio) x 100. RESULTS 268 HCP were included, of which 70 (26.1%) were considered cases and 198 (73.9%) controls. The frequency of vaccine exposure in cases was 55.7% vs. 69.7% in controls (p=0.035). The VEa of the first vaccine dose was 52.6% (95%CI: 1.1-77.3). The VEa in the subgroup of HCP studied for suspected disease was 74.6% (CI95%: 38.4-89.5). CONCLUSIONS One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 offers early protection after twelve days of administration.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently discovered enzymatic homologue of Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that may be an important new component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This study assesses the involvement of ACE2 in the normal and diabetic rodent retina and its modulation by ACE inhibition. METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into three groups, control, diabetes, and diabetes plus ramipril, with diabetes induced with the cell toxin streptozocin and the study run for 24 weeks. ACE2 and ACE gene levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), ACE2 protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting, and ACE and ACE2 catalytic activity were measured using specific activity assays in the rat retina. Localisation of ACE2 mRNA and protein were determined by in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS ACE mRNA levels were decreased to approximately 50% in the diabetic retina, but ACE2 mRNA levels were not significantly changed. ACE but not ACE2 gene expression was influenced by ramipril treatment. Following immunostaining, both ACE2 and ACE protein were localised predominantly to the inner nuclear layer (INL) but also to photoreceptors. In the diabetic retina, ACE enzyme activity was decreased, whereas ACE2 enzyme activity was increased. CONCLUSIONS This study has identified ACE2 gene and catalytically active protein in the rodent retina.

Because of the diverse phenotypes linked to RYR1 mutations it is fundamental to characterize their functional effects to classify variants carried by patients for future therapeutic interventions and identify non-pathogenic variants. Many laboratories have been interested in developing methods to functionally characterize RYR1 mutations expressed in patients' cells. This approach has numerous advantages, including: mutations are endogenously expressed, RyR1 is not over-expressed, use of heterologous RyR1 expressing cells is avoided. However, since patients may present mutations in different genes aside RYR1, it is important to compare results from biological material from individuals harboring the same mutation, with different genetic backgrounds. The present manuscript describes methods developed to study the functional effects of endogenously expressed RYR1 variants in: (a) Epstein Barr virus immortalized human B-lymphocytes and (b) satellite cells derived from muscle biopsies and differentiated into myotubes. Changes in the intracellular calcium concentration triggered by the addition of a pharmacological RyR1 activators are then monitored. The selected cell type is loaded with a ratiometric fluorescent calcium indicator and intracellular [Ca2+] changes are monitored either at the single cell level by fluorescence microscopy or in cell populations using a spectrofluorometer. The resting [Ca2+], agonist dose response curves are then compared between cells from healthy controls and patients harboring RYR1 variants leading to insight into the functional effect of a given variant.","Treves, Susan; Girard, Thierry; Zorzato, Francesco",J. vis. exp,609,22

The review considers E/HF perspectives on how the nature of work is changing and what this means for the practice of E/HF and for human performance and wellbeing at work. This field of research has attracted much attention from scholars from various disciplines as flexible working arrangements and casualised employment, in particular, have come under the microscope during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article begins by setting out the future of work field, focussing on the mega trends and future of work forces that are most relevant to the discipline. Next, E/HF contributions to this field are identified and discussed. Surprisingly, given the E/HF tradition as a system discipline fundamentally concerned with the study of human work, and as a contributor to transdisciplinary research related to the design of work systems, a search of the scholarly literature found few contributions outside of the automation systems field that addressed the future of work and E/HF directly. A research agenda is presented to address gaps in current knowledge in a number of key future of work domains.

We aimed to examine the extent of trainees' involvement in and comfort with telemedicine practices in Canada with the use of a web-based self-administered survey. Eighty-six trainees from 12 training programs completed the survey (65% response rate). Results showed that before COVID-19, 39 trainees (45%) had telemedicine exposure, compared with 67 (78%) after COVID-19 (P < 0.001). However, only 44 trainees (51%) reported being comfortable or very comfortable with the use of telemedicine. Of the 67 trainees who were involved in telemedicine, 4 (6%) had full supervision during virtual visits, 13 (19%) had partial supervision, and 50 (75%) had minimal or no supervision. Importantly, 67 trainees (78%) expressed the need for telemedicine-specific training and 64 (74%) were willing to have their virtual visits recorded for the purpose of evaluation and feedback. Furthermore, 47 (55%) felt strongly or very strongly positive about incorporating telemedicine into their future practice. The main perceived barriers to telemedicine use were concerns about patients' engagement, fear of weakening the patient-physician relationship, and unfamiliarity with telemedicine technology. These barriers, together with training in virtual physical examination skills and medicolegal aspects of telemedicine, are addressed in several established internal medicine telemedicine curricula that could be adapted by cardiology programs. In conclusion, while the degree of telemedicine involvement since COVID-19 was high, the trainees' comfort level with telemedicine practice remains suboptimal likely due to lack of training and inadequate staff supervision. Therefore, a cardiology telemedicine curriculum is needed to ensure that trainees are equipped to embrace telemedicine in cardiovascular clinical care.","Almufleh, Aws; Lee, Christopher; Tsang, Michael Yc; Gin, Kenneth; Tsang, Teresa S M; Nair, Parvathy",Can. j. cardiol,609,16

Critical care ultrasonography is vital because it provides real time information for diagnosis and treatment. Suggested protocols for image acquisition and measurements have not yet been evaluated. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at two centers from 1 April 2020 to 30 May 2020 in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the critical care unit. Cardiac and pulmonary evaluations were performed using the ORACLE protocol, specifically designed for this study, to ensure a structured process of image acquisition and limit staff exposure to the infection. RESULTS: Eighty-two consecutively admitted patients were evaluated. Most of the patients were males, with a median age of 56 years, and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and 25% of the patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The most frequent ultrasonographic findings were elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (69.5%), E/e' ratio > 14 (29.3%), and right ventricular dilatation (28%) and dysfunction (26.8%). A high rate of fluid responsiveness (82.9%) was observed. The median score (19 points) on pulmonary ultrasound did not reveal any variation between the groups. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: The ORACLE protocol was a feasible, rapid, and safe bedside tool for hemodynamic and respiratory evaluation of patients with COVID-19. Further studies should be performed on the alteration in pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular function and its relationship with outcomes.","García-Cruz, Edgar; Manzur-Sandoval, Daniel; Rascón-Sabido, Rafael; Gopar-Nieto, Rodrigo; Barajas-Campos, Ricardo Leopoldo; Jordán-Ríos, Antonio; Sierra-Lara Martínez, Daniel; Jiménez-Rodríguez, Gian Manuel; Murillo-Ochoa, Adriana Lizeth; Díaz-Méndez, Arturo; Lazcano-Díaz, Emmanuel; Araiza-Garaygordobil, Diego; Cabello-López, Alejandro; Melano-Carranza, Efrén; Bucio-Reta, Eduardo; González-Ruiz, Francisco Javier; Cota-Apodaca, Luis Antonio; Santos-Martínez, Luis Efrén; Fernández-de la Reguera, Guillermo; Ramos-Enríquez, Ángel; Rojas-Velasco, Gustavo; Álvarez-Álvarez, Rolando Joel; Baranda-Tovar, Francisco",Echocardiography,609,20

Effective prodrug forms distribute their payload to the site of the intended target and release it efficiently with minimal byproduct toxicity. The ability to balance unwanted payload release during transit with desired release at the site of action is critical to prodrug efficacy. Despite decades of research on prodrug forms, choosing the ideal prodrug form remains a challenge which is often solved empirically. The recent emergency use authorization of the antiviral remdesivir for COVID-19 exemplifies a new approach for delivery of phosphate prodrugs by parenteral dosing, which minimizes payload release during transit and maximizes tissue payload distribution. This review focuses on the role of metabolic activation in efficacy during oral and parenteral dosing of phosphate, phosphonate, and phosphinate prodrugs. Through examining prior structure-activity studies on prodrug forms and the choices that led to development of remdesivir and other clinical drugs and drug candidates, a better understanding of their ability to distribute to the planned site of action, such as the liver, plasma, PBMCs, or peripheral tissues, can be gained.

METHODS: Two samples were recruited for an online survey: one sample was a representative sample of Canadians living with overweight and obesity (n = 1,089), and the second was a convenience sample of individuals recruited from obesity clinical services or patient organizations (n = 980). Respondents completed ratings of their comfort receiving a COVID-19 vaccination along with the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. RESULTS: Approximately one-third of respondents, regardless of sample or weight category, were not comfortable receiving a vaccination, and one-half expressed moderate or greater perceived risks of vaccination. Confidence in vaccinations was extremely low, especially for those in the clinical sample. Fear of COVID-19 was substantial and predicted attitudes toward vaccination. Females were less comfortable receiving the vaccine and perceived more risks than males. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest those living with obesity are highly ambivalent about COVID-19 vaccination. Despite their being at high risk, their confidence in vaccines is very low.

The association between severe COVID-19 and tobacco use is still debated. The aim of this paper is to enhance the importance of providing up to date informations about nicotine and tobacco use in connection with the SARS-CoV-2-related conditions. METHODS: We present 3 cases of sudden tobacco use cessation in 3 long-term heavy smokers receiving mental health care for chronic psychotic disorders. Fear of severe form of COVID-19 was their principal motivation. Nicotine replacement therapy and quitline counseling were provided and no major withdrawal symptoms were declared. RESULTS: As mass media later wrongly presented tobacco use as a protective factor regarding COVID-19, all three patients resumed smoking. Rigorous counseling took advantage of psychotic symptoms to correct false informations and finally promote tobacco use cessation. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic might paradoxically represent a great motivational factor to quit smoking, espacially when considering patients suffering from severe mental health disorders. Beyond the terrible suffering it causes, we illustrate with a case serie that this opportunity must be exploited by mental health professionals to improve quality and life expectancy of their patients.","Theuerkauff, Olivier; Hanak, Catherine",Psychiatr Danub,609,7

Social distancing requirements following the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid changes to intervention delivery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed-methods process evaluation will investigate how the changes were implemented and the impact that these have on participants' experience. An implementation study will investigate how the intervention was delivered during the pandemic. A study on the mechanisms of impact and context will investigate how these changes were experienced by the PrAISED participants, their carers and the therapists delivering the intervention. The study will commence in May 2020. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The PrAISED RCT and process evaluation have received ethical approval number 18/YH/0059. The PrAISED process evaluation will enable us to understand how distancing and isolation affected participants, their activity and exercise routines and whether the therapy programme could be continued with remote support.

Genomic surveillance is an important tool for pandemic response, but many laboratories do not have the resources to support population-level sequencing. We hypothesized that a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to genotype mutations in the viral spike protein could facilitate high-throughput variant surveillance. We designed and analytically validated a one-step multiplex allele-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect three non-synonymous spike protein mutations (L452R, E484K, N501Y). Assay specificity was validated with next-generation whole-genome sequencing. We then screened a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from our San Francisco Bay Area population. Between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we screened 4,049 unique infections by genotyping RT-qPCR, with an assay failure rate of 2.8%. We detected 1,567 L452R mutations (38.7%), 34 N501Y mutations (0.84%), 22 E484K mutations (0.54%), and 3 (0.07%) E484K+N501Y mutations. The assay had perfect (100%) concordance with whole-genome sequencing in a validation subset of 229 specimens, and detected B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.427, B.1.429, B.1.526, and P.2 variants, among others. The assay revealed rapid emergence of L452R in our population, with a prevalence of 24.8% in December 2020 that increased to 62.5% in March 2021. We developed and clinically implemented a genotyping RT-qPCR to conduct high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 variant screening.

We analyzed the impact of patient characteristics including obesity on hospital mortality and specifically analyzed the effect of obesity by body mass index (BMI) class and by sex. Methods: This retrospective case series included adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. Data were manually extracted from electronic health records by the authors and included demographics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and outcomes (hospital mortality or discharge). We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Results: Some 348 patients were included in this study, of whom 207 were discharged and 141 died in the hospital. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death with older age and excess weight. Interestingly obesity increased mortality in women [odds ratio (OR) 4.4, confidence interval (CI) (1.4-13.5) p=0.011 but not among men [OR 1.4, (:1 (0.5-3.6).51. Among women, the effect of excess weight on mortality was seen in a ""dose-effect"" fashion, with increasingly higher odds of mortality from progressively worsening obesity (OR ranging between 2.7 and 6.9). Out of all the comorbidities, only obesity positively correlated with peak levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Conclusion: Advancing age is a risk factor for in-hospital death during COVID-19 illness. Obese women could be at a higher risk for mortality due to COVID-19 and should take extra precautions to prevent contamination by social distancing and other measures. Immunomodulators may be more effective in obese women affected by COVID-19. Further studies are needed to help elucidate this association.","Naaraayan, A.; Nimkar, A.; Pant, S.; Hasan, A.; Durdevic, M.; Elenius, H.; Suarez, C. N.; Jesmajian, S.",Cureus,609,24

Strategies that combine NPIs with innovative SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies may increase containment efficacy and help to shorten quarantine durations. We developed a user-friendly software-tool that implements a recently published stochastic within-host viral dynamics model that captures temporal attributes of the viral infection, such as test sensitivity, infectiousness and the occurrence of symptoms. Based on this model, the software allows to evaluate the efficacy of user-defined, arbitrary NPI and testing strategies in reducing the transmission potential in different contexts. The software thus enables decision makers to explore NPI strategies and perform hypothesis testing, e.g. with regards to the utilization of novel diagnostics or with regards to containing novel virus variants.","van der Toorn, Wiep; Oh, Djin-Ye; von Kleist, Max",Patterns (N Y),609,24

Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV and infects humans through the binding of the spike protein to ACE2. Here, we have systematically studied the molecular mechanisms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by protein-protein docking and MD simulations. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV, which may partly explain that SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is more stable and may survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This provides insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 because SARS-like coronaviruses have originated in bats. Our computation also suggested that the RBD-ACE2 binding for SARS-CoV-2 is much more temperature-sensitive than that for SARS-CoV. Thus, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 would decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV when the temperature rises. These findings would be beneficial for the disease prevention and drug/vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2.","He, Jiahua; Tao, Huanyu; Yan, Yumeng; Huang, Sheng-You; Xiao, Yi",Viruses,609,31

Consecuentemente, ¿se reduciría el apoyo OTAN? De momento, la Unión necesita a la OTAN, pero no puede descuidar sus propias capacidades Para articular nuestra propuesta de investigación nos situamos en uno de los niveles de análisis propio de las Relaciones Internacionales, en el plano de la microinternacionalidad, que se identificaría con el de la política exterior de la Unión Europea y los desafíos a los que se enfrenta, y en un marco temporal concreto que responde a la línea de acción que viene desarrollándose desde la adopción de la Estrategia Global en 2016 hasta el momento presente con una Unión que apuesta por una Europa geopolítica Desde una función explicativa, respaldada por la consulta de fuentes actuales (primarias y derivadas), se estructura el análisis del siguiente modo: (1) se parte de examinar el incierto y complejo escenario internacional y europeo, del que emergen desafíos globales y regionales;(2) para posteriormente definir qué se entiende por autonomía estratégica bajo el contexto de aquella Estrategia y delimitar cuáles son sus variables de análisis;(3) así como estudiar, desde una perspectiva institucionalista, los diferentes instrumentos políticos e institucionales que la Unión va adoptando y evaluar su idoneidad o no para impulsar la autonomía estratégica europea;(4) y cumpliendo con una función práctica, nuestro estudio se concluye valorando si el proceso de evolución de la Unión en este ámbito está cumpliendo o no con sus capacidades y condicionamientos, y discerniendo sobre cómo se debe afrontar la etapa venidera Alternate abstract:The changing global geopolitical circumstances (with a revisionist Russia, a rising and more assertive China, a w'thdrawing United States with values increasingly different from those of Europe, the instability coming from the East and the Southern Mediterranean, the consummation of Brexit ) are the contextual backdrop of the European Union, and following the adoption of its Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy it has developed a series of political and institutional tools to support its strategic autonomy in the field of security and defence (Action Plans, EU-NATO cooperation, permanent structured cooperation, the European Initiative for Intervention ) To these instruments can be added others provided for in the Lisbon Treaty (2009), such as the solidarity and mutual assistance clauses, the latter invoked after the Daesh attack n Paris in November 2015, as a defensive alliance to guarantee security in European countries All this is in line with the level of ambition set by the Member States, which ranges from protecting their neighbourhood to becoming a universal provider of global security -in this respect one notes the Franco-German leadership in defence German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron approved a Declaration in June 2018 at the Château de Meseberg that included majority voting in foreign policy, security and defence matters in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making In addition, it advocated the European Intervention Initiative and new formats such as a European Security Council, as well as strengthening European coordination within the United Nations and the development of a European fighter jet Based on this context that is outlined in previous lines, in which diverse variables and actors concur and from the perspective offered by the science of international relations, our object of study is articulated that aspires to verify if the changes from a world order based on rules to another truffle of hard power, require a step forward for the European Union with a common strategic culture, analysed from a constructivist approach (Meyer, 2007 y 2004), along with greater leadership and political will In other words, in the current international context, is ensuring the security and defence of Europe autonomously a necessity for the European Union? Consequently, would NATO support be reduced? At the moment, the Union needs NATO, but it cannot neglect its own capabilities In order to articulate our research proposal, we place ourselves in one of the levels of analysis specific to international relations, on the plane of micro-internationality (Calduch, 1991, p 13), which would be identified with that of the European Union's foreign policy and the challenges it faces And also in a temporal framework that responds to the line of action that has been developed since the adoption of the Global Strategy in 2016 until the present moment with a Union that is committed to a ""geopolitical"" Europe From an explanatory perspective, supported by consultation of current sources (primary and derived), the analysis is structured as follows: 1) The starting point is to examine the complex and uncertain international and European scenario, from which global and regional challenges emerge, with the risk of further conflicts We explain this context from the instability coming from the East, the Balkans and the Southern Mediterranean, as well as the references to the Trump Administration and the process commonly known as Brexit 2) To subsequently define what is meant by strategic autonomy in the context of that European Global Strategy and to delimit the variables of analysis This autonomy has its immediate antecedent in the Saint Malo Agreement (1998) In that agreement, both the United Kingdom and France agreed that the EU should have the capacity for ""autonomous action"", supported by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them and a preparation to do so This is with the aim of responding to international crises, and under French-British sponsorship the 1999 Cologne European Council introduced ""autonomy of action"" with the purpose of acting in international crises included in the Treaties, either when NATO does not do so, as an independent actor, or together with the Atlantic Alliance 3) The foregoing considerations are complemented and contextualised by the institutionalist approach (Smith, 2004) that provides the study with the different political and institutional instruments that the Union is adopting in the face of the need to promote the generation of civilian and military capabilities, as well as to assess their suitability or otherwise for promoting European strategic autonomy All of this is aimed at strengthening European unity and giving coherence to external action within the framework of one of its founding pillars, such as the Common Foreign and Security Polic (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), launched at the Cologne Council in 1999 and renamed the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) by the Lisbon Treaty, which called for the adoption of measures to increase EU-NATO cooperation 4) Finally, fulfilling a practical function, the conclusion is to assess whether or not the Union's evolutionary process in this field is fulfilling its capacities and conditions, and to discern how the next stage should be approached In this regard, we must assimilate those facts that will impact on the course and pace of the integration process and, therefore, on this desire for strategic autonomy, we refer to the departure of the United K'ngdom (Brexit), the economic difficulties of certain European countries of the South in balancing their economic balance and the consequent reaction of the creditor countries of the North, the different perception of the threats and risks of the countries of the North in the face of Russian pressure or those of the South that have to deal with immigration pressure, the expansion of jihadist terrorism or the social and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic For its part, the European Council, held in June 2018, ratified the will of the Member States to continue taking decisive steps to boost European defence, increase strategic autonomy and complement and strengthen NATO activities","Solsona, Miguel Ángel Benedicto García María José Molina",Relaciones Internacionales,609,26

The situation is further exacerbated in the case of a shortage of personal protective equipment that can increase the risk of exposure for the healthcare workers and even non-pandemic related patients, such as those on dialysis. In this study, we propose an emergency, non-invasive remote monitoring and control response system to retrofit dialysis machines with robotic manipulators for safely supporting the treatment of patients with acute kidney disease. Specifically, as a proof-of-concept, we mock-up the touchscreen instrument control panel of a dialysis machine and live-stream it to a remote user’s tablet computer device. Then, the user performs touch-based interactions on the tablet device to send commands to the robot to manipulate the instrument controls on the touchscreen of the dialysis machine. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we conduct an accuracy test. Moreover, we perform qualitative user studies using two modes of interaction with the designed system to measure the user task load and system usability and to obtain user feedback. The two modes of interaction included a touch-based interaction using a tablet device and a click-based interaction using a computer. The results indicate no statistically significant difference in the relatively low task load experienced by the users for both modes of interaction. Moreover, the system usability survey results reveal no statistically significant difference in the user experience for both modes of interaction except that users experienced a more consistent performance with the click-based interaction vs. the touch-based interaction. Based on the user feedback, we suggest an improvement to the proposed system and illustrate an implementation that corrects the distorted perception of the instrumentation control panel live-stream for a better and consistent user experience. © Copyright © 2021 Wazir, Lourido, Chacko and Kapila.","Wazir, H.

These include narcolepsy types 1 and 2, idiopathic hypersomnia, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and hypersomnia due to or associated with medical disease, neurologic disease, psychiatric disease, medications or substances, and insufficient sleep durations. This chapter focuses on the treatment of nonnarcoleptic hypersomnia syndromes, from those that are commonly encountered in neurologic practice, such as hypersomnia due to Parkinson's disease, to those that are exceedingly rare but present with dramatic manifestations, such as Kleine-Levin syndrome. The level of evidence for the treatment of sleepiness in these disorders is generally lower than in the well-characterized syndrome of narcolepsy, but available clinical and randomized, controlled trial data can provide guidance for the management of each of these disorders. Treatments vary by diagnosis but may include modafinil/armodafinil, traditional psychostimulants, solriamfetol, pitolisant, clarithromycin, flumazenil, sodium oxybate, melatonin, methylprednisolone, and lithium.","Trotti, Lynn Marie; Arnulf, Isabelle",Neurotherapeutics,609,16

However, an understanding on the socio-economic inequalities in overweight and obesity of women received little attention, especially in the context of Bangladesh. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the inequality in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in Bangladesh as well as to explore the effect of various socio-economic factors on this inequality. METHODS: This study used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 which is a nationally representative data. The concentration index of overweight and obesity was applied to measure the extent of socio-economic inequality. Finally, the concertation index was decomposed in order to understand the contribution of different socio-economic variables in inequality in overweight and obesity of women. RESULTS: This study included a total of 16,624 women of reproductive age. The study found that the prevalence of overweight was about 29% and the rate of obesity was approximately 11%. The value of concentration index for overweight and obesity was 0.37 (p < 0.001). This study also observed that about 52% inequality was explained by household's wealth status followed by watching television (25%), husband/partner's educational status (around 7%), women's educational status (about 5%), place of residence (approximately 4%). CONCLUSIONS: This study found notable level of overweight and obesity among the women of Bangladesh. Various socio-economic factors like wealth status, education levels of women and partners, urban settings, women watching television predominantly contributed to the inequality in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age. Therefore, the study suggests adopting necessary interventions targeting the women of higher socio-economic status to reduce the risk of life-threatening problems caused by overweight and obesity.","Hasan, Emran; Khanam, Moriam; Shimul, Shafiun N",BMC Womens Health,609,10

In 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessary to alter priorities. In these challenging times, Cochrane Rehabilitation has firstly changed its internal organisation and established a new relevant project in line with pandemic needs: the REH-COVER (Rehabilitation - COVID-19 evidence-based response) action. The aim was to focus on the timely collection, review and dissemination of summarised and synthesised evidence relating to COVID-19 and rehabilitation. Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER action has included in 2020 five main initiatives: 1) rapid living systematic reviews on rehabilitation and COVID-19; 2) interactive living evidence map on rehabilitation and COVID-19; 3) definition of the research topics on ""rehabilitation and COVID-19"" in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) rehabilitation programme; 4) Cochrane Library special collection on Coronavirus (COVID-19) rehabilitation; and 5) collaboration with COVID-END for the topics ""rehabilitation"" and ""disability.""

METHODS: Internet search query data from January 2011 to December 2019 in China were retrieved from the Baidu Index (BI). Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to detect the correlation among the search volumes of AH, rhinosinusitis, and AR. We also collected search data from the first 5 months of 2020, when quarantine was implemented in China due to the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Then, we compared the search data to those obtained during the same period in 2019 to assess the effects of isolation on AH and AR. RESULTS: Statistically significant relevance was found between the search variations of AH and rhinosinusitis during 2011-2019 (R = 0.643, P < 0.05). However, the relationship between AH and AR was weak (R = - 0.239, P < 0.05) and that between rhinosinusitis and AR (R = - 0.022, P > 0.05) was not relevant. The average monthly search volume of AH and rhinosinusitis had a strong correlation (R = 0.846, P < 0.01), but AH and AR and rhinosinusitis and AR were not correlated (R = - 0.350, P > 0.05; R = - 0.042, P > 0.05, respectively). AH and rhinosinusitis search volumes decreased consistently during the first 5 months of 2020 (isolation), whereas that for AR increased during January-February. CONCLUSION: AH had an epidemiological relationship with rhinosinusitis, which was not consistent with AR.

A successful vaccination campaign is widely viewed as the only way to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, placing greater urgency on the need for a rapid vaccination strategy. In this paper, we present emerging findings, from a national research study, that document the key challenges faced by current vaccine rollout strategies, which include procurement and leadership strategies, citizen engagement and limitations in supply chain capacity. These findings are used to inform a scalable vaccine strategy comprising collaborative leadership, mobilization of an integrated workforce and a digitally enabled supply chain strategy. The goal of vaccinating the entire Canadian population in the next few months can be achieved when supported by such a strategy.","Snowdon, Anne W; Wright, Alexandra; Saunders, Michael",Healthc Q,609,16

The procedure uses an unprecedented reverse transcription-free (RTF) approach for converting genomic RNA into DNA. This involves the formation of an RNA/DNA heteroduplex whose selective cleavage generates a short DNA trigger strand, which is then rapidly amplified using the exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR). Deploying the RNA-to-DNA conversion and amplification stages of the RTF-EXPAR assay in a single step results in the detection, via a fluorescence read-out, of single figure copy numbers per microliter of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in under 10 min. In direct three-way comparison studies, the assay has been found to be faster than both RT-qPCR and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), while being just as sensitive. The assay protocol involves the use of standard laboratory equipment and is readily adaptable for the detection of other RNA-based pathogens.","Carter, Jake G; Orueta Iturbe, Lorea; Duprey, Jean-Louis H A; Carter, Ian R; Southern, Craig D; Rana, Marium; Whalley, Celina M; Bosworth, Andrew; Beggs, Andrew D; Hicks, Matthew R; Tucker, James H R; Dafforn, Timothy R",Proc.

METHODS: This comparative cross-sectional study was done at tertiary care teaching institute. We enrolled all hospitalized children aged 1 month - 18 years and diagnosed with either MIS-C and/or dengue fever according to WHO criteria between June and December, 2020. Clinical and laboratory features and outcomes were recorded on a structured proforma. RESULTS: During the study period 34 cases of MIS-C and 83 cases of Dengue fever were enrolled. Mean age of MIS-C cases (male, 86.3%) was 7.89 (4.61) years. Of 34 cases, MIS-C with shock was seen in 15 cases (44%), MIS-C without shock, 17 cases (50%) and Kawasaki disease-like presentation in 2 cases (6%). Patients of MIS-C were younger as compared to dengue fever (P=0.002). Conjunctival injection and swelling of hand and feet were more commonly seen in MIS-C. Abdominal pain and erythematous rash were more common in dengue fever. Of the inflammatory markers, mean C reactive protein was higher in MIS-C patients, than dengue fever patients [100.2 (85.1) vs 16.9 (29.3) mg/dL (P&lt;0.001). In contrast, serum ferritin levels were higher in dengue fever patients (P=0.03). Need for mechanical ventilation was significantly more in MIS-C cases. Mean hospital stay was longer in MIS- C patients days compared to dengue fever (8.6 vs 6.5 days;P=0.014). CONCLUSION: Clinical and laboratory features can give important clues to differentiate dengue fever and MIS-C and help initiate specific treatment.","Dhooria, G. S.; Kakkar, S.; Pooni, P.

Approach and Results: VICs were isolated from human aortic valves obtained after surgery for calcific aortic valve disease and from normal aortic valves unsuitable for grafting (control VICs). We examined VIC in vitro and in vivo potential to differentiate in endothelial and perivascular lineages. VIC paracrine effect was also examined on human endothelial colony-forming cells. A pathological VIC (VICp) mesenchymal-like phenotype was confirmed by CD90+/CD73+/CD44+ expression and multipotent-like differentiation ability. When VICp were cocultured with endothelial colony-forming cells, they formed microvessels by differentiating into perivascular cells both in vivo and in vitro. VICp and control VIC conditioned media were compared using serial ELISA regarding quantification of endothelial and angiogenic factors. Higher expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-A was observed at the protein level in VICp-conditioned media and confirmed at the mRNA level in VICp compared with control VIC. Conditioned media from VICp induced in vitro a significant increase in endothelial colony-forming cell proliferation, migration, and sprouting compared with conditioned media from control VIC. These effects were inhibited by blocking VEGF-A with blocking antibody or siRNA approach, confirming VICp involvement in angiogenesis by a VEGF-A dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: We provide here the first proof of an angiogenic potential of human VICs isolated from patients with calcific aortic valve disease. These results point to a novel function of VICp in valve vascularization during calcific aortic valve disease, with a perivascular differentiation ability and a VEGF-A paracrine effect. Targeting perivascular differentiation and VEGF-A to slow calcific aortic valve disease progression warrants further investigation.","Gendron, Nicolas; Rosa, Mickael; Blandinieres, Adeline; Sottejeau, Yoann; Rossi, Elisa; Van Belle, Eric; Idelcadi, Salim; Lecourt, Séverine; Vincentelli, André; Cras, Audrey; Jashari, Ramadan; Chocron, Richard; Baudouin, Yaël; Pamart, Thibault; Bièche, Ivan; Nevo, Nathalie; Cholley, Bernard; Rancic, Jeanne; Staels, Bart; Gaussem, Pascale; Dupont, Annabelle; Carpentier, Alain; Susen, Sophie; Smadja, David M",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,609,16

However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: The North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research performed a multicentre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a 2-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to the hospital were recorded, including the Confusion, Urea, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure and Age Above or Below 65 Years (CURB-65), National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and Quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across seven hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in the intensive care unit. All scores underestimated mortality compared with pre-COVID-19 cohorts, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the 'low-risk' categories (CURB-65 score<2, NEWS2<5 and qSOFA score<2), 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. NEWS2&#8805;5 had a negative predictive value of 98% for early mortality. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION: In the setting of COVID-19, existing prognostic scores underestimated risk. The design of new prognostic tools should focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","Bradley, Patrick; Frost, Freddy; Tharmaratnam, Kukatharmini; Wootton, Daniel G",,609,20

This paper aims to study the social behaviour of the public in the Greater Region (GR) and related countries based on Twitter information with machine learning and representation learning methods. We find that tweets volume only can be a predictor of outbreaks in a particular period of the pandemic. Moreover, we map out the evolution of public behaviour in each country from 2020/01/22 to 2020/06/05, figuring out the main differences in public behaviour between GR and related countries.

In this study, a microchip-based grating coupled fluorescent plasmonic (GC-FP) assay was used to measure antibody levels that resulted from COVID-19 infection and vaccination. In addition, we measured the relative antibody binding towards antigens from variants CoV2 virus variants, strains B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (S. African). Antibody levels against multiple antigens within the SARS CoV2 spike protein were significantly elevated for both vaccinated and infected individuals, while those against the nucleocapsid (N) protein were only elevated for infected individuals. GC-FP was effective for monitoring the IgG-based serological response to vaccination throughout the vaccination sequence, and could also resolve acute (within hours) increases in antibody levels. A significant decrease in antibody binding to antigens from the B.1.351 variant, but not B.1.1.7, was observed for all vaccinated subjects when measured by GC-FP as compared to the 2019 SARS CoV2 antigens. These results were corroborated by competitive ELISA assay. Collectively, the findings suggest that GC-FP is a viable, rapid, and accurate method for measuring both overall antibody levels to CoV2 and relative antibody binding to viral variants during infection or vaccination.","Taubner, Benjamin; Peredo-Wende, Ruben; Ramani, Ananthakrishnan; Singh, Gurpreet; Strle, Klemen; Cady, Nathaniel",,609,1

We investigated the interaction of these two important factors on health-related job loss (HRJL) over 2 years of follow-up comparing male and female older workers. METHODS: A population sample of adults aged 50-64 years, recruited from 24 English general practices in the Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF) study, completed questionnaires at baseline with follow-ups at 12 and 24 months. Multiple-record Cox proportional hazards models were performed to explore the main effects of, and potential interactions between, job satisfaction and self-rated health (SRH) as predictors of time to first HRJL. RESULTS: Of the initial 8134 participants, 5143 were ever in work in the study period. Among men, 5.7% and 14.3% reported job dissatisfaction (those in good and poor SRH, respectively), while among women these percentages were 4.6 and 12.9. HRJL was reported by 106 men and 176 women. Men in good health dissatisfied with their job had a sixfold (HR=6.4; 95% CI 3.3 to 12.4) increased risk of HRJL compared with men satisfied with their job (significant multiplicative interaction). Women dissatisfied with their job were more likely to have an HRJL within 2 years of follow-up irrespective of their SRH. CONCLUSIONS: SRH and job dissatisfaction have important individual effects on the risk of stopping work for health among older workers. These findings point to the importance of job satisfaction in reducing health-related exit from paid work among older workers.","D039,; Angelo, Stefania; Syddall, Holly; Ntani, Georgia; Harris, E Clare; Linaker, Cathy; Cooper, Cyrus; Stevens, Martin; Walker-Bone, Karen",Occup. environ. med,609,24

The testing and adoption of effective therapies for novel coronaviruses are hampered by the challenge of conducting controlled studies during a state of emergency. The access to direct antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin, that have an existing inventory and reliable supply chain may be a priority consideration for therapies developed for the 2019-nCoV infection outbreaks and any strain variants that may emerge. On the basis of the direct antiviral activity of ribavirin against 2019-nCoV in vitro and evidence for potency enhancement strategies developed during the prior SARS and MERS outbreaks, ribavirin may significantly impact our ability to end the lingering outbreaks in China and slow outbreaks in other countries. The apparent COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to follow dosage guidelines for treatment with ribavirin, test new therapeutic concepts, and conduct controlled testing to apply the scientific rigor required to address the controversy around this mainstay of antiviral therapy.","Khalili, Jahan S; Zhu, Hai; Mak, Nga Sze Amanda; Yan, Yongqi; Zhu, Yi",J Med Virol,609,14

IgG of high avidity is established during affinity maturation. Failure to achieve high avidity IgG may result in a lack of protective immunity towards infection and disease. It is known that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cellular receptor is driven by high affinity. Therefore, it is predictable that protective antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 should show high affinity/avidity. AVIDITY AFTER SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: Recent findings by several groups demonstrate that the serological response towards infection with SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses is characterized by incomplete avidity maturation, followed by a decline of the serological response. This response might facilitate reinfection, prevent herd immunity and potentially allow repeated cycles of infection. CONSEQUENCES FOR VACCINATION TOWARDS SARS-COV-2: Therefore, the sole focus on antibody titers reached after vaccination towards SARS-CoV-2 might not be sufficient to evaluate the degree of achieved protection. Rather, it is suggested to include avidity determination to optimize vaccination protocols and achieve high avidity IgG directed towards SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. Avidity determination might also be useful to control for truly protective immunity towards SARS-CoV-2 in individual cases.","Bauer, Georg",Int J Infect Dis,609,16

Second, it constructs a vulnerability index to COVID-19 using Spain and its 50 provinces as case. The main results obtained indicate that tourism to the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, the provinces of the Mediterranean coast, and Madrid, in which the state capital is located, present higher vulnerability to COVID-19, yet with different underlying factors.

This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among U.S. adults with a history of using tobacco products or marijuana. Data were collected online in 2020-2021 including respondents' willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, factors that may promote vaccine acceptance, and prior history of influenza vaccination. Logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the associations between vaccine hesitancy and demographic characteristics, substance use, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and prior influenza vaccination. Among 387 respondents, 49.1% were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 26.0% were unwilling, and 24.9% were ""not sure."" Blacks, suburban or rural residents, those who lived by themselves or with a family with five members or above, those who were not stressed because of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to say ""no"" to a COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents who never, only once, or during some years received an influenza vaccine were 7.0, 6.2, and 5.2 times more likely to say ""no"" to a COVID-19 vaccine than respondents who received an influenza vaccination every year or almost every year. The use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and marijuana, as well as heavy drinking of alcohol, were not associated with COVID-19 hesitancy. The associations between demographic factors and vaccine hesitancy were roughly similar for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Although various demographic groups have different levels of vaccine hesitancy and also have different factors to increase their acceptance, addressing misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly concern about the safety of the vaccines is crucial in general.","Yang, Yong; Dobalian, Aram; Ward, Kenneth D",J. community health,609,1

In light of these benefits, it is imperative to learn the antecedents and underlying mechanisms for this to maintain and enhance engagement. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the factors and influencing mechanisms related to citizen engagement with the TikTok account of the National Health Commission of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a web crawler, 355 short videos were collected from the Healthy China account on TikTok (with more than 3 million followers throughout China), covering the period from January 21, 2020, to April 25, 2020. The title and video length, as well as the number of likes, shares, and comments were collected for each video. After classifying them using content analysis, a series of negative binomial regression analyses were completed. RESULTS: Among the 355 videos, 154 (43.4%) related to guidance for clinicians, patients, and ordinary citizens, followed by information concerning the government's handling of the pandemic (n=100, 28.2%), the latest news about COVID-19 (n=61, 17.2%), and appreciation toward frontline emergency services (n=40, 11.3%). Video length, titles, dialogic loop, and content type all influenced the level of citizen engagement. Specifically, video length was negatively associated with the number of likes (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.19, P<.001) and comments (IRR=0.39, P<.001). Title length was positively related to the number of shares (IRR=24.25, P=.01), likes (IRR=8.50, P=.03), and comments (IRR=7.85, P=.02). Dialogic loop negatively predicted the number of shares (IRR=0.56, P=.03). In comparison to appreciative information, information about the government's handling of the situation (IRR=5.16, P<.001) and guidelines information (IRR=7.31, P<.001) were positively correlated with the number of shares, while the latest news was negatively related to the number of likes received (IRR=0.46, P=.004). More importantly, the relationship between predictors and citizen engagement was moderated by the emotional valence of video titles. Longer videos with positive titles received a higher number of likes (IRR=21.72, P=.04) and comments (IRR=10.14, P=.047). Furthermore, for short videos related to government handling of the pandemic (IRR=14.48, P=.04) and guidance for stakeholders (IRR=7.59, P=.04), positive titles received a greater number of shares. Videos related to the latest news (IRR=66.69, P=.04) received more likes if the video title displayed higher levels of positive emotion. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, videos were frequently published on government social media platforms. Video length, title, dialogic loop, and content type significantly influenced the level of citizen engagement. These relationships were moderated by the emotional valence of the video's title. Our findings have implications for maintaining and enhancing citizen engagement via government social media.","Chen, Qiang; Min, Chen; Zhang, Wei; Ma, Xiaoyue; Evans, Richard",J Med Internet Res,609,20

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate service users’ perceptions of MySurgery, including its perceived acceptability, the potential barriers and facilitators to accessing and using its content, and ideas about how to facilitate its effective implementation. The secondary aim is to analyze how the intended use of the app might differ for diverse patients, including seldom-heard groups. Methods: We implemented a diversity approach to recruit participants from a range of backgrounds with previous experience of surgery. We aimed to achieve representation from seldom-heard groups, including those from a Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) background;those with a disability;and those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBT+) community. A total of 3 focus groups were conducted across a 2-month period, during which a semistructured protocol was followed to elicit a rich discussion around the app. The focus groups were audio recorded, and thematic analysis was carried out. Results: In total, 22 individuals participated in the focus groups. A total of 50% (n=11) of the participants were from a BAME background, 59% (n=13) had a disability, and 36% (n=8) were from the LGBT+ community. There was a strong degree of support for the MySurgery app. The majority of participants agreed that it was acceptable and appropriate in terms of content and usability, and that it would help to educate patients about how to become involved in improving safety. The checklist-like format was popular. There was rich discussion around the accessibility and inclusivity of MySurgery. Specific user groups were identified who might face barriers in accessing the app or acting on its advice, such as those with visual impairments or learning difficulties and those who preferred to take a more passive role (eg, some individuals because of their cultural background or personality type). The app could be improved by signposting further specialty-specific information and incorporating a calendar and notes section. With regard to implementation, it was agreed that use of the app should be signposted before the preoperative appointment and that training and education should be provided for clinicians to increase awareness and buy-in. Communication about the app should clarify its scientific basis in plain English and should stress that its use is optional. Conclusions: MySurgery was endorsed as a powerful tool for enhancing patient empowerment and facilitating the direct involvement of patients and their caregivers in maintaining patient safety. The diversity approach allowed for a better understanding of the needs of different population groups and highlighted opportunities for increasing accessibility and involvement in the app.","Russ, Stephanie Sevdalis Nick Ocloo Josephine",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,609,16

METHODS: We compared the number/visits of cancer outpatients receiving oncological therapies at the oncologic day clinic (DC) and admissions at the emergency department (ED) of our institution in time periods before (pre-lockdown period: 1 January - 15 March 2020) and after (post-lockdown period: 16 March- 31 May 2020) lockdown implementation with the respective reference periods of 2018 and 2019. Additionally, we analysed Emergency Severity Index (ESI) score of unplanned cancer patient presentations to the ED in the same post-lockdown time periods. Patient outcome was described as 3-month mortality rate (3-MM). RESULTS: In total, 16 703 visits at the DC and 2664 patient visits for the respective time periods were recorded at the ED. No decrease in patient visits was observed at the DC after lockdown implementation (P = .351), whereas a substantial decrease in patient visits at the ED was seen (P < .001). This translates into a 26%-31% reduction of cancer-related patient visits per half month after the lockdown at the ED (P < .001 vs. 2018 + 2019). There was no difference in the distribution of ESI scores at ED presentation (P = .805), admission rates or 3-MM in association with lockdown implementation (P = .086). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the feasibility of maintaining antineoplastic therapy administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our data underline the need for adapted management strategies for emergency presentations of cancer patients.","Minichsdorfer, Christoph; Jeryczynski, Georg; Krall, Christoph; Achhorner, Alina Magdalena; Caraan, Ariane; Pasalic, Sabina; Reininger, Katharina; Wagner, Christina; Bartsch, Rupert; Preusser, Matthias; Laggner, Anton; Raderer, Markus; Fuereder, Thorsten",Eur J Clin Invest,609,16

We propose rx-anon, an anonymization approach for heterogeneous semi-structured documents composed of relational and textual attributes. We map sensitive terms extracted from the text to the structured data. This allows us to use concepts like k-anonymity to generate a joined, privacy-preserved version of the heterogeneous data input. We introduce the concept of redundant sensitive information to consistently anonymize the heterogeneous data. To control the influence of anonymization over unstructured textual data versus structured data attributes, we introduce a modified, parameterized Mondrian algorithm. The parameter $\lambda$ allows to give different weight on the relational and textual attributes during the anonymization process. We evaluate our approach with two real-world datasets using a Normalized Certainty Penalty score, adapted to the problem of jointly anonymizing relational and textual data. The results show that our approach is capable of reducing information loss by using the tuning parameter to control the Mondrian partitioning while guaranteeing k-anonymity for relational attributes as well as for sensitive terms. As rx-anon is a framework approach, it can be reused and extended by other anonymization algorithms, privacy models, and textual similarity metrics.","Singhofer, Fabian; Garifullina, Aygul; Kern, Mathias; Scherp, Ansgar",,609,16

The new emerging infectious disease has raised many challenges and uncertainties regarding disease management and prognosis in immunocompromised patient populations. The risk of COVID-19 among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has different opinions. Some scholars speculated that patients with HIV may be at decreased risk for complications of COVID-19 because HIV antiretroviral medications may have activity against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2. But others have the opposite because of the immunosuppression for HIV patients. Here we reported a case of HIV-infected patient confirmed with COVID-19 and had a favourable prognosis.

Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing NAFLD, while there are no specific treatments. An ever-increasing number of high-throughput Omics investigations on the molecular pathobiology of NAFLD at the cellular, tissue and system levels produce comprehensive biochemical patient snapshots. In the clinical setting, these applications are considerably enhancing our efforts towards obtaining a holistic insight on NAFLD pathophysiology. Omics are also generating non-invasive diagnostic modalities for the distinct stages of NAFLD, that remain though to be validated in multiple, large, heterogenous and independent cohorts, both cross-sectionally as well as prospectively. Finally, they aid in developing novel therapies. By tracing the flow of information from genomics to epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and glycomics, the chief contributions of these techniques in understanding, diagnosing and treating NAFLD are summarized herein.","Perakakis, Nikolaos; Stefanakis, Konstantinos; Mantzoros, Christos S",Metabolism,609,27

Nearly 6000 deaths have been recorded due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and more than 50% of these deaths appeared to have evolved from China where the virus was thought to originate. The endemicity of COVID-19 dramatically surpassed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were so far discovered in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak not only a public health emergency but also pandemic in nature. Currently, over 120 countries including Nigeria were reported to have more than 157,844 confirmed cases and 5,846 deaths due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak as of March 15, 2020, 10:55 GMT.

An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guckenberger, Matthias; Belka, Claus; Bezjak, Andrea; Bradley, Jeffrey; Daly, Megan E; DeRuysscher, Dirk; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; Faivre-Finn, Corinne; Flentje, Michael; Gore, Elizabeth; Higgins, Kristin A; Iyengar, Puneeth; Kavanagh, Brian D; Kumar, Sameera; Le Pechoux, Cecile; Lievens, Yolande; Lindberg, Karin; McDonald, Fiona; Ramella, Sara; Rengan, Ramesh; Ricardi, Umberto; Rimner, Andreas; Rodrigues, George B; Schild, Steven E; Senan, Suresh; Simone, Charles B; Slotman, Ben J; Stuschke, Martin; Videtic, Greg; Widder, Joachim; Yom, Sue S; Palma, David",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,609,16

Objective: To determine TCF7L2 genetic association (rs7903146C/T and rs12255372G/T) in T2DM patients of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa population of Pakistan. Subjects and methods: This study comprised of 176 subjects including 118 T2DM patients and 58 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotype of common variants (rs7903146 C/T and rs12255372 G/T) was carried out by amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR of sequence specific oligonucleotides. Results: The distribution of genotype of TCF7L2 SNPs (rs7903146 C/T and rs12255372 G/T) was significantly associated with T2DM as compared to the controls (p <0.0001). The genetic models of the rs7903146 (C/T) and rs12255372 (G/T) SNPs were significantly associated between cases and controls (p <0.0001). On the other hand, the significant association was observed between the two SNPs and different biochemical parameters like serum fasting glucose, lipid profile, creatinine and blood HbA1c levels (p <0.05). Conclusion: It is concluded that the SNPs of the TCF7L2 gene are significantly associated with T2DM disease susceptibility in the population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan.","Hameed, Taha; Khan, Zahid; Imran, Muhammad; Ali, Saif; Albegali, Abdullah Abdo; Ullah, Muhammad Ikram; Ejaz, Hasan",Afr Health Sci,609,24

Cutaneous manifestations have been classified into 5 clinical patterns: acro-ischemic (pseudo-chilblain), vesicular, urticarial, maculopapular, and livedoid. Oral manifestations have also been reported, but much less frequently. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in which we examined the oral mucosa of 666 patients with COVID-19 at the IFEMA field hospital in Madrid in April 2020. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (11.7%) had changes involving the oral mucosa. The most common were transient anterior U-shaped lingual papillitis (11.5%) accompanied or not by tongue swelling (6.6%), aphthous stomatitis (6.9%), a burning sensation in the mouth (5.3%), mucositis (3.9%), glossitis with patchy depapillation (3.9%), white tongue (1.6%), and enanthema (0.5%). Most of the patients also reported taste disturbances. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 also manifests in the oral cavity. The most common manifestations are transient U-shaped lingual papillitis, glossitis with patchy depapillation, and burning mouth syndrome. Mucositis with or without aphthous ulcers or enanthema may also be observed.

These impacts are likely accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which precipitated an abrupt and wholesale transition to online education. Unfortunately, the individual-level consequences of these events are difficult to determine because the extant literature focuses on single-occasion surveys that produce only group-level inferences. To better understand individual-level variability in stress and learning, intensive longitudinal data can be leveraged. The goal of this paper is to illustrate this by discussing three different techniques for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data: (1) regression analyses;(2) multilevel models;and (3) person-specific network models, (e.g., group iterative multiple model estimation;GIMME). For each technique, a brief background in the context of education research is provided, an illustrative analysis is presented using data from college students who completed a 75-day intensive longitudinal study of cognition, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and intellectual interests during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election - a period of heightened sociopolitical stress - and strengths and limitations are considered.

Results As compared to doctors, paramedical staffs were more stressed with frequent protocol changes (88%), emotional exhaustion (68%), and conflicts with duties (62.7%). The factors like seeing colleague getting better (78.7%) and hoping for financial compensation (49.3%) were reported as stress busters;family compensation in case of death at the workplace and disability benefits in case of disease-related disability development were more effective motivational factors for paramedical staff in case of future outbreaks (p-value &lt;0.05). Conclusions It is needful that secondarily traumatized team members should be always observed, educated, and properly handled. Certain personal coping strategies adopted by health workers should be well addressed and motivated if scientifically sustainable. We have to include psychiatric preparedness and stress monitoring also for health care teams along with emphasizing hygiene, temperature monitoring, and fever management, in planning to fight the pandemic.","Srivastava, A.; Srivastava, S.; Upadhyay, R.; Gupta, R.; Jakhar, K.; Pandey, R.",Cureus,609,21

Also, it was the primary source of misinformation dissemination on a large scale, referred to as the infodemic. Therefore, automatic debunking misinformation is a crucial problem. To tackle this problem, we present two COVID-19 related misinformation datasets on Twitter and propose a misinformation detection system comprising network-based and content-based processes based on machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques. In the network-based process, we focus on social properties, network characteristics, and users. On the other hand, we classify misinformation using the content of the tweets directly in the content-based process, which contains text classification models (paragraph-level and sentence-level) and similarity models. The evaluation results on the network-based process show the best results for the artificial neural network model with an F1 score of 88.68%. In the content-based process, our novel similarity models, which obtained an F1 score of 90.26%, show an improvement in the misinformation classification results compared to the network-based models. In addition, in the text classification models, the best result was achieved using the stacking ensemble-learning model by obtaining an F1 score of 95.18%. Furthermore, we test our content-based models on the Constraint@AAAI2021 dataset, and by getting an F1 score of 94.38%, we improve the baseline results. Finally, we develop a fact-checking website called Checkovid that uses each process to detect misinformative and informative claims in the domain of COVID-19 from different perspectives.","Dadgar, Sajad; Ghatee, Mehdi",,609,16

The authors conducted a cross-sectional electronic study using a multisite survey to examine dentists' knowledge, attitudes, and professional behavior toward COVID-19 and the affect on their livelihood. METHODS: A questionnaire was circulated via e-mail and social media platforms to dentists in North America, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific regions. It covered demographic characteristics and questions about the COVID-19 outbreak related to dentists' levels of comfort for preventive and safety measures, provision of treatment, affect on work, and financial implications. Responses were tabulated and analyzed by means of &#967;2 or Fisher exact test. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare means. P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 1,251 dentists responded. General dentists represented 63.9% of the respondents and 62.5% worked in private practice. The global score for level of comfort with the preventive measures and provisions of treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic was low (14 of 30), and differences between regions were significant (P < .01); dentists working in private practice and general dental practitioners were less comfortable (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The respondents reported a lack of preparedness to confront a highly infectious respiratory disease. A new level of protective armamentarium in the dental operatory and updated operational guidance and policies are required, necessitating educators and regulators to ensure the delivery of knowledge and skills to oral health care providers. Dentists need to address the sustainability of their practices and have a robust business plan.","Bakaeen, Lara G; Masri, Radi; AlTarawneh, Sandra; Garcia, Lily T; AlHadidi, Abeer; Khamis, Amar H; Hamdan, Ahmad M; Baqain, Zaid H",,609,5

In response to herbivory and abiotic stresses that vary with latitudes and between ranges, invasive plants may shift their secondary chemicals to facilitate invasion success. However, it remains unclear whether and how invasive plant chemical responses to herbivory and chemical responses to abiotic environments are associated. We conducted large scale field surveys of herbivory on the invasive tallow tree (Triadica sebifera) along latitudes in both its native (China) and introduced ranges (United States) and collected leaf samples for analyses of tannins and flavonoids. We used data on climate and solar radiation to examine these chemical responses to abiotic environments and their variations along these latitudes and between ranges. We also re-analyzed previously published data from multiple common garden experiments on tallow tree to investigate genetic divergence of secondary chemical concentrations between introduced and native populations. We found foliar tannins and herbivory (chewing, sucking) were higher in the native range compared to the invasive range. Allocation to tannins versus flavonoids decreased with latitude in the native range but did not vary in the invasive range. Analyses of previously published common garden experimental data indicated genetic divergence contributes to chemical concentration differences between ranges. Our field data further indicated that the latitudinal patterns were primarily phenotypic responses to herbivory in China while in US they were primarily phenotypic responses to abiotic environments. The variation of tannins may be linked to flavonoids, given tannins and flavonoids share a biosynthesis pathway. Together, our results suggest that invasive plants adjust their secondary metabolism to decrease chemicals that primarily defend against herbivory and increase those that help them to respond to their abiotic environment. These findings deepen our understanding of how invasive plants adapt to biogeographically heterogeneous environments through trade-offs between secondary chemical responses.","Xiao, Li; Ding, Jianqing; Zhang, Jialiang; Huang, Wei; Siemann, Evan",Sci Total Environ,609,16

This study aims to identify factors that may explain the variation in CFR across countries. Methods: We identified 24 potential risk factors affecting CFR. For all countries with over 5000 reported COVID-19 cases, we used country-specific datasets from the WHO, the OECD, and the United Nations to quantify each of these factors. We examined univariable relationships of each variable with CFR, as well as correlations among predictors and potential interaction terms. Our final multivariable negative binomial model included univariable predictors of significance and all significant interaction terms. Results: Across the 39 countries under consideration, our model shows COVID-19 case fatality rate was best predicted by time to implementation of social distancing measures, hospital beds per 1000 individuals, percent population over 70 years, CT scanners per 1 million individuals, and (in countries with high population density) smoking prevalence. Conclusion: Our model predicted an increased CFR for countries that waited over 14 days to implement social distancing interventions after the 100th reported case. Smoking prevalence and percentage population over the age of 70 years were also associated with higher CFR. Hospital beds per 1000 and CT scanners per million were identified as possible protective factors associated with decreased CFR.","Pan, Jennifer; St Pierre, Joseph Marie; Pickering, Trevor A; Demirjian, Natalie L; Fields, Brandon K K; Desai, Bhushan; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),609,24

To combat transmission of the disease in India, the government declared a lockdown on March 25, 2020. Even after this strict lockdown was enacted nationwide, the number of COVID-19 cases increased and surpassed 450,000. A positive point to note is that the number of recovered cases began to slowly exceed that of active cases. The survival of patients, taking death as the event that varies by age group and sex, is noteworthy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a survival analysis to establish the variability in survivorship of patients with COVID-19 in India by age group and sex at different levels, that is, the national, state, and district levels. METHODS: The study period was taken from the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 in India, which was January 30, 2020, up to June 30, 2020. Due to the amount of underreported data and removal of missing columns, a total sample of 26,815 patients was considered. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, the Cox proportional hazard model, and the multilevel survival model were used to perform the survival analysis. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival function showed that the probability of survival of patients with COVID-19 declined during the study period of 5 months, which was supplemented by the log rank test (P<.001) and Wilcoxon test (P<.001) to compare the survival functions. Significant variability was observed in the age groups, as evident from all the survival estimates; with increasing age, the risk of dying of COVID-19 increased. The Cox proportional hazard model reiterated that male patients with COVID-19 had a 1.14 times higher risk of dying than female patients (hazard ratio 1.14; SE 0.11; 95% CI 0.93-1.38). Western and Central India showed decreasing survival rates in the framed time period, while Eastern, North Eastern, and Southern India showed slightly better results in terms of survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study depicts a grave scenario of decreasing survival rates in various regions of India and shows variability in these rates by age and sex. In essence, we can safely conclude that the critical appraisal of the survival rate and thorough analysis of patient data in this study equipped us to identify risk groups and perform comparative studies of various segments in India.

DESIGN: We used Data Envelopment Analysis to benchmark diets for improved adherence to food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG). We then optimised these diets for dietary preferences, nutrient quality and environmental impact. Diets were evaluated using the Nutrient Rich Diet score (NRD15.3), diet-related greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and a diet similarity index that quantified the proportion of food intake that remained similar as compared with the observed diet. SETTING: National dietary surveys of four European countries (Denmark, Czech Republic, Italy and France). SUBJECTS: Approximately 6500 adults, aged 18-64 years. RESULTS: When dietary preferences were prioritised, NRD15·3 was ~6 % higher, GHGE was ~4 % lower and ~85 % of food intake remained similar. This diet had higher amounts of fruit, vegetables and whole grains than the observed diet. When nutrient quality was prioritised, NRD15·3 was ~16 % higher, GHGE was ~3 % lower and ~72 % of food intake remained similar. This diet had higher amounts of legumes and fish and lower amounts of sweetened and alcoholic beverages. Finally, when environmental impact was prioritised, NRD15·3 was ~9 % higher, GHGE was ~21 % lower and ~73 % of food intake remained similar. In this diet, red and processed meat partly shifted to either eggs, poultry, fish or dairy. CONCLUSIONS: Benchmark modelling can generate diets with improved adherence to FBDG within the boundaries of dietary practices, but fully maximising health and minimising GHGE cannot be achieved simultaneously.","Mertens, Elly; Kuijsten, Anneleen; Kanellopoulos, Argyris; Dofková, Marcela; Mistura, Lorenza; D039,; Addezio, Laura; Turrini, Aida; Dubuisson, Carine; Havard, Sabrina; Trolle, Ellen; Eckl, Marion; Biesbroek, Sander; Bloemhof, Jacqueline; Geleijnse, Johanna M; 039, van; t Veer, Pieter",Public Health Nutr,609,1

Emerging tools, such as the Rapid Evidence Map (rEM), are being developed to systematically characterize large collections of scientific literature. We sought to generate an rEM of risk and protective factors to comprehensively inform areas that impact COVID-19 outcomes for different sub-populations in order to better protect the public. Methods: We developed a protocol that includes a study goal, study questions, a PECO statement, and a process for screening literature by combining semi-automated machine learning with the expertise of our review team. We applied this protocol to reports within the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) that were published in early 2020. SWIFT-Active Screener was used to prioritize records according to pre-defined inclusion criteria. Relevant studies were categorized by risk and protective status; susceptibility category (Behavioral, Physiological, Demographic, and Environmental); and affected sub-populations. Using tagged studies, we created an rEM for COVID-19 susceptibility that reveals: (1) current lines of evidence; (2) knowledge gaps; and (3) areas that may benefit from systematic review. Results: We imported 4,330 titles and abstracts from CORD-19. After screening 3,521 of these to achieve 99% estimated recall, 217 relevant studies were identified. Most included studies concerned the impact of underlying comorbidities (Physiological); age and gender (Demographic); and social factors (Environmental) on COVID-19 outcomes. Among the relevant studies, older males with comorbidities were commonly reported to have the poorest outcomes. We noted a paucity of COVID-19 studies among children and susceptible sub-groups, including pregnant women, racial minorities, refugees/migrants, and healthcare workers, with few studies examining protective factors. Conclusion: Using rEM analysis, we synthesized the recent body of evidence related to COVID-19 risk and protective factors. The results provide a comprehensive tool for rapidly elucidating COVID-19 susceptibility patterns and identifying resource-rich/resource-poor areas of research that may benefit from future investigation as the pandemic evolves.","Elmore, Rebecca; Schmidt, Lena; Lam, Juleen; Howard, Brian E; Tandon, Arpit; Norman, Christopher; Phillips, Jason; Shah, Mihir; Patel, Shyam; Albert, Tyler; Taxman, Debra J; Shah, Ruchir R",Front Public Health,609,16

To overcome this barrier, a biochemical understanding of the clinical effects of LCTE is needed. Here, we explore the chemical compounds present in the reported LCTE ingredients and the proteins targeted by these compounds via a network pharmacology analysis. Our results indicate that LCTE contains compounds with the potential to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and inflammation, and that the compound targets proteins highly related to COVID-19's main symptoms. We predict the general effect of LCTE is to affect the pathways involved in viral and other microbial infections, inflammation/cytokine response, and lung diseases. Our work provides a biochemical basis for using LCTE to treat COVID-19 and its main symptoms.","Zhang, Deng-Hai; Zhang, Xue; Peng, Bin; Deng, Sheng-Qiong; Wang, Yu-Fang; Yang, Lin; Zhang, Kai-Zheng; Ling, Chang-Quan; Wu, Kun-Lun",Commun Biol,609,21

The purpose of this study was the clinical assessment of the new Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test. METHODS: The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test was evaluated vs. a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) laboratory-based assay (Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV) in nasopharyngeal swabs collected from a series of consecutive patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to the Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) over a 2-week period. RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 321 consecutive patients (mean age, 46 years and IQR, 32-56 years; 181 women, 56.4%), with 149/321 (46.4%) positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via the Seegene AllplexTM2019-nCoV Assay, and 109/321 (34.0%) positive with Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test, respectively. The overall accuracy of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test compared to molecular testing was 86.9%, with 72.5% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. Progressive decline in performance was observed as cycle threshold (Ct) values of different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets increased. The sensitivity was found to range between 97-100% in clinical samples with Ct values <25, between 50-81% in those with Ct values between 25 and <30, but low as 12-18% in samples with Ct values between 30 and <37. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical performance of Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test is excellent in nasopharyngeal swabs with Ct values <25, which makes it a reliable screening test in patients with high viral load. However, mass community screening would require the use of more sensitive techniques.","Salvagno, Gian Luca; Gianfilippi, Gianluca; Bragantini, Damiano; Henry, Brandon M; Lippi, Giuseppe","Diagnosis (Berl., Internet)",609,24

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) and right ventricular longitudinal strain (RV-LS) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this prospective, single-center study, data were gathered from patients treated for COVID-19 between April 15 and April 30, 2020. Two-dimensional echocardiography (2-DE) and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) images were obtained for all patients. Patients were divided into three groups: those with severe COVID-19 infection, those with non-severe COVID-19 infection, and those without COVID-19 infection (the control group). Data regarding clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. A total of 100 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were included in this study. The mean age of the severe group (n = 44) was 59.1 ± 12.9, 40% of whom were male. The mean age of the non-severe group (n = 56) was 53.7 ± 15.1, 58% of whom were male. Of these patients, 22 died in the hospital. In patients in the severe group, LV-GLS and RV-LS were decreased compared to patients in the non-severe and control groups (LV-GLS: - 14.5 ± 1.8 vs. - 16.7 ± 1.3 vs. - 19.4 ± 1.6, respectively [p < 0.001]; RV-LS: - 17.2 ± 2.3 vs. - 20.5 ± 3.2 vs. - 27.3 ± 3.1, respectively [p < 0.001]).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Narrative review RESULTS: Delayed activation of EMS for stroke symptoms by patients and witnesses deprives patients of rapid access to brain-saving therapies and occurs due to public unawareness of stroke features, cognitive and motor deficits produced by the stroke itself, and sleep onset. A promising emerging approach to overcoming the inherent biologic constraints of patient capacity to self-detect and respond to stroke symptoms is continuous monitoring by mobile health technologies with wireless sensors and artificial intelligence recognition systems. This review surveys 11 sensing technologies - accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, pressure sensors, touch screen and keyboard input detectors, artificial vision, and artificial hearing; and 10 consumer device form factors in which they are increasingly implemented: smartphones, smart speakers, smart watches and fitness bands, smart speakers/voice assistants, home health robots, smart clothing, smart beds, closed circuit television, smart rings, and desktop/laptop/tablet computers. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in computing power, wearable sensors, and mobile connectivity have ushered in an array of mobile health technologies that can transform stroke detection and EMS activation. By continuously monitoring a diverse range of biometric parameters, commercially available devices provide the technologic capability to detect cardinal language, motor, gait, and sensory signs of stroke onset.

While the world at large is waiting that the released vaccines immunize most citizens, public health experts suggest that, in the meantime, it is only through behavior change that the spread of COVID-19 can be controlled. Importantly, the required behaviors are aimed not only at safeguarding one's own health. Instead, individuals are asked to adapt their behaviors to protect the community at large. This raises the question of which social concerns and moral principles make people willing to do so. We considered in 23 countries (N = 6948) individuals' willingness to engage in prescribed and discretionary behaviors, as well as country-level and individual-level factors that might drive such behavioral intentions. Results from multilevel multiple regressions, with country as the nesting variable, showed that publicized number of infections were not significantly related to individual intentions to comply with the prescribed measures and intentions to engage in discretionary prosocial behaviors. Instead, psychological differences in terms of trust in government, citizens, and in particular toward science predicted individuals' behavioral intentions across countries. The more people endorsed moral principles of fairness and care (vs. loyalty and authority), the more they were inclined to report trust in science, which, in turn, statistically predicted prescribed and discretionary behavioral intentions. Results have implications for the type of intervention and public communication strategies that should be most effective to induce the behavioral changes that are needed to control the COVID-19 outbreak.","Pagliaro, Stefano; Sacchi, Simona; Pacilli, Maria Giuseppina; Brambilla, Marco; Lionetti, Francesca; Bettache, Karim; Bianchi, Mauro; Biella, Marco; Bonnot, Virginie; Boza, Mihaela; Butera, Fabrizio; Ceylan-Batur, Suzan; Chong, Kristy; Chopova, Tatiana; Crimston, Charlie R; Álvarez, Belén; Cuadrado, Isabel; Ellemers, Naomi; Formanowicz, Magdalena; Graupmann, Verena; Gkinopoulos, Theofilos; Kyung Jeong, Evelyn Hye; Jasinskaja-Lahti, Inga; Jetten, Jolanda; Muhib Bin, Kabir; Mao, Yanhui; McCoy, Christine; Mehnaz, Farah; Minescu, Anca; Sirlopú, David; Simic, Andrej; Travaglino, Giovanni; Uskul, Ayse K; Zanetti, Cinzia; Zinn, Anna; Zubieta, Elena",PLoS One,609,1

Until recently geroscience research was pursued in laboratory animals, but now this field requires specialized expertise in the care of vulnerable older patients with multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, the population likely to benefit the most from emerging therapies. While chronological aging measures the inevitable passage of clock time that occurs equally for everyone, biological aging varies among individuals, and importantly, it is modifiable. Advances in our understanding of biological aging, the discovery of strategies for modifying its rate, and an appreciation of aging as a shared risk factor for chronic diseases have jointly led to the Geroscience Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that interventions modifying aging biology can slow its progression-resulting in the delay or prevention of the onset of multiple diseases and disorders. Here we wish to report on the Third Geroscience Summit held at National Institutes of Health on November 4-5, 2019, which highlighted the importance of engaging other disciplines including clinicians. Involvement by scientists with expertise in clinical trials, health outcomes research, behavioral and social sciences, health policy, and economics is urgently needed to translate geroscience discoveries from the bench to clinical care and health policy. Adding to the urgency of broadening this geroscience coalition is the emergence of biological aging as one the most important modifiable factors of COVID-19, combined with the inability of our society to once again recognize and confront aging as a priority and opportunity when facing these types of public health emergencies.","Sierra, Felipe; Caspi, Avshalom; Fortinsky, Richard H; Haynes, Laura; Lithgow, Gordon J; Moffitt, Terrie E; Olshansky, S Jay; Perry, Daniel; Verdin, Eric; Kuchel, George A",J. am. geriatr. soc,609,24

The first coronaviruses – members of the Coronaviridae family belonging to the order Nidovirales — were discovered in the first half of the last century. The first human coronavirus, HCoV-B814, was isolated in 1965 that was not preserved in available virological collections. Over the last time, old-fashioned names and terms have been overlapped. By the beginning of the XXI century coronaviruses posed a serious veterinary problem but it was believed that epidemic coronaviruses were not among highly dangerous viruses. Scientific community had to revise such views first in 2002 when SARS-CoV (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) was transferred to human population in the Southeast Asia from bats, and then in 2012 when natural foci of the MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) were found on the territory of the Arabian Peninsula. Due to an increased interest in coronaviruses, a large number of new Coronaviridae members was discovered in the first two decades of the XXI century, which required to revise its taxonomic structure several times. This review is aimed at outlining a history of investigating coronaviruses and their current classification that was shaped in early 2020 in accordance to the last recommendations of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.","Shchelkanov, M.Yu.; Popova, A.Yu.; Dedkov, V.

A safe and timely response is required for patients exhibiting escalating behaviours (e.g., responsive, agitated and/or aggressive behaviours) to prevent harm to the patient, nearby patients and staff. In this paper, we report on a new protocol that has been implemented throughout our institution to address Code White calls for escalating behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. This procedure uses a least restraint-based philosophy for the management of an escalating situation, involves the use of an interprofessional team of healthcare providers (including mental health clinicians) and security team members and accounts for the need for personal protective equipment. We believe that other hospitals could benefit from knowing about this approach as a strategy to improve patient care and diminish disease transmission.","Lucchese, Stephanie; Bellicoso, Daniela; Dang, Kien; Witz, Ifat",Healthc Q,609,1

The investigation used Eurostat data in relation to gross government debt, as well as NATO information regarding defence expenditure as a share of GDP and its distribution by main category for the period between 2005 and 2019. The authors applied descriptive statistics and methods of multivariate statistics: Spearman’s correlation, the ANOVA test, and Life tables. Taking into consideration the tendencies of variables in all examined countries, the results show that the share of defence expenditure in GDP correlates statistically significantly and negatively with government gross debt. Latvia, Slovakia, and Slovenia revealed statistically significant relationships between variables, while Luxembourg, Denmark and Lithuania insignificant. In Estonia, the relationship between variables is strong and positive. Additionally, the investigation shows that, whether for increasing defence expenditure or for stable or decreasing defence expenditure, the trajectories of government debt have no clear interrelation in explored countries. Therefore, the cause of government debt by means of defence expenditure alone can only be partially explained. The insights that were drawn from this study could be applied to government finance management processes, as well as to ensure both national security and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030.","Česnuitytė, Vida Prakapienė Dalia",Sustainability,609,1

286160,286160,286160,[Chilblains in lockdown: an old acquaintance in the context of COVID-19],16.984377,1.3088596,2020,"Dysautonomia covers a range of clinical conditions with different characteristics and prognoses. They are classified as Reflex Syndromes, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH) and Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity Syndrome. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes will not be discussed in this article. 1. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes are mostly benign and usually occur in patients without an intrinsic autonomic nervous system (ANS) or heart disease. Therefore, they are usually studied separately. 2. Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) is the term most currently used to define dysautonomia with impairment of the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic nervous system. It can be idiopathic, such as multisystemic atrophy or pure autonomic failure, or secondary to systemic pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, dementia syndromes, chronic renal failure, amyloidosis and it may also occur in the elderly. 3. The presence of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) implies greater severity and worse prognosis in various clinical situations. 4. Detection of Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) is a late sign and means greater severity in the context of dysautonomia, defined as Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH). It must be differentiated from hypotension due to hypovolemia or medications, called non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nnOH). 5. OH can result from benign causes, such as acute, chronic hypovolemia or use of various drugs. However, these drugs may only reveal subclinical pictures of Dysautonomia. All drugs of patients with dysautonomic conditions should be reevaluated. 6. Precise diagnosis of CAN and the investigation of the involvement of other organs or systems is extremely important in the clinical suspicion of pandysautonomia. 7. In diabetics, in addition to age and time of disease, other factors are associated with a higher incidence of CAN, such poor glycemic control, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Among diabetic patients, 38-44% can develop Dysautonomia, with prognostic implications and higher cardiovascular mortality. In the initial stages of DM, autonomic dysfunction involves the parasympathetic system, then the sympathetic system and, later on, it presents as orthostatic hypotension. 8. Valsalva, Respiratory and Orthostatic tests (30:15) are the gold standard methods for the diagnosis of CAN. They can be associated with RR Variability tests in the time domain, and mainly in the frequency domain, to increase the sensitivity (protocol of the 7 tests). These tests can detect initial or subclinical abnormalities and assess severity and prognosis. 9. The Tilt Test should not be the test of choice for investigating CAN at an early stage, as it detects cases at more advanced stages. Tilt response with a dysautonomic pattern (gradual drop in blood pressure without increasing heart rate) may suggest CAN. 10. Treatment of patients at moderate to advanced stages of dysautonomia is quite complex and often refractory, requiring specialized and multidisciplinary evaluation. There is no cure for most types of Dysautonomia at a late stage. 11. NOH patients can progress with supine hypertension in more than 50% of the cases, representing a major therapeutic challenge. The immediate risk and consequences of OH should take precedence over the later risks of supine hypertension and values greater than 160/90 mmHg are tolerable. Sleeping with the head elevated (20-30 cm), not getting up at night, taking short-acting antihypertensive drugs for more severe cases, such as losartan, captopril, clonidine or nitrate patches, may be necessary and effective in some cases. 12. Preventive measures such as postural care;good hydration;higher salt intake;use of compression stockings and abdominal straps;portioned meals;supervised physical activity, mainly sitting, lying down or exercising in the water are important treatment steps. 13. Various drugs can be used for symptomatic nOH, especially fludrocortisone, midodrine and droxidopa, the latter not available in Brazil. The risk of exacerbation or triggering supine hypertension should be considered. 14. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome represents a form of Dysautonomia and has been renamed as a systemic disease of exercise intolerance, with new diagnostic criteria: 1 - Unexplained fatigue, leading to occupational disability for more than 6 months;2 - Feeling ill after exercising;3 - Non-restorative sleep;4 - One of the following findings: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Several pathologies today have evolved with chronic fatigue, being called chronic diseases associated with chronic fatigue. 15. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), another form of presentation of dysautonomic syndromes, is characterized by sustained elevation of heart rate (HR) &gt;= 30 bpm (&gt;= 40 bpm if &lt;20 years) or HR &gt;= 120 bpm, in the first 10 minutes in an orthostatic position or during the tilt test, without classical orthostatic hypotension associated. A slight decrease in blood pressure may occur. Symptoms appear or get worse in an orthostatic position, with dizziness, weakness, pre-syncope, palpitations, and other systemic symptoms being common.","Rocha, E. A.; Mehta, N.; Tavora-Mehta, M. Z.

As COVID-19 has significantly impacted on people's lives, it is essential to capture how people react to public health interventions and understand their concerns. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate people's reactions and concerns about COVID-19 in North America, especially focusing on Canada. METHODS: We analyze COVID-19 related tweets using topic modeling and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and interpret the results with public health experts. To generate insights on the effectiveness of specific public health interventions for COVID-19, we compare timelines of topics discussed with timing of implementation of interventions, synergistically including information on people's sentiment about COVID-19 related aspects in our analysis. In addition, to further investigate anti-Asian racism, we compare timelines of sentiments for Asians and Canadians. RESULTS: Topic modeling identified 20 topics and public health experts provided interpretations of the topics based on top-ranked words and representative tweets for each topic. The interpretation and timeline analysis showed that the discovered topics and their trend are highly related to public health promotions and interventions, such as physical distancing, border restrictions, hand washing, staying-home, and face coverings. After training the data using ABSA with human-in-the-loop, we obtained 545 aspect terms (e.g., ""vaccines"", ""economy"", and ""masks"") and 60 opinion terms (e.g., ""infectious""- negative, and ""professional""- positive), which were used for inference of sentiments of 20 key aspects selected by public health experts. The results showed negative sentiments related to overall outbreak, misinformation and Asians, and positive sentiments related to physical distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with domain expert involvement can produce useful information for public health. This study is the first to analyze COVID-19 related tweets in Canada in comparison with tweets in the United States by using topic modeling and human-in-the-loop domain-specific aspect-based sentiment analysis. This kind of information could help public health agencies to understand public concerns as well as what public health messages are resonating in our populations who use Twitter, which can be helpful for public health agencies when designing a policy for new interventions.","Jang, Hyeju; Rempel, Emily; Roth, David; Carenini, Giuseppe; Janjua, Naveed Zafar",J. med. internet res,609,16

A test is an action on a subset of items which returns positive if the subset contains at least one positive and negative otherwise. In non-adaptive group testing, all tests are independent, can be performed in parallel and represented as a measurement matrix. In this work, we consider non-adaptive group testing with consecutive positives in which the items are linearly ordered and the positives are consecutive in that order. We proposed two improved algorithms for efficiently identifying consecutive positives. In particular, without storing measurement matrices, we can identify up to $d$ consecutive positives with $2 \log_2{\frac{n}{d}} + 2d$ ($4 \log_2{\frac{n}{d}} + 2d$, resp.) tests in $O \left( \log_2^2{\frac{n}{d}} + d \right)$ ($O \left( \log_2{\frac{n}{d}} + d \right)$, resp.) time. These results significantly improve the state-of-the-art scheme in which it takes $5 \log_2{\frac{n}{d}} + 2d + 21$ tests to identify the positives in $O \left( \frac{n}{d} \log_2{\frac{n}{d}} + d^2 \right)$ time with the measurement matrices associated with the scheme stored somewhere.","Bui, Thach V.; Cheraghchi, Mahdi; Nguyen, Thuc D.",,609,15

The causal agent is a negative-strand RNA virus 80-100 nm in diameter. It causes fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neural symptoms. The mortality rate of SFTS was 32.6% among 172 cases reported from 2012 to 2015 in South Korea. Thus, is necessary to develop an effective diagnostic method that selectively identifies the isolates circulating in South Korea. The real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay is a simple, rapid, and sensitive approach for molecular diagnosis. Here, we designed novel primers for this assay and found that the technique had very high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. This real-time RT-LAMP approach using the novel primers developed herein can be applied for early diagnosis of SFTSV strains in South Korea to reduce the mortality rate of SFTS.","Lee, Jae Woong; Won, Yu-Jung; Kang, Lae Hyung; Lee, Sung-Geun; Park, Seung-Won; Paik, Soon-Young",J Microbiol,609,15

We hypothesized that altered systemic glucose metabolism as a consequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, contributes to TB pathogenesis, and when normalized with anti-glycemic drugs would improve clinical outcomes. To test this hypothesis, guinea pigs were treated daily with the anti-diabetic drug metformin starting 4 weeks prior or concurrent with aerosol exposure to the H37Rv strain of Mtb. In the chronic stages of infection, Mtb infected metformin-treated animals had restored systemic insulin sensitivity but remained glucose intolerant as determined by oral glucose tolerance testing. Despite persistent glucose intolerance, metformin-treated guinea pigs had a 2.8-fold reduction in lung lesion burden and a 0.7 log decrease in CFUs. An alternative hypothesis that metformin treatment improved clinical disease by having a direct effect on immune cell energy metabolism was tested using extracellular flux analysis and flow cytometry. The proinflammatory immune response to Mtb infection in untreated guinea pigs was associated with a marked increase in energy metabolism (glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which was normalized in metformin-treated guinea pigs. Moreover, both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from Mtb infected, metformin treated animals maintained a more normal mitochondrial membrane potential while those isolated from untreated animals had persistent mitochondrial hyperpolarization. These data suggest that metformin promotes natural host resistance to Mtb infection by maintaining immune cell metabolic homeostasis and function during the chronic stages of active TB disease.","Frenkel, Jessica D Haugen; Ackart, David F; Todd, Alexandra K; DiLisio, James E; Hoffman, Siana; Tanner, Samantha; Kiran, Dilara; Murray, Megan; Chicco, Adam; Obregón-Henao, Andrés; Podell, Brendan K; Basaraba, Randall J",Sci Rep,609,0

OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and evaluate their correlations with seroconversion and disease severity. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 3 designated specialty care centers for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 3192 adult patients with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. RESULTS: Among 12 780 reverse transcriptase PCR tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that were done, 24.0% had positive results. In 2142 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the viral positivity rate peaked within the first 3 days. The median duration of viral positivity was 24.0 days (95% CI, 18.9 to 29.1 days) in critically ill patients and 18.0 days (CI, 16.8 to 19.1 days) in noncritically ill patients. Being critically ill was an independent risk factor for longer viral positivity (hazard ratio, 0.700 [CI, 0.595 to 0.824]; P < 0.001). In patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the IgM-positive rate was 19.3% in the first week, peaked in the fifth week (81.5%), and then decreased steadily to around 55% within 9 to 10 weeks. The IgG-positive rate was 44.6% in the first week, reached 93.3% in the fourth week, and then remained high. Similar antibody responses were seen in clinically diagnosed cases. Serum inflammatory markers remained higher in critically ill patients. Among noncritically ill patients, a higher proportion of those with persistent viral positivity had low IgM titers (<100 AU/mL) during the entire course compared with those with short viral positivity. LIMITATION: Retrospective study and irregular viral and serology testing. CONCLUSION: The rate of viral PCR positivity peaked within the initial few days. Seroconversion rates peaked within 4 to 5 weeks. Dynamic laboratory index changes corresponded well to clinical signs, the recovery process, and disease severity. Low IgM titers (<100 AU/mL) are an independent risk factor for persistent viral positivity.

In this study, commercially available generation 3 poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer was investigated for pulmonary delivery of siRNA directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#945; for the treatment of acute lung inflammation. Delivery efficiency was assessed in vitro in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and efficacy was evaluated in vivo in a murine model of LPS-induced lung inflammation upon pre-treatment with TNF-&#945; siRNA. The PAMAM dendrimer-siRNA complexes (dendriplexes) displayed strong siRNA condensation and high cellular uptake in macrophages compared with non-complexed siRNA. Q-PCR analyses showed that the dendriplexes mediated efficient and specific TNF-&#945; silencing in vitro, as compared to non-complexed siRNA and dendriplexes with negative control siRNA. Also in vivo, the PAMAM dendriplexes induced efficacious TNF-&#945; siRNA inhibition, as compared to non-complexed siRNA, upon pulmonary administration to mice with LPS-induced lung inflammation. Hence, these data suggest that PAMAM dendrimers are promising for the local delivery of TNF-&#945; siRNA in the treatment of lung inflammation via pulmonary administration.","Bohr, Adam; Tsapis, Nicolas; Foged, Camilla; Andreana, Ilaria; Yang, Mingshi; Fattal, Elias",Eur. j. pharm. biopharm,609,33

The survey consisted of 20 questions on four topics: patients' characteristics, contact with the hospital, consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns about COVID-19. RESULTS: Five thousand three hundred two patients with cancer completed this nationwide survey. Overall, 30% of patients reported consequences for their oncological treatment or follow-up. In the majority of cases, this resulted in conversion from hospital visit to consultation by phone or video. The most frequently adjusted treatments were chemotherapy (30%) and immunotherapy (32%). Among patients with delay and discontinuation of treatment, 55% and 63% of patients, respectively, were (very) concerned about these consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequences were independent of regional differences in COVID-19 incidence. However, patients in regions with high COVID-19 incidence were significantly more concerned. CONCLUSION: This is the first study investigating perspectives of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study demonstrates the significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on oncological care, indicating the need for psycho-oncological support during this pandemic.","de Joode, K; Dumoulin, D W; Engelen, V; Bloemendal, H J; Verheij, M; van Laarhoven, H W M; Dingemans, I H; Dingemans, A C; van der Veldt, A A M",Eur J Cancer,609,16

Assimilation of meteorological observations from aircraft improves forecasts greatly. However, global lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to May 2020) has eliminated 50-75% aircraft observations and imperiled weather forecasting. Here, we verify global forecasts against reanalysis to quantify the impact of the pandemic. We find a large deterioration in forecasts of surface meteorology over regions with busy air flights, such as North America, southeast China, and Australia. Forecasts over remote regions are also substantially worse during March to May 2020 than 2017–2019, and the deterioration increases for longer-term forecasts. This could handicap early warning of extreme weather and cause additional economic damage on the top of that from the pandemic. The impact over Western Europe is buffered by the high density of conventional observations, suggesting that introduction of new observations in data-sparse regions would be needed to minimize the impact of global emergencies on weather forecasts.","Chen, Ying",Geophys.

The main factors taken into account in the economic assessment are excess mortality and lower productivity. METHODS: This study links three methodologies. First, we estimate the association between physical inactivity and workplace productivity using multivariable regression models with proprietary data on 120 143 individuals in the UK and six Asian countries (Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and Sri Lanka). Second, we analyse the association between physical activity and mortality risk through a meta-regression analysis with data from 74 prior studies with global coverage. Finally, the estimated effects are combined in a computable general equilibrium macroeconomic model to project the economic benefits of physical activity over time. RESULTS: Doing at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, as per lower limit of the range recommended by the 2020 WHO guidelines, would lead to an increase in global gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.15%-0.24% per year by 2050, worth up to US$314-446 billion per year and US$6.0-8.6 trillion cumulatively over the 30-year projection horizon (in 2019 prices). The results vary by country due to differences in baseline levels of physical activity and GDP per capita. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing physical activity in the population would lead to reduction in working-age mortality and morbidity and an increase in productivity, particularly through lower presenteeism, leading to substantial economic gains for the global economy.","Hafner, Marco; Yerushalmi, Erez; Stepanek, Martin; Phillips, William; Pollard, Jack; Deshpande, Advait; Whitmore, Michael; Millard, Francois; Subel, Shaun; van Stolk, Christian",Br J Sports Med,609,20

Animal experiments show that systemic challenges with live bacteria cause a neuro-inflammatory response, but the effect of age on this response in these models is unknown. Young (2 months) and middle-aged mice (13-14 months) were intraperitoneally challenged with live Escherichia coli (E. coli) or saline. The mice were sacrificed at 2, 3 and 7 days after inoculation; for all time points, the mice were treated with ceftriaxone (an antimicrobial drug) at 12 and 24 h after inoculation. Microglial response was monitored by immunohistochemical staining with an ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) antibody and flow cytometry, and inflammatory response by mRNA expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. We observed an increased microglial cell number and moderate morphologically activated microglial cells in middle-aged mice, as compared to young mice, after intraperitoneal challenge with live E. coli. Flow cytometry of microglial cells showed higher CD45 and CD11b expressions in middle-aged infected mice compared to young infected mice. The brain expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes were higher in middle-aged than in young infected mice, while middle-aged infected mice had similar expression levels of these genes in the systemic compartment. We conclude that systemic challenge with live bacteria causes an age-dependent neuro-inflammatory and microglial response. Our data show signs of an age-dependent disconnection of the inflammatory transcriptional signature between the brain and the systemic compartment.","Hoogland, Inge C M; Westhoff, Dunja; Engelen-Lee, Joo-Yeon; Valls Seron, Mercedes; Houben-Weerts, Judith H M P; van Westerloo, David J; van der Poll, Tom; van Gool, Willem A; van de Beek, Diederik",,609,10

Introduction: Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) experienced a rapid evolution from delivery of in-person cessation counseling services to virtual telehealth treatments for our tobacco-dependent cancer patients. Aim: To examine the effect of rapid scaling of tobacco treatment telehealth on patient engagement, as measured by attendance rates for in-person counseling visits versus remote telehealth counseling visits. We also describe the patient, clinician, and health care system challenges encountered in rapid expansion of individual and group tobacco telehealth services. Methods: Data collected from the electronic medical record during the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were examined for tobacco treatment counseling. Results: From January 1, 2020 to March 30, 2020, markedly improved patient engagement was observed in ambulatory tobacco treatment services with greater attendance at scheduled telehealth visits than in-person visits, 75% versus 60.3%, odds ratio 1.84 (confidence interval: 1.26-2.71; p < 0.001). In addition, bedside hospital counseling visits were transformed into inpatient telephone visits with high levels of sustained patient engagement. Lastly, group telehealth services were launched rapidly to increase capacity and provide greater psychosocial support for cancer patients struggling with tobacco dependence. Discussion: Clinical, Information Technology (IT), and hospital system barriers were successfully addressed for most cancer patients seeking individual telehealth treatment. Group telehealth services were found to be feasible and acceptable. Conclusions: MSK's rapid leap into virtual care delivery mitigated disruption of tobacco treatment services and demonstrated strong feasibility and acceptance for managing complex tobacco-dependent patients.","Kotsen, Chris; Dilip, Deepika; Carter-Harris, Lisa; O039,; Brien, Maureen; Whitlock, Charles W; de Leon-Sanchez, Suhana; Ostroff, Jamie S",Telemed J E Health,609,26

Remaining active or becoming physically active during social distancing restrictions reduced the probability of aggravated mental health disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a 6.6- and 7.4-fold increase since the COVID-19 pandemic. Public policies such as physical activity promotion and strategies to reduce the economic strain caused by this pandemic are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health.","Feter, N; Caputo, E L; Doring, I R; Leite, J S; Cassuriaga, J; Reichert, F F; da Silva, M C; Coombes, J S; Rombaldi, A J",Public Health,609,1

METHODS: Our single-centre, retrospective study analysed the pertinence of guidelines produced by ENT UK to improve the investigation and management of suspected upper aerodigestive fish bone foreign bodies during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated 43.3 per cent (n = 13) low-risk cases and 56.7 per cent (n = 17) moderate-risk cases. Nine fish bones (two low risk, seven moderate risk) were found; none of these were confirmed with X-ray and three (moderate risk) required nasoendoscopy for diagnosis. One patient required rigid pharyngoscopy. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that soft tissue neck X-ray and flexible nasoendoscopy are unnecessary in low-risk cases; however, early nasoendoscopy in higher suspicion cases is appropriate. Recommendations are made about the long-term sustainability of these guidelines, and additional measures are encouraged that relate to repeat attendances and varying prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in the hospital catchment area.","Michaels, J; Orji, C; Green, F; Nogueira, C",J Laryngol Otol,609,23

The main protease (Mpro) enzyme produced by SARS-CoV-2 was recently demonstrated to be responsible for not only viral reproduction but also impeding host immune responses. The element selenium (Se) plays a vital role in immune functions, both directly and indirectly. Thus, we hypothesised that Se-containing heterocyclic compounds might curb the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We performed a molecular docking analysis and found that several of the selected selenocompounds showed potential binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, especially ethaselen (49), which exhibited a docking score of -6.7 kcal/mol compared with the -6.5 kcal/mol score for GC376 (positive control). Drug-likeness calculations suggested that these compounds are biologically active and possess the characteristics of ideal drug candidates. Based on the binding affinity and drug-likeness results, we selected the 16 most effective selenocompounds as potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. We also validated the structural integrity and stability of the drug candidate through molecular dynamics simulation. Using further in vitro and in vivo experiments, we believe that the targeted compound identified in this study (ethaselen) could pave the way for the development of prospective drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and trigger specific host immune responses.","Rakib, Ahmed; Nain, Zulkar; Sami, Saad Ahmed; Mahmud, Shafi; Islam, Ashiqul; Ahmed, Shahriar; Siddiqui, Adnan Bin Faisul; Babu, S M Omar Faruque; Hossain, Payar; Shahriar, Asif; Nainu, Firzan; Emran, Talha Bin; Simal-Gandara, Jesus",Brief Bioinform,609,29

Although diabetes technology is increasingly established today, data rarely gets assessed, and telemedicine has not been sufficiently integrated into clinical workflows. OBJECTIVE: This project sought to remotely support children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers to enhance clinical outcomes and quality-of-life, engage multiple stakeholders through a participatory approach, evaluate the feasibility of using an interoperable open-source platform in a university hospital setting, and analyze success factors and barriers in transitioning from conventional to digital care. METHODS: Service design methods were used to adapt clinical workflows. Remote consultations were performed monthly and on-demand. Device data were uploaded from patients' homes to an open-source platform. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were assessed before, during and after the lockdown period in Germany due to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 28 children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers enrolled and completed 6 months of remote visits. Of them, 16 participants opted to perform at least one of their regular visits online. After 3 months, Time-in-Range and Time-in-Hyperglycemia significantly improved whilst Time-in-Hypoglycemia did not increase. These improvements were maintained during the COVID-19 related lockdown between month 3 and 6 of the study. Psychosocial health improved after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Remote consultations and data access can improve clinical outcomes and quality-of-life in children with type 1 diabetes even during challenging circumstances. Service design helped to deliver a comprehensive and holistic solution taking multiple stakeholders into consideration. These findings can inform further integration and use of digital tools into clinical care during the pandemic and beyond.

METHODS: HCWs of the radiation oncology departments from 29 tertiary cancer care centers of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Nepal were studied from May 2020 to July 2020. A total of 758 eligible HCWs were identified. The 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, and 22-Item Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used for assessing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to identify the causative factors affecting mental health. RESULTS: A total of 758 participants from 794 HCWs were analyzed. The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-28). The incidence of moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress was 34.8%, 31.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. Severe personal concerns were noticed by 60.9% of the staff. On multivariate analysis, the presence of commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 during the previous 2 weeks, contact history (harzard ratio [HR], 2.04; CI, 1.15 to 3.63), and compliance with precautionary measures (HR, 1.69; CI, 1.19 to 2.45) for COVID-19 significantly predicted for increasing anxiety (HR, 2.67; CI, 1.93 to 3.70), depression (HR, 3.38; CI 2.36 to 4.84), and stress (HR, 2.89; CI, 1.88 to 4.43) (P < .001). A significant regional variation was also noticed for anxiety, stress, and personal concerns. CONCLUSION: This survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a significant proportion of HCWs in the radiation oncology community experiences moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. This trend is alarming and it is important to identify and intervene at the right time to improve the mental health of HCWs to avoid any long-term impacts.","Wadasadawala, Tabassum; Kumar, Anuj; Laskar, Sarbani Ghosh; Gondhowiardjo, Soehartati; Mokal, Smruti; Goswami, Savita; Giselvania, Angela; Kapoor, Rakesh; Das, Abhijit; Pradhan, Satyajit; Pujari, Lincoln; Acharya, Bibek; Chapagain, Sandhya; Mahantshetty, Umesh; Vadgaonkar, Rohit; Hussain, Qazi Mushtaq; Akbarov, Kamal; Agarwal, Jai Prakash",JCO Glob Oncol,609,16

The volume focuses on Western Europe in the period 2007-2018 and considers both right-wing and left-wing populist parties. It critically assesses the concept and rise of populism, and includes case studies on Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, the United Kingdom, Greece, and Italy. The authors apply an original typology of party strategic responses to political competitors, which allows them to map interactions between populist and non-populist parties in different countries. They also assess the links between ideology and policy, the goals of different populist parties, and how achieving power affects these parties. The volume provides important lessons for the study of political competition, particularly in the aftermath of a crisis and, as such, its framework can inform future research in the post-Covid-19 era. This wide-ranging study will appeal to students and scholars of political science interested in populism and political competition;and will appeal to policy makers and politicians from across the political spectrum. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Daniele Albertazzi and Davide Vampa;individual chapters, the contributors.

However, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of three antiviral treatment regimens in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Methods: This was a single-center, randomized, open-labeled, prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomized into three groups: ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus IFN-&#945;, and RBV plus LPV/r plus IFN-&#945; at a 1:1:1 ratio. Each patient was invited to participate in a 28-d follow-up after initiation of an antiviral regimen. The outcomes include the difference in median interval to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity, the proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity at day 14, the mortality at day 28, the proportion of patients re-classified as severe cases, and adverse events during the study period. Results: In total, we enrolled 101 patients in this study. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were comparable among the three groups. In the analysis of intention-to-treat data, the median interval from baseline to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity was 12 d in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group, as compared with 13 and 15 d in the RBV+IFN-&#945;-treated group and in the RBV+LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group, respectively (p=0.23). The proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (61.1%) was higher than the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group (51.5%) and the RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (46.9%) at day 14; however, the difference between these groups was calculated to be statistically insignificant. The RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group developed a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than the LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group and the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group. Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are no significant differences among the three regimens in terms of antiviral effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the combination of RBV and LPV/r is associated with a significant increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, suggesting that RBV and LPV/r should not be co-administered to COVID-19 patients simultaneously.

Structural results showed that stress factors from the teaching process had a predictive value for the learning process, emotions, and academic burnout, and being a man was a factor predicting negative emotion. In a similar way, inferential results revealed no significant effect of academic year but did show an effect of gender on stress experiences during the pandemic. Aside from certain specific aspects, there was no significant global effect of the year 2020 on factors and symptoms of stress. The results showed that studying in the year of the COVID-19 outbreak did not have a significant effect on stress triggered by the teaching process.

Pre-posttest measures of the Intercultural Effectiveness Scale (IES) found significant improvement in all dimensions. Students with prior international experience had higher pre-test results in the world orientation and relationship development dimensions;however, students without study abroad experience approximated those results in their post-test assessment, apparently as a result of the GC.

A group of international experts, with research and experience in MR-proADM applications, produced this review based on their own experience and the currently available literature. AREAS COVERED: The review provides evidence related to MR-proADM as a triaging tool in avoiding unnecessary admissions to hospital and/or inadequate discharge, and identifying patients most at risk of deterioration. It also covers the use of MR-proADM in the context of COVID-19. Moreover, the authors provide a proposal on how to incorporate MR-proADM into patients' clinical pathways in an ED setting. EXPERT OPINION: The data we have so far on the application of MR-proADM in the ED is promising. Incorporating it into clinical scoring systems may aid the clinician's decision making and recognizing the 'ill looking well' and the 'well looking ill' sooner. However there are still many gaps in our knowledge especially during the ongoing COVID-19 waves. There is also a need for cost-effectiveness analysis studies especially in the era of increasing cost pressures on health systems globally.","Saeed, Kordo; Legramante, Jacopo M; Angeletti, Silvia; Curcio, Francesco; Miguens, Iria; Poole, Stephen; Tascini, Carlo; Sozio, Emanuela; Del Castillo, Juan González",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,609,14

The mechanisms of cardiovascular damage seem to involve the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to which severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) binds to penetrate cells and other mechanisms, most of which are still under study. Cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 include heart failure, cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. This article aims to collect scientific evidence by exploiting PubMed, Scopus, and Pedro databases to highlight the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 and to define the physiotherapy treatment recommended for these patients. Exercise training (ET), an important part of cardiac rehabilitation, is a powerful tool in physiotherapy, capable of inducing significant changes in the cardiovascular system and functional in the recovery of endothelial dysfunction and for the containment of thromboembolic complications. In conclusion, due to the wide variety of possible exercise programs that can be obtained by combining intensity, duration, and speed in various ways, and by adjusting the program based on continuous patient monitoring, exercise training is well suited to the treatment of post-COVID patients with an impaired cardiovascular system of various degrees.","Calabrese, Mariaconsiglia; Garofano, Marina; Palumbo, Roberta; Di Pietro, Paola; Izzo, Carmine; Damato, Antonio; Venturini, Eleonora; Iesu, Severino; Virtuoso, Nicola; Strianese, Andrea; Ciccarelli, Michele; Galasso, Gennaro; Vecchione, Carmine",,609,33

Lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a useful tool for diagnosing many respiratory diseases. The prognostic role of LUS in COVID-19 patients has not yet been established. METHODS: Several databases were searched on 09 April 2021. The difference in LUS score between the death and survival groups, and the relationship between LUS score and COVID-19 severity were both assessed. RESULTS: The LUS score was significantly higher in the death group compared with the survival group (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 8.21, 95% CI: 4.74-11.67, P < 0.001), which was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Those with mild/moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 had a progressively higher LUS score (critical vs. severe: WMD = 8.78, 95% CI: 4.17-13.38; P < 0.001; critical vs. mild/moderate/severe: WMD = 10.00, 95% CI: 6.83-13.17, P < 0.001; severe vs. moderate: WMD = 5.96, 95% CI: 3.48-8.44, P < 0.001; severe vs. mild/moderate: WMD = 7.31, 95% CI: 4.45-10.17, P < 0.001).

This study investigated dental students and clinical staff perceptions of health risks and impacts on clinical competence of working in teaching clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A 39-item survey composed of closed and open questions was sent to students and clinical staff of a prominent Australasian dental school. Questions focused on students and clinical staff perceived impact of COVID-19 on their health, clinical safety and dental education. RESULTS: The majority of staff and students perceived their health to be at risk and this increased their stress and impacted clinical performance, particularly for students. The production of aerosols and violation of cross-infection protocols by some students were the main perceived contributors to COVID-19 cross-infection in teaching clinics. Both students and staff considered the closure of teaching clinics would cause extreme impacts on students' clinical competence; however, online case-based discussions and tutorials were suggested as potential alternative teaching methods that could be adopted during that period.

The subsequent loneliness and concerns of the pandemic during social distancing, quarantine, and lockdown are psychosocial stressors that negatively affect the immune system. These effects occur through mechanisms controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis that alter immune regulation, namely the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), which promotes inflammation and diminishes antiviral responses, leading to inadequate protection against viral disease. Unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances, and mental health consequences of COVID-19 add on to the pathological effects of loneliness, making immunity against this ferocious virus an even tougher fight. Therefore, social isolation, with its unintended consequences, has inherently paradoxical effects on immunity in relation to viral disease. Though this paradox can present a challenge, its acknowledgment can serve as an opportunity to address the associated issues and find ways to mitigate the adverse effects. In this review, we aim to explore, in detail, the pathological effects of the new social norms on immunity and present suggested methods to improve our physical, psychological, and healthcare abilities to fight viral infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pourriyahi, Homa; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",J Neuroimmunol,609,20

COVID-19 leads to a mild to severe respiratory disease and affects different organs and has become a global concern since December 2019. Meanwhile, molecular biology and diagnostic laboratories played an essential role in diagnosis of the disease by introducing serological and molecular tests. Molecular-based techniques are reliable detection tools for SARS-CoV-2 and used for diagnosis of patients especially in the early stage of the disease. While, serological assays are considered as additional tools to verify the asymptomatic infections, tracing previous contacts of individuals, vaccine efficacy, and study the seroprevalance. The average time of the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patient's serum is 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms for both IgM and IgA and 10-18 days for IgG. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, FDA has approved and authorized a series of serological laboratory tests for early diagnosis. Serological assays have low-cost and provide fast results but have poor sensitivity in the early stage of the viral infection.

Both the pandemic itself and the restrictions were thought to create some psychological problems especially in patients with chronic illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on daily lives of children with MS, and the anxiety status of these patients and anxiety - depression status of their parents. METHODS: This study was performed on a group of pediatric MS patients aged 8-18 years in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, and Child Neurology Department. Thirty patients with MS and their 30 parents were enrolled to the study. The control group consisted of 49 healthy, age- and sex-matched children and their 49 parents. The patients (and their parents) were asked to complete a web-based survey evaluating access to health care and other changes in daily life between March 11th, 2020 and June 1st, 2020. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [which is composed of two parts; S-anxiety (STAI-S) and T-anxiety (STAI-T)] was administrated to the patients and healthy controls and the results were compared between the two groups to assess their anxiety levels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) [which is composed of two parts; HAD-anxiety (HAD-A) and HAD-depression (HAD-D)] was also given to all parents. The results of the HAD tests were compared between the two groups statistically. RESULTS: The results of the web-based survey showed that 4 of 9 (44.4%) patients, who had a regular workout program, left the program and 13 (43.3%) patients put on weight during the pandemic. Twenty-two patients (73.3%) could not get direct exposure to sunlight because of the curfew. Therefore, approximately half of the patients started to take vitamin D supplement. Most of the patients (80%) thought that they had higher risk and believed that they would have severe symptoms compared to healthy people. Twenty one (70%) patients disrupted their regular health checks and the most frequent causes were identified as closure of policlinics to routine patient care (33%) and concerns of getting SARS-CoV2 infection (26,6%). Two of 3 patients who had an MS attack did not go to the doctor during this period. The mean STAI-S scores in MS patients were significantly higher compared to the healthy controls (p=<0.001). The level of S-anxiety in all patients was higher compared to the cut off value.The mean HAD A score was found to be significantly higher in them compared to the parents of healthy individuals (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that children with MS had negative changes in daily life and high anxiety levels during the pandemic. Since MS patients have also psychiatric comorbidities, they may need psychosocial support especially in this period.

Here, we show the prodrug and its parent GC373, are effective inhibitors of the Mpro from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with these inhibitors have a covalent modification of the nucleophilic Cys145. NMR analysis reveals that inhibition proceeds via reversible formation of a hemithioacetal. GC373 and GC376 are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture.

Scientists and pharmaceutical companies have been in race to produce vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine generation usually demands years of developing and testing for efficacy and safety. However, it only took less than one year to generate two mRNA vaccines from their development to deployment. The rapid production time, cost-effectiveness, versatility in vaccine design, and clinically proven ability to induce cellular and humoral immune response have crowned mRNA vaccines with spotlights as most promising vaccine candidates in the fight against the pandemic. In this review, we discuss the general principles of mRNA vaccine design and working mechanisms of the vaccines, and provide an up-to-date summary of pre-clinical and clinical trials on seven anti-COVID-19 mRNA candidate vaccines, with the focus on the two mRNA vaccines already licensed for vaccination. In addition, we highlight the key strategies in designing mRNA vaccines to maximize the expression of immunogens and avoid intrinsic innate immune response.

Therefore, we implemented an immunoinformatic approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Results: The designed-vaccine construct consists of several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and interferon-gamma responses. Also, these epitopes have a high antigenic capacity and are not likely to cause allergies. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants: Flagellin of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91, and human beta-defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. The tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by Phyre2 and Galaxi refine and validated using RAMPAGE and ERRAT. Results of ElliPro showed 246 sresidues from vaccine might be conformational B-cell epitopes. Docking of the vaccine with toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 5, 8, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 approved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptors. Prediction of mRNA secondary structure and in silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the multi-epitope vaccine might be potentially antigenic and induce humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine can interact appropriately with the TLR3, 5, and 8. Also, it has a high-quality structure and suitable characteristics such as high stability and potential for expression in Escherichia coli.","Yazdani, Zahra; Rafiei, Alireza; Yazdani, Mohammadreza; Valadan, Reza",Infect.

HP typically remains asymptomatic, however complications such as acute pancreatitis can arise. Gastrointestinal involvement with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not uncommon and there are reported cases of associated pancreatitis.Case presentationA 31-year-old male presented to the Emergency department (ED) with a 3-day history of right iliac fossa pain. The patient was found to have COVID-19 and a planned laparoscopic appendectomy was later converted to a midline laparotomy when a mass close to the duodeno-jejunal (DJ) flexure was identified. Following a hand-sewn anastomosis the patient made a good post-operative recovery. Histology illustrated the presence of heterotopic pancreatic tissue within the small bowel with underlying fat necrosis typical of acute pancreatitis. Follow-up radiology supported the intraoperative finding of intestinal malrotation.Clinical DiscussionRarely the combined presence of intestinal malrotation and HP in patients has been noted. Heterotopic pancreatitis can present in a multitude of ways and it is a difficult diagnosis to make pre-operatively. Emerging literature documents the potential presentation of COVID-19 with acute pancreatitis. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the pancreas is believed to play a role. Conclusion: This is the first documented case of heterotopic pancreatitis with intestinal malrotation in a COVID-19 positive patient. We hypothesise that the COVID-19 infection contributed to the heterotopic pancreatitis.","Tomasi, Ivan; Scott, Luca; Cullen, Jack; di Maggio, Francesco; Ebied, Husam; Wheatstone, Sarah",Int J Surg Case Rep,609,1

As illustrated by the global COVID19 pandemic, high healthcare costs, economic disruption and loss of productivity reinforce the unmet medical need to develop new antiviral strategies to combat not only the current pandemic but also future viral outbreaks. Pivotal for effective anti-viral defense is the innate immune system, a first line host response that senses and responds to virus infection. While molecular details of the innate immune response are well characterized, this research field is now being revolutionized with the recognition that cell metabolism has a major impact on the antiviral and inflammatory responses to virus infections. A detailed understanding of the role of metabolic regulation with respect to antiviral and inflammatory responses, together with knowledge of the strategies used by viruses to exploit immunometabolic pathways, will ultimately change our understanding and treatment of pathogenic viral diseases.

Different morphological settings and variable biogeophysical conditions characterize this continuously evolving system that rapidly responds to the anthropic impacts. When the lockdown measures were enforced in Italy to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 10th 2020, the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice, one of the major pressures in the lagoon, came to a halt. This provided a unique opportunity to analyse the environmental effects of restrictions to mobility on water transparency. Pseudo true-colour composites Sentinel-2 satellite imagery proved useful for qualitative visual interpretation, showing the reduction of the vessel traffic and their wakes from the periods before and during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. A quantitative analysis of suspended matter patterns, based on satellite-derived turbidity, in the absence of traffic perturbations, allowed to focus on natural processes and the residual stress from human activities that continued throughout the lockdown. We conclude that the high water transparency can be considered as a transient condition determined by a combination of natural seasonal factors and the effects of COVID-19 restrictions.","Braga, Federica; Scarpa, Gian Marco; Brando, Vittorio Ernesto; Manfè, Giorgia; Zaggia, Luca",Sci Total Environ,609,16

Therefore, our purpose is to provide insights into the nutritional importance of vitamin D for its immunomodulatory effect, in order to help counteracting the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel interesting findings suggest that vitamin D, by inducing progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF), might regulate the immune response and also modulate cytokine IL-6, which appears to be increased in COVID-19 infections. Therefore, in addition to the standard recommendations to prevent the infection, supplementation of vitamin D might be considered an approach to help counteracting this global epidemic.","Orrù, B; Szekeres-Bartho, J; Bizzarri, M; Spiga, A M; Unfer, V",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,609,28

Laboratory studies and case series published early in the pandemic supported its efficacy. The scientific community raced to conduct observational and randomized evaluations of the drug in all stages of the disease, including prophylaxis, early treatment, and advanced disease. Yet a divisive media response affected recruitment, funding, and subsequent enthusiasm for continuing scientific investigations. Of the more than 300 HCQ trials registered, fewer than 50% report having recruited any patients, and most trials might fail to achieve any useful portions of their intended sample size. Multiple observational studies and two large randomized trials have demonstrated HCQ does not offer efficacy against COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Prophylaxis studies and early treatment studies provided heterogeneous results and are plagued by low event rates and poor study outcome monitoring. Emerging high-quality evaluations of prophylaxis and early treatment do not support a role for HCQ in these populations. The story of HCQ for COVID-19 has followed a pattern of initial enthusiasm supported by poor quality evidence, followed by disappointment based on more rigorous evaluations. The experience of HCQ in the COVID-19 era calls for the depoliticization of science away from media glare.","Lee, Zelyn; Rayner, Craig R; Forrest, Jamie I; Nachega, Jean B; Senchaudhuri, Esha; Mills, Edward J",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,609,20

Methods: This was a retrospective case series involving 218 patients admitted to three tertiary hospitals in the Loudi, Shaoyang, and Xiangtan areas of China from January 21 to June 27, 2020, who were confirmed by RT-PCR to have SARS-CoV-2. The patients' clinical characteristics, laboratory results, treatments, and prognoses based on clinical classification were recorded. Poor outcome was defined as admission to an ICU, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: The patients were classified into four clinical groups based on disease severity, namely mild (10/218, 5%), moderate (146/218, 67%), severe (24/218, 11%), or critical (14/218, 6%); 24 (11%) asymptomatic cases were also included in the study. The most common symptoms were self-reported cough (162/218, 74%), fever (145/218, 67%), sputum production (99/218, 45%), and fatigue (77/218, 35%). Among the 218 patients, 192 (88%) received lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-alpha inhalation, and 196 (90%) patients received traditional Chinese medicine. Among the severe and critical patients, 25 (11%) were admitted to an ICU with or without mechanical ventilation, and one patient died. The presence of diabetes [relative risk (RR), 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3–6.8; p = 0.007) or other comorbidities (RR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.9–17.8; p = 0.002) was independently associated with poor outcome. To date, 20 (9%) patients have retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after recovering and being discharged. Conclusion: The majority of patients in this case series were clinically classified as having moderate COVID-19. Older patients tended to present with greater levels of clinical severity. The prognosis for patients who were elderly or had diabetes or other chronic comorbidities was relatively poor.","Yan, Xiquan; Han, Xiaotong; Peng, Danhong; Fan, Yong; Fang, Zhixiong; Long, Da; Xie, Yu; Zhu, Shuibo; Chen, Fang; Lin, Wei; Zhu, Yimin",Front.

Methods: A retrospective, observational study of adult inpatients with a length of stay of 1 or more days at an urban hospital in Detroit, Michigan. Individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis were compared with a cohort within similar diagnostic categories (respiratory, fever, and sepsis) but without COVID-19. Outcome measures included PT or OT intervention on 1 or more days, the timing of initial PT or OT visit, the average number of visits and units per patient, length of stay, discharge to home, and readmission within 30 days. Results: Individuals with COVID-19 had lower rates of discharge to home (P =.001), higher rates of readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge (P =.01), increased hospital length of stay (P =.001), and waited an average of 3.1 days longer for therapy evaluations than subjects in the comparison group (P =.001). The percentage of subjects who had one or more PT or OT visits during their hospital stays was comparable between groups.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced the activations for STEMI in epicenters like Spain. METHODS: From January 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020, 143 STEMIs were identified across our integrated 18-hospital system. Pre- and post-COVID-19 cohorts were based on March 23rd, 2020, whenstay-at-home orders were initiated in Ohio. We used presenting heart rate, blood pressure, troponin, new Q-wave, and left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) to assess severity. Duration of intensive care unit stay, total length of stay, door-to-balloon (D2B) time, and radial versus femoral access were used to assess patterns of care. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 presentation was associated with a lower admission LVEF (45 vs. 50%, p = .015), new Q-wave, and higher initial troponin; however, these did not reach statistical significance. Among post-COVID-19 patients, those with >12-hr delay in presentation 31(%) had a longer average D2B time (88 vs. 53 min, p = .033) and higher peak troponin (58 vs. 8.5 ng/ml, p = .03). Of these, 27% avoided the hospital due to fear of COVID-19, 18% believed symptoms were COVID-19 related, and 9% did not want to burden the hospital during the pandemic.

T cells that failed to respond to peptides from the membrane, spike, or nucleocapsid proteins were more common in subjects who died. In those whose T cells had the capacity to respond, older patients with comorbidity had larger numbers of activated T cells compared with patients who had fewer risk factors, but these cells showed impaired IFN-Î³ production.

Predicting both its prevalence and incidence throughout the world is crucial to help health professionals make key decisions. In this study, we aim to predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period to better manage the disease. METHODS: The COVID-19 datasets provided by Johns Hopkins University, contain information on COVID-19 cases in different geographic regions since January 22, 2020 and are updated daily. Data from 252 such regions were analyzed as of March 29, 2020, with 17,136 records and 4 variables, namely latitude, longitude, date, and records. In order to design the incidence pattern for each geographic region, the information was utilized on the region and its neighboring areas gathered 2 weeks prior to the designing. Then, a model was developed to predict the incidence rate for the coming 2 weeks via a Least-Square Boosting Classification algorithm. RESULTS: The model was presented for three groups based on the incidence rate: less than 200, between 200 and 1000, and above 1000. The mean absolute error of model evaluation were 4.71, 8.54, and 6.13%, respectively. Also, comparing the forecast results with the actual values in the period in question showed that the proposed model predicted the number of globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a very high accuracy of 98.45%. CONCLUSION: Using data from different geographical regions within a country and discovering the pattern of prevalence in a region and its neighboring areas, our boosting-based model was able to accurately predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period.","Ahouz, Fatemeh; Golabpour, Amin",BMC Public Health,609,33

The skin flap was prefabricated by implantation of a distally ligated femoral pedicle into subdermal layer of the skin. Skin of the abdominal wall donnor site of 25 Wistar rats were compared in three groups of flaps receiving (A) pedicle implantation with no delay and (B) and (C) delay performed at the time of pedicle implantation. Three weeks later, the flaps in the group A and B were raised as an island flap, based on the implanted pedicle. In the group C, the implanted pedicle was severed when the flaps were raised. Seven days later, survival area in groups A, B and C were marked and the percentage survival area, with regard to whole flap area, calculated by Auto Cad R-14. The vascular density around the implanted pedicle, in groups A and B, was assessed by histological study. The mean percentage survival rate of the skin flap was 9.6 percent in the nondelayed group, 44.8 percent in the delayed group and 0.3percent in the group with implanted pedicle severed. The results of this study showed that delay procedure significantly increased (p 0.01, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) the percentages survival of the flap and was found to have no influency over vascular density (p=0.307 two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) developed around the pedicle implantation three weeks after prefabrication.","Zacchê de Sá, Jairo; Lamartine de Andrade Aguiar, José; Morais, Júlio; Roberto Barros Coelho, Antonio; Maria Limongi Lopes, Silvia; Batista Melo, Cláudia",Acta cir. bras.,609,30

In this study, the aim was to identify factors associated with headache in COVID-19 and headache characteristics. METHODS: This case-control study includes COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pneumonia during March 2020. Controls comprise COVID-19 patients without headache and the cases are COVID-19 patients with headache. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records. Headache characteristics were evaluated by semi-structured telephonic interview after discharge. RESULTS: Of a total of 379 COVID-19 patients, 48 (13%) developed headache. Amongst these, 30 (62%) were men and the median age was 57.9 (47-73) years. Headache was associated with younger age, fewer comorbidities and reduced mortality, as well as with low levels of C-reactive protein, mild acute respiratory distress syndrome and oropharyngeal symptoms. A logistic multiple regression model revealed that headache was directly associated with D-dimer and creatinine levels, the use of high flow nasal cannula and arthromyalgia, whilst urea levels, beta-lactamic treatment and hypertension were negatively associated with headache. COVID-19-associated headache characteristics were available for 23/48 (48%) patients. Headache was the onset symptom in 8/20 (40%) patients, of mild or moderate intensity in 17/20 (85%) patients, with oppressive characteristics in 17/18 (94%) and of holocranial 8/19 (42%) or temporal 7/19 (37%) localization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that headache is associated with a more benign SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated headache appears as an early symptom and as a novel headache with characteristics of headache attributed to systemic viral infection. Further research addressing the underlying mechanisms to confirm these findings is warranted.","Gonzalez-Martinez, Alicia; Fanjul, Víctor; Ramos, Carmen; Serrano Ballesteros, Jorge; Bustamante, Marta; Villa Martí, Almudena; Álvarez, Claudia; García Del Álamo, Yaiza; Vivancos, José; Gago-Veiga, Ana Beatriz",Eur. j. neurol,609,16

It is supposed that lockdown measures and fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection might reduce vitamin D levels through the modification of lifestyle. However, very few data exist on the association between lockdown measures and vitamin D status in humans. For this cross-sectional comparative study, adolescents (n = 298) aged 18 to 19 years were enrolled during the compulsory military fitness-for-duty evaluation between July and December 2020 in Southern Switzerland. Beyond anthropometric measurements, participants filled in a structured questionnaire about their lifestyle and a blood specimen was sampled for the determination of total 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. The obtained data were compared with those of 437 adolescents enrolled at the military fitness-for-duty evaluation during the same period of the year in the context of the CENERI study (2014-2016).

SARS-CoV-2 and its variants have particularly exerted tremendous pressure on global healthcare system owing to their life threatening and debilitating implications. The sheer plurality of the variants and huge scale of genome sequence data available for Covid19 have added to the challenges of traceability of mutations of concern. The latter however provides an opportunity to utilize SARS-CoV-2 genomes and the mutations therein as big data records to comprehensively classify the variants through the (machine) learning of mutation patterns. The unprecedented sequencing effort and tracing of disease outcomes provide an excellent ground for identifying important mutations by developing machine learnt models or severity classifiers using mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2. This is expected to provide a significant impetus to the efforts towards not only identifying the mutations of concern but also exploring the potential of mutation driven predictive prognosis of SARS-CoV-2. ResultsWe describe how a graduated approach of building various severity specific machine learning classifiers, using only the mutation corpus of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, can potentially lead to the identification of important mutations and guide potential prognosis of infection. We demonstrate the applicability of model derived important mutations and use of Shapley values in order to identify the significant mutations of concern as well as for developing sparse models of outcome classification. A total of 77,284 outcome traced SARS-CoV-2 genomes were employed in this study which represented a total corpus of 30346 unique nucleotide mutations and 18647 amino acid mutations. Machine learning models pertaining to graduated classifiers of target outcomes namely Asymptomatic, Mild, Symptomatic/Moderate, Severe and Fatal were built considering the TRIPOD guidelines for predictive prognosis. Shapley values for model linked important mutations were employed to select significant mutations leading to identification of less than 20 outcome driving mutations from each classifier. We additionally describe the significance of adopting a temporal modeling approach to benchmark the predictive prognosis linked with continuously evolving pathogens. A chronologically distinct sampling is important in evaluating the performance of models trained on past data in accurately classifying prognosis linked with genomes of future (observed with new mutations). We conclude that while machine learning approach can play a vital role in identifying relevant mutations, caution should be exercised in using the mutation signatures for predictive prognosis in cases where new mutations have accumulated along with the previously observed mutations of concern.

However, scant information is available regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and ocular structures tropism. We conducted a systematic review of articles referenced in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR) from December 20, 2019 to April 6, 2020, providing information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, and tears. We excluded ongoing clinical studies as for unobtainable conclusive results. Of 2422 articles, 11 met the inclusion criteria for analysis and were included in the study. None of the studies were multinational. Among the 11 selected papers there were three original articles, one review, four letters, two editorials, and one correspondence letter. Globally, 252 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were included in our review. The prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis complicating the course of COVID-19 was demonstrated to be as high as 32% in one study only. Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR. The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial. However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures. SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients' conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay.","Aiello, Francesco; Gallo Afflitto, Gabriele; Mancino, Raffaele; Li, Ji-Peng Olivia; Cesareo, Massimo; Giannini, Clarissa; Nucci, Carlo",Eye (Lond),609,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 78-question survey was distributed to practicing interventional radiologists and IR trainees. The survey consisted of demographic and practice environment queries. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) screener, and coping strategies were assessed using the Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 422 respondents including 333 (78.9%) attending interventional radiologists and 89 (21.1%) interventional radiologists-in-training from 15 counties. Most respondents were from academic medical centers (n = 218; 51.7%). A large majority (n = 391; 92.7%) performed a procedure on a patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection. An N95 mask was the most common (n = 366; 93.6%) safety measure employed. Cancellation or limitation of elective procedures were reported by 276 (65.4%) respondents. Many respondents (n = 177; 41.9%) had self-reported anxiety (GAD-7 score >5) with an overall mean GAD-7 score of 4.64 ± 4.63 (range: 0-21). Factors associated with reporting anxiety included female gender (p = 0.045), increased call coverage (p = 0.048), lack of adequate departmental adjustments (p <0.0001), and lack of adjustments in a timely manner (p <0.0001). The most utilized coping strategy was acceptance (mean of 5.49 ± 1.88), while the most employed dysfunctional coping strategy was self-distraction (mean of 4.16 ± 1.67). The odds of reporting anxiety increased by >125% with adoption of dysfunctional strategies.

This framework consists of an extended epidemic model in interconnected networks and a dynamic structure that has major human mobility. The networked causal analysis focuses on the stochastic processing mechanism. It highlights the social infectivity as the intervention estimator between the observable effect (the number of daily new cases) and unobservable causes (the number of infectious persons).

On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) informed the public for the first time about causes of pneumonnia of unknown origin, in the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), in people who were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal whole sale local market in Wuhan. Coronavrus disease, called COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019), after China quickly spread to most countries in the wold, and the WHO on March 11, 2020 declared a pandmic with this virus. SARS-CoV-2, has a high level of sequential similarities to the SARS-CoV-1 and uses the same receptors when it enters the human body (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/ACE2). COVID-19 is respiratry infection that is primarily transmitted via respiratry droplets. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection can be very moderate (infected can be even asymptomatic) to very severe, with severe respiratory symptoms (bilateral severe pneumonia), septic schock, and fatal outcome. Numeous unknows regarding the biological, epidemilogical adn clinical characteristics of COVID-19, still exist, and make it impossible to predict with certainty the further course of the current pandemic. COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the respiratory system, but SARS-CoV-2, in a number of patients also penetrates the CNS, and apparently could be responsible for fatal outcome in some cases. The entrry of the virus into the brain can lead to neurological and psychiatric manifestationss, which are not uncommon, including headache, paresthesia, myalgia, impaired consciousnessm, confusion or delirum and cerebrovascular diseases. SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals should be evaluated in a timely manner for neurological and psychiatic symptoms because tretament of infection-related neurological and psychiatric complications is an important factor in better prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.From the current point of view, it seems that in COVID-19 survivors, in the coming years and decades, the inflammatory systemic process and/or the inflammatory process of the brain could trigger long-term mechanisms that generally lead to an increase of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Psychosocial consequences as well as consequences for mental health are also significant, both for the general population and especially for health workers of all profiles. COVID-19 pandemia is associtaed with negative psychosocial consequences, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger and stress, sleep disorders, simpotms of posttrauamtic stres disorder, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization.","Sinanovic, Osman; Muftic, Mirsad; Sinanovic, Selma",Psychiatr Danub,609,1

The city government soon strictly locked down the city, implemented a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system, and took a series of unprecedented pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures. The residents’ access to the medical resources and the consequently potential demand–supply tension may determine effective diagnosis and treatment, for which travel distance and time are key indicators. Using the Application Programming Interface (API) of Baidu Map, we estimated the travel distance and time from communities to the medical facilities capable of treating COVID-19 patients, and we identified the service areas of those facilities as well. The results showed significant differences in service areas and potential loading across medical facilities. The accessibility of medical facilities in the peripheral areas was inferior to those in the central areas;there was spatial inequality of medical resources within and across districts;the amount of community healthcare centers was insufficient;some communities were underserved regarding walking distance;some medical facilities could be potentially overloaded. This study provides reference, in the context of Wuhan, for understanding the spatial aspect of medical resources and residents’ relevant mobility under the emergency regulation, and re-examining the coordination of emergency to improve future planning and utilization of medical facilities at various levels. The approach can facilitate policymakers to assess potential loading of medical facilities, identify low-accessibility areas, and deploy new medical facilities.

The viral infection initiates inflammatory responses leading to endothelial damage and coagulation cascade dysfnction. Spread of COVID-19 has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and subsequent coagulopathy. Initially coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients result in significant elevation of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and abnormalities in coagulatory parameters, which resulting in formation of thrombus and eventually death. METHODOLOGY: Present report intends to summarize the information of the research reports available so far on the complications of formation of unusal blood clots (thrombosis) during COVID-19 infection and its therapeutic strategies. Extensive web search was done for various reports associating COVID-19 infection with increased coagulopathy and abnormal coagulatory parameters such as PT, PTT, and platelet counts; along with increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Findings of these research reports were summarized to recommend cautions for clinicians while treating COVID-19 patient. Screening of coagulatory parameters upon admission and during entire course of treatment is recommended, especially those who are at increased risk of thrombosis. Also, anticoagulant treatment can be used as thromboprophylaxis measure. Dose and duration of anticoagulation treatment requirement may vary and thus regular monitoring is needed.","Srivastava, Swati; Garg, Iti; Bansal, Anju; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",Clin Chim Acta,609,25

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the worldwide research on COVID-19 in the pediatric field by bibliometric analysis, identifying publication trends and topic dissemination and showing the relevance of publishing authors, institutions and countries. METHODS: Scopus database was comprehensively searched for all indexed documents published between January 1, 2020 and June 11, 2020, dealing with COVID-19 in pediatric age (0-18 years). A machine learning bibliometric methodology was applied to evaluate the total number of papers and citations, journal and publication types, the top productive institutions and countries and their scientific collaboration, the core keywords. RESULTS: A total of 2301 papers were retrieved, with an average of 4.8 citations per article. Out of them, 1078 (46.9%) were research articles, 436 (18.9%) reviews, 363 (15.8%) letters, 186 (8.1%) editorials, 7 (0.3%) were conference papers, and 231 (10%) others. The studies were published in 969 different journals, headed by The Lancet. The retrieved papers were published by a total of 12657 authors from 114 countries.

In this study, we aimed to compare the clinical course of COVID-19 in adult SCD patients under the organ injury mitigation and clinical care improvement program (BASCARE) with healthcare professionals without significant comorbid conditions. The study was planned as a retrospective, multicenter and cross-sectional study. Thirty-nine SCD patients, ages 18 to 64 years, and 121 healthcare professionals, ages 21 to 53, were included in the study. The data were collected from the Electronic Health Recording System of PRANA, where SCD patients under the BASCARE program had been registered. The data of other patients were collected from the Electronic Hospital Data Recording System and patient files. In the SCD group, the crude incidence of COVID-19 was 9%, while in healthcare professionals at the same period was 23%. Among the symptoms, besides fever, loss of smell and taste were more prominent in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals. There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of development of pneumonia, hospitalization, and need for intubation (43 vs 5%, P < 0.00001; 26 vs 7%, P = 0.002; and 10 vs 1%, P = 0.002, respectively). Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin and salicylate were used more in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals group (41 vs 9% and 28 vs 1%; P < 0.0001 for both). The 3-month mortality rate was demonstrated as 5% in the SCD group, while 0 in the healthcare professionals group. One patient in the SCD group became continously dependent on respiratory support. The cause of death was acute chest syndrome in the first case, hepatic necrosis and multi-organ failure in the second case. In conclusion, these observations supported the expectation that the course of COVID-19 in SCD patients will get worse.

No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: In accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed. The consistency between the first COVID-19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied. RESULT: The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was -1.52. With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6-24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2-43.0. CONCLUSION: The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes.","Zhifeng, Jiang; Feng, Aiqiao; Li, Tao",J Clin Virol,609,3

METHODS: Adults involved in studies prior to the pandemic were contacted during the COVID-19 lockdown. Seventeen young adults (age range: 18-35 years) and 21 older adults (age range: 65-90 years) agreed to participate. Participants were interviewed by phone (between 27th April and 4th May, 2020) to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep (DBAS) questionnaire they had been administered before the pandemic. RESULTS: In terms of mean changes, the results showed null effect sizes for changes in self-reported sleep quality for both age groups. In young adults, a medium effect size emerged for changes in sleep latency, which increased during lockdown. No changes in any of the self-reported sleep quality dimensions emerged in older adults. In both age groups, the effect sizes for changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs were negligible. In older adults, however, changes in self-reported sleep quality were largely associated with changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that self-reported sleep quality and dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs were not affected by the COVID-19 lockdown in young or older adults. They also suggest that it might be useful to consider changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs to better capture the impact of stressful events (such as a period of quarantine) on sleep quality, especially where older adults are concerned.","Sella, Enrico; Carbone, Elena; Toffalini, Enrico; Borella, Erika",Sleep Med,609,23

They were recently identified as potential therapeutic options for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The present study aims to map and grade the diverse health outcomes associated with HCQ/CQ using an umbrella review approach. METHODS: Umbrella review of systematic reviews of observational and intervention studies. For observational studies, random-effects summary effect size, 95% confidence interval, and 95% prediction interval were estimated. We also assessed heterogeneity, evidence for small-study effect, and evidence for excess significance bias. The quality of evidence was then graded using validated criteria from highly convincing to weak. The evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. RESULTS: From 313 articles returned in the literature search, six meta-analyses were included (n = 25 outcomes). Among meta-analyses (MAs) of observational studies, HCQ/CQ are weakly associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular events and diabetes when used for autoimmune diseases and with spontaneous abortion; they are also associated with a higher risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Among MAs of RCTs, HCQ/CQ are associated with an improvement of articular manifestations of rheumatic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: There is high evidence of the efficacy of HCQ/CQ in the rheumatologic field. The lack of evidence for efficacy and the risk of death associated with the use of HCQ/CQ for COVID-19 indicate the inappropriateness of their inclusion in recent COVID-19 therapy guidelines and the urgent need for RCTs to determine eventual appropriateness as a COVID-19 therapy.","Celotto, Stefano; Veronese, Nicola; Barbagallo, Mario; Ometto, Francesca; Smith, Lee; Pardhan, Shahina; Barnett, Yvonne; Ilie, Petre Cristian; Soysal, Pinar; Lagolio, Erik; Kurotschka, Peter Konstantin; Tonelli, Roberto; Demurtas, Jacopo",Int J Infect Dis,609,16

While significant effort has been made towards acute management, long-term management has received less attention. To address this, our study identified patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and recorded the time to enrollment into a formal pulmonary rehabilitation program at an academic center;the differences in time allowed us to assess whether earlier enrollment led to differences in physiologic and psychologic outcomes. First, we hypothesize that enrollment into a pulmonary rehabilitation program is essential to a patient's long term treatment and management of post-infectious, chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Second, we aim to demonstrate that early participation leads to improvements in dyspnea, anxiety and depression as supported by the UCSD SOBQ, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores respectively. Through chart review, we collected data from 24 patients enrolled in a post-COVID recovery program centered around pulmonary rehabilitation at an academic medical center in Texas. We administered: (1) pulmonary function test (PFT);(2) University of California - San Diego (UCSD) Dyspnea Questionnaire;and (3) six-minute walk (6MW) tests when a patient entered and completed the program. We used this data to assess for subjective and objective changes in respiratory function postrehabilitation. To analyze the indirect benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation on mental health effects of COVID-19, we used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) questionnaires to evaluate a patients' anxiety and depression respectively at the same time points. Our results showed that it took patients an average 67.8 days to initiate rehabilitation after initial diagnosis. 13 of 24 patients began rehab earlier than the average and had an average decrease in UCSD SOBQ score of 35.6 and 6MW increase of 64.5 m compared to the group averages of 17.8 and 74.7 m respectively. The average initial GAD7 and PHQ9 scores were 6.7 and 8.7, with an average decrease of 1.5 and 2.2 respectively. Through our study, we highlight the benefit of early initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation in the post-COVID 19 recovery period. Through both subjective and objective measurements of patient respiratory function and mental health, our study supports inclusion and standardization of early pulmonary rehabilitation as a component of COVID-19 recovery.","Baig, M.; Joo, M.; Nada, K.

We previously identified a novel accessory protein NS7a encoded by PDCoV; however, the function of NS7a was not resolved. In this study, we demonstrated that PDCoV NS7a is an interferon antagonist. Overexpression of NS7a notably inhibited Sendai virus (SeV)-induced interferon-ß (IFN-ß) production and the activation of IRF3 rather than NF-&#954;B. NS7a also inhibited IFN-ß promoter activity induced by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKKÎµ, which are key components of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway but not IRF3, the transcription factor downstream of TBK1/IKKÎµ. Surprisingly, NS7a specifically interacts with IKKÎµ but not with the closely related TBK1. Furthermore, NS7a interacts simultaneously with the kinase domain (KD) and the scaffold dimerization domain (SDD) of IKKÎµ, competing with TRAF3, and IRF3 for binding to IKKÎµ, leading to the reduction of RLR-mediated IFN-ß production. The interactions of TRAF3-IKKÎµ and IKKÎµ-IRF3 are also attenuated in PDCoV-infected cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV NS7a inhibits IFN-ß production by disrupting the association of IKKÎµ with both TRAF3 and IRF3, revealing a new mechanism utilized by a PDCoV accessory protein to evade the host antiviral innate immune response.","Fang, Puxian; Fang, Liurong; Xia, Sijin; Ren, Jie; Zhang, Jiansong; Bai, Dongcheng; Zhou, Yanrong; Peng, Guiqing; Zhao, Shuhong; Xiao, Shaobo",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,609,26

Although these trials can offer significant advantages over traditional clinical trials, the process of designing and implementing direct-to-family studies is poorly defined, especially in children with rheumatic disease. This paper provides lessons learnt from the design and implementation of a self-controlled, direct-to-family pilot trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a medication management device on adherence to hydroxychloroquine in paediatric SLE. METHODS: Several design features accommodate a direct-to-family approach. Participants meeting eligibility criteria from across the USA were identified a priori through a disease registry, and all outcome data are collected remotely. The primary outcome (medication adherence) is evaluated using electronic medication event-monitoring, plasma drug levels, patient questionnaires and pill counts. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include (1) lupus disease activity measured by a remote SLE Disease Activity Index examination and the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire; and (2) hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Recruitment of the initial target of 20 participants was achieved within 10 days. Due to initial recruitment success, enrolment was increased to 26 participants. Additional participants who were interested were placed on a waiting list in case of dropouts during the study. DISCUSSION AND DISSEMINATION: Direct-to-family trials offer several advantages but present unique challenges. Lessons learnt from the protocol development, design, and implementation of this trial will inform future direct-to-family trials for children and adults with rheumatic diseases. Additionally, the data collected remotely in this trial will provide critical information regarding the accuracy of teleresearch in lupus, the impact of adherence to hydroxychloroquine on disease activity and a pharmacokinetic analysis to inform paediatric-specific dosing of hydroxychloroquine.

We use the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, as a case to show the use of social media as a key mechanism in shaping the actions of the central government in its coordination with the local governments during the pandemic response. The Chinese government effectively collaborated with a social media platform to not only create a dedicated channel to allow citizens to post information about the pandemic to accelerate the speed of relief but also mobilize citizens and nonprofit organizations to support government response and recovery efforts. This suggests that social media can provide a venue for the government to not only tackle the information overload but also mitigate the friction among levels of governments.","Li, Yiran; Chandra, Yanto; Kapucu, Naim",Am.

In this work, we investigated the impact of the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the urban skyglow of Berlin, Germany. We compared night sky brightness and correlated color temperature (CCT) measurements obtained with all-sky cameras during the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 with data from March 2017. Under normal conditions, we expected an increase in night sky brightness (or skyglow, respectively) and CCT because of the transition to LED. This is supported by a measured CCT shift to slightly higher values and a time series analysis of night-time light satellite data showing an increase in artificial light emission in Berlin. However, contrary to this observation, we measured a decrease in artificial skyglow at zenith by 20% at the city center and by more than 50% at 58 km distance from the center during the lockdown. We assume that the main cause for the reduction of artificial skyglow originates from improved air quality due to less air and road traffic, which is supported by statistical data and satellite image analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported impact of COVID-19 on artificial skyglow and we conclude that air pollution should shift more into the focus of light pollution research.","Jechow, A.; Holker, F.",Remote Sensing,609,24

Under CVI, during periods where the medical system is under capacity, volunteers from low-risk groups would be intentionally infected after giving informed consent, and then quarantined until they have developed immunity. Proponents claim that this could have benefits for society, such as building herd immunity and ensuring that critical workers won't be incapacitated during the peak of the infection. They also claim that this could have benefits for individuals, such as being safely exempted from lockdown measures and (for individuals who are likely to be infected anyway) ensuring that the infection happens under relatively less dangerous conditions. Some respond that CVI would unethical. Here, I argue that, while CVI may or may not be ill-advised for empirical reasons, there are no in-principle ethical objections to it (i.e., if CVI would work as well as its proponents think, it would be ethical to implement it). I present three arguments for this conclusion. The first is an argument from informed consent: informed consent to relevantly similar medical procedures renders performing these procedures permissible, so informed consent to CVI would render it permissible. The second is an argument from reasonable beneficence: it draws on recent work by Caspar Hare on relevantly similar choices to argue that CVI is permissible. The third is an argument from precedent: smallpox variolation was permissible, and CVI is relevantly similar to that, so CVI is permissible.","Crummett, Dustin",Bioethics,609,16

COVID-19 cases were defined as confirmed or highly suspicious according to the World Health Organization criteria. The impact of medications on COVID-19 development was evaluated. RESULTS: The study population included 2050 adults with chronic inflammatory arthritis receiving glucocorticoids, conventional-synthetic (cs), or targeted-synthetic/biological (ts/b) disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs). Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and highly suspicious infection were recorded in 1.1% and 1.4% of the population, respectively. Treatment with glucocorticoids was independently associated with increased risk of COVID-19 (adjusted OR [95% CI] ranging from 1.23 [1.04-1.44] to 3.20 [1.97-5.18] depending on the definition used). Conversely, patients treated with ts/bDMARDs were at reduced risk (adjusted OR ranging from 0.46 [0.18-1.21] to 0.47 [0.46-0.48]). No independent effects of csDMARDs, age, sex, and comorbidities were observed. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, treatment with immunomodulatory medications appears safe. Conversely, glucocorticoids, even at low-dose, may confer increased risk of infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered.

The protein domain-receptor interactions permit P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) to evade elimination in the spleen by adhering to the microvasculature in various organs including the placenta. The sequences for the main components of the fractions, determined by tandem mass spectrometry, yielded four T-superfamily conotoxins, one (CC-Loop-CC) with I-IV, II-III connectivity and three (CC-Loop-CXaaC) with a I-III, II-IV connectivity. The 3D structure for one of the latter, NuxVA = GCCPAPLTCHCVIY, revealed a novel scaffold defined by double turns forming a hairpin-like structure stabilized by the two disulfide bonds. Two other main fraction components were a miniM conotoxin, and a O2-superfamily conotoxin with cysteine framework VI/VII. This study is the first one of its kind suggesting the use of conotoxins for developing pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Among the 850+ species of cone snail species there are hundreds of thousands of diverse venom exopeptides that have been selected throughout several million years of evolution to capture prey and deter predators. They do so by targeting several surface proteins present in target excitable cells. This immense biomolecular library of conopeptides can be explored for potential use as therapeutic leads against persistent and emerging diseases affecting non-excitable systems. We aim to expand the pharmacological reach of conotoxins/conopeptides by revealing their in vitro capacity to disrupt protein-protein and protein-polysaccharide interactions that directly contribute to pathology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This is significant for severe forms of malaria, which might be deadly even after treated with current parasite-killing drugs because of persistent cytoadhesion of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes even when parasites within red blood cells are dead. Anti-adhesion adjunct drugs would de-sequester or prevent additional sequestration of infected erythrocytes and may significantly improve survival of malaria patients. These results provide a lead for further investigations into conotoxins and other venom peptides as potential candidates for anti-adhesion or blockade-therapies. This study is the first of its kind and it suggests that conotoxins can be developed as pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as potential inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment.","Padilla, Alberto; Dovell, Sanaz; Chesnokov, Olga; Hoggard, Mickelene; Oleinikov, Andrew V; Marí, Frank",J Proteomics,609,29

These were run by Foundation Trainees in psychiatry with supervision and oversight from a senior psychiatrist. This study aims to review current literature on remote teaching as a learning resource and will evaluate the effectiveness of clinical simulation as an alternative to patient contact, with the focus being on improving students’ confidence as well as developing clinical interview skills.MethodFeedback surveys were developed, focussing on confidence undertaking difficult aspects of psychiatric interviews, and distributed amongst two cohorts of medical students at the University of Sheffield. One cohort completed their face-to-face psychiatry placement in full pre-COVID, the other undertook placements consisting of virtual simulation sessions alongside reduced patient contact. Responses were collected online over 6 weeks between February and March 2021. As two medical students who completed face-to-face psychiatry placement prior to the pandemic, we have additionally submitted personal reflections as a comparator to current student experiences.ResultA total of 8 students in the clinical simulation cohort, and a total of 13 students from the face-to-face teaching cohort completed the questionnaire. 62.5% of students that responded were female and the remaining percentage identified as male. Students in the face-to-face cohort reported being more confident in 6 out of 7 aspects of our feedback surveys determining confidence undertaking clinical interview skills in comparison to the virtual simulation cohort. Students attended varying numbers of simulation sessions and ultimately the main restrictions and barriers to the simulation teaching reported by students are the time constraints during the sessions, and unstable internet connection.ConclusionOverall confidence levels in medical students are undoubtedly higher in students that completed full face-to-face placements in comparison to those with combined teaching. Based on student responses and review of current literature, clinical simulation appears to serve as a useful adjunct to students with reduced face-to-face contact in psychiatry, particularly for increasing confidence when interviewing more challenging patients. Immediate facilitator feedback and exposure to more difficult patient scenarios seem to be the most beneficial aspects. We would not advocate it as an exclusive form of teaching for medical students, but it may be a useful resource post-pandemic for providing students with extra learning opportunities, specifically targeted at developing confidence and skills in more difficult situations which will hopefully benefit them in their later careers.","Mitchell, Philippa Varnish Ella Das Arthita",BJPsych Open,609,20

Objective: To estimate frequency of and reasons for reported forgone medical care from March to mid-July 2020 and examine characteristics of US adults who reported forgoing care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data from the second wave of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey, fielded from July 7 to July 22, 2020. Respondents included a national sample of 1337 individuals aged 18 years or older in the US who were part of National Opinion Research Center's AmeriSpeak Panel. Exposures: The initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, defined as from March to mid-July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were missed doses of prescription medications; forgone preventive and other general medical care, mental health care, and elective surgeries; forgone care for new severe health issues; and reasons for forgoing care. Results: Of 1468 individuals who completed wave 1 of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey (70.4% completion rate), 1337 completed wave 2 (91.1% completion rate). The sample of respondents included 691 (52%) women, 840 non-Hispanic White individuals (63%), 160 non-Hispanic Black individuals (12%), and 223 Hispanic individuals (17%). The mean (SE) age of respondents was 48 (0.78) years. A total of 544 respondents (41%) forwent medical care from March through mid-July 2020. Among 1055 individuals (79%) who reported needing care, 544 (52%) reported forgoing care for any reason, 307 (29%) forwent care owing to fear of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, and 75 (7%) forwent care owing to financial concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who were unemployed, compared with those who were employed, forwent care more often (121 of 186 respondents [65%] vs 251 of 503 respondents [50%]; P = .01) and were more likely to attribute forgone care to fear of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (78 of 186 respondents [42%] vs 120 of 503 respondents [24%]; P = .002) and financial concerns (36 of 186 respondents [20%] vs 28 of 503 respondents [6%]; P = .001). Respondents lacking health insurance were more likely to attribute forgone care to financial concerns than respondents with Medicare or commercial coverage (19 of 88 respondents [22%] vs 32 of 768 respondents [4%]; P < .001). Frequency of and reasons for forgone care differed in some instances by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and health status. Conclusions and Relevance: This survey study found a high frequency of forgone care among US adults from March to mid-July 2020. Policies to improve health care affordability and to reassure individuals that they can safely seek care may be necessary with surging COVID-19 case rates.","Anderson, Kelly E; McGinty, Emma E; Presskreischer, Rachel; Barry, Colleen L",JAMA Netw Open,609,1

Virologic factors may also be important in determining clinical outcome and transmission rates, but limited patient-level data is available. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study at seven public hospitals in Singapore. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and compared between individuals infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. Firth's logistic regression was used to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 clade and development of hypoxia, and quasi-Poisson regression to compare transmission rates. Plasma samples were tested for immune mediator levels and the kinetics of viral replication in cell culture were compared. FINDINGS: 319 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had clinical and virologic data available for analysis. 29 (9%) were infected with clade S, 90 (28%) with clade L/V, 96 (30%) with clade G (containing D614G variant), and 104 (33%) with other clades 'O' were assigned to lineage B.6. After adjusting for age and other covariates, infections with clade S (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0·030 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0·0002-0·29)) or clade O (B·6) (aOR 0·26 (95% CI 0·064-0·93)) were associated with lower odds of developing hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen compared with clade L/V. Patients infected with clade L/V had more pronounced systemic inflammation with higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. No significant difference in the severity of clade G infections was observed (aOR 0·95 (95% CI: 0·35-2·52). Though viral loads were significantly higher, there was no evidence of increased transmissibility of clade G, and replicative fitness in cell culture was similar for all clades. INTERPRETATION: Infection with clades L/V was associated with increased severity and more systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Infection with clade G was not associated with changes in severity, and despite higher viral loads there was no evidence of increased transmissibility.","Young, Barnaby E; Wei, Wycliffe E; Fong, Siew-Wai; Mak, Tze-Minn; Anderson, Danielle E; Chan, Yi-Hao; Pung, Rachael; Heng, Cheryl Sy; Ang, Li Wei; Zheng, Adrian Kang Eng; Lee, Bernett; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Pada, Surinder; Tambyah, Paul A; Parthasarathy, Purnima; Tan, Seow Yen; Sun, Louisa; Smith, Gavin Jd; Lin, Raymond Tzer Pin; Leo, Yee-Sin; Renia, Laurent; Wang, Lin-Fa; Ng, Lisa Fp; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Lye, David Chien; Lee, Vernon J",EBioMedicine,609,20

Therefore, our present study aimed to (i) assess the prevalence of burnout and levels of job satisfaction among physicians in Jordan, and (ii) explore physicians' opinions, experiences, and perceptions during the pandemic crisis. METHODS: This was a mixed-method study that utilized a structured web-based questionnaire and semi-structured individual interviews. The 10-Item Burnout Measure-Short version (BMS), and the 5-Item Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS) were adopted to assess occupational burnout and job satisfaction, respectively. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, based on a conceptual framework that was developed from Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation and Job Demands-Resources Model. Descriptive statistics and regression models, as well as inductive thematic analysis, were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 973 survey responses and 11 interviews were included in our analysis. The prevalence of burnout among physicians was (57.7%). Several significant factors were positively associated with burnout, including female gender, working at highly loaded hospitals, working for long hours, doing night shifts, lack of sufficient access to personal protective equipment, and being positively tested for SARS-CoV-2. Regarding job satisfaction, regression analysis revealed that age was positively associated with higher levels of job satisfaction. On contrary, being a general practitioner or specialist, working at highly loaded hospitals, low salaries, and suffering from burnout have predicted lower levels of job satisfaction. Besides, four themes have emerged from the thematic analysis: (i) Work-induced psychological distress during the pandemic, (ii) Decision-driven satisfactory and dissatisfactory experiences, (iii) Impact of the pandemic on doctor-patient communication and professional skills, and (iv) Economic impacts of the pandemic crisis and lockdown. CONCLUSION: A significant physical and psychological burden was associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Reliable efforts should be implemented aiming at protecting physicians' physical and mental wellbeing, enhancing their working conditions, and raising awareness about burnout. Evidence-based decisions and proper utilization of financial and human resources at institutional and national levels are believed to be crucial for the sustainability of the health workforce, especially in crises.","Alrawashdeh, Hamzeh Mohammad; Al-Tammemi, Ala039; a, B; Alzawahreh, Mohammad Kh; Al-Tamimi, Ashraf; Elkholy, Mohamed; Al Sarireh, Fawaz; Abusamak, Mohammad; Elehamer, Nafisa M K; Malkawi, Ahmad; Al-Dolat, Wedad; Abu-Ismail, Luai; Al-Far, Ali; Ghoul, Imene",BMC Public Health,609,12

Quarantine has huge impact and can cause considerable psychological stress. The study aims to identify psychological stress, emotional changes, approach to studies, resilience skills related to the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of university students. A sample of university students from the Campus Bio Medico University of Rome was studied. The participants responded to an online questionnaire packet that included socio-demographic information, COVID-19 impact on emotions and on university life, perceived stress (PSS-10) and resilience skills (RS-14). We received 955 responses. The respondents experienced an increase in perceived stress in 89.4% of cases (66% stress moderate and 23.4% high). Moreover, 54.4% of students reported decrease in attention span and difficulty in studying with consequent concern about the exam outcomes (55%). Resilience skills positively affect stressful events and in particular the COVID-19 impact on study and interpersonal relationships. The study shows a psychological impact of the Covid-19 emergency on college students. Stress significantly decreases learning and negatively affects psychological well-being of students. Resilience skills were a protective factor to overcome difficulties learning.","Quintiliani, Livia; Sisto, Antonella; Vicinanza, Flavia; Curcio, Giuseppe; Tambone, Vittoradolfo",Psychol Health Med,609,20

Convalescent plasma may offer treatment, but efficacy and safety are not established. Measuring seroprevalence in donors would inform public health policy. Here, we survey blood services around the world to assess the different research programmes related to COVID-19 planned or in progress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood collection services were surveyed in June 2020 to determine whether they were participating in serosurveys or convalescent plasma collection and clinical trials. RESULTS: A total of 48 countries (77% of those contacted) responded. Seroprevalence studies are planned or in progress in 73% of countries surveyed and in all continents, including low- and middle-income countries. Most aimed to inform public health policy. Convalescent plasma programmes have been initiated around the globe (79% of surveyed), about three quarters as clinical trials in high-, middle- and low-income countries. CONCLUSION: Blood services around the world have drawn upon their operational capacity to provide much-needed seroprevalence data to inform public health. They have rapidly implemented preparation of potential treatment when few treatments are available and mostly as clinical trials. At the same time, they must continue to provide blood products for recipients despite challenges of working in a state of emergency. It is important to track and coordinate research efforts across jurisdictions to gain a composite evidence-based view that will influence future practice and preparative strategies.","O039,; Brien, Sheila F; Lieshout-Krikke, Ryanne W; Lewin, Antoine; Erikstrup, Christian; Steele, Whitney R; Uzicanin, Samra; Custer, Brian",Vox sang,609,16

Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and other pathogens. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase a smaller fraction of cases' contacts can be traced, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested and traced can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between increasing cases and delays and the pathogen reproductive number Rt, and the implications for infection dynamics using deterministic and stochastic compartmental models of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Rt increased sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because Rt initially increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing Rt (but minimizing total infections may be more complicated). Contact tracing efficacy decreased sharply with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, testing and tracing reductions in Rt can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also highlight the synergistic value of high capacity, easy access testing and rapid turn-around of testing results, and outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic cases to be tested immediately after symptom onset.","Gardner, Billy J; Kilpatrick, A Marm",PLoS Comput Biol,609,16

This prospective follow-up cohort study included 94 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a medical ward at the Montichiari Hospital, Brescia, Italy from February 28th to April 30th, 2020. Patients had COVID-19 related pneumonia with respiratory failure. Ninety-four patients out of 193 survivors accepted to be re-evaluated after discharge, on average after 4 months. In » of the patients an evidence of pulmonary fibrosis was detected, as indicated by an altered diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO); in 6-7% of patients the alteration was classified as of moderate/severe degree. We also evaluated quality of life thorough a structured questionnaire: 52% of the patients still lamented fatigue, 36% effort dyspnea, 10% anorexia, 14% dysgeusia or anosmia, 31% insomnia and 21% anxiety. Finally, we evaluated three prognostic indices (the Brixia radiologic score, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the 4C mortality score) in terms of prediction of the clinical consequences of the disease. All of them significantly predicted the extent of short-term lung involvement. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia is associated to relevant short-term clinical consequences, both in terms of persistence of symptoms and in terms of impairment of DLCO (indicator of a possible development of pulmonary fibrosis); some severity indices of the disease may predict short-term clinical outcome. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether such manifestations may persist long-term.","Boari, Gianluca E M; Bonetti, Silvia; Braglia-Orlandini, Federico; Chiarini, Giulia; Faustini, Cristina; Bianco, Gianluca; Santagiuliana, Marzia; Guarinoni, Vittoria; Saottini, Michele; Viola, Sara; Ferrari-Toninelli, Giulia; Pasini, Giancarlo; Bonzi, Bianca; Desenzani, Paolo; Tusi, Claudia; Malerba, Paolo; Zanotti, Eros; Turini, Daniele; Rizzoni, Damiano",High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,609,7

However, patients with coarse information of the exposure date, as well as infections other than the symptomatic, were not taken into account in previously published studies. Thus, by using the statistical method dealing with the interval-censored data, we assessed the quarantine duration for both common and uncommon infections. The latter type includes the presymptomatic, the asymptomatic and the recurrent test positive patients. METHODS: As of 10 December 2020, information on cases have been collected from the English and Chinese databases, including Pubmed, Google scholar, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang. Official websites and medias were also searched as data sources. All data were transformed into doubly interval-censored and the accelerated failure time model was applied. By estimating the incubation period and the time-to-event distribution of worldwide COVID-19 patients, we obtain the large percentiles for determining and suggesting the quarantine policies. For symptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the incubation time is the duration from exposure to symptom onset. For the asymptomatic, we substitute the date of first positive result of nucleic acid testing for that of symptom onset. Furthermore, the time from hospital discharge or getting negative test result to the positive recurrence has been calculated for recurrent positive patients. RESULTS: A total of 1920 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were included. Among all uncommon infections, 34.1% (n = 55) of them developed symptoms or were identified beyond fourteen days. Based on all collected cases, the 95th and 99th percentiles were estimated to be 16.2 days (95% CI 15.5-17.0) and 22.9 days (21.7â24.3) respectively. Besides, we got similar estimates based on merely symptomatic and presymptomatic infections as 15.1 days (14.4â15.7) and 21.1 days (20.0â22.2). CONCLUSIONS: There are a certain number of infected people who require longer quarantine duration. Our findings well support the current practice of the extended active monitoring. To further prevent possible transmissions induced and facilitated by such infectious outliers after the 14-days quarantine, properly prolonging the quarantine duration could be prudent for high-risk scenarios and in regions with insufficient test resources.","Li, Zhi-Yao; Zhang, Yu; Peng, Liu-Qing; Gao, Rong-Rong; Jing, Jia-Rui; Wang, Jia-Le; Ren, Bin-Zhi; Xu, Jian-Guo; Wang, Tong",Infect Dis Poverty,609,3

There is substantial concern that the use of existing ICU triage protocols to allocate scarce ventilators and critical care resources-most of which are designed to save as many lives as possible-may compound these inequities. As governments and health systems revisit their triage guidelines in the context of impending resource shortages, scholars have advocated a range of alternative allocation strategies, including the use of a random lottery to give all patients in need an equal chance of ICU treatment. However, both the save-the-most-lives approach and random allocation are seriously flawed. In this Perspective, we argue that ICU triage policies should simultaneously promote population health outcomes and mitigate health inequities. These ethical goals are sometimes in conflict, which will require balancing the goals of maximizing the number of lives saved and distributing health benefits equitably across society. We recommend three strategies to mitigate health inequities during ICU triage: introducing a correction factor into patients' triage scores to reduce the impact of baseline structural inequities; giving heightened priority to individuals in essential, high-risk occupations; and rejecting use of longer-term life expectancy and categorical exclusions as allocation criteria. We present a practical triage framework that incorporates these strategies and attends to the twin public health goals of promoting population health and social justice.","White, Douglas B; Lo, Bernard",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,609,16

The pandemic pushed the teaching of anatomy, histology and embryology out of the classroom and labs, across states, countries, and continents. It demanded an immense effort and adaptability, especially from faculty. Teaching through the thick of the pandemic has been the challenge of a lifetime to instructors, doctors, educators. We are living through what may be the most difficult time in the history of global healthcare. The pandemic threw us off our paths and demanded more than training, more than skills. It demanded our passion and our courage. Our willingness to lean into our values and embrace our purpose: the success of our students. All the rules were changed as we navigated uncharted territories together. It was a call to courage and the Team of World Changers at Mount Sinai showed up, bravely, with all their passion, their curiosity to ask questions, try new modalities, and look for solutions out of their comfort zones. Mentors and experienced professors supported the system with humbleness and unparalleled openness, leaning into the vulnerable place of learning an entirely new set of skills in record time. The pandemic demanded resilience: that willingness to try again and again, with patience, flexibility and persistence. Structures is the first course of our medical school, encompassing Anatomy, Histology, and Embryology. It is traditionally a hands-on course which was moved to a 100% remote system in a matter of 3 months. We stripped ourselves from our identities and our voices, and went searching for something entirely new, yet authentic, still ours. Our bodies ached and our minds were drained at the end of working days of 12, 14, sometimes 24 hours, weekdays and weekends, as we strived to be the air under our student's wings. Zoom became our classroom, our lab, our meeting room, our offices, our everywhere;we acquired and repurposed resources, created new visualizations, developed new materials, expanded the team, reinvented ourselves, defied our boundaries as educators, and reached out farther than ever before. We accelerated the technological fluency of our teaching force and we dealt with questions of equality of learning, e.g. students in different time zones, disparity of internet speed, quality of hardware, not to mention the inherent isolation of the distance learning modality. And we succeeded. We got to teach and inspire our students. We got to learn and be inspired by them. We got to see them being curious and daring, discovering new ways to learn, and finding their own paths as they progressed in Structures, and in their career. We were rewarded with priceless joy and fulfillment. As we peak into the future, we see a world of possibilities and potential, coupling hands-on work and remote technology in the world of Anatomical Sciences and Medical Education. We know we can reach out our arms farther than ever before and spread knowledge at an even larger scale, prioritizing the quality of learning, and embracing our community anywhere in the world. At the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we believe that ?impossible? is a temporary concept, and we pride ourselves of having the most passionate and compassionate thinkers and doers in our teams. This was a turbulent year, but it made us stronger and today we hope and work for a 2021 of healing and progress.","Curcio, Daniella",The FASEB Journal,609,1

Physician trainees and the education system that serves them adapted quickly so that trainees could finish the academic year on time and advance to the next phase of training without compromising clinical competency or public safety. Systemic changes have had the most significant impact on telemedicine training, virtual learning, secure testing, and the interview process for residency and fellowship training positions. Trainees are now getting regular, supervised practice experience with telemedicine. Some secure testing is being done remotely, without jeopardizing examination test items or trainee assessment. Attending physicians are experimenting with novel ways to engage learners with video for virtual rounds to keep the rounding team safe. Finally, the interview process for medical school, residency, and fellowship programs, which has traditionally been an expensive and travel-laden process, has been made completely virtual for the first time ever. These changes have disadvantages, including a lack of social connection, potential distraction when learning remotely, and limited contact with a potential training program when interviewing by video. This perspective paper, written by a senior internal medicine resident, details his firsthand experience with these changes during the pandemic. It also looks forward to how the current changes will likely change medical education permanently and for the better.","Savage, David J",,609,20

Informal home care, care provided by non-healthcare professionals, increases the community's healthcare capacity during pandemics. There is, however, limited research about the characteristics of informal home care providers and the challenges they face during such public health emergencies. DESIGN: A random, cross-sectional, population-based, RDD, telephone survey study was conducted to examine patterns of home care, characteristics of informal home care providers and the challenges experienced by these care providers during this pandemic. SETTING: Data were collected from 22 March to 1 April 2020 in Hong Kong, China. PARTICIPANTS: A population representative study sample of Chinese-speaking adults (n=765) was interviewed. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The study examined the characteristics of informal home care providers and self-reported health requirements of those who needed care. The study also examined providers' self-perceived knowledge to provide routine home care as well as COVID-19 risk reduction care. Respondents were asked of their mental health status related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 25.1% of 765 provided informal home care during the studied COVID-19 pandemic period. Among the informal home care providers, 18.4% of respondents took leave from school/work during the epidemic to provide care for the sick, fragile elderly and small children. Care providers tended to be younger aged, female and housewives. Approximately half of care providers reported additional mental strain and 37.2% reported of challenges in daily living during epidemic. Although most informal home care providers felt competent to provide routine care, 49.5% felt inadequately prepared to cope with the additional health risks of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During public health emergencies, heavy reliance on informal home healthcare providers necessitates better understanding of their specific needs and increased government services to support informal home care.","Chan, Emily Yy; Lo, Eugene Sk; Huang, Zhe; Kim, Jean H; Hung, Heidi; Hung, Kevin Kc; Wong, Eliza Ly; Wong, Samuel Ys; Gobat, Nina",BMJ Open,609,13

Although stress resulting from social isolation may increase cancer progression, its interference on tumorigenesis is poorly known. In this study, we used a preclinical model to evaluate the effects of social isolation stress on chemically induced oral carcinogenesis. Sixty-two 21-day-old male Wistar rats were divided into isolated and grouped groups. After 90 days of age, the rats from both groups underwent oral carcinogenesis with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) for 20 weeks. All rats were assessed for depressive-like behavior and euthanized for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) diagnosis and measurement of inflammatory mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Social isolation stress increased the OSCC occurrence by 20.4% when compared to control. Isolated rats also showed higher tumor volume and cachexia than the grouped rats. Social isolation did not induce changes in the depressive-like behavior after carcinogenic induction. Tumors from stressed rats had increased levels of the inflammatory mediators, TNF-alpha, IL1-beta and MCP-1. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 were significantly increased in the large tumors from isolated animals. Higher tumor levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL1-beta and MCP-1 were positively correlated with OSCC growth. This study provides the first evidence that social isolation stress may facilitate OSCC occurrence and tumor progression, an event accompanied by increased local levels of inflammatory mediators.","Verza, Flávia Alves; Valente, Vitor Bonetti; Oliveira, Lia Kobayashi; Kayahara, Giseli Mitsuy; Crivelini, Marcelo Macedo; Furuse, Cristiane; Biasoli, Éder Ricardo; Miyahara, Glauco Issamu; Oliveira, Sandra Helena Penha; Bernabé, Daniel Galera",PLoS One,609,13

Such restrictions have altered physical activity (PA) habits. This study aimed to evaluate longitudinal trends in PA in a self-selected UK-based sample and the key predictors of these trends. MethodsFrom 23 April 2020 to 30 January 2021, an online survey collected detailed measures of PA engagement in a sample of 1,947 UK-based adults. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) were fitted to explore trends in PA engagement over time, and how sociodemographic, health, lifestyle and contextual factors impacted participants attainment of Word Health Organisation (WHO) recommended levels of PA (constituting muscle strengthening activity (MSA), and moderate or vigorous PA (MVPA)). ResultsAttainment of WHO recommended levels of total PA showed a decline. While one in five achieved the recommended levels of total PA in the first UK lockdown in April-June 2020 (19.5%, 95%, CI 17.8-21.3%) and a similar proportion in June-July 2020 (17.7%, 95%CI 16.1-19.5%), this reduced significantly during the period of eased restrictions in August-September 2020 (15.2%, 95%CI 13.7-16.9%) and the second UK lockdown in November 2020-January 2021 (14.1%, 95%CI 12.6-15.9%). The same trends were observed for MSA and MVPA individually. Better quality of life, higher socioeconomic position and higher pre-COVID-19 PA levels were associated with meeting WHO recommended PA levels, while having overweight or obesity, a limiting chronic health condition, or being in strict isolation showed the inverse associations. Time-specific associations with MSA or MVPA were observed for gender, age, ethnicity, and other health behaviours. ConclusionAmong a self-selected sample of UK-based adults, there were reductions in PA levels throughout the first UK lockdown without reversal during the ensuing period. Based on observed associations of reduced PA with socioeconomic and health-related indices, such changes may point towards deepening health inequities during the pandemic.","Mitchell, John J; Dicken, Samuel James; Kale, Dimitra; Herbec, Aleksandra; Beard, Emma; Shahab, Lion",,609,24

This study analyzed clinical and biochemical parameters between mild and severe patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early. METHODS: In this single center, cross-sectional study, 143 patients were included and divided to mild/moderate and sever/critical groups. Correlation between the disease criticality and clinical features and peripheral blood biochemical markers was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve.

Therefore, this study aims to adapt the Fear of COVID-19 Scale into Turkish and investigate the relationships between fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. Data were collected by convenience sampling method, which allowed us to reach total 1304 participants, aged between 18 and 64 years, from 75 cities in Turkey. In the adaptation process of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, convergent validity, and reliability (Cronbach's &#945;, McDonald's &#969;, Guttmann's &#955;6, and composite reliability) analyses were performed. Additionally, the mediating role of psychological distress on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction was tested. The uni-dimensionality of the 7-item scale was confirmed on a Turkish sample. Item Response Theory revealed that all items were coherent and fit with the model. The results indicated that the Turkish version of the scale had satisfactory reliability coefficients. The fear of COVID-19 was found to be associated with psychological distress and life satisfaction. Results indicated that the Turkish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale had strong psychometric properties. This scale will allow mental health professionals to do research on the psychological impacts of COVID-19 in Turkey.","Satici, Begum; Gocet-Tekin, Emine; Deniz, M Engin; Satici, Seydi Ahmet",Int J Ment Health Addict,609,13

Webinars, increased informal resident and faculty sessions, and live-narrated video tours are potential solutions. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of these elements in virtually showcasing a residency program during the virtual interview season. DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective applicants to one general surgery residency program (Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota) were invited to attend six webinars: Program Overview, Simulation Education, Diversity, Resident Life, Mingle with Residents, and Last-Minute Q&A. An anonymous survey was sent to all registered participants of the webinars. Interviewees participated in a preinterview social hour with resident and faculty and a live-narrated video tour of our facilities during their interview. A second anonymous survey was sent to all interviewees. PARTICIPANTS: Webinars - 33% of 159 unique registrants surveyed participated. Interviews - 46% of 109 interviewees surveyed participated. RESULTS: Average satisfaction with the webinars was 9.4/10. Overall, 98% of attendees felt that the webinars gave them a ""feel"" for the program. Attendees found the Last-Minute Q&A webinar and Program Overview to be most useful. For resident-led webinars, 100% of attendees felt that themed break-out rooms were effective. Average satisfaction with the interviews was 4.4/5. Interviewees rated access to faculty and residents highly (4.4/5 and 4.5/5, respectively). 98% of interviewees found the live-narrated video tour helpful. CONCLUSIONS: A webinar curriculum can be effective in virtual residency recruitment, as prospective applicants developed a good understanding of the resident program after participating. Further, live-narrated video tours and purposefully incorporating several avenues for informal conversations with residents and faculty can successfully address applicant concerns about virtual interviews.","Lund, Sarah; MacArthur, Taleen; Keune, Jonie; Enger, Teresa; Martinez-Jorge, Jorys; McKenzie, Travis; Nelson, Megan; Olson, Angela; Que, Florencia; Stulak, John; Rivera, Mariela",J. surg. educ,609,16

The rapid genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains has become a helpful tool for better understanding the genomic characteristics and origin of the virus. To obtain virus whole-genome sequences directly from clinical specimens, we performed nanopore sequencing using a modified ARTIC protocol in a portable nanopore sequencer and validated a routine 8-h workflow and a 5-h rapid pipeline. We conducted some optimization to improve the genome sequencing workflow. The sensitivity of the workflow was also tested by serially diluting RNA from clinical samples. The optimized pipeline was finally applied to obtain the whole genomes of 29 clinical specimens collected in Hangzhou from January to March 2020. In the 29 obtained complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2, 33 variations were identified and analyzed. The genomic variations and phylogenetic analysis hinted at multiple sources and different transmission patterns during the COVID-19 epidemic in Hangzhou, China.

Out of 842,197 tests, 11.7% were positive and 88.3% negative. The prevalence of HIV was 6.25 and 6.31% in the SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative cohort, respectively (p = 0.444). However, the prevalence of HIV-positive individuals in the critical cohort (9.15%) was higher than in the noncritical group (6.24%) (p = 0.011). Active tuberculosis infection was approximately 50% less in SARS-CoV-2-positive than in SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. The prevalence of uncontrolled diabetes was 3.4 times higher in SARS-CoV-2-positive cases but was not higher in the critical vs. noncritical cases (p = 0.612). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, coagulation markers, urea, and cardiac- and liver-related analytes were significantly elevated in the critical compared to noncritical cases. Platelet count and creatinine concentration did not differ significantly between the two groups. These findings do not support increased prevalence of HIV or tuberculosis in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection but do suggest an association of increased disease severity with HIV-positive status. Uncontrolled diabetes was positively associated with a significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and our investigation into analyte changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 disease severity supported previous findings of raised inflammatory markers, coagulation markers, liver- and cardiac-related analytes, and urea but not for creatinine and platelet count.","Hesse, R; van der Westhuizen, D J; George, J A",Adv Exp Med Biol,609,15

Its purported mode of action is as an immune modulator. Vitamin D, however, also affects the metabolism of phosphate and Mg, which may well play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 may induce a cytokine storm that drains ATP whose regeneration requires phosphate and Mg. These minerals, however, are often deficient in conditions that predispose people to severe COVID-19, including older age (especially males), diabetes, obesity, and usage of diuretics. Symptoms observed in severe COVID-19 also fit well with those seen in classical hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, such as thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, dysfunction of liver and kidneys, neurologic disturbances, immunodeficiency, failure of heart and lungs, delayed weaning from a respirator, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, and, finally, multiorgan failure. Deficiencies of phosphate and Mg can be amplified by kidney problems commonly observed in patients with COVID-19 resulting in their wastage into urine. Available data show that phosphate and Mg are deficient in COVID-19, with phosphate showing a remarkable correlation with its severity. In one experiment, patients with COVID-19 were supplemented with a cocktail of vitamin D3, Mg, and vitamin B12, with very encouraging results. We, thus, argue that patients with COVID-19 should be monitored and treated for phosphate and Mg deficiencies, ideally already in the early phases of infection. Supplementation of phosphate and Mg combined with vitamin D could also be implemented as a preventative strategy in populations at risk.","van Kempen, Theo A T G; Deixler, Elisabeth",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,609,20

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Sixty-nine eyes of 69 patients with successfully reattached macula-off RRD were retrospectively analyzed. Six radial spectral-domain optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images were used to evaluate the effects of the ICCs on detached macula and to measure the angle of the retina at the macula as a parameter to evaluate the anterior protrusion of the detached retina. The findings were compared to other parameters. RESULTS: The mean angle of the retina at the macula was 143.1 ± 15.9° with a range of 108 to 172°. Preoperatively, 51 eyes (74%) had ICCs in the inner nuclear layer and/or the outer plexiform layer and Henle fiber layer complex, but none was present after surgery. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that the angle of the retina was significantly associated with the presence of ICCs (ß = -0.637, P<0.001) and the height of subretinal fluid (ß = -0.256, P = 0.005). Eyes with ICCs had poorer preoperative vision (P<0.001), narrower angle of the retina (P<0.001), and thicker subretinal fluid (P<0.001) than eyes without cavities. CONCLUSIONS: The anterior protrusion in eyes with macula-off RRD is associated with the presence of ICCs. The presence of ICCs can affect preoperative function and morphology but does not affect postoperative function and morphology.","Iwase, Takeshi; Tomita, Ryo; Ra, Eimei; Iwase, Chie; Terasaki, Hiroko",Jpn. j. ophthalmol,609,22

On 15 March 2020, the South African president declared a national state of disaster under the Disaster Management Act of 2002. On 26 March 2020, national lockdown, which included measures stipulated in guidelines for education in emergencies, was implemented in South Africa. The presidential declaration and subsequent lockdown came at a time when some of the universities in South Africa were already struggling either to commence the academic year, or to make up for time lost due to persistent student protests relating to several student demands. However, disaster management now entailed that all schools and institutions of higher education were forced to close immediately for extended periods, necessitating alternative ways of ensuring access to education. The qualitative case study presented in this article sought to document the intervention strategies developed by two universities located in remote parts of Eastern Cape Province to deliver education during the COVID-19 restrictions. A second aim was an examination of the challenges experienced by the two institutions' largely rural student population. The authors collected data using a questionnaire completed by 15 educators and 30 students from the two universities. They also analysed official communications documents from the universities addressed to lecturers and students. The results indicate that access to online teaching and learning platforms and resources for students from poor rural communities in South Africa is challenging, and that there are gross inequalities in educational outcomes for learners from different socio-economic backgrounds. This affects the future plans of higher education institutions to provide teaching and learning through online-based platforms.

In collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team in Kenya, we aimed to establish the first evidence-based guidelines for the management of routine procedure-related neonatal pain that consider low-resource hospital settings. METHODS: We did a systematic review by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases for studies published from Jan 1, 1953, to March 31, 2019. We included data from randomised controlled trials using heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score, neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) score, neonatal facial coding system score, and douleur aiguë du nouveau-né scale score as pain outcome measures. We excluded studies in which neonates were undergoing circumcision or were intubated, studies from which data were unextractable, or when pain was scored by non-trained individuals. We did a narrative synthesis of all studies, and meta-analysis when data were available from multiple studies comparing the same analgesics and controls and using the same outcome measures. 17 Kenyan health-care professionals formed our clinical guideline development panel, and we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and the panel's knowledge of the local health-care context to guide the guideline development process.

We found a moderate level of certainty for the superiority for expressed breastmilk over placebo or no intervention (SMDs were -0·46 [95% CI -0·87 to -0·05] in heart rate and 0·48 [0·20 to 0·75] in SpO2). Therefore, the panel recommended that breastfeeding should be given as first-line analgesic treatment, initiated at least 2 min pre-procedure. Given contextual factors, for neonates who are unable to breastfeed, 1-2 mL of expressed breastmilk should be given as first-line analgesic, or 1-2 mL of oral sugar (&#8805;10% concentration) as second-line analgesic. The panel also recommended parental presence during procedures with adjunctive provision of skin-to-skin care, or non-nutritive sucking when possible. INTERPRETATION: We have generated Kenya's first neonatal analgesic guidelines for routine procedures, which have been adopted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health, and have shown a framework for clinical guideline development that is applicable to other low-income and middle-income health-care settings.

They crawl at the bottom of freshwater and brackish environments with the help of filose pseudopodia. These protists have drawn the attention of the scientific community because of two photosynthetic bodies, called chromatophores, that fill up their cells permitting fully photoautotrophic existence. Paulinella chromatophores, similarly to primary plastids of the Archaeplastida supergroup (including glaucophytes, red algae as well as green algae and land plants), evolved from free-living cyanobacteria in the process of endosymbiosis. Interestingly, these both cyanobacterial acquisitions occurred independently, thereby undermining the paradigm of the rarity of endosymbiotic events. Chromatophores were derived from &#945;-cyanobacteria relatively recently 60-140 million years ago, whereas primary plastids originated from ß-cyanobacteria more than 1.5 billion years ago. Since their acquisition, chromatophore genomes have undergone substantial reduction but not to the extent of primary plastid genomes. Consequently, they have also developed mechanisms for transport of metabolites and nuclear-encoded proteins along with appropriate targeting signals. Therefore, chromatophores of Paulinella photosynthetic species, similarly to primary plastids, are true cellular organelles. They not only show that endosymbiotic events might not be so rare but also make a perfect model for studying the process of organellogenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the current knowledge and retrace the fascinating adventure of Paulinella species on their way to become photoautotrophic organisms.","Gagat, Przemyslaw; Sidorczuk, Katarzyna; Pietluch, Filip; Mackiewicz, Pawel",Results Probl Cell Differ,609,1

The reports of the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients vary widely. In this study, we report our unique experience with AKI in COVID-19 patients in a low socioeconomic and predominantly ethnic minority group and provide its incidence, risk factors, and prognosis to expand the current understanding of this complication. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, we analyzed the data of 469 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, from March 18 through April 23, 2020. Information regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory data, and outcomes was collected from the electronic medical records. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (interquartile range [IQR] 25-75; range 19-101 years), and 268 (57.14%) patients were male. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Equation was low (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in 207 (44.1%) patients. During hospitalization, 128 (27.3%) patients developed AKI, and the incidence was significantly higher in those patients presenting with a low eGFR (N = 81, 39.1%; p < 0.001). Male sex, hypertension, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, hemodynamic instability, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and admission elevated ferritin, creatinine kinase, brain natriuretic peptide, and troponin 1 were identified as the risk factors for in-hospital AKI. Ninety-seven (28.45%) patients died in the non-AKI group versus 91 (71.1%) in the AKI group (p < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, hemodynamic status, and PF ratio (arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2]/fractional inspired oxygen [FiO2]) determined that on admission, an elevated blood urea nitrogen (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.48), a low eGFR (HR 1.43; CI 1.1-2.03), AKI stage 1 (HR 1.14; CI 0.64-2.03), AKI stage 2 (HR 1.86; CI 1.03-3.56), and AKI stage 3 (HR 2.1; CI 1.3-2.81) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) did not improve survival in stage III AKI. CONCLUSION: AKI in our hospitalized COVID-19 patients was common and carried a high mortality, especially in patients with AKI stage 3. RRT did not improve survival. Policy changes and planning for this high incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients and its associated high mortality are necessary at the local and national levels.","Zahid, Umar; Ramachandran, Preethi; Spitalewitz, Samuel; Alasadi, Lutfi; Chakraborti, Abhishek; Azhar, Muhammad; Mikhalina, Galina; Sherazi, Andleeb; Narh, Joshua Tetteh; Khattar, Pallavi; Bedi, Puneet",Am J Nephrol,609,24

In response to governmental policy changes, many hospitals and private practices in Massachusetts canceled or postponed nonurgent office visits and elective surgeries. The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the provision and practice trends of otolaryngology services for 10 private practices in Massachusetts. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Multipractice study for community practices in Massachusetts. METHODS: Electronic billing records from 10 private otolaryngology practices in Massachusetts were obtained for the first 4 months of 2019 and 2020. Questionnaires from these otolaryngology practices were collected to assess financial and staffing impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: The local onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant decrease of 63% of visits in comparison to equivalent weeks in 2019. Virtual visits overtook in-person visits over time. A greater decline in operating room (OR) procedures than for office procedures was recorded. Ninety percent of practices reduced working hours, and 80% furloughed personnel. Seventy percent of practices applied for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a multifaceted impact on private otolaryngology practices in Massachusetts. A significant decline in provision of otolaryngology services aligned with the Massachusetts government's public health policy changes. The combination of limited personnel and personal protective equipment, as well as suspension of nonessential office visits and surgeries, led to decrease in total office visits and even higher decrease in OR procedures.","Fan, Timothy; Workman, Alan D; Miller, Lauren E; Sakats, Mallory Mason; Rajasekaran, Karthik; Brant, Jason A; Parasher, Arjun K; Huckins, David; Aliphas, Avner; Glicksman, Robin; Eskander, Antoine; Glicksman, Jordan T",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,609,16

Hence, this study assessed the prevalence of mental health symptoms as well as emotional reactions among sub-Saharan Africans (SSAs) and associated factors among SSAs during the COVID-19 lockdown period. This was a web-based cross-sectional study on mental health and emotional features from 2005 respondents in seven SSA countries. This study was conducted between 17 April and 17 May 2020 corresponding to the lockdown period in most SSA countries. Respondents aged 18 years and above and the self-reported symptoms were feeling anxious, being worried, angry, bored and frustrated. These were the main outcomes and were treated as dichotomous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with these symptoms. We found that over half (52.2%) of the participants reported any of the mental health symptoms and the prevalence of feeling bored was 70.5% followed by feeling anxious (59.1%), being worried (57.5%), frustrated (51.5%) and angry (22.3%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate analysis revealed that males, those aged >28 years, those who lived in Central and Southern Africa, those who were not married, the unemployed, those living with more than six persons in a household, had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Similarly, people who perceived low risk of contracting the infection, and those who thought the pandemic would not continue after the lockdown had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Health care workers had lower odds for feeling angry than non-healthcare workers. During the COVID-19 lockdown periods in SSA, about one in two participants reported mental health and emotional symptoms. Public health measures can be effectively used to identify target groups for prevention and treatment of mental health and emotional symptoms. Such interventions should be an integral component of SSA governments' response and recovery strategies of any future pandemic.","Langsi, Raymond; Osuagwu, Uchechukwu L; Goson, Piwuna Christopher; Abu, Emmanuel Kwasi; Mashige, Khathutshelo P; Ekpenyong, Bernadine; Ovenseri-Ogbomo, Godwin O; Chikasirimobi G, Timothy; Miner, Chundung Asabe; Ishaya, Tanko; Oloruntoba, Richard; Nwaeze, Obinna; Charwe, Deborah Donald; Agho, Kingsley Emwinyore",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),609,16

Temperature, followed by matrix type, most greatly influenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA first-order decay rates (k). The average T90 (time required for 1-log10 reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA ranged from 8.04 to 27.8 days in untreated wastewater, 5.71 to 43.2 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 9.40 to 58.6 days in tap water. The average T90 for RNA of MHV at 4 to 37 °C ranged from 7.44 to 56.6 days in untreated wastewater, 5.58-43.1 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 10.9 to 43.9 days in tap water. There was no statistically significant difference between RNA decay of SARS-CoV-2 and MHV; thus, MHV is suggested as a suitable persistence surrogate. Decay rate constants for all temperatures were comparable across all matrices for both viral RNAs, except in untreated wastewater for SARS-CoV-2, which showed less sensitivity to elevated temperatures. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for WBE application.","Ahmed, Warish; Bertsch, Paul M; Bibby, Kyle; Haramoto, Eiji; Hewitt, Joanne; Huygens, Flavia; Gyawali, Pradip; Korajkic, Asja; Riddell, Shane; Sherchan, Samendra P; Simpson, Stuart L; Sirikanchana, Kwanrawee; Symonds, Erin M; Verhagen, Rory; Vasan, Seshadri S; Kitajima, Masaaki; Bivins, Aaron",Environ Res,609,21

Despite the progress made in the development of the vaccine, there is an urge need for the discovery of antivirals that may better work at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction. The main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial therapeutic target due to its critical function in virus replication. The &#945;-ketoamide derivatives represent an important class of inhibitors against the Mpro of the SARS-CoV. While there is 99% sequence similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases, anti-SARS-CoV compounds may have a huge demonstration's prospect of their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we applied various computational approaches to investigate the inhibition potency of novel designed &#945;-ketoamide-based compounds. In this regard, a set of 21 &#945;-ketoamides was employed to construct a QSAR model, using the genetic algorithm-multiple linear regression (GA-MLR), as well as a pharmacophore fit model. Based on the GA-MLR model, 713 new designed molecules were reduced to 150 promising hits, which were later subject to the established pharmacophore fit model. Among the 150 compounds, the best selected compounds (3 hits) with greater pharmacophore fit score were further studied via molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations along with the Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analysis.

The impact of the similarities and differences in testing methods and certification criteria on FFR and mask performance for protecting healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 are discussed, as well as the value of a new standard in the EU for testing fabrics for masks used by the public. Health and safety personnel in healthcare settings must understand the differences between standards so that they can select respirators and masks that provide appropriate protection for healthcare workers.","Jones, Rachael M; Rempel, David",Ann.

METHODS: Four databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest, and Web of Science Core Collections) were searched in April 2020 using keywords relating to SARS-CoV, physical function, fitness, and exercise. Observational studies or randomized controlled trials were included if they involved people following SARS-CoV infection and either assessed the change or recovery in physical function/fitness or evaluated the effects exercise postinfection. RESULTS: A total 10 articles were included in this review. Evidence from 9 articles demonstrated that SARS-CoV patients had reduced levels of physical function and fitness postinfection compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, patients demonstrated incomplete recovery of physical function, with some experiencing residual impairments 1 to 2 years postinfection. Evidence from 1 randomized controlled trial found that a combined aerobic and resistance training intervention significantly improved physical function and fitness postinfection compared with a control group. CONCLUSIONS: Physical function and fitness are impaired following SARS-CoV infection, and impairments may persist up to 1 to 2 years postinfection. Researchers and clinicians can use these findings to understand the potential impairments and rehabilitation needs of people recovering from the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. While 1 study demonstrated that exercise can improve physical function and fitness postinfection, further research is required to determine the effectiveness of exercise in people recovering from similar infections (eg, COVID-19). IMPACT: Considering the similarities in pathology and clinical presentation of SARS-CoV and COVID-19, it is likely that COVID-19 patients will present with similar impairments to physical function. Accordingly, research is required to measure the extent of functional impairments in COVID-19 cohorts. In addition, research should evaluate whether rehabilitation interventions such as exercise can promote postinfection recovery.","Rooney, Scott; Webster, Amy; Paul, Lorna",Phys Ther,609,21

We therefore conducted an analysis to assess if there has been a reduction in new haematological malignancy diagnoses within the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (BHSCT). Methods: We observed a significant decline in diagnostic tests used in the diagnosis of haematological malignancies. We therefore decided to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the volume of tests performed to see if this impacted the number of new cases of haematological malignancies diagnosed. To ascertain the number of new diagnoses referred to Clinical Haematology we decided to analyse the number of new diagnoses discussed at the local Multidisciplinary Team Meetings (MDM) between March and June 2020 and compare this with the same period in 2019. In line with NICE guidelines2 there has been no change to the referral pathway for patients with new haematological malignancy. Results: Results show that there is no significant difference between the number of new malignant haematological diagnoses discussed during March to June 2020 and the same period in 2019. This confirms that the number of new diagnoses remains the same within the two time periods. Conclusion: This analysis highlights that despite a reduction in primary and secondary care diagnostic blood tests, there is no difference in the number of new cases of haematological malignancies discussed at Haematology MDM throughout the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic locally.","Waddell, D.; Benson, G.",Ulster Medical Journal,609,1

SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than two million deaths after one year of the pandemic. The world is experiencing a deep economic recession. Safe and effective vaccines are needed to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Vaccine candidates against COVID-19 have been developed at an unprecedented speed, with more than 200 vaccine candidates currently under investigation. Among those, 20 candidates have entered the clinical Phase 3 to evaluate efficacy, and three have been approved by the European Medicines Agency. The aim of immunization is to act against infection, disease and/or transmission. However, the measurement of vaccine efficacy is challenging, as efficacy trials need to include large cohorts with verum and placebo cohorts. In the future, this will be even more challenging as further vaccine candidates will receive approval, an increasing number of humans will receive vaccinations and incidence might decrease. To evaluate novel and second-generation vaccine candidates, randomized placebo-controlled trials might not be appropriate anymore. Correlates of protection (CoP) could be an important tool to evaluate novel vaccine candidates, but vaccine-induced CoP have not been clearly defined for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this review, we report on immunogenicity against natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine-induced immune responses and discuss immunological markers that can be linked to protection. By discussing the immunogenicity and efficacy of forerunner vaccines, we aim to give a comprehensive overview of possible efficacy measures and CoP.","Koch, Till; Mellinghoff, Sibylle C; Shamsrizi, Parichehr; Addo, Marylyn M; Dahlke, Christine",,609,16

Later, it became one of the first approved protein drugs using heterologous protein expression systems, which allowed its large-scale production. It has been approved, and widely used in a pleiotropy of diseases, including multiple-sclerosis, hepatitis B and C, and some forms of cancer. Preliminary clinical data has supported its effectiveness against potential pandemic pathogens such as Ebola and SARS. Still, more efficient and specific drugs have taken its place in treating such diseases. The COVID-19 global pandemic has again lifted the status of IFN-Is to become one of the more promising drug candidates, with initial clinical trials showing promising results in reducing the severity and duration of the disease. Although SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the production of IFNß and thus obstructs the innate immune response to this virus, it is sensitive to the antiviral activity of externally administrated IFN-Is. In this review I discuss the diverse modes of biological actions of IFN-Is and how these are related to biophysical parameters of IFN-I-receptor interaction and cell-type specificity in light of the large variety of binding affinities of the different IFN-I subtypes towards the common interferon receptor. Furthermore, I discuss how these may guide the optimized use IFN-Is in combatting COVID-19.","Schreiber, Gideon",Front Immunol,609,24

RECENT FINDINGS: Preoperative IVIg is not needed to prevent myasthenic crisis in stable myasthenia gravis patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia, based on controlled data. Rituximab, if initiated early in new-onset myasthenia gravis, can lead to faster and more sustained remission even without immunotherapies in 35% of patients at 2 years. Biomarkers determining the timing for follow-up infusions in Rituximab-responding AChR-positive patients are discussed. Most patients with MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis treated with Rituximab have sustained long-term remission with persistent reduction of IgG4 anti-MuSK antibodies. Eculizumb in the extension REGAIN study showed sustained long-term pharmacological remissions and reduced exacerbations. Three new biologic agents showed promising results in phase-II controlled myasthenia gravis trials: Zilucoplan, a subcutaneous macrocyclic peptide inhibiting complement C5; Efgartigimod, an IgG1-derived Fc fragment binding to neonatal FcRn receptor; and Rozanolixizumab, a high-affinity anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody.

One of the main challenges the managers have to face is the elaboration and implementation of the budgets. During 2020, companies worldwide had to continuously adjust the budgets which were already approved before the pandemic. But, as everyone understood that the world is not facing just a temporary situation, executive leaders had to also reconsider their budgeting process, taking into consideration the uncertainties of the future. It was clear that the traditional way of developing a budget, based on historical information, was no longer relevant and a new process should be implemented. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put into discussion which would be the best alternative to the traditional budgeting process. Based on the thorough analysis of the reports published by relevant organisms and firms, the authors concluded that the best alternative would be the zero-based budgeting technique. The paper presents the benefits of this method, but also a guideline regarding the implementation of this process.","Brînduşe, Anca-Ioana PhD Student Bunget Ovidiu Constantin PhD",Audit Financiar,609,17

Here we tested the neutralizing activity of infected and/or vaccinated individuals against pseudoviruses expressing the spike of the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (WH1), the D614G mutant and the B.1.1.7 variant. Our data show that parameters of natural infection (time from infection and nature of the infecting variant) determined cross-neutralization. Uninfected vaccinees showed a small reduction in neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant compared to both the WH1 strain and the D614G mutant. Interestingly, upon vaccination, previously infected individuals developed more robust neutralizing responses against B.1.1.7, suggesting that vaccines can boost the neutralization breadth conferred by natural infection.","Trinité, Benjamin; Pradenas, Edwards; Marfil, Silvia; Rovirosa, Carla; Urrea, Víctor; Tarrés-Freixas, Ferran; Ortiz, Raquel; Rodon, Jordi; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Segalés, Joaquim; Guallar, Victor; Lepore, Rosalba; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Trujillo, Glòria; Trapé, Jaume; González-Fernández, Carolina; Flor, Antonia; Pérez-Vidal, Rafel; Toledo, Ruth; Chamorro, Anna; Paredes, Roger; Blanco, Ignacio; Grau, Eulàlia; Massanella, Marta; Carrillo, Jorge; Clotet, Bonaventura; Blanco, Julià",Viruses,609,16

In several recent studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been demonstrated to be the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as it was previously well known as the receptor of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 can bind with high affinity to human ACE2 and engages it as an entry receptor. It seems that the genetic, notably epigenetic variations of ACE2 are less known in different populations, indicating the need for its further investigation. These variations have the potential to affect its contribution to the pathogenicity of COVID-19. The contribution of epigenetics in the interindividual variability of ACE2 merits more attention because epigenetic processes can play important roles in ACE2 alterations in various tissues and different people and populations. Analyzing different DNA methylation patterns and microRNAs, contributing to the ACE2 modulation in the lungs will have a high priority. The epigenetic and genetic variations of ACE2 become even more important when considering that some people have mild clinical symptoms despite having COVID-19. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex; therefore, a better understanding of the underlying pathobiology, especially binding the virus to its receptors, could help improve therapeutic and preventive approaches. This review aims to highlight the importance of evaluating both the epigenetic and genetic variations of ACE2 as a receptor for the deadly SARS-CoV-2.","Kianmehr, Anvarsadat; Faraoni, Isabella; Kucuk, Omer; Mahrooz, Abdolkarim",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,609,22

The primary BOECs had a fast growth phase (between days 4 and 5) and were validated by their slight ß-galactosidase and visible cytokerat in 18 expression. In addition, RT-PCR results demonstrated that the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), Na+/H+exchanger 1 (NHE1), and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) were expressed in the isolated primary BOECs. In conclusion, this primary BOEC isolation and culture model is a promising method for the study of nutrient absorption and regulation, as well as the immune regulation of epithelial cell transport in vitro.","Hu, Zixuan; Zhan, Kang; Yang, Tianyu; Zhao, Guoqi; Lin, Miao","In vitr. cel. dev. biol., Anim",609,25

METHODS: We therefore conducted this multicentre retrospective study and collected data of middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities at admission from three designated hospitals in China. RESULTS: Among 119 middle-aged patients without comorbidities, 18 (15.1%) developed into severe illness and 5 (3.9%) died in hospital. ARDS (26, 21.8%) and elevated D-dimer (36, 31.3%) were the most common complications, while other organ complications were relatively rare. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe illness associated with neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, OR, 11.238; 95% CI 1.110-1.382; p < 0.001) and D-dimer greater than 1 µg/ml (OR, 16.079; 95% CI 3.162-81.775; p = 0.001) on admission. The AUCs for the NLR, D-dimer greater than 1 µg/ml and combined NLR and D-dimer index were 0.862 (95% CI, 0.751-0.973), 0.800 (95% CI 0.684-0.915) and 0.916 (95% CI, 0.855-0.977), respectively. SOFA yielded an AUC of 0.750 (95% CI 0.602-0.987). There was significant difference in the AUC between SOFA and combined index (z = 2.574, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to the monitoring and early treatment of respiratory and coagulation abnormalities in middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities. In addition, the combined NLR and D-dimer higher than 1 µg/ml index might be a potential and reliable predictor for the incidence of severe illness in this specific patient with COVID-19, which could guide clinicians on early classification and management of patients, thereby relieving the shortage of medical resource. However, it is warranted to validate the reliability of the predictor in larger sample COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Peng; Sha, Jing; Meng, Mei; Wang, Cuiyan; Yao, Qingchun; Zhang, Zhongfa; Sun, Wenqing; Wang, Xingguang; Qie, Guoqiang; Bai, Xue; Liu, Keke; Chu, Yufeng",J Transl Med,609,2

Hyperinflammation and high levels of several cytokines, for example, IL-6, are observed in severe COVID-19 cases. However, little is known about the cellular origin of these cytokines. Here, we investigated whether circulating leukocytes from patients with COVID-19 had spontaneous cytokine production. Patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (n = 6) and sepsis (n = 3) were included at Skåne University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy controls were also recruited (n = 5). Cytokines were measured in COVID-19 and sepsis patients using an Immulite immunoassay system. PBMCs were cultured with brefeldin A to allow cytokine accumulation. In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL-6 and measurable levels of IL-8 and TNF, but not IL-1ß, were observed in COVID-19 patients. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients had spontaneous production of IL-1ß and IL-8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL-6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID-19 patients produced more IL-1ß than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL-1ß and IL-8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL-1ß blockade in treatment of COVID-19. However, the source of the high levels of IL-6 remains to be determined.","Kahn, Robin; Schmidt, Tobias; Golestani, Karan; Mossberg, Anki; Gullstrand, Birgitta; Bengtsson, Anders A; Kahn, Fredrik",J. leukoc. biol,609,1

Why some individuals seem particularly vulnerable to severe cytokine storms is still unknown. Primary immunodeficiency (PID)-related genes are inherited factors that dysregulate host inflammatory responses to infection, especially hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-related genes, established as contributors to the development of excessive cytokine storms. We analyzed the association between PID gene variants with severe cytokine storms in COVID-19. We conducted whole-exome sequencing in 233 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and identified four PID gene (UNC13D, AP3B1, RNF168, DHX58) variants were significantly enriched in COVID-19 patients experiencing severe cytokine storms. The total percentage of COVID-19 patients with variants in UNC13D or AP3B1, two typical HLH genes, was dramatically higher in high-level cytokine group than in low-level group (33.3 vs. 5.7%, P < 0.001).

Up until now, there are no corresponding data for university policlinics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With the help of the data of the clinic's electronic medical record system (IS-H/i.s.h.med from SAP, Cerner Corporation, North Kansas City, MO, United States of America and SAP SE, Walldorf, Germany) and the time recording and management software TimeElement (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany), which was codeveloped at our clinic, all patient contacts of the COVID-19 shutdown were evaluated over a period of approximately 7 weeks from 18 March 2020 to 8 May 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019. In addition, quarterly revenues for the first and second quarters of 2019 and 2020 were put into perspective via SAP. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period the total number of patient contacts was reduced by 59.5% compared to the previous year. The number of lockdown period cases decreased by 74.8% compared to the same period in 2019. In particular, the university outpatient/self-paying sector recorded the largest number of lost patient contacts with a reduction to 17.2% of the 2019 baseline. The reduced patient contacts and case numbers resulted in a significant financial loss of at least â¯218,000. Via TimeElement there was a 69.4% decrease in all special diagnostic services, with visual field examinations in particular also reduced by 75.3%. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements recorded a decrease of 60.3%. Patient tracking revealed a reduction of average patient attendance times by approximately 23% (COVID 19: 145.8â¯± 88.8â¯min versus 189.6â¯± 97.2â¯min in 2019). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 shutdown caused the work performance of our policlinic to drop to only about 40% of patient contacts and that of functional diagnostic examinations to only about 30%, compared to the performance in 2019; however, the reduction in the number of patients also led to a significant reduction in the time patients were present at the clinic compared to the regular workload. The associated financial losses are considerable and obviously not compensated by legally regulated compensation payments as in the inpatient sector.","Framme, C; Gottschling, J; Buley, P; Rohwer-Mensching, K; Junker, B; Dittberner, M; Volkmann, I",Ophthalmologe,609,24

It is often assumed that geospatial datasets are accurate and complete. Furthermore, GIS datasets regularly lack metadata on the temporal specificity. Data is usually provided 'as is', and therefore may be unsuitable for retrospective or longitudinal studies of health outcomes. In this paper we outline a practical approach to both fill gaps in geospatial datasets, and to test their temporal validity. This approach is applied to both district council and open-source datasets in the Taranaki region of Aotearoa New Zealand. METHODS: We used the 'streetview' python script to download historic Google Street View (GSV) images taken between 2012 and 2016 across specific locations in the Taranaki region. Images were reviewed and relevant features were incorporated into GIS datasets. RESULTS: A total of 5166 coordinates with environmental features missing from council datasets were identified. The temporal validity of 402 (49%) environmental features was able to be confirmed from council dataset considered to be 'complete'. A total of 664 (55%) food outlets were identified and temporally validated. CONCLUSIONS: Our research indicates that geospatial datasets are not always complete or temporally valid. We have outlined an approach to test the sensitivity and specificity of GIS datasets using GSV images. A substantial number of features were identified, highlighting the limitations of many GIS datasets.","Whitehead, Jesse; Smith, Melody; Anderson, Yvonne; Zhang, Yijun; Wu, Stephanie; Maharaj, Shreya; Donnellan, Niamh",Int J Health Geogr,609,13

Little is known about the protective factors of this infection, which is equally distributed between genders and different ages while severe and poor prognosis cases are strongly associated to old males and the presence of comorbidities. Thus, preventive measures aiming at reducing the number of infection and/or their severity are strongly needed. Vitamin D has got great attention and has been claimed as potentially protective against the infection since it may be associated with immunocompetence, inflammation, aging, and those diseases involved in determining the outcomes of COVID-19. This narrative review aims at collecting the literature available on the involvement of the vitamin D status in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the putative utility of vitamin D supplementation in the therapeutics. It emerges that a poor vitamin D status seems to associate with an increased risk of infection whereas age, gender and comorbidities seem to play a more important role in COVID-19 severity and mortality. While randomized control trials are needed to better inquire into this topic, vitamin D supplementation may be useful beside its potential effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.","Ferrari, Davide; Locatelli, Massimo; Briguglio, Matteo; Lombardi, Giovanni",Cell Biochem Funct,609,16

Dromedary camels are the only known reservoir of the virus until now. They shed the virus in their body secretions thus potentiate a risk for human infection. MERS-CoV tropism and replication is mainly affected by the presence of certain receptor ligands on the target tissues. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is believed to act as receptors for MERS-CoV. The main objective of this study was to determine the expression levels of the DPP-4 in various organs of some naturally infected camels. We conducted a surveillance study to identify some positive MERS-CoV infected camels. Three positive animals identified by the Real time PCR. Our results are clearly showing the high level of expression of the DPP-4 in various organs of these animals' particularly nasal turbinate, trachea, and lungs. The expression level may explain at least in part the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in these organs. These findings confirm the pivotal roles of the DPP4 in the context of the MER-CoV infection in dromedary camels.

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies investigating the association between vitamin D levels and risk of COVID-19 infection and risk of severe disease and mortality among those infected have yielded mixed results. Thus far, the majority of studies investigating the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 have been observational and rely on vitamin D levels obtained at the time of admission, limiting causal inference. Currently, clinical trials assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with COVID-19 infection are extremely limited. Randomized, interventional trials may offer more clarity on the protective effects of vitamin D against COVID-19 infection and outcomes. SUMMARY: Decreased levels of vitamin D may amplify the inflammatory effects of COVID-19 infection, yet, data regarding the mortality benefits of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19-infected individuals are still limited. Current observational data provides the impetus for future studies to including randomized controlled trials to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19-infected individuals with kidney disease can improve mortality outcomes.","Szeto, Betsy; Fan, Lena; Nickolas, Thomas L",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,609,16

This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t)>1 to R(t)<1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March 2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction number at R(t)<1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t)>1. Thus, it may be wise to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.","Dandekar, Raj; Barbastathis, George",,609,0

One adaption of new ways of working are coworking spaces. They are shared working environments that offer office space and intangible resources, such as knowledge sharing, collaboration and networking. Access to flexible office space for self-employed, start-ups, and corporates is a key resource for businesses. Covid-19 has shown that space provision is becoming more flexible and ventures increasingly use scalable space instead of long-term lease agreements for office space or than owning it. Deskmag counts 18,700 coworking spaces worldwide in the year of 2018 with 1.65 million coworkers and high future growth expectations after COVID-19 [1]. Data were collected through two sources. Data about coworking spaces were collected through a web scraper crawling for coworking spaces within a city as of December 31, 2018. Those data were manually enriched by real estate and economic variables, such as the office high prime rent and office market size. Data about the funding and founding of ventures were obtained through using the database Crunchbase, including all start-ups in a city with their type of funding (including: seed, venture capital, private equity, debt convertibles and others) and their financing rounds. The Crunchbase database lists mostly young firms, commonly called start-ups and small medium enterprises (SME), and their financing with external funding. It includes firms that have needed or might need funding in the near future, or have already got funding. Hence, it is possible to relate spatial clusters with entrepreneurial activity and analyze for example the influence of (flexible) office markets on founding activity. This dataset enables researchers and practitioners to further explore important questions regarding the nexus between the real estate industry, entrepreneurship behavior, start-ups and regional clusters. Due to the scarcity of publicly available quality flexible office space market data, the dataset detailed in this article may play a relevant role to be ready to be used by researchers and practitioners.

Methods: Consecutive subjects aged &#8805;12 years old who were screened for COVID-19 were included in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 23 to February 3, 2020, and the subjects were further divided into the inception cohort and the validation cohort. The gender, age, onset time of disease of the subjects were recorded. The information of epidemiological history, fever, and the declined blood lymphocytes were collected as clinical indicators, CT scan was used to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current Chinese national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya pathway was constructed with multi-indexes, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and Chinese national standards, their effectiveness of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the inception and validation cohort. Results: A total of 382 consecutive adults who was screened for COVID-19 were included, and 261 cases were in the inception cohort and 121 cases were in the validation cohort. Among the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased peripheral blood lymphocytes, 114 cases (29.8%) with positive CT findings, 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive virus nucleic acid by throat swab. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and declined blood lymphocyte count (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this pathway and the pathway recommended by the Health Commission of China were both high (all were 1.000), while the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya pathway were higher than the one recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64), with difference rate of 51.6%, and the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31). In validation cohort, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya pathway was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9%(10/13). Conclusions: The Xiangya pathway can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19, and can be applied as a reliable strategy to screen patients with suspected COVID-19 among people aged &#8805;12 years in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19.

Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. Depending on the time from the outbreak, strategies have ranged from minimal intervention to mitigation by quarantine for high-risk groups (elderly with chronic illnesses) to containment and lockdown. Adherence to such restrictions have depended on the individual and national psyche and culture. One can understand and forgive governments for being over-cautious, but not for being ill-prepared. It seems that Singapore after SARS (2003) and South Korea after MERS (2015) learnt from their experiences and have fared relatively well with minimal disruption to daily routines. Coping with the challenge of COVID-19 is an urgent global task. We use the Sociotype ecological framework to analyze different coping responses at three levels: Context (government and leadership, social context, health services, and media); Relationships; and the Individual. We describe the many negative outcomes (e.g. mortality [obviously], unemployment, economic damage, threat to democracy, claustrophobia) and the positive ones (e.g. new, remote teaching, working, and medical routines; social bonding and solidarity; redefining existential values and priorities) of this surreal situation, which is still evolving. We highlight the importance of humor in stress reduction. Regular and reliable communication to the public has to be improved, acknowledging incomplete data, and learning to deal with fake news, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. Excess mortality is the preferred statistic to follow and compare outcomes. When the health risks are over, the economic recovery responses will vary according to the financial state of countries. If world order is to be reshaped, then a massive economic aid plan should be launched by the rich countries-akin to the Marshall plan after the Second World War. It should be led preferably by the USA and China. The results of the tradeoffs between health and economic lockdowns will only become apparent in the months to come.

This study aimed to understand individual decisions to practice different social distancing measures in the immediate emergence of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Utilizing social media advertising and snowball sampling, a web-based survey was administered in 16 Latin American countries. METHODS: We estimated seemingly unrelated Probit models to identify factors associated with the decision to implement social distancing practices. RESULTS: From 5,480 respondents, estimated marginal effects indicate that risk perceptions are positively related to distancing from friends or relatives and avoiding public places but do not seem to influence the decision to stay home. Results also indicate that risk perceptions are related to household income, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the country, and perceived preparedness of the health care system. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the notion that people will follow social distancing measures if there is a clear understanding of risk. Providing the public ways to access accurate numbers of confirmed cases can inform perception of disease severity. Since household income was a determinant of practicing social distancing, without financial assistance, some will be forced to break regulations in order to procure food or resources for their survival.","Alicea-Planas, Jessica; Trudeau, Jennifer M; Vásquez Mazariegos, William F",Hisp Health Care Int,609,26

This analysis included assessments of week-24 and week-52 disease activity, week-52 radiographic progression, and the relationship between baseline characteristics and week 52 clinical outcomes with clinically relevant radiographic progression (CRRP) at week 52.Results: At week 52, there were no significant differences between 25 and 10 mg etanercept in terms of achieving low disease activity or remission. CRRP was observed in 36% and 32% patients in the 10 and 25 mg groups, respectively. Predictor analysis suggested that worse background disease status, treatment with methotrexate rather than etanercept, and poorer clinical outcomes at week 52 were associated with CRRP.Conclusions: The 25 mg BIW etanercept dosage does not appear to be significantly more efficacious than 10 mg in Japanese patients with RA. Further studies evaluating the optimal etanercept dosing regimen in this patient population may be merited.NCT: NCT00445770.","Takeuchi, Tsutomu; Miyasaka, Nobuyuki; Pedersen, Ron D; Sugiyama, Noriko; Hirose, Tomohiro",Mod Rheumatol,609,33

FCM not only allows the identification of cell subpopulations by detecting the expression of molecules in the cell membrane or cytoplasm, but it can also quantify and identify soluble molecules. The proper functioning of the FCM requires six fundamental systems, from those related to the transport of events to the systems dedicated to the analysis of information. In this review, we have identified the main considerations that every FCM user must know for an optimal antibody panel design, the quality systems that must govern the FCM protocols to guarantee reproducible results in research or clinical laboratories. Finally, we have introduced the current evidence that highlights the relevance of FCM in the investigation and clinical diagnosis of respiratory diseases, establishing important advances in the basic and clinical study of diseases as old as Tuberculosis along with the recent proposals for the monitoring and classification of patients infected with the new SARS-CoV2 virus.","Flores-Gonzalez, Julio; Cancino-Díaz, Juan Carlos; Chavez-Galan, Leslie",Int. j. mol. sci.

Visual examination of the world map shows a wide variation of death tolls between countries. The main goal of our series is to determine the best predictors of such discrepancy. Methods: This is a retrospective study in which the rate of COVID-19 deaths was correlated with each of the following independent variables: total tests per 1 million population, gross domestic product (GDP), average temperatures per country, ultraviolet index, median age, average BMI per country, food supply, Bacille Calmette-Guerin compulsory status, and passenger traffic. Results: BMI per country proved to be the second best predictor of death rate with an R value of 0.43, and GDP being the best predictor with R = 0.65. Conclusion: This article shows a tight correlation between average BMI, food supply per country, and COVID-19-related deaths. Such predisposing factors might operate by upregulating the inflammation pathway in heavily struck countries, leading to easier triggering of the infamous cytokine storm syndrome.

Respiratory tract infection is a common cause of asthma exacerbation. There has not been evidence suggesting the link between COVID-19 and asthma exacerbation, especially in places with dramatic responses in infection control with universal masking and aggressive social distancing. OBJECTIVE: To assess the number for admissions of asthma exacerbation in January to April 2020 in Hong Kong with reference to admission in past five years. METHODS: Admission records of asthma exacerbation were retrieved from Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. Patients with age at or above 18 years old with known history of asthma admitted for asthma exacerbation were included. Log-linear was used to model count with year and masking used as covariate, with further analysis on ambient temperature, length of hospital stays. Fisher exact test was used to compare the mortality rate and mechanical ventilation between the periods. Admissions for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and gastric ulcer were included as controls. RESULTS: The number of admissions for asthma exacerbation significantly decreased by 53.2% (95%CI 50.4%-55.8%) in 2020 compared with monthly average admission in 2015-2019, with higher magnitude of decrease compared to control diagnoses. Admissions for asthma exacerbation decreased by 2.0% (95%CI 1.8%-2.2%) with every 1â (1.8°F) increase in temperature and by 0.8% with every 1% increase in masking (95%CI 0.8%-0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization number for asthma exacerbation significantly decreased in early 2020 with similar length of stay. This was observed with concomitant practice of universal masking and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. We proposed that universal masking and social distancing reduced respiratory viral infection, leading to less hospital admission with asthma exacerbation.","Chan, King Pui Florence; Kwok, Wang-Chun; Ma, Ting-Fung; Hui, Chun-Him; Tam, Terence Chi-Chun; Wang, Julie Kwan-Ling; Ho, James Chung-Man; Lam, David Chi-Leung; Ip, Mary Sau-Man; Ho, Pak-Leung",Ann.

This article highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic could threaten the actualization of the SDGs in Africa. We assessed relevant published literature, observations, and current global trends. Our results suggest that although the improvement of healthcare systems has become a priority in Africa, there is a need to ensure that some SDGs are not sacrificed to achieve control of the pandemic.

Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. Methods: This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Findings: Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0·450, 95% CI 0·204-0·990, p=0·047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0·900, 0·412-1·966; p=0·79). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0·866, 95% CI 0·482-1·553; p=0·63) or IL-6 inhibition (0·882, 0·452-1·722; p=0·71) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0·990, 95% CI 0·981-0·999; p=0·031) and adverse clinical outcome (0·987, 0·979-0·995; p=0·0021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1·009, 95% CI 1·003-1·014, p=0·0011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·006, 1·001-1·011, p=0·028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1·006, 1·002-1·010, p=0·0031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·005, 1·001-1·010, p=0·016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. Interpretation: IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibition was effective in a subgroup of patients with markedly high C-reactive protein concentrations, whereas both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition were effective in patients with low lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.

We show that in time series data, the future fit tends to be poor unless the data covers the entire range from before to after the inflection point. We discuss the theoretical reasons for this: the growth data provides little information about the damping term (and vice-versa).

After double deprotonation with strong Mg or Ca bases, a series of alkaline earth (Ae) metal catalysts R1-Ae·(THF)n was obtained. Crystal structures of these C2-symmetric catalysts have been analyzed by quadrant models which show that the ligands with C(H)Ph2, dibenzosuberane and 8-quinoline substituents should give the best steric discrimination for the enantioselective intramolecular alkene hydroamination (IAH) of the aminoalkenes H2C[double bond, length as m-dash]CHCH2CR'2CH2NH2 (CR'2 = CPh2, CCy or CMe2). The dianionic R12- ligand in R1-Ae·(THF)n functions as reagent that deprotonates the aminoalkene substrate, while the monoanionic (R1-H)- ligand formed in this reaction functions as a chiral spectator ligand that controls the enantioselectivity of the ring closure reaction. Depending on the substituent R in the BINAM ligand, full cyclization of aminoalkenes to chiral pyrrolidine products as fast as 5 minutes was observed. Product analysis furnished enantioselectivities up to 57% ee, which marks the highest enantioselectivity reported for Ca catalyzed IAH. Higher selectivities are impeded by double protonation of the R12- ligand leading to complete loss of chiral information in the catalytically active species.","Stegner, Philipp C; Eyselein, Jonathan; Ballmann, Gerd M; Langer, Jens; Schmidt, Jochen; Harder, Sjoerd",Dalton trans (2003.

This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone with multiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1 trisaccharide. This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo-ß-d-glucopyranuronate)-(1â3)-ß-d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removed anti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic.","Steinman, Lawrence",J Neurochem,609,24

Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a gold standard in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presently, many single tube multiple gene target RTPCR kits have been developed and are commercially available for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. Aim: To evaluate the performance of seven COVID-19 RT-PCR kits (DiagSure, Meril, VIRALDTECT II, TruPCR, Q-line, Allplex and TaqPath) which are commercially available for COVID-19 RT-PCR diagnosis. Materials and Methods: This observational study was conducted at the State Virology Laboratory (SVL), Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. Seven commercially available kits have been evaluated on the basis of: (i) number of SARS-CoV-2 specific gene target;(ii) human housekeeping genes as internal control;(iii) RT-PCR run time;and (iv) kit performances to correctly detect SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative RNA samples. A total of 50 RNA samples (left over RNA) were included, master mix preparation, template addition and RT-PCR test has been performed according to kits literature. At the end of PCR run, mean and standard deviation of obtained cut-off of all kits were calculated using Microsoft Excel. Results: All seven RT-PCR kits performed satisfactory regarding the reproducibility and they could correctly identify 30 positive and 20 negative RNA samples. RNA samples (group C) having low viral loads with a high Cycle threshold (Ct) value (&gt;30) were also detected by all these seven kits. Obtained Ct values of each group was in parallel range in comparison with the initial testing Ct values. Kits were found to be superior which contains primers and probes for three SARS-CoV-2 specific gene targets, have human housekeeping gene as internal control and taking less time to complete RT-PCR. Conclusion: All seven COVID-19 RT-PCR kits included in this study demonstrated satisfactory performance and can be used for the routine molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 disease.","Jain, R.

This overwhelming phenomenon has not been well defined and has been called ""post-COVID syndrome"" or ""long-COVID"" [1]. There are striking similarities to myalgic encephalomyelitis also called chronic fatigue syndrome linked to a viral and autoimmune pathogenesis. In both disorders neurotransmitter receptor antibodies against ß-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors may play a key role. We found similar elevation of these autoantibodies in both patient groups. Extracorporeal apheresis using a special filter seems to be effective in reducing these antibodies in a significant way clearly improving the debilitating symptoms of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Therefore, such a form of neuropheresis may provide a promising therapeutic option for patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome.

However, the optimal surgical margin is still under debate. Precancerous lesions exist in tumor-adjacent tissues beyond the histological margin. However, potential precancerous epigenetic variation patterns beyond the histological margin of pGGO are yet to be discovered and described. RESULTS: A genome-wide high-resolution DNA methylation analysis was performed on samples collected from 15 pGGO at tumor core (TC), tumor edge (TE), para-tumor tissues at the 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm beyond the tumor, and peripheral normal (PN) tissue. TC and TE were tested with the same genetic alterations, which were also observed in histologically normal tissue at 5 mm in two patients with lower mutation allele frequency. According to the difference of methylation profiles between PN samples, 2284 methylation haplotype blocks (MHBs), 1657 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs), and 713 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Two different patterns of methylation markers were observed: Steep (S) markers sharply changed at 5 mm beyond the histological margin, and Gradual (G) markers changed gradually from TC to PN. S markers composed 86.2% of the tumor-related methylation markers, and G markers composed the other 13.8%. S-marker-associated genes enriched in GO terms that were related to the hallmarks of cancer, and G-markers-associated genes enriched in pathways of stem cell pluripotency and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Significant difference in DNA methylation score was observed between peripheral normal tissue and tumor-adjacent tissues 5 mm further from the histological margin (p < 0.001 in MHB markers). DNA methylation score at and beyond 10 mm from histological margin is not significantly different from peripheral normal tissues (p > 0.05 in all markers). CONCLUSIONS: According to the methylation pattern observed in our study, it was implied that methylation alterations were not significantly different between tissues at or beyond P10 and distal normal tissues. This finding explained for the excellent prognosis from radical resections with surgical margins of more than 15 mm. The inclusion of epigenetic characteristics into surgical margin analysis may yield a more sensitive and accurate assessment of remnant cancerous and precancerous cells in the surgical margins.","Jia, Ziqi; Wang, Yadong; Xue, Jianchao; Yang, Xiaoying; Bing, Zhongxing; Guo, Chao; Gao, Chao; Tian, Zhenhuan; Zhang, Zhenzhen; Kong, Hualei; He, Qiye; Su, Zhixi; Liu, Yiying; Song, Yang; Liang, Dianjing; Liang, Naixin; Li, Shanqing; Gao, Yuan",Clin Epigenetics,609,16

METHODS: We evaluated ordering patterns during cardiovascular telehealth clinic visits in the Duke University Health System between March 15 and June 30, 2020 and 30-day outcomes compared with in-person visits in the same time frame in 2020 and in 2019. RESULTS: Within the Duke University Health System, there was a 33.1% decrease in the number of outpatient cardiovascular visits conducted in the first 15 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the same time period in 2019. As a proportion of total visits initially booked, 53% of visits were cancelled in 2020 compared to 35% in 2019. However, patients with cancelled visits had similar demographics and comorbidities in 2019 and 2020. Telehealth visits comprised 9.3% of total visits initially booked in 2020, with younger and healthier patients utilizing telehealth compared with those utilizing in-person visits. Compared with in-person visits in 2020, telehealth visits were associated with fewer new (31.6% for telehealth vs 44.6% for in person) or refill (12.9% vs 15.6%, respectively) medication prescriptions, electrocardiograms (4.3% vs 31.4%), laboratory orders (5.9% vs 21.8%), echocardiograms (7.3% vs 98%), and stress tests (4.4% vs 6.6%). When adjusted for age, race, and insurance status, those who had a telehealth visit or cancelled their visit were less likely to have an emergency department or hospital encounter within 30 days compared with those who had in-person visits (adjusted rate ratios (aRR) 0.76 [95% 0.65, 0.89] and aRR 0.71 [95% 0.65, 0.78], respectively).

Therefore, we created the International Registry of COVID infection in glomerulonephritis (IRoc-GN) and identified 40 patients with glomerulonephritis and COVID-19 followed in centers in North America and Europe. Detailed information on glomerulonephritis diagnosis, kidney parameters, and baseline immunosuppression prior to infection were recorded, as well as clinical presentation, laboratory values, treatment, complications, and outcomes of COVID-19. This cohort was compared to 80 COVID-positive control cases from the general population without glomerulonephritis matched for the time of infection. The majority (70%) of the patients with glomerulonephritis and all the controls were hospitalized. Patients with glomerulonephritis had significantly higher mortality (15% vs. 5%, respectively) and acute kidney injury (39% vs. 14%) than controls, while the need for kidney replacement therapy was not statistically different between the two groups. Receiving immunosuppression or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors at presentation did not increase the risk of death or acute kidney injury in the glomerulonephritis cohort. In the cohort with glomerulonephritis, lower serum albumin at presentation and shorter duration of glomerular disease were associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury and need for kidney replacement therapy. No differences in outcomes occurred between patients with primary glomerulonephritis versus glomerulonephritis associated with a systemic autoimmune disease (lupus or vasculitis). Thus, due to the higher mortality and risk of acute kidney injury than in the general population without glomerulonephritis, patients with glomerulonephritis and COVID-19 should be carefully monitored, especially when they present with low serum albumin levels.","Waldman, Meryl; Soler, Maria Jose; García-Carro, Clara; Lightstone, Liz; Turner-Stokes, Tabitha; Griffith, Megan; Torras, Joan; Valenzuela, Laura Martinez; Bestard, Oriol; Geddes, Colin; Flossmann, Oliver; Budge, Kelly L; Cantarelli, Chiara; Fiaccadori, Enrico; Delsante, Marco; Morales, Enrique; Gutierrez, Eduardo; Niño-Cruz, Jose A; Martinez-Rueda, Armando J; Comai, Giorgia; Bini, Claudia; La Manna, Gaetano; Slon, Maria F; Manrique, Joaquin; Agraz, Irene; Sinaii, Ninet; Cravedi, Paolo",Kidney Int,609,16

Systematic testing of COVID-19 patients having bacterial co-infections is essential to select the correct antibiotic for treatment in order to reduce mortality and also prevent spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The present study aims to evaluate the prevalence, demographic parameters, antibiotic sensitivity patterns and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infections. MethodsA total of 1019 COVID-19 patients were selected for the study. We analyzed the prevalence, antibiotic sensitivity pattern and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients having bacterial co-infections. ResultsOut of a total 1019 COVID-19 patients screened, 5.2% of patients demonstrated clinical signs of bacterial co-infection. Bacteremia was found in majority of the patients followed by respiratory and urinary infections. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. were most common isolates among the Gram-negative and Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CONS) and Staphylococcus aureus among the Gram-positive bacterial infections. Antibiotic sensitivity profiling revealed that colistin, imipenem and fosfomycin were the most effective drugs against the Gram-negative isolates while vancomycin, teicoplanin and doxycycline against the Gram-positive isolates. Analysis of clinical outcomes revealed that the mortality rate was higher (39%) among the patients with bacterial co-infections as compared to the group without co-infection (17%). ConclusionsThis study reveals that the rate of bacterial co-infections is significantly increasing among COVID-19 patients and leading to increase in mortality. Systematic testing of bacterial co-infections is therefore essential in COVID-19 patients for better clinical outcomes and to reduce AMR.","Pathak, Ashutosh; Singh, Sweta; Singh, Sanjay; Patel, Sangram Singh; Fatima, Nida; Garg, Atul; Ghoshal, Ujjala; Sahu, Chinmoy",,609,10

Here, by combining observational data and simulations, this work aims to understand the diverse air quality response in two city clusters, Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) and Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China. Though there was a noticeable drop in primary pollutants in both the regions, differently, the maximum daily 8 h average ozone (O3) soared by 20.6-76.8% in YRD but decreased by 15.5-28.1% in PRD. In YRD, nitrogen oxide (NOx) reductions enhanced O3 accumulation and hence increased secondary aerosol formation. Such an increment in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols under stationary weather reached up to 36.4 and 10.2%, respectively, which was further intensified by regional transport. PRD was quite the opposite. The emission reductions benefited PRD air quality, while regional transport corresponded to an increase of 17.3 and 9.3% in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols, respectively. Apart from meteorology, the discrepancy in O3-VOCs-NOx relationships determined the different O3 responses, indicating that future emission control shall be regionally specific, instead of one-size-fits-all cut. Overall, the importance of regionally coordinated and balanced control strategy for multiple pollutants is highly emphasized.","Wang, Nan; Xu, Jiawei; Pei, Chenglei; Tang, Rong; Zhou, Derong; Chen, Yanning; Li, Mei; Deng, Xuejiao; Deng, Tao; Huang, Xin; Ding, Aijun",Environ Sci Technol,609,16

This study aimed to investigate the threshold of glycemia and its association with the outcomes of COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Glucose levels were assessed through intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring in 35 patients for an average period of 10.2 days. The percentages of time above range (TAR), time below range (TBR), time in range (TIR), and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated. Composite adverse outcomes were defined as either the need for admission to the intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, or morbidity with critical illness. RESULTS: TARs using thresholds from 160 to 200 mg/dL were significantly associated with composite adverse outcomes after adjustment of covariates. Both TBR (<70 mg/dL) and TIR (70-160 mg/dL), but not mean sensor glucose level, were significantly associated with composite adverse outcomes and prolonged hospitalization. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of the CV of sensor glucose across tertiles for composite adverse outcomes of COVID-19 were 1.00, 1.18, and 25.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes and COVID-19 have an increased risk of adverse outcomes with glucose levels >160 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL and a high CV. Therapies that improve these metrics of glycemic control may result in better prognoses for these patients.","Shen, Yun; Fan, Xiaohong; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Yaxin; Li, Cheng; Lu, Jingyi; Zha, Bingbing; Wu, Yueyue; Chen, Xiaohua; Zhou, Jian; Jia, Weiping",Diabetes Care,609,30

In pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies, experiments using a variety of animal species are assumed. We have identified optimal multiple reaction monitoring transitions for signature candidate peptides of nivolumab in human, mouse, and rat plasma and developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) using trastuzumab as the internal standard. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 1-200 µg/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy in human plasma fulfilled Food and Drug Administration guideline criteria for bioanalytical validation. There was no need to change the measurement method in mouse plasma. On the other hand, in rat plasma, an interference peak was observed at a retention time similar to that of the surrogate peptide ASGITFSNSGMHWVR (550.75 > 661.50) employed in human and mouse plasma. Therefore, we confirmed that ASQSVSSYLAWYQQKPGQAPR (785.0 > 940.2) can be used as an alternate nivolumab surrogate peptide in rat plasma at the same concentration range as used in human and mouse plasma. Using our method, the concentration range and a gradual increase in trough value were confirmed in clinical samples from two antibody-treated patients, including one with gastric cancer and one with non-small-cell lung cancer. The time course and blood concentration transition also were evaluated in nivolumab administration experiments in mouse and rat. The present study showed that the selection of the optimal peptide is essential for accurate LC-MS/MS measurement of nivolumab concentration in human, mouse, and rat plasma. The method developed here is expected to be of use in non-clinical and clinical pharmacokinetic studies.","Ohuchi, Mayu; Yagishita, Shigehiro; Taguchi, Kazuaki; Goto, Yasushi; Fukahori, Masaru; Enoki, Yuki; Shimada, Takashi; Yamaguchi, Masakazu; Matsumoto, Kazuaki; Hamada, Akinobu",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,609,26

AIM: To evaluate the knowledge Latin American gastroenterologists and endoscopists (staff physicians and residents) have about the characteristics of COVID-19, as well as the prevention measures to be taken during endoscopic procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included gastroenterologists and endoscopists from 9 Latin American countries. An electronic questionnaire was applied that was designed to evaluate the knowledge of symptoms, risk groups for severe disease, prevention measures, and the reprocessing of endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Information was obtained from 133 physicians. Ninety-five percent of them correctly identified the most frequent symptoms of the virus, and 60% identified the 3 risk groups for severe disease. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed did not consider it necessary to use standard precautions during endoscopic procedures, and 30% did not consider contact precautions necessary. Forty-eight percent of the participants surveyed were not familiar with the protocol for reprocessing the endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority of the gastroenterologists and endoscopists surveyed were familiar with the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the populations at risk for complications. There was a lack of knowledge about prevention measures (during clinical care and endoscopic procedures) and the reprocessing of endoscopic equipment by 70% and 48%, respectively, of those surveyed.

We propose a version of BCD that, for block multi-convex and smooth objective functions under constraints, is guaranteed to converge to the stationary points with worst-case rate of convergence of $O((\log n)^{2}/n)$ for $n$ iterations, and a bound of $O(\epsilon^{-1}(\log \epsilon^{-1})^{2})$ for the number of iterations to achieve an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. Furthermore, we show that these results continue to hold even when the convex sub-problems are inexactly solved if the optimality gaps are uniformly summable against initialization. A key idea is to restrict the parameter search within a diminishing radius to promote stability of iterates. As an application, we provide an alternating least squares algorithm with diminishing radius for nonnegative CP tensor decomposition that converges to the stationary points of the reconstruction error with the same robust worst-case convergence rate and complexity bounds. We also experimentally validate our results with both synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate that using auxiliary search radius restriction can in fact improve the rate of convergence.","Lyu, Hanbaek",,609,1

METHODS: An observational study was conducted in four public hospitals in Madrid. All HIV patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were included and compared with COVID-19 patients without HIV infection. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with HIV infection and confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were analyzed. The median age was 46 years (IQR: 37-56 years), and 88.9% were men. The median duration of HIV infection was 10.8 years (IQR: 6.5-16.8 years), and 96.8% were on antiretroviral therapy. 84.1% had previous comorbidities. The most common symptoms were fever (66.1%), cough (66.1%) and dyspnea (46.8%). Pneumonia was found in 47.5%, 28.6% of patients had severe disease, and 32.3% were admitted to hospital. The ICU admission rate and the mortality rate were both 3.17%. A significant association was observed between age, arterial hypertension, overweight, and diabetes mellitus and the severity of COVID-19. No association was observed between HIV-related factors and the severity of COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 in HIV-patients was 1.68%. Similar hospitalization (31.74% vs 32.57%) and ICU admission (3.17% vs 2%) rates were observed with non-HIV infected patients. A lower mortality rate during hospitalization (10% vs 21.37%) and a lower global mortality rate (3.17% vs 6.96%) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Established poor prognostic factors for COVID-19 patients, such as age and comorbidities, remain the main determinants for PLHIV.

Results: Out of 17,534 admitted patients, 3.6% of patients developed secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The mortality among patients who developed secondary infections was 56.7% against an overall mortality of 10.6% in total admitted COVID-19 patients. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 78% of patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (21%). Thirty-five percent of patients reported polymicrobial infections, including fungal infections. High levels of carbapenem resistance was seen in A. baumannii (92.6%) followed by K. pneumoniae (72.8%). Conclusion: Predominance of Gram-negative pathogens in COVID-19 patients coupled with high rates of resistance to higher generation antimicrobials is an alarming finding. A high rate of mortality in patients with secondary infections warrants extra caution to improve the infection control practices and practice of antimicrobial stewardship interventions not only to save patient lives but also prevent selection of drug-resistant infections, to which the current situation is very conducive.","Vijay, S.; Bansal, N.; Rao, B.

Nowadays, in a world of continuous technological changes and scientific advances, there is a need for life-long learning and education within both formal and non-formal educational environments. In response to this challenge, the use of eye-tracking technology and data-mining techniques, respectively, for supervised (mainly prediction) and unsupervised (specifically cluster analysis) learning, provide methods for the detection of forms of learning among users and/or the classification of their learning styles. In this study, a protocol is proposed for the study of learning styles among adults with and without previous knowledge at different ages (18 to 69-year-old) and at different points throughout the learning process (start and end). Statistical analysis-of-variance techniques mean that differences may be detected between the participants by type of learner and previous knowledge of the task. Likewise, the use of unsupervised learning clustering techniques throws light on similar forms of learning among the participants across different groups. All these data will facilitate personalized proposals from the teacher for the presentation of each task at different points in the chain of information processing. It will likewise be easier for the teacher to adapt teaching materials to the learning needs of each student or group of students with similar characteristics.","Sáiz Manzanares, María Consuelo; Payo Hernanz, René Jesús; Zaparaín Yáñez, María José; Andrés López, Gonzalo; Marticorena Sánchez, Raúl; Calvo Rodríguez, Alberto; Martín, Caroline; Rodríguez Arribas, Sandra",J. vis. exp,609,30

As many schools continue to shift between hybrid and remote learning, I ask, how do we address our own and students' emotional well-being to promote active learning during the pandemic? How can we as teachers help students cope with this chronic stressor, be it the COVID-19 pandemic or the racial inequality? I share my own personal experiences and argue that affect/feelings/emotions are embodied thoughts imbricated with social values and often involved in the preservation of social expectations and power relations. I suggest that educators recognize affect/feelings/emotions as a critical part of students' embodied experiences, encourage students to attend to their surrounding world and live their life with heightened consciousness and reflectiveness.

We aimed to identify sociodemographic, occupational, and community risk factors among physician trainees during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in New York City. In this retrospective study of 328 trainees at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, we administered a survey to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 February and 30 June 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by self-reported and laboratory-confirmed IgG antibody and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test results. We used Bayesian generalized linear mixed effect regression to examine associations between hypothesized risk factors and infection odds. The cumulative incidence of infection was 20.1%. Assignment to medical-surgical units (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.18-5.34), and training in emergency medicine, critical care, and anesthesiology (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.24-6.92) were independently associated with infection. Caring for unfamiliar patient populations was protective (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.73). Community factors were not statistically significantly associated with infection after adjustment for occupational factors.

Part of this canon involves the idea that virulence and free-living survival (a key component of transmission) may have different relationships in different host-parasite systems. Most examinations of the evolution of virulence-transmission relationships-Theoretical or empirical in nature-Tend to focus on the evolution of virulence, with transmission being a secondary consideration. Even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. Few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulence-survival relationships. In this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. Across virulence-survival relationships (where these traits are either positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including R0, and on the size of the infectious peak in the population. These results highlight the importance of properly understanding the mechanistic relationship between virulence and parasite survival, as the evolution of increased survival across different relationships with virulence may have considerably different epidemiological signatures.","Gomez, Lourdes M; Meszaros, Victor A; Turner, Wendy C; Ogbunugafor, C Brandon",Viruses,609,22

METHODS: We analyzed data from practices enrolled in RISE between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017. Eight quality measures in the areas of RA disease management, cardiovascular risk reduction, and patient safety were examined. Variability in performance was evaluated at the practice level. Multivariate linear models were used to predict change in measure performance by year and determine the effect of practice characteristics on change in performance over time. RESULTS: Data from 59,986 patients from 54 practices was examined. Mean age was 62±14 years, 77% were female, 69% were Caucasian, and most patients were seen in a single-specialty group practice (46%). Average performance on measures related to RA treatments was consistently high (>90%) across the study period. Measures related to RA functional status and disease activity assessment had the greatest improvements over time (8.4% and 13.0% increase per year, respectively; p<0.001). Single-specialty group practices had the fastest rates of improvement over time across all measures. CONCLUSIONS: Among practices participating in RISE between 2015 to 2017, performance on most RA quality measures improved. Single specialty group practices saw the fastest rates of improvement over time. Identification of workflow patterns leading to dramatic improvements in quality of care will help guide process redesign to address gaps in priority areas, such as TB screening and blood pressure control.","Izadi, Zara; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Gianfrancesco, Milena; Subash, Meera; Evans, Michael; Trupin, Laura; Yazdany, Jinoos",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),609,1

The Pituitary Society surveyed its membership to understand planned approaches to glucocorticoid management in patients with adrenal insufficiency who will receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Members were asked to complete up to 3 questions regarding their planned approach for use of glucocorticoid replacement in patients with proven adrenal insufficiency. RESULTS: Surveys were sent to 273 members and 103 responded. Thirty-six percent plan to recommend that patients automatically increase glucocorticoid dosage with administration of the first vaccine injection. Of these, 84% plan to increase glucocorticoid dose on the day of vaccination, and 49% plan to increase glucocorticoid dose prior to vaccination. Of the 64% who do not plan to recommend automatic glucocorticoid dose increase with vaccine administration, 88% plan to increase the dose if the patient develops a fever, and 47% plan to increase the dose if myalgias and arthralgias occur. CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians plan to maintain the current glucocorticoid dose with vaccine administration. The vast majority plan and to increase glucocorticoid dose in case of fever, and just under half in case of arthralgias and myalgias.

An important issue is also that there is still no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Substantial vascular events are significant accompaniments to lung complications in COVID-19 patients. Various papers have now also shown the significance of thromboelastrography (TEG(R)) as point-of-care technology to determine the levels of coagulopathy (both clotting and bleeding) in COVID-19, in managing COVID-19 patients. Here we present two treatment protocols that may used to treat thrombotic and bleeding or thrombocytopenia pathologies. Both the protocols use clinical parameters like D-dimer and CRP, as well as the TEG(R), to closely follow the daily clotting propensity of COVID-19 patients. We conclude by suggesting that the treatment of COVID-19 patients, should be based on a combination of blood biomarkers, and results from point-of-care analyses like the TEG(R).

Subsequently, some groups of people found themselves away from their family or friends, and were unable to return to them. The aim of the research was to explore the lives of young adults who were living alone and working, during the lockdown in India. Focus was on their daily living, their relationships and their mental health. Twelve participants residing in various cities of India were included via the Internet. Focus group discussions were used to attain the objectives of the study. The data that emerged from the discussions, was analysed using thematic analysis. All participants had experienced different kinds of disruptions in their life due to the lockdown. This effect was mediated by their financial situation, their general comfort and preference for living alone, media, opportunities for non-virtual interactions and other kinds of recreation, quality of relationships and more. Though there were similarities in their coping methods, their perspective on the lockdown, the meaning they attributed to their current situation and their vision for their future was unique.","Raj, Tanya; Bajaj, Aishwarya",Curr Psychol,609,9

Regulations provide additional protections for children participating in human subject research and limit the amount of risk to which children may be exposed without benefit (21 CFR 50, subpart D, Additional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations). The objective of this paper is to describe the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experience with placebo-controlled trials conducted as part of pediatric drug development programs including compliance with 21 CFR 50, subpart D. METHODS: Pediatric drug development programs conducted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) or the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) between 2012 and 2018 were reviewed. Trials that utilized a placebo control were identified and trial characteristics and risk mitigation strategies were extracted from publicly available sources. RESULTS: During this time frame, a total of 266 products were studied under pediatric product development initiatives. Of those, 67 products (25%) were studied in 96 individual placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients. The majority of these studies included approaches to minimize risk to children in the placebo arm, including 49 trials that utilized placebo as an add-on to known effective therapy for the disease and 48 trials that included rescue therapy in the study protocol. CONCLUSIONS: When designed and conducted appropriately, placebo-controlled trials meet requirements under current US federal regulations for the protection of children in research.","Momper, Jeremiah D; Green, Dionna J; Park, Kyunghun; Burckart, Gilbert J; Snyder, Donna L",Ther. innov. regul. sci.

Methods: The consecutive records of 93 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. A series of chest CT findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The serial chest CT scans were scored on a semiquantitative basis according to the extent of pulmonary abnormalities. Chest CT scores in different periods (0 - 5 days, 6 - 10 days, 11 - 15 days, 16 - 20 days, and > 20 days) since symptom onset were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors, and the temporal trend of the radiographic-clinical features was analyzed. Results: The final cohort consisted of 93 patients: 68 survivors and 25 nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors were significantly older than survivors. For both survivors and nonsurvivors, the chest CT scores were not different in the first period (0 - 5 days) but diverged afterwards. The mortality rate of COVID-19 monotonously increased with chest CT scores, which positively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil percentage, D-dimer level, lactate dehydrogenase level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while negatively correlated with the lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count. Conclusions: Chest CT scores correlate well with risk factors for mortality over periods, thus they may be used as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19. While higher chest CT scores are associated with a higher mortality rate, CT images taken at least 6 days since symptom onset may contain more prognostic information than images taken at an earlier period.","Li, Lingli; Yang, Lian; Gui, Shan; Pan, Feng; Ye, Tianhe; Liang, Bo; Hu, Yu; Zheng, Chuansheng",Theranostics,609,25

Here we introduce a simple-yet-powerful ensemble methodology for forecasting the trajectory of dynamic growth processes that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations with applications to infectious disease spread. METHODS: We propose and assess the performance of two ensemble modeling schemes with different parametric bootstrapping procedures for trajectory forecasting and uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we conduct sequential probabilistic forecasts to evaluate their forecasting performance using simple dynamical growth models with good track records including the Richards model, the generalized-logistic growth model, and the Gompertz model. We first test and verify the functionality of the method using simulated data from phenomenological models and a mechanistic transmission model. Next, the performance of the method is demonstrated using a diversity of epidemic datasets including scenario outbreak data of the Ebola Forecasting Challenge and real-world epidemic data outbreaks of including influenza, plague, Zika, and COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that the ensemble method that randomly selects a model from the set of individual models for each time point of the trajectory of the epidemic frequently outcompeted the individual models as well as an alternative ensemble method based on the weighted combination of the individual models and yields broader and more realistic uncertainty bounds for the trajectory envelope, achieving not only better coverage rate of the 95% prediction interval but also improved mean interval scores across a diversity of epidemic datasets. CONCLUSION: Our new methodology for ensemble forecasting outcompete component models and an alternative ensemble model that differ in how the variance is evaluated for the generation of the prediction intervals of the forecasts.","Chowell, Gerardo; Luo, Ruiyan",BMC Med Res Methodol,609,32

However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called ""knowns"", and there are more we do not know called ""unknowns"". Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently, it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype-based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to ""open"" the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speeds up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.","Shu, Yu; Shi, Yemin; Wang, Yaowei; Huang, Tiejun; Tian, Yonghong",Sci Rep,609,24

The mechanisms mediating these processes remain unclear. METHODS: We performed multicolor staining for SARS-CoV-2 proteins and lineage markers to define viral tropism and lung pathobiology in 5 autopsy cases. RESULTS: Lung parenchyma showed severe DAD with thromboemboli. Viral infection was found in an extensive range of cells including pneumocyte type II, ciliated, goblet, club-like and endothelial cells. Over 90% infiltrating immune cells were positive for viral proteins including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK), B and T cells. Most but not all infected cells were ACE2-positive. The numbers of infected and ACE2-positive cells are associated with extensive tissue damage. Infected tissues exhibited high inflammatory cells including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and NK cells, and low B- but abundant T-cells consisting of mainly T helper cells, few cytotoxic T cells, and no T regulatory cell. Robust interleukin-6 expression was present in most cells, with or without infection.

The scale of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) and the controversial suggestion that HCQ is a treatment option have led to a significant increase in HCQ use. HCQ poisoning should be at the top-of-mind for emergency providers in cases of toxic ingestion. Treatment for HCQ poisoning includes sodium bicarbonate, epinephrine, and aggressive electrolyte repletion. We highlight the use of hypertonic saline and diazepam. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 37-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after the ingestion of approximately 16 g of HCQ tablets (initial serum concentration 4270 ng/mL). He was treated with an epinephrine infusion, hypertonic sodium chloride, high-dose diazepam, sodium bicarbonate, and aggressive potassium repletion. Persistent altered mental status necessitated intubation, and he was managed in the medical intensive care unit until his QRS widening and QTc prolongation resolved. After his mental status improved and it was confirmed that his ingestion was not with the intent to self-harm, he was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: For patients presenting with HCQ overdose and an unknown initial serum potassium level, high-dose diazepam and hypertonic sodium chloride should be started immediately for the patient with widened QRS. The choice of hypertonic sodium chloride instead of sodium bicarbonate is to avoid exacerbating underlying hypokalemia which may in turn potentiate unstable dysrhythmia. In addition, early intubation should be a priority in vomiting patients because both HCQ toxicity and high-dose diazepam cause profound sedation.","Mahan, Keenan M; Hayes, Bryan D; North, Crystal M; Becker, Justin S; Fenves, Andrew Z; Hyppolite, Guibenson; Khosrowjerdi, Sara; Sinden, Daniel; Stearns, Dana A",J. emerg. med,609,22

Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Materials and Methods A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87. Assisted by the probabilities of the model, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs 85%, &#916; = 5, P < .001), sensitivity (88% vs 79%, &#916; = 9, P < .001), and specificity (91% vs 88%, &#916; = 3, P = .001).

Here, we compared the gut mycobiota of 67 COVID-19 patients, 35 H1N1-infected patients and 48 healthy controls (HCs) using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 3-ITS4 sequencing and analysed their associations with clinical features and the bacterial microbiota. Compared to HCs, the fungal burden was higher. Fungal mycobiota dysbiosis in both COVID-19 and H1N1-infected patients was mainly characterized by the depletion of fungi such as Aspergillus and Penicillium, but several fungi, including Candida glabrata, were enriched in H1N1-infected patients. The gut mycobiota profiles in COVID-19 patients with mild and severe symptoms were similar. Hospitalization had no apparent additional effects. In COVID-19 patients, Mucoromycota was positively correlated with Fusicatenibacter, Aspergillus niger was positively correlated with diarrhoea, and Penicillium citrinum was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP). In H1N1-infected patients, Aspergillus penicilloides was positively correlated with Lachnospiraceae members, Aspergillus was positively correlated with CRP, and Mucoromycota was negatively correlated with procalcitonin. Therefore, gut mycobiota dysbiosis occurs in both COVID-19 patients and H1N1-infected patients and does not improve until the patients are discharged and no longer require medical attention.","Lv, Longxian; Gu, Silan; Jiang, Huiyong; Yan, Ren; Chen, Yanfei; Chen, Yunbo; Luo, Rui; Huang, Chenjie; Lu, Haifeng; Zheng, Beiwen; Zhang, Hua; Xia, Jiafeng; Tang, Lingling; Sheng, Guoping; Li, Lanjuan",Commun Biol,609,30

In particular, in low- and middle-income countries they experience a higher burden of disease, exacerbated by global inequity limiting access to quality health care. According to the inverse care law, the availability of quality health care varies inversely to the need of the population, and hardworking health-care professionals in under-resourced countries may face impediments to continued education or subspecialty training. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, collaborations have been developed between high-income and low- and-middle-income countries to address global disparities in health. These collaborations face challenges of high financial costs, difficulties creating long-term sustainable change, and with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, border closures preventing fly-in volunteers. In this paper, we describe the development of an innovative, paediatric-specific model of care for training and support between high- and low-income countries - Taking Paediatrics Abroad Ltd. Taking Paediatrics Abroad supports the development of mutually beneficial relationships between Australian paediatric health-care professionals and paediatric health-care professionals in developing countries and remote, underserved Australian Aboriginal communities.

The objective of this study was to investigate what worries children and adolescents living in Sweden expressed in relation to the pandemic. METHODS: Using an anonymous web-survey, 1,047 children (4–12 years; N = 717) and adolescents (13–18 years; N = 330) responded to five background and four open-ended questions, one of which was: Is there anything that you are worried about when it comes to ‘Corona’? The responses were coded using manifest content analysis. Interrater reliability was .95, assessed on the code level. RESULTS: Worry was common (77%); mostly (60%) related to disease or death of elderly relatives, parents, the child him/herself or general worry for the elderly/risk groups. Existential worry (15%) comprised worries about the future, including economy and worries about the world perishing or the contagion becoming uncontrollable. A developmental trajectory was evident in the nature of responses. Adolescents’ worries about the future included missing out on their youth and employment. They also worried about society (6%), for example, the future of democracy and the world economy. There was no indication of socioeconomic status or geographic area (urban vs. rural) affecting the presence of worrisome thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: Worry about “Corona” was common. Universal preventative mental health intervention is warranted and could be conducted in the school setting. Intervention could be tailored by age, covering discussion on financial aspects with adolescents.","Sarkadi, Anna; Sahlin Torp, Lisa; Pérez-Aronsson, Anna; Warner, Georgina",J Pediatr Psychol,609,1

The elicited disease COVID-19 is characterized by fever, dry cough, myalgia, or fatigue and has a favorable outcome in the majority of cases. However, in some patients COVID-19 leads to severe pneumonia and sepsis with subsequent respiratory failure and gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological, and cardiovascular complications. A higher risk of infection is intrinsic to active rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and the use of biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). With an increasing number of reports on COVID-19 in RMD patients, we are beginning to appraise their risks. In this review, we summarize the published cases of COVID-19 infections in RMD patients, including patients with inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases as well as anti-phospholipid syndrome and Kawasaki syndrome. Overall, patients with inflammatory arthritis do not seem to be at a higher risk for infection or a severe course of COVID-19. Risk for critical COVID-19 in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases such as SLE or vasculitis might be increased, but this needs further confirmation. Furthermore, we summarize the data on DMARDs used to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection and hyperinflammation.","Stradner, Martin H.; Dejaco, Christian; Zwerina, Jochen; Fritsch-Stork, Ruth D.",Front Med (Lausanne),609,1

These evaluations typically occur in an emergency department (ED), but there is increasing interest in providing this care in other settings. We report on a novel care model whereby a nursing hotline is used to triage patients to the ED or to the North Carolina Cancer Hospital Infusion Center (NCCHIC). METHODS: A retrospective study of adult patients with a neoplasm diagnosis seeking acute care at a large academic hospital pre- and post-initiation of the novel care model in January of 2016. Patients were identified by querying the electronic medical record and clinic administrative data during matched 6 month pre- and post-periods. RESULTS: During the pre-initiation period, 1346 patients visited the ED on 1651 occasions (76.1% admission rate). In the post-initiation period, 1434 patients visited the ED on 1797 occasions (81.5% admission rate), and 246 patients visited the NCCHIC on 322 occasions (68.9% admission rate). The emergency severity index (ESI) in the pre-initiation ED group was primarily ESI 2 (30.6%) and ESI 3 (65.4%). In the post-initiation ED group, the ESI was similar (32.6% ESI 2 and 64.2% ESI 3). In contrast, the NCCHIC predominantly treated lower acuity patients (65.8% calculated ESI of 4/5). CONCLUSIONS: This model demonstrates a multidisciplinary partnership to providing acute unscheduled care for patients with cancer. In the early implementation phase of this model, approximately 15% of patients, generally of lower acuity, were seen in the NCCHIC.","Bischof, Jason J.; Bush, Montika; Shams, Rayad Bin; Collichio, Frances A.; Platts-Mills, Timothy F.",Support Care Cancer,609,0

METHODS: Respiratory samples (nasal/throat swabs) were collected between August 2010 and November 2012 and real time PCR was used to detect different viral pathogens. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 32.1% (43/134) of samples from 101 patients. Specifically, 9% (12/134) were positive for HBoV, 8.2% (11/134) were positive for HAdV, 5.2% (7/134) were positive for HRV, and 1.5% (2/134) were positive for FLUBV or HMPV, as single infections.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","Sun, H.; Dickens, B.

T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy can reconstitute CD8 T cell immunity in chronic patients. We cloned 10 virus-specific TCRs targeting 5 different viruses, causing chronic and acute infection. All 10 TCR genetic constructs were optimized for expression using a P2A sequence, codon optimization and the addition of a non-native disulfide bond. However, maximum TCR expression was only achieved after establishing the optimal orientation of the alpha and beta chains in the expression cassette; 9/10 TCRs favored the beta-P2A-alpha orientation over alpha-P2A-beta. Optimal TCR expression was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of IFN-gamma+ T cells. In addition, activating cells for transduction in the presence of Toll-like receptor ligands further enhanced IFN-gamma production. Thus, we have built a virus-specific TCR library that has potential for therapeutic intervention in chronic viral infection or virus-related cancers.","Banu, Nasirah; Chia, Adeline; Ho, Zi Zong; Garcia, Alfonso Tan; Paravasivam, Komathi; Grotenbreg, Gijsbert M.; Bertoletti, Antonio; Gehring, Adam J.",Sci Rep,609,1

Most have applied tools enabling assessing the general traits of anxiety. Tools specifically designed for an assessment of anxiety or fear related to COVID-19 have also been developed. However, no study has assessed the future anxiety in relation to the pandemic. This concept was defined by Zaleski in the end of the 20th century as the state of apprehension, fear, worry, and concern regarding unfavourable changes in the more remote personal future. The aim of this study was an analysis to establish the level and the determinants of future anxiety in Polish society related to the COVID-19 pandemic three months after the introduction of the state of epidemic. The analysis reported in the paper is based on the data obtained through a web-based survey carried out on a representative sample of 1002 Polish adults aged 18–74 years. The hierarchical linear regression model was developed for the analysis of the determinants of future anxiety from the responses to a questionnaire consisting of five items. The independent variables selected for inclusion in the model, apart from sociodemographic characteristics, encompassed health literacy (HL) and ehealth literacy (eHL), perceived health threat related to COVID-19 (PHTC19), and a COVID-19-related conspiracy belief score (CCBS) derived from three items asking about the most popular conspiracy theories. The regression model developed in the final step showed that the future anxiety scale score (FASS) was significantly associated with gender, vocational status, HL, PHTC19, and CCBS. The FASS was lower among men than women (regression coefficient (B) (standard error, SE) = −1.28 (0.39), p = 0.001), among entrepreneurs or farmers rather than among employees of the public or private sector (B(SE) = −1.55, p = 0.010), in persons with a higher HL (B(SE) = −0.43 (0.06), p < 0.001). A higher FASS was observed in respondents with higher rather than lower PHTC19 (B(SE) = 1.49 (0.17), p < 0.001) and in those with a higher CCBS (B(SE) = 0.33 (0.07), p < 0.001). The model accounted for 15.2% of the variance of the FASS. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is not only a cause of increased mental symptoms, but also of increased future anxiety. Health-related measures are significantly associated with the FASS.","Duplaga, Mariusz; Grysztar, Marcin",Healthcare (Basel),609,33

In order to undergo a conformational change, these proteins require energy to activate the chemical reaction that leads to the conformational change. In this study, data from the literature is used to calculate the energy required for viral inactivation for a variety of different viruses by means of the Arrhenius equation. We find that some viruses (rhinovirus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus, and hepatitis A virus) have high inactivation energies, indicative of breaking of a chemical double bond. We also find that several viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, poliovirus, and norovirus) have nonlinear Arrhenius plots, suggesting that there is more than a single pathway for inactivation of these viruses.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate feasibility of conducting a definitive trial and assessing the potential efficacy of tranexamic acid on ovarian reserve and intra-operative blood loss by comparing mean differences in anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels following laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy between tranexamic acid and control groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A parallel two-arm pilot trial was conducted with 40 participants with endometriotic cysts who underwent laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. They were randomized 1:1 to either 1 g tranexamic acid (TXA) or no TXA (n = 20 per group). TXA was administered to the participants immediately after induction of general anesthesia and intubation. The primary outcome was the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial in terms of design and procedures (such as recruitment rate, retention, safety of intravenous 1 gm of TXA, sample size verification) and assess the efficacy of TXA on the ovarian reserve and intra-operative blood loss by comparing mean difference of AMH levels between TXA and control groups at pre- and 3 months post-surgery. RESULTS: The recruitment and successful completion rates were 95% and 100%. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The mean difference of serum AMH levels (pre- and 3 months post-surgery) between the TXA and control groups was not significantly different. When performing a subgroup analysis, the mean difference of AMH levels (pre- and 3 months post-surgery) seemed to be higher in the bilateral than in the unilateral ovarian cyst group but not significantly different. Operating time was significantly longer in bilateral than in unilateral cysts. No post-operative complications or adverse effects were found. CONCLUSION: The full randomized controlled trial for evaluating effects of TXA administration during laparoscopic cystectomy for endometrioma on ovarian reserve was shown to be feasible.

The Beetle readout chip was developed for the LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) tracking detectors and was used in the VELO (Vertex Locator) during Run 1 and 2 of LHC data taking. The VELO, surrounding the LHC beam crossing region, was a leading part of the LHCb tracking system. The Beetle chip was used to read out the signal from silicon microstrips, integrating and amplifying it. The studies presented in this paper cover the optimization of its electronic configuration to achieve the lower power consumption footprint and the lower operational temperature of the sensors, while maintaining a good condition of the analogue response of the whole chip. The studies have shown that optimizing the operational temperature is possible and can be beneficial when the detector is highly irradiated. Even a single degree drop in silicon temperature can result in a significant reduction in the leakage current. Similar studies are being performed for the future silicon tracker, the Upstream Tracker (UT), which will start operating at LHC in 2021. It is expected that the inner part of the UT detector will suffer radiation damage similar to the most irradiated VELO sensors in Run 2. In the course of analysis we also developed a general approach for the pulse shape reconstruction using an ANN approach. This technique can be reused in case of any type of front-end readout chip.","Kopciewicz, Pawel; Akiba, Kazuyoshi Carvalho; Szumlak, Tomasz; Sitko, Sebastian; Barter, William; Buytaert, Jan; Eklund, Lars; Hennessy, Karol; Koppenburg, Patrick; Latham, Thomas; Majewski, Maciej; Oblakowska-Mucha, Agnieszka; Parkes, Chris; Qian, Wenbin; Velthuis, Jaap; Williams, Mark",Sensors,609,5

However, there are increasing reports of persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (pCIA), especially for patients treated with taxane-containing chemotherapy regimens. Objective To analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics and response to treatment of patients with pCIA after chemotherapy for breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants In this case series, a retrospective evaluation was performed of patients with a diagnosis of pCIA after chemotherapy for breast cancer in 4 specialist hair clinics from November 1, 2011, to February 29, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical, trichoscopic, and histopathologic characteristics and treatment outcomes were analyzed. For patients who presented with diffuse alopecia or diffuse rarefaction of hair over the midfrontal scalp with widening of the central part line and preservation of the frontal hairline, the Sinclair scale (grades 1-5, where 1 indicates normal hair density and 5 indicates the most severe stage of hair loss, with little or no hair in the centroparietal region) was used to assess severity. Results One hundred patients (99 women [99%]; mean age at presentation, 54.0 years [range, 29.0-74.1 years]) were included. Most patients had diffuse nonscarring alopecia (n = 39), female pattern hair loss (n = 55), or male pattern hair loss (n = 6). Six patients developed cicatricial alopecia. Taxane-containing regimens were used for most patients (92 [92%]) and were associated with more severe alopecia than regimens that did not contain taxanes (median Sinclair grade, 4 [IQR, 3-5] vs 2 [IQR, 2-2.5]; P < .001). A total of 76 of 86 patients (88%) had trichoscopic signs indistinguishable from those of androgenetic alopecia. Of 18 patients who had biopsies, 14 had androgenetic alopecia-like features, 2 had cicatricial alopecia, and 2 had features of both. Both topical and oral minoxidil, sometimes combined with antiandrogen therapy, were associated with an improvement in hair density (median Sinclair grade, 4 [IQR, 3-5] before treatment vs 3 [IQR, 2-4] after treatment; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance This case series outlines previously unreported features of pCIA in patients with breast cancer, including a trichoscopic description. Cosmetically significant regrowth was achieved for a significant proportion of patients with topical or systemic treatments, suggesting that pCIA may be at least partly reversible.","Bhoyrul, Bevin; Asfour, Leila; Lutz, Gerhard; Mitchell, Lorne; Jerjen, Rebekka; Sinclair, Rodney D; Holmes, Susan; Chaudhry, Iskander H; Harries, Matthew J",JAMA dermatology,609,1

Few quantitative studies on this topic have been published in domestic and international peer-reviewed journals. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to use national data to quantitatively analyse the scale, structure, and changes of public health education in China’s HEIs, and to compare the changes of public health education with those of other health science disciplines. METHODS: This study uses previously unreleased national data provided by the Ministry of Education of China that includes the number of health professional students by school and major. The data, which spans from 1998 to 2012, are descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: The number of HEIs for public health education per 100 million population increased from 7.2 in 1998 to 11.3 in 2012. The total enrolment, number of students, and number of graduates increased at rates of 7.3, 7.4, and 5.8% per year, respectively. The percentage of junior college students dropped drastically from 24.0 to 8.4% from 1998 to 2012. During that same period, the number of undergraduates, master and doctorate students increased. Undergraduates accounted for the majority of public health graduates (63.1%) in 2012, and master and doctorate students increased by 10.0 and 5.1 times, respectively, from 1998 to 2012. The relative percentage of public health enrollment, students, and graduates to all health education disciplines dropped from about 6.0% percent in 1998 to around 2% in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: The overall scale of public health education has clearly expanded, though at a slower pace than many other health science disciplines in China. The increase of public health graduates helped to address the previous shortage of public health professionals. Gradually adopting a modern model of education, public health education in China has undergone notable changes that may be informative to other developing countries though it still faces a complex situation in terms of graduates’ adherence to public health, student recruitment, teaching and training, program planning and reform.","Hou, Jianlin; Wang, Zhifeng; Liu, Xiaoyun; Luo, Youhui; Sabharwal, Sabhyta; Wang, Nan; Meng, Qingyue",BMC Public Health,609,1

The classic view is that autoreactive T cells mistakenly destroy healthy (‘innocent’) β-cells. We propose an alternative view in which the β-cell is the key contributor to the disease. By their nature and function, β-cells are prone to biosynthetic stress with limited measures for self-defence. β-Cell stress provokes an immune attack that has considerable negative effects on the source of a vital hormone. This view would explain why immunotherapy at best delays progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus and points to opportunities to use therapies that revitalize β-cells, in combination with immune intervention strategies, to reverse the disease. We present the case that dysfunction occurs in both the immune system and β-cells, which provokes further dysfunction, and present the evidence leading to the consensus that islet autoimmunity is an essential component in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Next, we build the case for the β-cell as the trigger of an autoimmune response, supported by analogies in cancer and antitumour immunity. Finally, we synthesize a model (‘connecting the dots’) in which both β-cell stress and islet autoimmunity can be harnessed as targets for intervention strategies.","Roep, Bart O.; Thomaidou, Sofia; van Tienhoven, René; Zaldumbide, Arnaud",Nat Rev Endocrinol,609,1

Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinucleotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies that aim to force nucleotide usage against the direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards U. In turn, analysis of observed synonymous site composition implicates selection against U. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed UU content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. Possible mechanisms of selection against U mutations includes selection for higher expression, for high mRNA stability or lower immunogenicity of viral genes. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV-2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily-informed approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","Rice, Alan M; Morales, Atahualpa Castillo; Ho, Alexander T; Mordstein, Christine; Mühlhausen, Stefanie; Watson, Samir; Cano, Laura; Young, Bethan; Kudla, Grzegorz; Hurst, Laurence D",Mol Biol Evol,609,16

In this study, soluble recombinant human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) NP was produced to examine the antigenicity of the HCoV-OC43 NP of betacoronavirus. Using the purified recombinant NP as an antigen, a polyclonal antibody from rabbit serum with specificity for HCoV-OC43 NP was generated; this antibody reacts specifically with HCoV-OC43 NP and does not cross-react with other human CoV NPs (including those of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E) by Western blot. Sera from 26 young adults, 17 middle-aged and elderly patients with respiratory infection, and 15 cord blood samples were also tested. Strong reactivity to the NPs of HCoV-OC43 was observed in 96%, 82%, and 93% of the serum samples from the young adults, respiratory patients, and cord blood samples, respectively. To identify the immunoreactivities of the three structural regions of the NP that are recognised by the rabbit polyclonal antibody and human serum, the antigenicities of three protein fragments, including the N-terminal domain (aa 1-173), the central-linker region (aa 174-300), and the C-terminal domain (aa 301-448), were evaluated by Western blot. The rabbit polyclonal antibody demonstrated greater immunoreactivity to the central-linker region and the C-terminal domain than to the N-terminal domain. Three different patterns for the immunoreactivities of the three structural regions of HCoV-OC43 NP were observed in human serum, suggesting variability in the immune responses that occur during HCoV-OC43 infection in humans. The central-linker region of the NP appeared to be the most highly immunoreactive region for all three patterns observed. The goal of this study was to offer insight into the design of diagnostic tools for HCoV infection.","Liang, Fang-Ying; Lin, Leng-Chieh; Ying, Tsung-Ho; Yao, Chen-Wen; Tang, Tswen-Kei; Chen, Yi-Wen; Hou, Ming-Hon",J Virol Methods,609,1

To investigate how aging compromises defense against COVID-19, we developed a model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 (mCoV-A59) that recapitulated majority of clinical hallmarks of COVID-19. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of γδ T cells in lungs. Ketogenic diet increases beta-hydroxybutyrate, expands tissue protective γδ T cells, deactivates the inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice.

The disruption to chronic illnesses, such as epilepsy, may relate to several factors ranging from direct infection to secondary effects from healthcare reorganization and social distancing measures. OBJECTIVES: As part of the COVID-19 and Epilepsy (COV-E) global study, we ascertained the effects of COVID-19 on people with epilepsy in Brazil, based on their perspectives and those of their caregivers. We also evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the care delivered to people with epilepsy by healthcare workers. METHODS: We designed separate online surveys for people with epilepsy and their caregivers. A further survey for healthcare workers contained additional assessments of changes to working patterns, productivity, and concerns for those with epilepsy under their care. The Brazilian arm of COV-E initially collected data from May to November 2020 during the country's first wave. We also examined national data to identify the Brazilian states with the highest COVID-19 incidence and related mortality. Lastly, we applied this geographic grouping to our data to explore whether local disease burden played a direct role in difficulties faced by people with epilepsy. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-one people returned the survey, 20% were individuals with epilepsy (n = 48); 22% were caregivers (n = 53), and 58% were healthcare workers (n = 140). Just under half (43%) of people with epilepsy reported health changes during the pandemic, including worsening seizure control, with specific issues related to stress and impaired mental health. Of respondents prescribed antiseizure medication, 11% reported difficulty taking medication on time due to problems acquiring prescriptions and delayed or canceled medical appointments. Only a small proportion of respondents reported discussing significant epilepsy-related risks in the previous 12 months. Analysis of national COVID-19 data showed a higher disease burden in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro compared to Brazil as a whole. There were, however, no geographic differences observed in survey responses despite variability in the incidence of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Brazilians with epilepsy have been adversely affected by COVID-19 by factors beyond infection or mortality.

A reduction in the quality of life and the presence of prolonged fatigue are some of the most imminent problems that emerge among these professionals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a holistic intervention (workshop) for health science students aimed at developing skills that will enable them to obtain a better self-assessment of their quality of life, and prolonged fatigue. METHODS: Pre- and post-measures of quality of life, and prolonged fatigue were obtained from 130 health science students, including a group of 96 attendees (cases) of a 4-h wellness workshop and 34 students who did not attend (controls). RESULTS: Paired t tests indicated a significant improvement in nearly all dimensions related to quality of life, and prolonged fatigue in the case group who attended the workshop. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive wellness strategy that utilizes a holistic approach can play an important role in improving and promoting essential skills to improve healthcare provider’s self-assessment about the quality of life and reduce their prolonged fatigue. The critical importance of these needs has long been recognized, and this will also be crucial for addressing new challenges and emerging realities.","Gómez, Claudia; Lamas, Aura; Ramirez-Martinez, Flor Rocio; Blunk, Dan; Leiner, Marie",Med Sci Educ,609,16

The growing importance for securing such an ecosystem can be seen from DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks on e-learning components of the Croatian e-learning system. The negative impact of the conducted attack is visible in numerous users who were prevented from participating in and implementing the planned teaching process. Network anomalies such as conducted DDoS attacks were identified as one of the crucial threats to the e-learning systems. In this paper, an overview of the network anomaly phenomenon was given and botnets’ role in generating DDoS attacks, especially IoT device impact. The paper analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the e-learning systems in Croatia. Based on the conclusions, a research methodology has been proposed to develop a cyber-threat detection model that considers the specifics of the application of e-learning systems in crisis, distinguishing flash crowd events from anomalies in the communication network. The proposed methodology includes establishing a theoretical basis on DDoS and flash crowd event traffic, defining a laboratory testbed setup for data acquisition, development of DDoS detection model, and testing the applicability of the developed model on the case study. The implementation of the proposed methodology can improve the quality of the teaching process through timely DDoS detection and it gives other socio-economic contributions such as developing a specific research domain, publicly available dataset of network traffic, and raising the cyber-security of the e-learning systems.","Cvitić, Ivan; Peraković, Dragan; Periša, Marko; Jurcut, Anca D.",Mobile Netw Appl,609,27

The unique kinetics of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, with its significant presymptomatic transmission, presents an unprecedented challenge to our intuitions. In this context, a generalizable quantitative understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on disease control strategies is vital. We used a previously published time-dependent model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (He et al., 2020) to parameterize an epidemiological model of transmission, which was then used to explore the effect of various disease control measures. Our analysis suggests that using symptom-based isolation alone as a control strategy is ineffective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, in contrast to its effectiveness in other diseases, such as SARS and influenza. Additionally, timeliness of testing and tracing strategies to reduce time to isolation, along with widespread adoption of measures to limit transmission are critical for any containment strategy. Our findings suggest that for symptom-based isolation and testing strategies to be effective, reduced transmission is required, reinforcing the importance of measures to limit transmission. From a public health strategy perspective, our findings lend support to the idea that symptomatic isolation should not form the primary basis for COVID-19 disease control.","Johnson, K.

We have investigated the possibility of using the Stryker Flyte surgical helmet as a respiratory protective device against airborne- and droplet-transmitted disease, since the helmet shares many features with powered air-purifying respirators. Materials and methods — Using an aerosol particle generator, we determined the filtration capacity of the Stryker Flyte helmet by placing particle counters measuring the concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, and 5 µm particles inside and outside of the helmet. Results — We found that the helmet has insufficient capacity for filtrating aerosol particles, and, for 0.3 µm sized particles, we even recorded an accumulation of particles inside the helmet.

While zoonotic diseases originate from a reservoir, most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes, either exclusively humans or exclusively animals, without considering the importance of animal to human transmission (i.e. spillover transmission) for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple continuous time stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and that (ii) an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host.","Voinson, Marina; Alvergne, Alexandra; Billiard, Sylvain; Smadi, Charline",J Theor Biol,609,9

The purpose of present study is to investigate the wind induced air pollutant transmission and cross contamination routes in typical buildings. In this paper, a series of experiments was carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel using a 1:30 scaled model that represented the typical configuration of rectangular multi-storey residential buildings in Shanghai. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF(6)) was employed as tracer gas in the wind tunnel tests. The conditions under two ventilation modes, i.e. single-sided natural ventilation and cross natural ventilation, were compared. The tracer gas concentration distributions under four approaching wind angles were monitored and analyzed. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method was adopted to assist in analyzing airflow patterns. The experiment results elucidated that in the two ventilation scenarios, both of the vertical and horizontal inter-flat airborne transmission could proceed. The wind direction played a key role on the pollutant concentration distribution. Compared with the single-sided ventilation mode, cross ventilation could weaken the air pollutant dispersion along the vertical direction when the contamination source was on the windward or on the leeward unit. When the wind blowing parallelly to the source unit window, namely the source room was on the sideward, cross ventilation would not suppress the vertical transport on one hand, but reinforce the horizontal transmission on the other hand. The study is helpful for the analysis of infection risk of respiratory diseases in the residential buildings.","Mu, Di; Gao, Naiping; Zhu, Tong",Build Environ,609,28

Therefore the present work aims to analyze the risks associated with the time between the patient's first symptoms and hospitalization followed by death. A cross-sectional study was performed among Mexican population diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized from March to January 2021. Four different Bayesian models were developed to asses the risk associated with different patient trajectories: symptoms-hospitalization and hospitalization-death. Comorbidities that could worsen the patient outcome were included as linear predictions; these analyses were further broken down to the different states of the Mexican Republic and the healthcare providers within. Model III was chosen as the best performance through a validation of leaving one out (LOO). Increased risk for hospitalization was observed at the global population level for chronic renal disease, whereas for death such was the case for COPD and the interaction of diabetes:hypertension:obesity. Our results show that there are differences in mortality between the states without accounting for institution and it is related to the prompt time of death or viceversa. Regarding the 6 healthcare providers included in the analysis differences were also found. While state-managed hospitals and private sector showed lower risks, in contrast the IMSS seems to be the one with the highest risk. The proposed modelling can be helpful to improve healthcare assistance at a regional level, additionally it could inform statistical parameter inference in epidemiological models.","Diaz-Martinez, J.

However, the effect of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes, and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterized by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment is likely to alter the expression of the key entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the human kidney. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, Xiao; Eales, James M; Scannali, David; Nazgiewicz, Alicja; Prestes, Priscilla; Maier, Michelle; Denniff, Matthew; Xu, Xiaoguang; Saluja, Sushant; Cano-Gamez, Eddie; Wystrychowski, Wojciech; Szulinska, Monika; Antczak, Andrzej; Byars, Sean; Skrypnik, Damian; Glyda, Maciej; Król, Robert; Zywiec, Joanna; Zukowska-Szczechowska, Ewa; Burrell, Louise M; Woolf, Adrian S; Greenstein, Adam; Bogdanski, Pawel; Keavney, Bernard; Morris, Andrew P; Heagerty, Anthony; Williams, Bryan; Harrap, Stephen B; Trynka, Gosia; Samani, Nilesh J; Guzik, Tomasz J; Charchar, Fadi J; Tomaszewski, Maciej",Eur Heart J,609,26

We seek to examine the impact of clinical variables such as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) on mortality and need for intubation, as well as demographic variables such as age, sex, and race on persons with type 2 diabetes and COVID‐19. METHODS: Analyses were conducted on 4413 patients with an International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD‐10) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and COVID‐19. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan‐Meier curves and the log‐rank test to compare subgroup analyses. RESULTS: In this multivariate analysis, male gender, older age, and hyperglycemia at admission were associated with increased mortality and intubation, but this was not seen for race, ethnicity, insurance type, or HbA1c. Based on Kaplan‐Meier analysis, having comorbid conditions such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic levels at admission have a greater impact on health outcomes than HbA1c. Older men and those with comorbid disease are also at greater risk for mortality.

These are typically targeted at the process of tracheal intubation by a particular provider group in a restricted category of patients and reflect practice preferences in a particular geographical region. The existence of multiple distinct guidelines for some (but not other) closely related circumstances, increases complexity and may obscure the underlying principles that are common to all of them. This has the potential to increase cognitive load; promote the grouping of ideas in silos; impair teamwork; and ultimately compromise patient care. Development of a single set of airway management guidelines that can be applied across and beyond these domains may improve implementation; promote standardisation; and facilitate collaboration between airway practitioners from diverse backgrounds. A global multidisciplinary group of both airway operators and assistants was assembled. Over a 3‐year period, a review of the existing airway guidelines and multiple reviews of the primary literature were combined with a structured process for determining expert consensus. Any discrepancies between these were analysed and reconciled. Where evidence in the literature was lacking, recommendations were made by expert consensus. Using the above process, a set of evidence‐based airway management guidelines was developed in consultation with airway practitioners from a broad spectrum of disciplines and geographical locations. While consistent with the recommendations of the existing English language guidelines, these universal guidelines also incorporate the most recent concepts in airway management as well as statements on areas not widely addressed by the existing guidelines. The recommendations will be published in four parts that respectively address: airway evaluation; airway strategy; airway rescue and communication of airway outcomes.

Our risk equations account for the basic transmission probability of COVID-19 ([Formula: see text]) and the lowered risk due to various protection options: physical distancing; face coverings such as masks, goggles, face shields or other medical equipment; handwashing; and vaccination. We found that the outcome depends significantly on the degree of vaccine uptake: if uptake is higher than 80%, then the daily risk can be cut by 50% or more. However, if less than 40% of people get vaccinated and other protection options are abandoned—as may well happen in the wake of a COVID-19 vaccine—then introducing even an excellent vaccine will produce a worse outcome than our current situation.

The contagious nature of viruses such as COVID-19 warrants noncontact methods for physiological signal estimation. However, these approaches are subject to estimation biases due to variations in environmental conditions and subject demographics. The performance of contact-based wearable sensors has been evaluated, using off-the-shelf devices across demographics. However, the measurement uncertainty of rPPG methods that estimate pulse rate has not been sufficiently tested across diverse demographic populations or environments. Quantifying the efficacy of rPPG methods in real-world conditions is critical in determining their potential viability as health monitoring solutions. Currently, publicly available face datasets accompanied by physiological measurements are typically captured in controlled laboratory settings, lacking diversity in subject skin tones, age, and cultural artifacts (e.g, bindi worn by Indian women). In this study, we collect pulse rate and facial video data from human subjects in India and Sierra Leone, in order to quantify the uncertainty in noncontact pulse rate estimation methods. The video data are used to estimate pulse rate using state-of-the-art rPPG camera-based methods, and compared against ground truth measurements captured using an FDA-approved contact-based pulse rate measurement device. Our study reveals that rPPG methods exhibit similar biases when compared with a contact-based device across demographic groups and environmental conditions. The mean difference between pulse rates measured by rPPG methods and the ground truth is found to be ~2% (1 beats per minute (b.p.m.)), signifying agreement of rPPG methods with the ground truth. We also find that rPPG methods show pulse rate variability of ~15% (11 b.p.m.), as compared to the ground truth. We investigate factors impacting rPPG methods and discuss solutions aimed at mitigating variance.","Dasari, Ananyananda; Prakash, Sakthi Kumar Arul; Jeni, László A.; Tucker, Conrad S.",NPJ Digit Med,609,26

Respiratory viruses have been shown to modulate the host response to gain a replication advantage through a variety of mechanisms. Viruses are parasites and must co-opt host genes for replication, and must interface with host cellular machinery to achieve an optimal balance between viral and cellular gene expression. Host cells have numerous strategies to resist infection, replication and virus spread, and only recently are we beginning to understand the network and pathways affected. The following is a short review article covering some of the studies associated with the Tripp laboratory that have addressed how respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) operates at the virus-host interface to affects immune outcome and disease pathogenesis.","Tripp, Ralph A.",Immune Netw,609,29

METHODS: An email invitation was sent to 71 known contacts within networks across Public Health England, local authorities, health protection teams and contacts within the Department for Education. Following online publication of ‘My Back to School Bubble’, users were asked to provide informal feedback via an online survey to ask about their impressions of the story. RESULTS: Findings from the 31 responses highlighted that children are likely to hold differing feelings regarding COVID-19, depending on their own temperament and lockdown experiences, including changes in relationships with family and friends. Following the launch of ‘My Back to School Bubble’ e-storybook, 21 users provided feedback via survey. Fourteen respondents (67%) indicated that the storybook was a useful tool for providing support to children, and twelve (57%) reported that the resource helped children understand their own feelings. RECOMMENDATIONS: Clear, accurate information about the new school environment should be provided in the context of COVID-19. It is especially important to support children with special educational needs and disabilities, including those with autism. Encouraging children to take ownership of their health and hygiene behaviours, such as handwashing, will help to normalise this and prevent the spread of infection. Lessons learnt from the development of ‘My Back to School Bubble’ online storybook suggest the clarity of imagery could be improved to better support children with autism. Future work should focus on longitudinal and qualitative research. This should include the long-term effects of the pandemic on children’s development and education, effects on mental health and resilience, peer socialisation, and ability to cope with life-changing events.","Syeda, Rowshonara; Hann, Magdalena; Allison, Rosalie; Demirjian, Alicia",BMJ Paediatr Open,609,24

Methods: To reach this aim, we performed an online longitudinal survey recruiting 1,330 participants at Time 1 (at the beginning of the lockdown) and 308 participants at Time 2 (few days before the end of the lockdown). All filled out a set of questionnaires: demographic data, University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale−18 items, and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale−21 items. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling in two steps and controlling for age. First, hypotheses were tested on cross-sectional data. Then, a cross-lagged panel analysis was performed on longitudinal data. Results: Models obtained a good fit and evidenced the predictive role of loneliness levels on the three outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress). Moreover, we found that emotion dysregulation levels partially mediated the longitudinal relationship between loneliness and both depression and stress but not between loneliness and anxiety levels. Conclusions: This study points out that a central goal of clinical intervention could be the ability to regulate negative emotional states.","Velotti, Patrizia; Rogier, Guyonne; Beomonte Zobel, Sara; Castellano, Rosetta; Tambelli, Renata",Front Psychiatry,609,3

Such outbreaks would certainly be catastrophic for some of the best-ranked health systems and would be more catastrophic in countries with more fragile health systems. Accordingly, the World Health Organization and other organizations have been appealing to donor countries to support a rapid response plan. The primary objectives of this response plan are to appeal for funds from donors and to distribute these funds to the most affected countries based on the requirements. METHODS: In this study, we developed a mathematical model to provide initial insights into the efficient and equitable distribution of urgent funds to high-priority countries. Three phases were proposed for the construction of this mathematical model. In the first phase, the final epidemic sizes in all the target countries were predicted by using three epidemiological models. In the second phase, the urgent requirements for each country were estimated in parallel with the estimates issued by the humanitarian response plan, based on the size of the epidemic and several other factors. In the third and final phase, a multi-objective optimization model was proposed. The first objective was to maximize the funds from donors to cover all the requirements. The second objective was to minimize the unmet demands by ensuring a fair distribution of the urgent funds based on the requirements of the target countries. RESULTS: Predictions of the basic reproduction numbers and the final epidemic sizes were calculated for all target countries. The urgent requirements were estimated, and the requirements issued by the humanitarian response plan for all target countries were also considered. Moreover, a proposed response plan for the distribution network was demonstrated. Donors must provide urgent funds exceeding US$ 2,608,084,209 to cover at least 40 % of each target country’s requirements. Overall, results demonstrate the importance of an urgent and fair distribution of funds to the target countries to overcome the outbreak of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid responses by donor countries to humanitarian appeals will facilitate the immediate and fair distribution of relief supplies to the poorest countries. This distribution may help to support health systems, restrain the spread of COVID-19, and prevent an unlimited catastrophe.","Hezam, Ibrahim M.",ISA Trans,609,9

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: A rural college town in central Pennsylvania. SUBJECTS: Adult residents without minor children. MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccination intention. Secondary measures included vaccination attitudes, norms, efficacy, past behavior, trust in the vaccination process, and sociodemographic variables of education, financial standing, political viewpoint, and religiosity. ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics were used to describe quantitative data. Multivariate ordinal regression was used to model predictors of vaccine intention. RESULTS: Of 950 respondents, 55% were ""very likely"" and 20% ""somewhat likely"" to take a coronavirus vaccine, even though 70% had taken the flu vaccine since September 2019. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance were trust in the system evaluating vaccines and perceptions of local COVID-19 vaccination norms. The strongest predictors of negative vaccine intentions were worries about unknown side-effects and positive attitudes toward natural infection. Sociodemographic factors, political views, and religiosity did not predict vaccine intentions. CONCLUSION: Fewer adults intend to take a coronavirus vaccine than currently take the flu vaccine. Traditional sociodemographic factors may not be effective predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Although based on a small sample, the study adds to our limited understanding of COVID-19-specific vaccine confidence among some rural Americans and suggests that traditional public health vaccination campaigns based on sociodemographic characteristics may not be effective.","Lennon, Robert P; Small, Meg L; Smith, Rachel A; Van Scoy, Lauren J; Myrick, Jessica G; Martin, Molly A; Group, Data Action Research",Am J Health Promot,609,22

From the beginning, the international scientific community employed several strategies to tackle the spread of this disease. Most notably, these consisted of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the discovery of antiviral agents through the repositioning of already known drugs with methods such as de novo design. Previously, methylthiomorphic compounds, designed by our group as antihypertensive agents, have been shown to display an affinity with the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme) receptor, a key mechanism required for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) entry into target cells. Therefore, the objective of this work consists of evaluating, in silico, the inhibitory activity of these compounds between the ACE2 receptor and the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Supported by the advances of different research groups on the structure of the coronavirus spike and the interaction of the latter with its receptor, ACE2, we carried out a computational study that examined the effect of in-house designed compounds on the inhibition of said interaction.

Aspectos destacados y controversias,16.71069,1.0750991,2021,"BACKGROUND: A key strategy for mitigating the current opioid epidemic is expanded access to medications for treating opioid use disorder (MOUD). However, interventions developed to expand MOUD access have limited ability to engage opioid users at higher levels of overdose risk, such as those who inject opioids. This paper describes the study protocol for testing STAMINA (Syringe Service Telemedicine Access for Medication-assisted Intervention through NAvigation), an intervention that engages high-risk opioid users at community-based syringe service programs (SSP) and quickly links them to MOUD using a telemedicine platform. METHODS: This randomized control trial will be conducted at three SSP sites in Chicago. All participants will complete an initial assessment with a provider from a Federally Qualified Health Center who can prescribe or refer MOUD services as appropriate. The control arm will receive standard referral to treatment and the intervention arm will receive immediate telemedicine linkage to the provider and (depending on the type of MOUD prescribed) provided transportation to pick up their induction prescription (for buprenorphine or naltrexone) or attend their intake appointment (for methadone). We aim to recruit a total of 273 participants over two years to provide enough power to detect a difference in our primary outcome of MOUD treatment linkage. Secondary outcomes include treatment engagement, treatment retention, and non-MOUD opioid use. Data will be collected using structured interviews and saliva drug tests delivered at baseline, three months, and six months. Fixed and mixed effects generalized linear regression analyses and survival analysis will be conducted to compare the probabilities of a successful treatment linkage between the two arms, days retained in treatment, and post-baseline opioid and other drug use. DISCUSSION: If successful, STAMINA’s telemedicine approach will significantly reduce the amount of time between SSP clients’ initial indication of interest in the medication and treatment initiation. Facilitating this process will likely lead to stronger additional treatment- and recovery-oriented outcomes. This study is also timely given the need for more rigorous testing of telemedicine interventions in light of temporary regulatory changes that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The surveillance enables the implementation of measures to protect the populations’ health. Therefore, relevant information needs to be provided in a timely and target-group-specific manner to the respective stakeholders. A dissemination strategy supports the effective communication of results and considers three key questions: (1) “What content is relevant to the surveillance?”, (2) “Who requires which information?” and (3) “How are the results disseminated to the target audience?” In this context, digitalisation allows for novel possibilities in the design of publication formats. Since 2015, diabetes surveillance has been established at the Robert Koch Institute. Within a structured process of consensus, we defined four fields of action relevant for health policy including 40 indicators. Thereafter, we developed the first publication formats in collaboration with the scientific advisory board of the project that reflected novel possibilities offered by digitalisation. In addition to articles in scientific journals, the essential formats of the first project phase comprise the report “Diabetes in Germany” and a website including interactive visualisations of results. Additional posts on Twitter and YouTube are used to increase coverage. In addition to the further development of the indicator set, the focus of the next project phase is the advancement of the dissemination towards user- and action-oriented reporting.

They possess a rigorously ordered structure, come in a variety of shapes, and present unique surface elements, such as spikes. These attributes facilitate propitious biodistribution, the crossing of complex biological barriers and a minutely coordinated interaction with cells. Due to the orchestrated sequence of interactions of their stringently arranged particle corona with cellular surface receptors they effectively identify and infect their host cells with utmost specificity, while evading the immune system at the same time. Furthermore, their efficacy is enhanced by their response to stimuli and the ability to spread from cell to cell. Over the years, great efforts have been made to mimic distinct viral traits to improve biomedical nanomaterial performance. However, a closer look at the literature reveals that no comprehensive evaluation of the benefit of virus-mimetic material design on the targeting efficiency of nanomaterials exists. In this review we, therefore, elucidate the impact that viral properties had on fundamental advances in outfitting nanomaterials with the ability to interact specifically with their target cells. We give a comprehensive overview of the diverse design strategies and identify critical steps on the way to reducing them to practice.

In comparison, genotypes of rs4588 and rs12794714 did not show any significant difference neither in total nor in free 25(OH)D level. Post hoc test revealed that total 25(OH)D was lower in the rs7041 TT allele compared to the GG allele (P = 0.022). Chi-square test showed that vitD status was associated with rs7041 genotypes (P = 0.035). In addition, rs7041 minor alleles were found to have an association with vitD deficiency with a statistical significant odds ratio (>1) of 2.24 and 3.51 with P = 0.006 and P = 0.007 for TG and GG genotypes respectively. CONCLUSION: The rs7041 SNP in GC was associated with total 25(OH)D level in postmenopausal women in Saudi Arabia, while rs4588 in GC and rs12794714 in CYP2R1 did not show association with total 25(OH)D. Further studies exploring additional variants in vitD related genes are needed to understand genetic factors underlying vitD deficiency in Saudi population.","Alharazy, Shatha; Naseer, Muhammad Imran; Alissa, Eman; Robertson, M.

The cause of the plague of Athens continues to be debated. Infectious diseases most often cited as causes of the plague include influenza, epidemic typhus, typhoid fever, bubonic plague, smallpox, and measles. Thucydides provides the only available description of the plague of Athens. Given the nuances of the translation, bubonic plague, smallpox, and measles are the most likely causes of the plague. In my view, measles is the most likely cause of the plague of Athens.","Cunha, Burke A.",Infect Dis Clin North Am,609,20

Health prevention measures to contain the outbreak are profoundly affecting the physical and mental health as well as personal freedom of the population. AIM: To evaluate psychiatric emergencies in a 6-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to those of the corresponding period of the previous year. METHODS: This monocentric observational study preliminarily collected variables of the urgent psychiatric consultations (UPCs) carried out in emergency room (ER) from 1-3-2020 to 31-8-2020 and the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who required UPCs in the 6-month period, comparing these data with those collected from 1-3-2019 to 31-8-2019. The data, collected in alpha-numeric code, were statistically analyzed through STATA 12-2011. RESULTS: This research reported a reduction of both UPCs and hospital psychiatric admissions. Concomitantly, we observed an increase of UPCs required by people already being treated by psychiatric and other health services, residents in psychiatric facilities and non-Italians. In 2020, differently from 2019, the most frequent reasons for urgent psychiatric consultations were aggressive behavior and adjustment disorders with anxiety and depressive mood. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that, during the COVID-19 epidemic, urgent psychiatric consultations in ER were reduced, except for the most vulnerable people due to their clinical and/or social conditions.","Di Lorenzo, Rosaria; Frattini, Nicoletta; Dragone, Diego; Farina, Riccardo; Luisi, Filippa; Ferrari, Silvia; Bandiera, Geminiano; Rovesti, Sergio; Ferri, Paola",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,609,14

Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood‐mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. On the basis of the likelihood‐mapping analysis, the increasing tree‐like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019‐nCoV in human hosts. We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019‐nCoV strains. The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019‐nCoV ranged from 1.7926 × 10(−3) to 1.8266 × 10(−3) substitutions per site per year. On the basis of our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019‐nCOV transmission in real‐time.","Li, Xingguang; Wang, Wei; Zhao, Xiaofang; Zai, Junjie; Zhao, Qiang; Li, Yi; Chaillon, Antoine",J Med Virol,609,5

METHODS: We performed a single‐center, prospective, observational study of 4 pulse oximetry devices, 3 of which are commercially available to the public. A convenience sample of 200 emergency department (ED) patients with chief complaints of cardiopulmonary origin or a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ≤ 94 percent were enrolled. Analysis of variance was performed to compare SpO2s and test characteristics of the 3 devices compared to control. RESULTS: Although differences in measured SpO2s were observed (P < 0.001) across groups, the differences were small (mean differences ranged from 1.00% to 1.87%). The correlation between test devices and the control were high (r range 0.70–0.79). Although the test characteristics were not perfect, the devices did have good sensitivity using a cutoff value of 94% (sensitivity ranging from 90% to 92%), which improved with lower SpO2 cutoff values to 92% (sensitivity ranging from 96% to 97%). CONCLUSION: The 3 commercially available devices were accurate enough to be clinically useful when compared to a hospital bedside monitor pulse oximeter. Consumer‐grade portable pulse oximeters may be useful if overwhelming numbers of patients require oxygen saturation monitoring, such as during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Schrading, Walter A.; McCafferty, Ben; Grove, Jordan; Page, David B.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,609,33

Students were administered a pre-course test on their perceived confidence of their urologic knowledge, confidence in identifying urologic conditions, comfort with performing urologic evaluations, and confidence placing consults for urologic issues. Students participated in a two-week curriculum that included both asynchronous and synchronous content. Asynchronous content included pre-recorded lectures, self-paced problem-based learning (PBL) modules, directed reading and video content, and an online discussion board. Synchronous content included real-time videoconferences covering case discussions, simulated patient presentations, and critical literature reviews. At the conclusion of the course, students were administered the post-course survey evaluating changes in their ability to identify and understand urologic conditions. RESULTS: The post-course survey demonstrated this course significantly increases students’ scores in: self-perceived urologic knowledge, confidence in naming urologic conditions, comfort with performing urologic evaluations, and confidence placing consults for urologic conditions (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual medical student rotations are scalable and effective at delivering surgical material and can approximate the interpersonal teaching found in clinical learning environments. They may be a useful tool to supplement or augment clinical learning in select situations.","Williams, Cheyenne; Familusi, Olivia O; Ziemba, Justin; Lee, Daniel; Mittal, Sameer; Mucksavage, Phillip; Smith, Ariana; Kovell, Robert Caleb",Urology,609,16

Conventional silicone sheet therapy has a positive effect on the healing process of HSs. However, the dimensions of the silicone sheet are typically larger than those of the HS itself which may negatively impact the healthy skin that surrounds the HS. Furthermore, the debonding and displacement of the silicone sheet from the skin are critical problems that affect treatment compliance. Herein, we propose a bespoke HS treatment design that integrates pressure sleeve with a silicone sheet and use of silicone gel using a workflow of three-dimensional (3D) printing, 3D scanning and computer-aided design, and manufacturing software. A finite element analysis (FEA) is used to optimize the control of the pressure distribution and investigate the effects of the silicone elastomer. The result shows that the silicone elastomer increases the amount of exerted pressure on the HS and minimizes unnecessary pressure to other parts of the wrist. Based on this treatment design, a silicone elastomer that perfectly conforms to an HS is printed and attached onto a customized pressure sleeve. Most importantly, unlimited scar treating gel can be applied as the means to optimize treatment of HSs while the silicone sheet is firmly affixed and secured by the pressure sleeve.","Chow, Lung; Yick, Kit-lun; Sun, Yue; Leung, Matthew S.
