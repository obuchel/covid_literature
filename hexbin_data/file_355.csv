2423,Contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment by healthcare providers,2015-09-30,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to describe the processes of both the donning and the doffing of personal protective equipment for Ebola and evaluate contamination during the doffing process. METHODS: We recruited study participants among physicians and nurses of the emergency department of Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea. Participants were asked to carry out doffing and donning procedures with a helper after a 50-minute brief training and demonstration based on the 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol. Two separate cameras with high-density capability were set up, and the donning and doffing processes were video-taped. A trained examiner inspected all video recordings and coded for intervals, errors, and contaminations defined as the outside of the equipment touching the clinician’s body surface. RESULTS: Overall, 29 participants were enrolled. Twenty (68.9%) were female, and the mean age was 29.2 years. For the donning process, the average interval until the end was 234.2 seconds (standard deviation [SD], 65.7), and the most frequent errors occurred when putting on the outer gloves (27.5%), respirator (20.6%), and hood (20.6%). For the doffing process, the average interval until the end was 183.7 seconds (SD, 38.4), and the most frequent errors occurred during disinfecting the feet (37.9%), discarding the scrubs (17.2%), and putting on gloves (13.7%), respectively. During the doffing process, 65 incidences of contamination occurred (2.2 incidents/person). The most vulnerable processes were removing respirators (79.2%), removing the shoe covers (65.5%), and removal of the hood (41.3%). CONCLUSION: A significant number of contaminations occur during the doffing process of personal protective equipment.","Lim, Seong Mi; Cha, Won Chul; Chae, Minjung Kathy; Jo, Ik Joon",Clin Exp Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052842/,355

The aims of this study were to estimate burnout, perceived stress, job satisfaction, coping and general health levels experienced by nurses working in emergency departments in Spain and to analyze the relationships between sociodemographic, occupational, and psychological variables and the occurrence of burnout syndrome among these professionals. A cross-sectional study was conducted in four emergency departments in Andalusia (Spain) from March to December 2016. The study sample was composed of n = 171 nurses. An ad hoc questionnaire was prepared to collect sociodemographic and work data, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Font–Roja Questionnaire, the Brief Cope Orientation to Problem Experience and the General Health Questionnaire were used. The prevalence of high burnout was 8.19%. The levels of perceived stress and job satisfaction were moderate. The most frequent clinical manifestations were social dysfunction and somatic symptoms, and problem-focused coping was the strategy most used by nurses. Lack of physical exercise, gender, years worked at an emergency department, anxiety, social dysfunction, and avoidance coping were significant predictors of the dimensions of burnout.","Portero de la Cruz, Silvia; Cebrino, Jesús; Herruzo, Javier; Vaquero-Abellán, Manuel",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7230883/,355
11994,An Urgent Need for “Common Cold Units” to Study COVID-19,2020-04-09,"Computational identification of ribosomal frameshift sites in genomic sequences is difficult due to their diverse nature, yet it provides useful information for understanding the underlying mechanisms and discovering new genes. We have developed an algorithm that searches entire genomic or mRNA sequences for frameshifting sites, and implements the algorithm as a web-based program called FSFinder (Frameshift Signal Finder). The current version of FSFinder is capable of finding −1 frameshift sites on heptamer sequences X XXY YYZ, and +1 frameshift sites for two genes: protein chain release factor B (prfB) and ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (oaz). We tested FSFinder on ∼190 genomic and partial DNA sequences from a number of organisms and found that it predicted frameshift sites efficiently and with greater sensitivity and specificity than existing approaches. It has improved sensitivity because it considers many known components of a frameshifting cassette and searches these components on both + and − strands, and its specificity is increased because it focuses on overlapping regions of open reading frames and prioritizes candidate frameshift sites. FSFinder is useful for discovering unknown genes that utilize alternative decoding, as well as for analyzing frameshift sites.

15189,Anti-fogging techniques as part of personal protective equipment (PPE),2020-12-12,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is one of the most common and debilitating health conditions. Treatments for chronic low back pain typically focus on biomedical treatment approaches. While psychosocial treatments exist, multiple barriers prevent broad access. There is a significant unmet need for integrative, easily accessible, non-opioid solutions for chronic pain. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology allowing innovation in the delivery of behavioral pain treatments. Behavioral skills-based VR is effective at facilitating pain management and reducing pain-related concerns. Continued research on these emerging approaches is needed. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled trial, we seek to test the efficacy of a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program as a nonpharmacological home-based pain management treatment for people with chronic low back pain (cLBP). METHODS: We will randomize 180 individuals with cLBP to 1 of 2 VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (8-week skills-based VR program); or (2) Sham VR (control condition). All participants will receive a VR headset to minimize any biases related to the technology’s novelty. The Sham VR group had 2D neutral content in a 3D theater-like environment. Our primary outcome is average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep. Our secondary outcomes include patient-reported physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, health utilization, medication use, and user satisfaction. We hypothesize superiority for the skills-based VR program in all of these measures compared to the control condition. Team statisticians blinded to treatment assignment will assess outcomes up to 6 months posttreatment using an approach suitable for the longitudinal nature of the data. RESULTS: The study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board on July 2, 2020. The protocol (NCT04415177) was registered on May 27, 2020. Recruitment for this study was completed in July 2020, and data collection will remain active until March 2021. In total, 186 participants were recruited. Multiple manuscripts will be generated from this study. The primary manuscript will be submitted for publication in the winter of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Effectively delivering behavioral treatments in VR could overcome barriers to care and provide scalable solutions to chronic pain’s societal burden. Our study could help shape future research and development of these innovative approaches.

40717,Perspectives – One survey to rule them all,2020-10-10,"ISSUE: For several weeks, prophylactic messages against the extension of Covid-19 have saturated the public space. To protect populations, efficient measures have been rapidly put to limit the movement of people and manufactured goods. These policies have reduced global greenhouse gas emissions as well as air pollution, especially in China. PROBLEM: If climate change were an epidemic, we would probably have already restored it. But it results directly from the thermo-industrial activities linked to the consumption society. For Friel (Lancet, 2020), the dramatic consequences of this disturbances have to be considered as an essential health issue. She advocates for 'climate change and health alliances'. RESULTS: Within such alliances, health professionals have the responsibility (1) to describe the morbidity inherent in our thermo-industrial societies (2) to alert populations, and (3) to work with allies to tackle climate change and protect human populations, starting with the most vulnerable. This type of alliance is underway in the battle against air pollution, as it has been for years for fighting smoking. Alliances are intended to extend to all population health issues, with a complete decompartmentalization of minds and practices at large scale. LESSONS: Health professionals have to be mindful not to cause any harm while practicing. The health system alone produces up to 8% of global greenhouse gas in developed countries (Pichler, 2019; HCWH, 2019). There is room for action. Since 2009, the British health care system (NHS) has adopted an efficient decarbonation policy, reducing global emission from 8 to 4%, but this outstanding initiative remains an exception worldwide. KEY MESSAGES: A review of public health strategies is necessary to meet the energy, environmental and health issues, both in terms of health risks due to climate change and of decarbonation of care activities. Health professionals have the responsibility to alert populations and to work with allies to tackle climate change and protect human populations.","Marrauld, L; Cucchi, M; Lainey, E; Depoux, A",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543579/,355
53271,617 Does Wearing Enhanced Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) In Theatre Increase Surgeon Workload and Patient Morbidity?,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims COVID-19 has reinforced the necessity for a faster and more accurate diagnostic pathway for suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA) patients so that unnecessary use of glucocorticoids can be avoided/minimised. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we replaced a twice weekly service with a 5 day per week ultrasound-based fast-track pathway within a secondary/tertiary hospital. The aim was to determine the impact of a more frequent diagnostic service for GCA, based on rapid access to ultrasound and clinical evaluation on the diagnostic certainty in evaluating patients with newly suspected GCA. Methods We reviewed records from patients referred between November 2019 to July 2020, comparing those seen during 17 weeks ‘pre-COVID’, using the twice weekly service, with patients seen during 17 weeks of a 5 day per week service, termed ‘intra-COVID’. All patients underwent clinical evaluation and an eight-site ultrasound of temporal and axillary arteries. Those with hypoechoic, non-compressible peri-luminal arterial wall-thickening (or halo sign) were considered ultrasound ‘positive’. Results We audited 139 patients with suspected GCA (63 pre-COVID period vs 76 intra-COVID). A clinical diagnosis of GCA was made in 33.3% pre-COVID and 42% intra-COVID (p = 0.289). Ultrasound sensitivity improved from 38.1% to 68.6% (p < 0.0001), whilst specificity remained unchanged (100%, p < 0.0001) for both periods. The proportion of patients seen within seven days of referral improved by 61.6% (p < 0.0001), from 31.7% (pre-COVID) to 93.3% (intra-COVID). The median number of days from referral to assessment fell over four-fold, from 12.5 (interquartile range [IQR]=8.25) to 3 (IQR=3.5) respectively. Median number of days of steroid exposure fell over seven-fold from 15 days (IQR=11.25) pre-COVID to 2 days (IQR=5) intra-COVID. Similar proportions in both periods were empirically commenced on steroids prior to assessment (71% vs 68% respectively, p = 0.700). Mean number of ‘halos’ increased from 0.25 (standard deviation [SD]1.19) pre-COVID to 3.05 (SD = 1.82) intra-COVID. The was no significant difference in the number of GCA visual complications (p = 0.894). Ultrasound positivity was associated with fewer days of steroid exposure: the median number of days on steroids in negative versus positive scans was 16 and 5.5 (pre-COVID); compared to 2.5 and 1 days (intra-COVID). The proportion of patients without GCA who were empirically commenced on steroids reduced from 71.4% to 56.8% (pre-COVID vs intra-COVID, p = 0.158) and median days steroid exposure reduced from 9.5 (IQR=17.5) to 1 (IQR=5), respectively. Conclusion A regular, daily ultrasound service for diagnosing suspected GCA significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced unnecessary steroid exposure in patients who did not have GCA. The sensitivity of ultrasound improved by 30.5% and the delay from steroid exposure to diagnosis was reduced by 76%. An ultrasound-based daily fast-track service significantly improved the diagnostic certainty of suspected GCA, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when availability of temporal artery biopsy was very limited.

58668,Cetylpyridinium Chloride mouthwashes: potential role in COVID-19 control,2021-10-06,"Background: The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is usually used in epidemiological studies to assess food consumption. However, the FFQ must have good accuracy, requiring its validation and reproducibility for the target population. Thus, this study aimed to describe the construction of the online Food Frequency Questionnaire (oFFQ) used at the Cohort of Universities of Minas Gerais (CUME project, Brazil) and evaluate its validity and reproducibility. Methods: The oFFQ was answered two times in 1 year (March/August 2018—March/April 2019; n = 108 participants—reproducibility), and four 24-h dietary recalls (24hRs) were applied in two seasons of the southern hemisphere [two 24hRs in autumn (March/June 2018) and two 24hRs in winter (August/September 2018); n = 146 participants—validity]. To assess the validity and reproducibility, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated. Results: The oFFQ had 144 food items separated into eight groups (dairy products; meat and fish; cereals and legumes; fruits; vegetables; fats and oils; drinks; other foods). In assessing the validity, ICCs for energy and macronutrients were considered moderate, ranging from 0.41 (energy) to 0.59 (protein), while the ICCs for micronutrients were considered low to moderate, ranging from 0.25 (fibers) to 0.65 (vitamin B6). Regarding reproducibility assessment, ICCs for energy and all the assessed items were considered moderate to excellent, ranging from 0.60 (vegetables) to 0.91 (vitamin E and retinol). Conclusions: The self-reported oFFQ had satisfactory validity and reproducibility. So, it can be used to analyze the association between food consumption and chronic diseases in the participants of the Cohort of Universities of Minas Gerais (CUME project—Brazil).","Azarias, Heloísa Gambarelli de Araújo; Marques-Rocha, José Luiz; Miranda, Aline Elizabeth da Silva; dos Santos, Luana Caroline; Gomes Domingos, Ana Luíza; Hermsdorff, Helen Hermana Miranda; Bressan, Josefina; de Oliveira, Fernando Luiz Pereira; Leal, Arieta Carla Gualandi; Pimenta, Adriano Marçal",Front Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8495245/,355

In this multicentre observational study of 152 consecutive patients (≥18 years) with severe COVID-19 supported by veno-venous (VV) ECMO in four UK commissioned centres during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March to 31 May 2020), we assessed the incidence of major bleeding and thrombosis and their association with 180-day mortality. Median age (range) was 47 years (23-65) and 75% were male. Overall, the 180-day survival was 70·4% (107/152). The rate of major bleeding was 30·9% (47/152), of which intracranial bleeding (ICH) was 34% (16/47). There were 96 thrombotic events (63·1%) consisting of venous 44·7% [68/152 of which 66·2% were pulmonary embolism (PE)], arterial 18·6% (13/152) and ECMO circuit thrombosis 9·9% (15/152). In multivariate analysis, only raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the initiation of VV ECMO was associated with an increased risk of thrombosis [hazard ratio (HR) 1·92, 95% CI 1·21-3·03]. Major bleeding and ICH were associated with 3·87-fold (95% CI 2·10-7·23) and 5·97-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 2·36-15·04] increased risk of mortality and PE with a 2·00-fold (95% CI1·09-3·56) risk of mortality.

OBJECTIVES The main objective of this study was to monitor the genetic diversity of the H5N1 viruses in LBMs in Indonesia. METHODS Therefore, the disease surveillance was conducted in the area of Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Jakarta Province, Indonesia from 2014 to 2019. Subsequently, the genetic characterization of the H5N1 viruses was performed by sequencing all 8 segments of the viral genome. RESULTS As a result, the H5N1 viruses were detected in most of LBMs in both bird' cloacal and environmental samples, in which about 35% of all samples were positive for influenza A and, subsequently, about 52% of these samples were positive for H5 subtyping. Based on the genetic analyses of 14 viruses isolated from LBMs, genetic diversities of the H5N1 viruses were identified including clades 2.1.3 and 2.3.2 as typical predominant groups as well as reassortant viruses between these 2 clades. CONCLUSIONS As a consequence, zoonotic transmission to humans in the market could be occurred from the exposure of infected birds and/or contaminated environments. Moreover, new virus variants could emerge from the LBM environment. Therefore, improving pandemic preparedness raised great concerns related to the zoonotic aspect of new influenza variants because of its high adaptivity and efficiency for human infection.","Dharmayanti, Ni Luh Putu Indi; Hewajuli, Dyah Ayu; Ratnawati, Atik; Hartawan, Risza",Journal of veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2020.21.e56; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735094/,355
76211,Roles and Responsibilities of Nurses in Advance Care Planning in Palliative Care in the Acute Care Setting-A Scoping Review.,2020-12-05,"The 5' end of eukaryotic mRNA contains the type-1 (m7GpppNm) or type-2 (m7GpppNmNm) cap structure. Many viruses have evolved various mechanisms to develop their own capping enzymes (e.g. flavivirus and coronavirus) or to 'steal' caps from host mRNAs (e.g. influenza virus). Other viruses have developed 'cap-mimicking' mechanisms by attaching a peptide to the 5' end of viral RNA (e.g. picornavirus and calicivirus) or by having a complex 5' RNA structure (internal ribosome entry site) for translation initiation (e.g. picornavirus, pestivirus and hepacivirus). Here we review the diverse viral RNA capping mechanisms. Using flavivirus as a model, we summarize how a single methyltransferase catalyses two distinct N-7 and 2'-O methylations of viral RNA cap in a sequential manner. For antiviral development, a structural feature unique to the flavivirus methyltransferase was successfully used to design selective inhibitors that block viral methyltransferase without affecting host methyltransferases. Functionally, capping is essential for prevention of triphosphate-triggered innate immune activation; N-7 methylation is critical for enhancement of viral translation; and 2'-O methylation is important for subversion of innate immune response during viral infection. Flaviviruses defective in 2'-O methyltransferase are replicative, but their viral RNAs lack 2'-O methylation and are recognized and eliminated by the host immune response. Such mutant viruses could be rationally designed as live attenuated vaccines. This concept has recently been proved with Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus. The findings obtained with flavivirus should be applicable to other RNA viruses.","Dong, Hongping; Fink, Katja; Züst, Roland; Lim, Siew Pheng; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Shi, Pei-Yong",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.062208-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486628/,355

MS2 coliphage was used as a surrogate for pathogenic viruses. A viral droplet test system was constructed, and the size distribution of viral droplets loaded directly onto respirators was characterized using an aerodynamic particle sizer. The sizes ranged from 0.5 to 15 mum, and the sizes of the majority of the droplets were the range from 0.74 to 3.5 mum. The results also showed that the droplet test system generated similar droplet concentrations (particle counts) at different respirator locations. The test system was validated by studying the relative efficiencies of decontamination of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and UV irradiation with droplets containing MS2 virus on filtering facepiece respirators. It was hypothesized that more potent decontamination treatments would result in corresponding larger decreases in the number of viable viruses recovered from the respirators. Sodium hypochlorite doses of 2.75 to 5.50 mg/liter with a 10-min decontamination period resulted in approximately 3- to 4-log reductions in the level of MS2 coliphage. When higher sodium hypochlorite doses (> or =8.25 mg/liter) were used with the same contact time that was used for the dilute solutions containing 2.75 to 5.50 mg/liter, all MS2 was inactivated. For UV decontamination at a wavelength of 254 nm, an approximately 3-log reduction in the level of MS2 virus was achieved with dose of 4.32 J/cm(2) (3 h of contact time with a UV intensity of 0.4 mW/cm(2)), while with higher doses of UV irradiation (> or =7.20 J/cm(2); UV intensity, 0.4 mW/cm(2); contact times, > or =5 h), all MS2 was inactivated.

OPLS models were developed demonstrating good accuracy for multiple analytes at both scales. Furthermore, the 50L SUB prototype enabled on-line monitoring without the need for sterilisation of the probe prior to use and minimal light interference was observed. We also demonstrate the ability to build robust models due to induced changes that are hard and costly to perform at large scale and the potential of transferring these models across the scales. The implementation of this technology enables integration of spectroscopy at the small scale for better process understanding and generation of robust models over a large design space while facilitating model transfer throughout the scales enabling continuity throughout process development and utilisation and transfer of ever-increasing data generation from development to manufacturing.","Rowland-Jones, Ruth C; Graf, Alexander; Woodhams, Angus; Diaz-Fernandez, Paloma; Warr, Steve; Soeldner, Robert; Finka, Gary; Hoehse, Marek",Biotechnology progress,https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.3074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32865874/,355

The goal was to evaluate the effects of a theory driven group intervention to cultivate mental health and flourishing. Design: A pre post design with three groups (151 individuals) was conducted, including an experimental group that received the intervention during the pandemic, a pre-COVID intervention group, and a COVID control group. Main Outcome Measures: Based on Keyes' concept of positive mental health, measures of subjective, psychological and social well-being were obtained, as well as an indicator of psychological distress (GHQ12). Results: Intervention groups showed an increase in well-being and the COVID control group a decrease. Change scores revealed significant differences. Overall percentage of individuals at risk of ill health in baseline was 25.2%, but after the intervention, the COVID control group reached 64.1%. Conclusions: Despite the limitations, the present findings suggest that interventions to sustain and improve mental health in times of crisis and adversity can be an effective approach.","Gorbeña, Susana; Gómez, Ignacio; Govillard, Leila; Sarrionandia, Sare; Macía, Patricia; Penas, Patricia; Iraurgi, Ioseba",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1936520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121544/,355
109778,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Healthcare Professionals.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND The frequent incidence of fungal infection and widespread of antibiotic resistance are emergent concerns in public health. Hence, there is a need to harness the potential of natural bioactive compounds from plant towards treatment of fungal infection. Combination effect of antibiotic creams with natural products from plants is prospective strategy to produce new antifungal agent. This study therefore, revealed antifungal effect of combined Antifungal Creams (AFCs) with Turmeric Essential Oil (TEO) or Aloe vera Gel (AVG). METHODS Phytochemicals and bioactive compounds in TEO and AVG were revealed using GC-MS. Bioactive compounds in plant extracts were compared to known compounds in database library of National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S.). Antifungal activity and synergistic effect of AFCs with TEO or AVG were carried out using agar well diffusion method. RESULTS Phenol, flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids and cardiac glycosides were present in TEO and AVG. GCMS revealed thirty-six (36) and eighteen (18) bioactive compounds in TEO and AVG, respectively. AFCs displayed zones of inhibition with values ranged from 5.0 to 14.3 mm, TEO was 5.0 to 11.0 mm and AVG was 8.0 to 11.7 mm against tested fungi. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) by AFCs, TEO and AVG ranged from 1.25 to 10.0 mg/ml. Combinatory effects of AFCs with TEO or AVG revealed synergistic and indifferent properties. CONCLUSION Development of novel products using bioactive ingredients from plants with commercially available AFCs will serve as potential alternative therapy to cure dermatological infections with no side effects.","Ogidi, Clement Olusola; Ojo, Ayokunbi Elizabeth; Ajayi-Moses, Oluwatayo Benjamin; Aladejana, Oluwatoyin Modupe; Thonda, Oluwakemi Abike; Akinyele, Bamidele Juliet",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03205-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509168/,355

113705,Outcomes of Conservative Management of Acute Appendicitis during COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-01-01,"Expanded polystyrene (EPS) has excellent thermal insulation properties and is widely applied in building energy conservation. However, these thermal insulation materials have caused numerous fires because of flammability. Pyrolysis is necessary to support combustion, and more attention should be paid to the pyrolysis characteristics of EPS. Moreover, pyrolysis is considered to be an effective method for recycling solid waste. Pyrolysis kinetics of EPS were analyzed by thermogravimetric experiments, both in nitrogen and air atmospheres. A new method was proposed to couple the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa model-free method and the model-fitting method called the Coats-Redfern as well as the particle swarm optimization (PSO) global algorithm to establish reaction mechanisms and their corresponding kinetic parameters. It was found that the pyrolysis temperature of EPS was concentrated at 525-800 K. The activation energy of EPS in nitrogen was about 163 kJ/mol, which was higher than that in air (109.63 kJ/mol). Furthermore, coupled with Coats-Redfern method, reaction functions g(α) = 1 - (1 - α)3 and g(α) = 1 - (1 - α)1/4 should be responsible for nitrogen and air reactions, respectively. The PSO algorithm was applied to compute detailed pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Kinetic parameters could be used in further large-scale fire simulation and provide guidance for reactor design.","Ni, Xiaoyang; Wu, Zheng; Zhang, Wenlong; Lu, Kaihua; Ding, Yanming; Mao, Shaohua",Polymers,https://doi.org/10.3390/polym12081744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764279/,355

117424,Outcomes of Conservative Management of Acute Appendicitis during COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-01-01,"Introduction Student-run clinics can supplement medical education by exposing students to diverse clinical scenarios and collaborating with underresourced populations. We examined the impact of volunteering at THRIVE, a student-run bridge clinic located within sheltered housing for individuals with substance use disorder, on students' attitudes toward people experiencing homelessness (PEH). Methods This cohort study analyzed pre- and postsurvey matched responses from nonvolunteer and volunteer first-year medical students utilizing the Health Professional Attitudes Towards the Homeless (HPATHI) tool, totaled into three subcategories: Cynicism, Social Advocacy, and Personal Advocacy. We evaluated the association between change in scores and volunteering utilizing Student t tests and adjusting for participant characteristics using multivariable regression analysis. Results We received 106 responses (53% response rate); 58 students (55%) volunteered at the clinic and were mostly female (62%), White (52%), and had previous experience working with PEH (71%). The mean change in Personal Advocacy scores was higher for volunteers compared to nonvolunteers, even when adjusting for respondent characteristics (P=.02). Additionally, students who held a prior advanced degree and/or current enrollment in the master of bioethics program (Higher Education Students) had a positive association with change in Personal Advocacy scores (P=.02). Conclusion Volunteering at the THRIVE Clinic appears to impact the Personal Advocacy scores of medical students. This suggests that interacting with PEH early in students' career may be associated with a commitment to working with this population. However, our study has multiple limitations, including self-selection bias, limited sample size, and unclear permanence of students' attitudes over time. Further studies of this cohort could help clarify the significance and permanence of volunteering in student-run clinics.","Mercadante, Sophia F; Goldberg, Leah A; Divakaruni, V Laavanya; Erwin, Ryan; Savoy, Margot; O'Gurek, David",PRiMER,https://doi.org/10.22454/primer.2021.489756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286222/,355

Women were recruited at cancer treatment facilities in Namibia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. The baseline interview included information used to generate the geospatial features: urban/rural residence, travel mode to treatment facility, and straight-line distances from home to first care provider and to diagnostic/treatment facility, categorized into country/ethnicity (population)-specific quartiles. These factors were investigated in relation to delay in diagnosis (≥3 months since first symptom) and late stage at diagnosis (TNM: III, IV) using logistic regression, adjusted for population group and sociodemographic characteristics. The median (interquartile range) distances to first provider and diagnostic and treatment facilities were 5 (1-37), 17 (3-105), and 62 (5-289) kms, respectively. The majority had a delay in diagnosis (74%) and diagnosis at late stage (64%). Distance to first provider was not associated with delay in diagnosis or late stage at diagnosis. Rural residence was associated with delay, but the association did not persist after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. Distance to the diagnostic/treatment facility was associated with delay (highest vs lowest quartile: Odds Ratio (OR)=1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.08-2.27) and late stage (overall: OR=1.47, CI=1.05-2.06; without Nigerian hospitals where mostly local residents were treated: OR=1.73, CI=1.18-2.54). These findings underscore the need of measures addressing the geospatial barriers to early diagnosis in sub-Saharan African settings, including providing transport or travel allowance and decentralizing diagnostic services.","Togawa, Kayo; Anderson, Benjamin O; Foerster, Milena; Galukande, Moses; Zietsman, Annelle; Pontac, Johanna; Anele, Angelica; Adisa, Charles; Parham, Groesbeck; Pinder, Leeya F; McKenzie, Fiona; Schüz, Joachim; Dos-Santos-Silva, Isabel; McCormack, Valerie",International journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197280/,355

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of visualization of surgical steps via instructional media on performance of an end-to-side microvascular anastomosis. METHODS Thirty-two first- and second-year surgical trainees from the University of Ottawa received an expert-guided, didactic lecture on vascular anastomosis and performed an end-to-side anastomosis on a procedural model to assess baseline skills. Assessments were performed by 2 blinded, expert observers using validated measurements of skill. Subjects were then proctored to perform anastomoses using the model. Subjects were then randomized to watch an instructional video on performance of vascular anastomosis using visualization as the education strategy. One week later, subjects were again assessed for technical skill on the model. The primary outcome was the score achieved on the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scale. Secondary outcomes included an anastomosis-specific End-Product Rating Score and time to completion. RESULTS Compared with residents who received expert-guided simulator training alone, those who used the supplementary multimedia scored significantly greater on OSATS (17.4 ± 2.9 vs 14.2 ± 3.2, P = .0013) and on End-Product Rating Score (11.24 ± 3.0 vs 7.4 ± 4.1, P = .011). However, performance time did not differ between groups (15.7 vs 14.3 minutes, P = .79). CONCLUSIONS Residents with supplemental instructional media performed an end-to-side anastomosis more proficiently as assessed by OSATS and with a greater quality end-product. This suggests that both didactic simulation training as well as use of visualization multimedia improves learning and performance of vascular anastomosis and should be incorporated into surgical curricula.","Malas, Tarek; Al-Atassi, Talal; Brandys, Tim; Naik, Viren; Lapierre, Harry; Lam, Buu-Khanh",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.10.080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554789/,355

Indeed, directly transmitted pathogens have long been considered a major cost of group living in humans and other social animals, as well as a driver of the evolution of group size and social behaviour. As the risk and frequency of emerging infectious diseases rise, the ability of social taxa to respond appropriately to changing infectious disease pressures could mean the difference between persistence and extinction. Here, we examine changes in the social behaviour of humans and wildlife in response to infectious diseases and compare these responses to theoretical expectations. We consider constraints on altering social behaviour in the face of emerging diseases, including the lack of behavioural plasticity, environmental limitations and conflicting pressures from the many benefits of group living. We also explore the ways that social animals can minimize the costs of disease-induced changes to sociality and the unique advantages that humans may have in maintaining the benefits of sociality despite social distancing.","Townsend, Andrea K; Hawley, Dana M; Stephenson, Jessica F; Williams, Keelah E G",Proceedings.

It was examined if there are significant changes in trapezius muscle activity in the afternoon compared to the morning work period and relationships to the level of arm acceleration during lunchtime. Nineteen female office employees were recruited. A one hour period of the work in the morning, afternoon, and lunchtime were compared. The measures of the trapezius muscle activity and muscle rest time (TR) did not significantly differ between working in the morning (TR: median 10%; range 1%-49) or working in the afternoon (TR: median 18%; range 2%-34%). The 90th percentile of arm acceleration during lunch time significantly correlated with less trapezius muscle activity in the afternoon compared to the morning values (RT: Spearman R=0.80; p<0.01). Differences in the duration and level of trapezius muscle activity were bigger between the subjects than between different work periods or between lunchtime and work. Furthermore it seems that higher arm accelerations during lunch may be beneficial in reducing trapezius activity in the afternoon compared to the morning values.","Nicoletti, Corinne; Läubli, Thomas",Industrial health,https://doi.org/10.2486/indhealth.2016-0189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28090066/,355

The aim was to assess the feasibility of a transrectal approach with a completely retroperitoneal mobilization of the left colon and mesenteric vessels in an acute porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight pigs were used. A purse-string suture was made 3 cm above the anal sphincter. Next, the retroperitoneal, perirectal space was entered with an endoscope through a single (or twin) anterior lateral, transrectal viscerotomy. A retroperitoneal tunnel was created using pneumodissection or endoscopically guided dissection to the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The IMA was skeletonized and lymph nodes retrieved using the IsisScope or other instruments. The IMA was divided with the Ligasure, clips, or ligature performed with the IsisScope. The rectum was dissected transanally in the ""Holy"" plane. After achieving mobilization using a completely retroperitoneal approach, the peritoneal attachments were then divided and the rectosigmoid specimen exteriorized through the anus. An explorative laparoscopy was then performed to evaluate the quality of the mobilization. RESULTS The procedure was successfully completed and the IMA correctly identified and ligated in all cases. In all but one case, no further mobilization was possible, even by a laparoscopic approach. CONCLUSIONS Perirectal oncologic gateway to retroperitoneal endoscopic single-site surgery for left-sided colonic resections using both flexible and rigid surgical endoscopic platforms was feasible and reproducible in an acute porcine model. This technique might represent a step toward pure NOTES left-sided colorectal procedures.","Leroy, Joël; Diana, Michele; Barry, Brian; Mutter, Didier; Melani, Armando Geraldo Franchini; Wu, Hurng-Sheng; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350612452346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22751618/,355

Intravenous (IV) vitamin C has been utilized as adjuvant therapy in critically ill patients with sepsis for its protective effects against reactive oxygen species and immunomodulatory effects. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of IV vitamin C in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS Retrospective observational cohort study with propensity score matching of intensive care unit (ICU) patients who received 1.5 grams IV vitamin C every 6 hours for up to 4 days for COVID-19 infection. The primary study outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included vasopressor requirements in norepinephrine equivalents, ICU length of stay, and change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS Eight patients received IV vitamin C and were matched to 24 patients. Patients in the IV vitamin C group had higher rates of hospital mortality [7 (88%) vs. 19 (79%), P = 0.049]. There was no difference in the daily vasopressor requirement in the treatment group or between the 2 groups. The mean SOFA scores post-treatment was higher in the IV vitamin C group (12.4 ± 2.8 vs. 8.1 ± 3.5, P < 0.005). There was no difference in ICU length of stay between the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSION Adjunctive IV vitamin C for the management of COVID-19 infection in critically ill patients may not decrease the incidence of mortality, vasopressor requirements, SOFA scores, or ventilator settings.","Li, Matthew; Ching, Tsung Han; Hipple, Christopher; Lopez, Ricardo; Sahibzada, Asad; Rahman, Habibur",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/08971900211015052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098784/,355
152440,Judge rules that baby should be removed from ventilator and given palliative care.,2020-06-22,"BACKGROUND The overall clinical outcome of inflammatory conditions is the result of the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Because nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB) is at the bottom of many inflammatory conditions, methods to evaluate the net effect of inflammation modulators on this master regulator have been conceptualized for years. METHODS Using an ex vivo NF-ĸB reporter cell line-based assay, plasma samples of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 27), psoriasis (n = 15), or severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) (n = 21) were investigated for NF-ĸB activation compared to plasma samples from 9 healthy volunteers. RESULTS When separated by C-reactive protein (CRP) threshold levels, samples of patients exhibiting increased CRP levels (≥5 mg/l) activated NF-ĸB more efficiently than samples from patients with levels below 5 mg/l (P = 0.0001) or healthy controls (P = 0.04). Overall, there was a moderate association of CRP levels with NF-ĸB activation (Spearman r = 0.66; p < 0.0001). Plasma from COVID-19 patients activated NF-ĸB more efficiently (mean 2.4-fold compared to untreated reporter cells) than samples from any other condition (healthy controls, 1.8-fold, P = 0.0025; rheumatoid arthritis, 1.7-fold, P < 0.0001; psoriasis, 1.7-fold, P < 0.0001). In contrast, effects of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or healthy volunteer samples did not differ. CONCLUSION This study shows that a NF-ĸB reporter cell line can be used to evaluate the net inflammatory effect of clinical plasma samples. Patients with chronic but stable rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis do not exhibit increased plasma levels of NF-ĸB-activating compounds as opposed to COVID-19 patients with high inflammatory burden.","Wagner, Lelia; Haefeli, Walter E; Merle, Uta; Lorenz, Hanns-Martin; Hohmann, Nicolas; Weiss, Johanna; Theile, Dirk",Cytokine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338916/,355

We also compared it with the already existing data with similar manifestations. PIMS-TS is reported to occur in children with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms, hemodynamic instability, and myocardial dysfunction. The implications of development of atrioventricular block during critical illness in PIMS-TS are yet unknown. Both patients had an otherwise normal cardiac structure and had no gastrointestinal symptoms but suffered complete heart block without any other identifiable etiology, both requiring temporary pacemaker placement. While one child recovered completely with medical management, the other child required permanent pacemaker placement. While we cannot be certain that COVID-19 was the cause, complete heart block appeared to be temporally related to COVID-19 infection in both patients, and hence, it is important for pediatricians to be aware of the potential manifestation of this disease.","Mehta, Rishika Ghosh Sanjiban Nandy Jayita Das Shubhadeep Chattopadhyay Amitabha",Annals of Pediatric Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.4103/apc.apc_96_21,355

The purposes of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of the Penumbra 5MAX ACE catheter for revascularization of large vessels and to compare its cost to the cost of stent retrievers. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center case review study, data were captured on consecutive patients treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE as first-line therapy during an 11-month period. Good functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of ≤2 at discharge. Results were directly compared with previously published data for stent retrievers, and length of stay was analyzed in relation to revascularization. RESULTS The 31 patients studied had a mean age of 66.3 ± 17.8 years and a mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 19.4 ± 5.7. Intravenous tissue recombinant plasminogen activator therapy was initiated in 35.5% (11/31) of patients. A Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grade of 2b-3 reperfusion after endovascular therapy was achieved in 26/31 (83.9%) of cases; TICI grade 3 was achieved in 19/31 (61.3%) patients. The average time from groin puncture to TICI grade 2b-3 reperfusion was 40 minutes. The average estimated cost for aspiration with the 5MAX ACE alone was $4,916 per case compared with an estimated cost of $9,620 if a stent retriever was used as the primary device. Our actual average cost per case, including all adjunctive devices used in the neurointerventional procedure, was $6,997. Good functional outcome was achieved in 19/31 (61.3%) patients. Two patients experienced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (6.5%), and 1 (3.2%) patient died. The length of stay was significantly shorter among patients with TICI grade 2b-3 reperfusion compared to patients with TICI grade <2 (6.8 ± 5.34 days vs 15.8 ± 11.32 days, respectively; P<0.05). CONCLUSION These findings suggest that direct aspiration with the large-bore 5MAX ACE catheter can be considered a first-line approach to mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions. Our results demonstrated high rates of successful reperfusion in a timely manner with excellent clinical outcomes, although our sample size was small. In addition, this direct-aspiration technique has important cost-savings potential compared to stent retrievers.","Vidal, Gabriel A; Milburn, James M",The Ochsner journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27999507/,355

Blocking either the 5' or 3' terminus did not affect cleavage. Double- and single-stranded RNAs were both substrates for Nsp15 but with different kinetics for cleavage. Mn(2+) at 2 to 10 mM was needed for optimal endoribonuclease activity, but Mg(2+) and several other divalent metals were capable of supporting only a low level of activity. Concentrations of Mn(2+) needed for endoribonuclease activity induced significant conformation change(s) in the protein, as measured by changes in tryptophan fluorescence. A similar endoribonucleolytic activity was detected for the orthologous protein from another coronavirus, demonstrating that the endoribonuclease activity of Nsp15 may be common to coronaviruses. This work presents an initial biochemical characterization of a novel coronavirus endoribonuclease.","Bhardwaj, Kanchan; Guarino, Linda; Kao, C Cheng",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15507608/,355

189853,Use of personal protective equipment during infectious disease outbreak and nonoutbreak conditions: a survey of emergency medical technicians.,2009,"OBJECTIVES Chlorhexidine (CHX) is one of the most widely used antiseptic, especially in dentistry. At low concentrations CHX is bacteriostatic and at high concentrations acts bactericidal causing cell death by cytolysis. In this study, we performed a systematic review of pharmaco-biological activity and application of CHX. MATERIALS AND METHODS Articles for inclusion in this review were retrieved from online databases PubMed/Medline. The selected papers were included in the present manuscript according to their relevance for the topic. RESULTS Totally 75 papers were enrolled in this research. CHX has strong biocidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria and weaker activity against Gram-negative bacteria. It is also active against yeasts, some dermatophytes and some lipophilic viruses. The most widely application CHX has found in dentistry and antisepsis. Numerous studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of CHX in reducing of plaque accumulation, in tooth caries, gingivitis, periodontitis and in alveolar osteitis. Unfortunately, CHX exhibits cytotoxic activity on human cells, can cause colorization of teeth and fillings, and its activity depends on the pH of the environment and the presence of organic substances. CONCLUSIONS CHX play a valuable role in the dentistry and antisepsis. However, it can also cause side effects, limiting its application time.","Karpiński, T M; Szkaradkiewicz, A K",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25912596/,355
190072,Autism Spectrum Disorder and COVID-19: Helping Caregivers Navigate the Pandemic.,2020-06-01,"Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gene 1 encodes several nonstructural proteins. The functions are unknown for most of these nonstructural proteins, including p28, which is encoded at the 5' end of the MHV genome. Transient expression of cloned p28 in several different cultured cells inhibited cell growth, indicating that p28 expression suppressed cell proliferation. Expressed p28 was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that p28 expression induced G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest. Characterization of various cellular proteins that are involved in regulating cell cycle progression demonstrated that p28 expression resulted in an accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), tumor suppressor p53, and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21(Cip1). Expression of p28 did not alter the amount of p53 transcripts yet increased the amount of p21(Cip1) transcripts, suggesting that p28 expression increased p53 stability and that p21(Cip1) was transcriptionally activated in a p53-dependent manner. Our present data suggest the following model of p28-induced G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest. Expressed cytoplasmic p28 induces the stabilization of p53, and accumulated p53 causes transcriptional upregulation of p21(Cip1). The increased amount of p21(Cip1) suppresses cyclin E/Cdk2 activity, resulting in the inhibition of pRb hyperphosphorylation. Accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRb thus prevents cell cycle progression from G(0)/G(1) to S phase.","Chen, Chun-Jen; Sugiyama, Kazuo; Kubo, Hideyuki; Huang, Cheng; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367607/,355

194190,Hospital planning for acts of terrorism and other public health emergencies involving children.,2005,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can evade the host immune system, which results in prolonged virus replication for several weeks to several months. To date, the mechanisms of PRRSV immune evasion have not been investigated in detail. One possible immune-evasion strategy is to avoid incorporation of viral proteins into the plasma membrane of infected cells, as this prevents recognition by virus-specific antibodies and consequent cell lysis either by the classical complement pathway or by antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In this study, viral proteins were not observed in the plasma membrane of in vitro-infected macrophages by using confocal microscopy or flow cytometry. Subsequently, the sensitivity of PRRSV-infected macrophages towards antibody-dependent, complement-mediated cell lysis (ADCML) was determined by using an ADCML assay. A non-significant percentage of PRRSV-infected cells were killed in the assay, showing that in vitro PRRSV-infected macrophages are protected against ADCML. PRRSV proteins were not detected in the plasma membrane of in vivo-infected alveolar macrophages and ADCML was also not observed. Together, these data indicate that viral proteins are not incorporated into the plasma membrane of PRRSV-infected macrophages, which makes infected cells invisible to PRRSV-specific antibodies. This absence of viral proteins on the cell surface could explain the protection against ADCML observed for in vitro and in vivo PRRSV-infected macrophages, and may play a role in virus persistence.","Costers, Sarah; Delputte, Peter L; Nauwynck, Hans J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16847130/,355
195799,Legal Implications of Personal Protective Equipment Use When Treating Patients for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND The Carolinas comfort scale (CCS) is an ideal tool for assessing patients’ quality-of-life post hernia repair, but its use has been barely investigated preoperatively. The aim was to quantify preoperative symptoms and assess their relevance in predicting postoperative clinical outcomes following totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS The CCS was modified for preoperative use (modified or MCCS) by omitting mesh sensation questioning. Data collection was prospective over a 16 months period. (M)CCS questionnaires were completed preoperatively and at 2 then 6 weeks post repair. Intraoperative findings were also recorded. One hundred and four consecutive patients consented for TEP repair were included using a fibrin glue mesh fixation technique. RESULTS All three questionnaires were completed by 88 patients (84.6 %). Preoperative MCCS scores did not differ with age, obesity, the presence of bilateral or recurrent inguinal herniae or hernia type. Higher MCCS grouping [OR 4.3 (95 % CI 1.5–12.6)] and the presence of bilateral herniae [OR 8.5 (1.2–61.8)] were predictors of persisting discomfort at 6 weeks, with lower scores on MCCS [OR 16.4 (3.9–67.6), obesity (OR 9.9 91.6–63.2)] and recurrent hernia repair [OR 11.4 (1.4–91.0)] predicting increased discomfort at 2 weeks versus preoperatively. MCCS scores were inversely correlated with the size of a direct defect (r −0.42, p = 0.011) but did not differ with the intraoperative finding of an incidental femoral and/or obturator hernia. Female sex was strongly associated with recognition of a synchronous incidental hernia (5 vs 57 %, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Pre- and post-operative scoring of hernia specific symptoms should be considered as part of routine surgical practice, to counsel patients on their expectations of pain and discomfort post repair and to select those who might be more appropriate for a watchful waiting approach. Females with inguinal hernia warrant complete assessment of their groin hernial orifices intraoperatively due to a high rate of synchronous incidental hernia.","Knox, Robert D; Berney, Christophe R",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015520/,355
196169,[Ocular manifestations of Covid-19].,2021-01-27,"In this study, we report a serum-free culture system for primary neonatal pulmonary cells that can support the growth of octamer-binding transcription factor 4+ (Oct-4+) epithelial colonies with a surrounding mesenchymal stroma. In addition to Oct-4, these cells also express other stem cell markers such as stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1), stem cell antigen 1 (Sca-1), and Clara cell secretion protein (CCSP) but not c-Kit, CD34, and p63, indicating that they represent a subpopulation of Clara cells that have been implicated as lung stem/progenitor cells in lung injury models. These colony cells can be kept for weeks in primary cultures and undergo terminal differentiation to alveolar type-2- and type-1-like pneumocytes sequentially when removed from the stroma. In addition, we have demonstrated the presence of Oct-4+ long-term BrdU label-retaining cells at the bronchoalveolar junction of neonatal lung, providing a link between the Oct-4+ cells in vivo and in vitro and strengthening their identity as putative neonatal lung stem/progenitor cells. Lastly, these Oct-4+ epithelial colony cells, which also express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, are the target cells for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in primary cultures and support active virus replication leading to their own destruction. These observations imply the possible involvement of lung stem/progenitor cells, in addition to pneumocytes, in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, accounting for the continued deterioration of lung tissues and apparent loss of capacity for lung repair.","Ling, Thai-Yen; Kuo, Ming-Der; Li, Chung-Leung; Yu, Alice L; Huang, Yen-Hua; Wu, Tsai-Jung; Lin, You-Chin; Chen, Shu-Hwa; Yu, John",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16772384/,355

Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.","Wong, David M; Blumberg, Dean A; Lowe, Lisa G",American family physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17002029/,355
201899,Muffling of healthcare: Assessing the impact of personal protective equipment on speaking volume in an Endoscopy Centre,2020,"Since late 2004, the swine industry in the province of Quebec has experienced a significant increase in death rate related to postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). To explain this phenomenon, 2 hypotheses were formulated: 1) the presence of a 2nd pathogen could be exacerbating the porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) infection, or 2) a new and more virulent PCV-2 strain could be infecting swine. In 2005, 13 PMWS cases were submitted to the Quebec provincial diagnostic laboratory and PCV-2 was the only virus that could be found consistently by PCR in all 13 samples. The PCR detection results obtained for other viruses revealed the following: 61.5% were positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, 30.8% for swine influenza virus, 15.4% for porcine parvovirus, 69.2% for swine torque teno virus (swTTV), 38.5% for swine hepatitis E virus (swHEV) and 84.6% for Mycoplasma hyorhinis; transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus (TGEV/PRCV) was not detected. Sequences of the entire genome revealed that these PCV-2 strains belonged to a genotype (named PCV-2b) that has never been reported in Canada. Further sequence analyses on 83 other Canadian PCV-2 positive cases submitted to the provincial diagnostic laboratory during years 2005 and 2006 showed that 79.5% of the viral sequences obtained clustered in the PCV-2b genotype. The appearance of the PCV-2b genotype in Canada may explain the death rate increase related to PMWS, but this relationship has to be confirmed.","Gagnon, Carl A; Tremblay, Donald; Tijssen, Peter; Venne, Marie-Hélène; Houde, Alain; Elahi, Seyyed Mehdy",The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17824323/,355

We used data on all advanced NSCLC patients who had a genetic test between April 2012 and April 2013 in France in the frame of the IFCT Biomarqueurs-France study (n = 15814). We computed four established measures of geographic variation of the sex-adjusted rates of genetic testing utilization at the ""départment"" (the French territory is divided into 94 administrative units called 'départements') level. We also performed a spatial regression model to determine the relationship between département-level sex-adjusted rates of genetic testing utilization and economic and ecological variables. Our results are the following: (i) Overall, 46.87% lung cancer admission patients obtained genetic testing for NSCLC; département-level utilization rates varied over 3.2-fold. Measures of geographic variation indicated a relatively high degree of geographic variation. (ii) there was a statistically significant relationship between genetic testing rates and per capita supply of general practitioners, radiotherapists and surgeons (negative correlation for the latter); lower genetic testing rates were also associated with higher local poverty rates.

The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D. RESULTS: Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human's cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases. CONCLUSION: Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.","de Lucena, Thays Maria Costa; da Silva Santos, Ariane Fernandes; de Lima, Brenda Regina; de Albuquerque Borborema, Maria Eduarda; de Azevêdo Silva, Jaqueline",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,355

We undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the mortality benefit of non-specialist therapeutic interventions for ARDS available to general critical care units. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register for RCTs investigating therapeutic interventions in ARDS including corticosteroids, fluid management strategy, high PEEP, low tidal volume ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, prone position ventilation, or recruitment maneuvers. Data was collected on demographic information, treatment strategy, duration and dose of treatment, and primary (28 or 30-day mortality) and secondary (PaO2:FiO2 ratio at 24-48 hours) outcomes.

The effectiveness of different response measures is anchored on addressing inequities that have permeated Philippine society for a long time. Since most measures that are in place as part of the COVID-19 response are meant to be temporary, these are unable to resolve the inequities that have led to the magnitude of morbidity and mortality associated with the pandemic. These cannot improve the country's readiness to deal with pandemics and other emergencies in the future. Transition to a new normal recognizes the possibility that other infectious diseases could come and endanger our health security. Our pandemic experiences are proving that having an egalitarian society will serve the interests not only of disadvantaged sectors but also of everybody else, including the privileged. Response measures should thus take the opportunity to promote equity by giving importance to the concerns of the underprivileged and vulnerable while giving preference to initiatives that can be sustained beyond the period of the current pandemic.","De Castro, Leonardo; Lopez, Alexander Atrio; Hamoy, Geohari; Alba, Kriedge Chlare; Gundayao, Joshua Cedric",,,355

223362,Surgeon in the Polls,2021,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based programs can help provide accessible and inexpensive behavioral health care to those in need; however, the evaluation of these interventions has been mostly limited to controlled trials. Data regarding patterns of use and effectiveness of self-referred, open-access online interventions are lacking. We evaluated an online-based treatment designed to address stress, depression, and conflict management, the Dartmouth PATH Program, in a freely available and self-guided format during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to determine users' levels of stress and depression, and the nature of problems and triggers they reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective is to assess the acceptability and usability of the PATH content and determine whether such a program would be useful as a stand-alone open-access resource. The final objective is understanding the high dropout rates associated with online behavioral programs by contrasting the use pattern and program efficacy of individuals who completed session one and did not return to the program with those who came back to complete more sessions. METHODS: Cumulative anonymous data from 562 individuals were analyzed. Stress triggers, stress responses, and reported problems were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. Scores on usability and acceptability questionnaires were evaluated using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to evaluate changes in stress and depression over time. RESULTS: A total of 2484 users registered from April through October 2020, most of whom created an account without initiating a module. A total of 562 individuals started the program and were considered in the data analysis. The most common stress triggers individuals reported involved either conflicts with family or spouses and work or workload. The most common problems addressed in the mood module were worry, anxiousness, or stress and difficulty concentrating or procrastination. The attrition rate was high with 13% (21/156) completing the conflict module, 17% (50/289) completing session one of the mood module, and 14% (16/117) completing session one of the stress module. Usability and acceptability scores for the mood and stress modules were significantly better than average. In those who returned to complete sessions, symptoms of stress showed a significant improvement over time (P=.03), and there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms over all time points (P=.01). Depression severity decreased on average by 20% (SD 35.2%; P=.60) between sessions one and two. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicts with others, worry, and difficulty concentrating were some of the most common problems people used the programs to address. Individuals who completed the modules indicated improvements in self-reported stress and depression symptoms. Users also found the modules to be effective and rated the program highly for usability and acceptability. Nevertheless, the attrition rate was very high, as has been found with other freely available online-based interventions.

226517,Public Masking: An Urgent Need to Revise Global Policies to Protect against COVID-19,2020,"Emetine is a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of amebiasis. Previously we demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of emetine against some RNA and DNA viruses. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral efficacy of emetine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and found it to be a low nanomolar (nM) inhibitor. Interestingly, emetine exhibited protective efficacy against lethal challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; a chicken coronavirus) in the embryonated chicken egg infection model. Emetine treatment led to a decrease in viral RNA and protein synthesis without affecting other steps of viral life cycle such as attachment, entry and budding. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay, emetine was shown to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA with eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, a cellular cap-binding protein required for initiation of protein translation). Further, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested that emetine may bind to the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E, in a similar conformation as m7-GTP binds. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exploit ERK/MNK1/eIF4E signalling pathway for its effective replication in the target cells. Collectively our results suggest that further detailed evaluation of emetine as a potential treatment for COVID-19 may be warranted.","Kumar, Ram; Afsar, Mohammad; Khandelwal, Nitin; Chander, Yogesh; Riyesh, Thachamvally; Dedar, Ramesh Kumar; Gulati, Baldev R; Pal, Yash; Barua, Sanjay; Tripathi, Bhupendra N; Hussain, Tanweer; Kumar, Naveen",Antiviral Res,,355

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial, controlled, open, parallel group, to evaluate the effectiveness of steroids in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, with incipient pulmonary involvement, without hospital admission criteria. Patients will be stratified by the presence or not of radiological data on pneumonia. PARTICIPANTS: We will include patients with early stage SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia who do not meet hospital admission criteria from the reference hospital, the Hospital Universitario de Burgos, in the region of Castilla y León, Spain. Patients will be followed-up by specialist physicians and Primary Health Care professionals. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Men and women. - Age between 18 and 75 years old. - Diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by PCR and/or IgM+ antibody test and/or antigen test. - Clinical diagnosis of lung involvement: (respiratory symptoms +/- pathological auscultation +/- O2 desaturation) - Chest X-ray with mild-moderate alterations or normal. - Patients who give their verbal informed consent in front of witnesses, which will be reflected in the patients' medical records. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: - Oxygen desaturation below 93% or P02 < 62. - Moderate-severe dyspnea or significant respiratory or general deterioration that makes admission advisable. - Chest X-ray with multifocal infiltrates. - Insulin-dependent diabetes with poor control or glycaemia in the emergency room test greater than 300 mg/ml (fasting or not). - Other significant comorbidities: Severe renal failure (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min); cirrhosis or chronic liver disease, poorly controlled hypertension. - Heart rhythm disturbances (including prolonged QT). - Severe immunosuppression (HIV infection, long-term use of immunosuppressive agents); cancer. - Pregnant or breast-feeding women. - Patients under use of glucocorticoids for other diseases. - History of allergy or intolerance to any of the drugs in the study (prednisone, azithromycin or hydroxychloroquine). - Patients who took one or more of the study drugs in the 7 days prior to study inclusion. - Patients taking non-suppressible drugs with risk of QT prolongation or significant interactions. - Patients unwilling or unable to participate until study completion. - Participation in another study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Eligible patients will be randomized to receive standard outpatient treatment only (group 1) or standard outpatient treatment plus prednisone (group 2). - Group 1: paracetamol 1 g/8 h (on demand) + hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/12h the first day, 200 mg/12 h for 4 days + azithromycin 500 mg/24h for 5 days. - Group 2: paracetamol 1 g/8 h (on demand) + hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/12h the first day, 200 mg/12 h for 4 days + azithromycin 500 mg/24h for 5 days + prednisone 60 mg / 24 h for 3 days, 30 mg / 24 h for 3 days and 15 mg / 24 h for 3 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: If the patient requires ambulatory observation, according to the protocol established in this respect in the Emergency Department, meets all the criteria for inclusion and none for exclusion, data will be taken by the person responsible on the data collection sheet. The main result is admission after 30 days. Secondary outcomes are 30-day ICU admission and hospital stay. The safety variable will be the occurrence of clinical symptoms or delirium related to the steroids. Also, the possible decompensations of diabetes will be measured. All tests will be on an intention-to-treat basis. RANDOMISATION: Treatment will be assigned according to stratified randomization by the presence or absence of radiological data of lung involvement (previously performed by random sequence 1:1 generated with Epidat and kept hidden by opaque, sealed envelopes, which will only be opened after inclusion and basal measurement). BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers and personnel responsible for outcomes measurement will not be blinded to group assignment, once the patient is included and the basal measurement performed, as per protocol design. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The percentage of patients with incipient lung involvement is unknown, but given that pulmonary involvement already exists it is estimated to be around 20%. We consider that the intervention could reduce this percentage to 5%, so the necessary sample size would be 200 subjects (100 per group), with a power of 80% and an estimated loss percentage of 10%. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol with code TAC-COVID-19, version 2.0 on date: April 16, 2020 is approved by the Spanish Drug Agency (AEMPS) and the local Ethics Committee. The trial is in the recruitment phase. Recruitment began 19 April, 2020 and is anticipated to be complete by April 2021.

Throughout the pandemic, these patients have been at increased risk of arterial thrombotic events and subsequent mortality as a result of a hypercoagulable state. The exact mechanism of thrombosis is unknown; however arterial thrombosis may be due to invasion of endothelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, endothelial injury from inflammation, or even free-floating aortic thrombus. Multiple studies have been performed evaluating the medical and surgical management of these patients; the decision to proceed with operative intervention is dependent on the patient's clinical status as it relates to COVID-19 and morbidity of that disease. The interventions afforded typically include anticoagulation in patients undergoing palliation; alternatively, thrombectomy (endovascular and open) is utilized in other patients. There is a high risk of rethrombosis, despite anticoagulation, given persistent endothelial injury from the virus. Postoperative mortality can be high in these patients.","Ilonzo, Nicole; Judelson, Dejah; Al-Jundi, Wissam; Etkin, Yana; O039,; Banion, Leigh Anne; Rivera, Aksim; Tinelli, Giovanni; Bellosta, Rafaello; Vouyouka, Ageliki",Semin Vasc Surg,,355

Research Design & Methods: We use qualitative information from surveys that cover about 24 000 organisations and 5100 households in all Russian regions. The total economic sentiment indicator (TESI) combines information on 18 survey-based indicators. Cross-correlation analysis, Hodrick-Prescott filtering, and a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with dummy variables are used as the research methods. Findings: The study confirms an almost synchronous cyclic conformity of the gross domestic product (GDP) growth and TESI dynamics for the period of 1998-2020. Probable GDP growth until the end of 2021 is estimated based on the expected impulses in the TESI dynamics, including those due to the sudden impact of the coronavirus. Implications & Recommendations: Assessments of business and household activity are reliable and available much earlier than quantitative statistics on GDP growth. Therefore, we advise to use them as an early warning system about economic growth and take them into account in policymaking. Contribution & Value Added: We are the first to confirm the effectiveness and reliability of TESI as a leading indicator of GDP growth in Russia, using data from large-scale business surveys and with a focus on crisis shocks. © 2021, Cracow University of Economics.

Time-sensitive and lifesaving cancer screening and care have been canceled and delayed. This abstract will discuss the devastating and irreversible impact that these delays and cancellations in screening, diagnosis, and treatment have had on women’s health and how they have exacerbated the deep-seated racial and ethnic health disparities in the US. Methods: Secondary research was conducted to identify the procedure rates, and further analysis was undergone to understand the willingness to attend screenings and care. This analysis also explores the link between COVID-19, healthcare inequities, and the impact on women’s health, with a focus on mammograms and breast cancer. Results: A survey of 600 breast care patients revealed that 60% had delays in diagnostic imaging and two-thirds had reconstruction surgery delayed. Another survey suggests that nearly half of breast cancer patients have delayed care during the pandemic. Additionally, an analysis by the nonprofit Families USA estimated that 5.4 million workers lost health insurance during the first three months of the pandemic. This financial instability and inability to pay for care disproportionately affected minority women, as the analysis revealed more women have lost their jobs compared to men, with black and Hispanic women experiencing even steeper declines. In June, the director of the National Cancer Institute proclaimed that a conservative model forecasts nearly 10,000 excess deaths from breast and colon cancer in the next decade because of drops in screening and treatment. Conclusions: As the industry emerges from the pandemic, new solutions and partnerships should address ways to develop effective and patient-tailored strategies for healthcare systems to provide adequate care for breast cancer patients, reduce inequities, and transform the future of women’s health.","Infante, K.; Eslami, N.; Garfield, S.",Value in Health,,355

258312,Plastic Bags as Personal Protective Equipment During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,2020,"PURPOSE: To assess the quality of the research about how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young workers, and to summarize the available evidence. METHODS: We undertook a systematic search of three databases using a tiered search strategy. Studies were included if they: (a) assessed employment conditions such as working hours, precarious employment, contract type, insecurity, and flexible work, or psychosocial workplace exposures such as violence, harassment and bullying, social support, job demand and control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational justice; (b) included a validated mental health measure; and (c) presented results specific to young people aged &#8804; 30 years or were stratified by age group to provide an estimate for young people aged &#8804; 30 years. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review. Four were related to employment conditions, capturing contract type and working hours. Five studies captured concepts relevant to psychosocial workplace exposures including workplace sexual harassment, psychosocial job quality, work stressors, and job control. The quality of the included studies was generally low, with six of the nine at serious risk of bias. Three studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the qualitative synthesis, and results of these showed contemporaneous exposure to sexual harassment and poor psychosocial job quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes among young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that exposure to low job control was associated with incident depression diagnosis among young workers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review illustrate that even better studies are at moderate risk of bias. Addressing issues related to confounding, selection of participants, measurement of exposures and outcomes, and missing data will improve the quality of future research in this area and lead to a clearer understanding of how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young people. Generating high-quality evidence is particularly critical given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on young people's employment.

273727,"Feasibility, Reproducibility, and Clinical Validity of a Quantitative Chest X-Ray Assessment for COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS/DESIGN: The ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to category 5, 6, or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The results of this study are expected to contribute to establishing the potential place of CP in the therapeutics for a new viral disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04345523 .

276624,Health Policy Perspective: Medicaid and State Politics Beyond COVID,2020,"Importance: Mortality is an important measure of the severity of a pandemic. This study aimed to understand how mortality by age of hospitalized patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 has changed over time. Objective: To evaluate trends in in-hospital mortality among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included patients who were hospitalized for at least 1 day at 1 of 209 US acute care hospitals of variable size, in urban and rural areas, between March 1 and November 21, 2020. Eligible patients had a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test within 7 days of admission or during hospitalization, and a record of discharge or in-hospital death. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test within 7 days before admission or during hospitalization. Mortality was extracted from electronically available data. Results: Among 503â¯409 admitted patients, 42â¯604 (8.5%) had SARS-CoV-2-positive tests. Of those with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests, 21â¯592 (50.7%) were male patients. Hospital admissions among patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests were highest in the group aged 65 years or older (19â¯929 [46.8%]), followed by those aged 50 to 64 years (11â¯602 [27.2%]) and 18 to 49 years (10â¯619 [24.9%]). Hospital admissions among patients 18 to 49 years of age increased from 1099 of 5319 (20.7%) in April to 1266 of 4184 (30.3%) in June and 2156 of 7280 (29.6%) in July, briefly exceeding those in the group 50 to 64 years of age (June: 1194 of 4184 [28.5%]; 2039 of 7280 [28.0%]). Patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests had higher in-hospital mortality than patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests (4705 [11.0%] vs 11â¯707 of 460â¯805 [2.5%]; P < .001). In-hospital mortality rates increased with increasing age for both patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests and SARS-CoV-2-positive tests. In patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests, mortality increased from 45 of 11â¯255 (0.4%) in those younger than 18 years to 4812 of 107â¯394 (4.5%) in those older than 75 years. In patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests, mortality increased from 1 of 454 (0.2%) of those younger than 18 years to 2149 of 10â¯287 (20.9%) in those older than 75 years. In-hospital mortality rates among patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests were similar for male and female patients (6273 of 209â¯086 [3.0%] vs 5538 of 251â¯719 [2.2%]) but higher mortality was observed among male patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests (2700 of 21â¯592 [12.5%]) compared with female patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests (2016 of 21â¯012 [9.60%]). Overall, in-hospital mortality increased from March to April (63 of 597 [10.6%] to 1047 of 5319 [19.7%]), then decreased significantly to November (499 of 5350 [9.3%]; P = .04), with significant decreases in the oldest age groups (50-64 years: 197 of 1542 [12.8%] to 73 of 1341 [5.4%]; P = .02; 65-75 years: 269 of 1182 [22.8%] to 137 of 1332 [10.3%]; P = .006; >75 years: 535 of 1479 [36.2%] to 262 of 1505 [17.4%]; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: This nationally representative study supported the findings of smaller, regional studies and found that in-hospital mortality declined across all age groups during the period evaluated. Reductions were unlikely because of a higher proportion of younger patients with lower in-hospital mortality in the later period.","Finelli, Lyn; Gupta, Vikas; Petigara, Tanaz; Yu, Kalvin; Bauer, Karri A; Puzniak, Laura A",JAMA Netw Open,,355

Methodologies derived from innovation and human-centered design can contribute to the development and testing of vaccine promotion campaigns, speeding up processes and streamlining the production of evidence in this area. The multiple activities involving the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be the fertile ground in which to develop, test and refine effective frameworks to transfer data acquired through listening strategies into effective vaccine promotion campaigns. The World Health Organization's Vaccine Safety Net is an interesting example of trusted information sources that aim toward using digital tools and innovative methodologies for communicating science-based information on vaccine safety at the global level.","Gesualdo, Francesco; Bucci, Lucie M; Rizzo, Caterina; Tozzi, Alberto E",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,355

METHODS: We collected data from a variety of publicly available sources for 817 counties in the US. (26% of all counties). Cumulative COVID-19 deaths and cases from January 22 to August 31, 2020 were the dependent variables; explicit racial attitudes and implicit racial attitudes served as the moderators; subjective poor or fair health, food insecurity, percent uninsured, percent unemployed, median family income, percent women, percent of Asian county resident, percent of Hispanic county residents, and percent of people 65 or older were controls. RESULTS: The percent of Black county residents was positively associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county level. The relationship between percent of Black residents and COVID-19 cases was moderated by explicit racial attitudes and implicit racial attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Implicit racial attitudes can take on a shared property at the community level and effectively explain racial disparities.

The rapid progression to a global pandemic of COVID-19 has had profound medical, social, and economic consequences. Pregnant women and newborns represent a vulnerable population. However, the precise impact of this novel virus on the fetus and neonate remains uncertain. Appropriate protection of health care workers and newly born infants during and after delivery by a COVID-19 mother is essential. There is some disagreement among expert organizations on an optimal approach based on resource availability, surge volume, and potential risk of transmission. The manuscript outlines the precautions and steps to be taken before, during, and after resuscitation of a newborn born to a COVID-19 mother, including three optional variations of current standards involving shared-decision making with parents for perinatal management, resuscitation of the newborn, disposition, nutrition, and postdischarge care. The availability of resources may also drive the application of these guidelines. More evidence and research are needed to assess the risk of vertical and horizontal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on fetal and neonatal outcomes. KEY POINTS: · The risk of vertical transmission is unclear; transmission from family members/providers to neonates is possible.. · Optimal personal-protective-equipment (airborne vs. droplet/contact precautions) for providers is crucial to prevent transmission.. · Parents should be engaged in shared decision-making with options for rooming in, skin-to-skin contact, and breastfeeding..","Chandrasekharan, Praveen; Vento, Maximo; Trevisanuto, Daniele; Partridge, Elizabeth; Underwood, Mark A; Wiedeman, Jean; Katheria, Anup; Lakshminrusimha, Satyan",Am J Perinatol,,355

This paper focuses on the incarcerated individuals and how the coronavirus has added a new and unprecedented threat to correctional facilities that are already overcrowded and ill-equipped to identify and address the medical needs of the inmate population. The risk-need-responsivity model (RNR) should be used to make empirically-informed decisions about the targeted release. The identification and release of inmates who pose the least threat to society will help alleviate some of the burdens associated with prison crowding. Specifically, with fewer inmates, correctional facilities can comply with social distancing guidelines, introduce enhanced cleaning measures, and make necessary institutional adjustments. In so doing they will limit the transmission of COVI-19 within correctional institutions, ensure the safety of staff and their charges, and enable prisons and jails to better accommodate the needs of the inmate population.","Vose, Brenda; Cullen, Francis T; Lee, Heejin",Am J Crim Justice,,355

The role of silylation in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of bisphenols was investigated. Partial degradation occurred for selected targets during hot injection with the presence of a silylation agent. A PSA (primary and secondary amines) sorbent placed on the top of the solid-phase extraction (SPE) column sorbent was found to be a matrix component trap, mostly for humic acids. The whole water analysis was performed by washing the filters with methanol and recycling the extract to the sample.

In order to explore this phenomenon, we sought to compare the early immune responses against AZD1222 and BNT162b2. SARS-CoV-2 seronegative participants received a single dose of either vaccine and were analyzed for immune cell, effector T cell and antibody dynamics. AZD1222 induced transient leukopenia and major changes among innate and adaptive subpopulations. Both vaccines induced spike protein specific effector T cells which were dominated by Th1 responses following AZD1222 vaccination. A significant reduction of anti-inflammatory T cells upon re-stimulation was also restricted to AZD1222 vaccinees. While IgM and IgG were the dominant isotypes elicited by AZD1222, BNT162b2 led to a significant production of IgG and IgA. Our results suggest that the strategy for spike antigen delivery impacts on how and to what extent immune priming against the main SARS-CoV-2 antigen proceeds.","Müller, Michael; Volzke, Johann; Subin, Behnam; Müller, Silke; Sombetzki, Martina; Reisinger, Emil Christian; Müller-Hilke, Brigitte",,,355

RRMS patients returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic were invited to answer a telephonic interview consisting of the administration of the Short-Screening-Scale for DSM IV (SSS-DSM-IV), the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Other information was extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Valid and complete interviews were obtained from 432 patients (response rate 64.3%). Out of them, 277 (64.1%) were female, mean age 40.4 (SD 12.4) years. One-hundred thirty-seven (31.7%) RRMS patients received a score &#8805;4 at the SSS-DSM-IV, indicating clinically significant PTSD-like symptoms. About DASS-21, moderate-to-severe anxiety was reported by 210 RRMS patients (48.6%), moderate-to-severe depression, and moderate-to-severe stress were respectively reported by 95 (22%) and 220 (50.9%) RRMS patients. Insomnia was reported by 128 patients (29.6%). Factors associated with major severity of symptoms were: marital status, previous diagnosis of mood disorders, switching/starting Disease-Modifying Therapies in the last 12 months, and a higher level of disability measured with Expanded Disability Status Scale (for all, p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need to provide psychological support to MS patients facing the delicate phase of returning to work and to normal activities.","Zanghì, Aurora; D039,; Amico, Emanuele; Luca, Maria; Ciaorella, Marco; Basile, Lucia; Patti, Francesco",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,355

Here we focused on the antiviral potential of the medicinal herb, Saxifraga spinulosa (SS). Water-soluble extracts of SS were prepared, and their virus-inactivating activity was evaluated against the human virus pathogens SARS-CoV-2 and IAV; we also examined virucidal activity against feline calicivirus and murine norovirus, which are surrogates for human NV. Among our findings, we found that SS-derived gallocatechin gallate compounds were capable of inactivating all viruses tested. Interestingly, a pyrogallol-enriched fraction (Fr 1C) inactivated all viruses more rapidly and effectively than did any of the component compounds used alone. We found that 25 µg/mL of Fr 1C inactivated >99.6% of SARS-CoV-2 within 10 s (reduction of &#8805;2.33 log10 TCID50/mL). Fr 1C resulted in the disruption of viral genomes and proteins as determined by gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR. Taken together, our results reveal the potential of Fr 1C for development as a novel antiviral disinfectant.","Takeda, Yohei; Murata, Toshihiro; Jamsransuren, Dulamjav; Suganuma, Keisuke; Kazami, Yuta; Batkhuu, Javzan; Badral, Duger; Ogawa, Haruko",Viruses,,355

This study assessed longitudinal changes in body weight and lifestyle behaviors in the US adults during the pandemic. METHODS: We used Qualtrics survey to collect self-reported data on body weight, dietary, physical activity, and psychological variables (n = 727) during the peak-lockdown (April/May) and at post-lockdown (September/October). Peak-lockdown weight data were categorized based on the magnitude of weight gained, maintained, or lost, and behavioral differences were examined between categories at two time points. RESULTS: Body weight increased (+0.62 kg; p < 0.05) at the post-lockdown period. The body mass index also increased (26.38 ± 5.98 kg/m2 vs. 26.12 ± 5.81 kg/m2; p < 0.01) at the post-lockdown period vs. peak-lockdown period. Close to 40% of participants reported gaining either 1-4 lbs or >5 lbs of body weight during the peak-lockdown, while 18.2% lost weight. Weight-gainers engaged in riskier dietary behaviors such as frequent ultra-processed food intake (p < 0.01) and snacking (p < 0.001), were less active, and reported high stress and less craving control during peak-lockdown. Of those gaining >5 lbs, 33% continued to gain weight after the lockdown eased, while 28% maintain higher body weight. In weight-gainers, takeout meal frequency increased, and high ultra-processed food intake and stress, and low craving control continued to persist after the lockdown eased. CONCLUSION: We show that the COVID-19 lockdown periods disrupted weight management among many Americans and that associated health effects are likely to persist.","Bhutani, Surabhi; vanDellen, Michelle R; Cooper, Jamie A",Nutrients,,355

The clinical presentation of COVID-19 ranges from that of being asymptomatic to developing a fatal illness characterized by multiple organ involvement. Approximately 20% of the patients will require hospitalization; one-quarter of hospitalized patients will develop severe COVID-19 requiring admission to the intensive care unit, most frequently, with acute respiratory failure. An ongoing effort is being made to identify the patients that will develop severe COVID-19. Overall, patients present with 3 different phenotypes of nutrition risk: (1) the frail older patient, (2) the patient with severe ongoing chronic illness, and (3) the patient with severe and morbid obesity. These 3 phenotypes represent different nutrition risks and diverse nutrition interventions. This article explores the different potential approaches to nutrition intervention in patients with COVID-19, evaluating, in this process, the challenges faced in the implementation of guidelines written by different societies.","Ochoa, Juan B; Cárdenas, Diana; Goiburu, María E; Bermúdez, Charles; Carrasco, Fernando; Correia, M Isabel T D",JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr,,355

It is referred to as a SEIRDEoIo since the dead individuals caused by the disease are defined as a new subpopulation. The potential contribution of the disease propagation of non-resident external infected travellers is considered as well as a re-susceptibility which increases the susceptible numbers and a parallel loss of immunity caused by a potential delayed re-infection. The model is also studied under eventual vaccination and treatment controls each one of them including two additive terms including proportional feedback of the susceptible and infectious, respectively, as well as control actions being independent of the population numbers. The disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are characterized, as well as their dependence on the control gains, and their stability properties are also studied. It is found that they are unique and only one of the two is a global attractor depending on the model parameter values. Typically, the value of the basic reproduction number is crucial to characterize the stability or, alternatively, that of the coefficient transmission rate provided that the remaining parameters are prefixed. The controls are also useful to increase the admissible minimum threshold of the infection force compatible with the stability of the disease-free equilibrium point. Simulation results are given, some of them related to parameterizations of usefulness related to the recent COVID-19, while others to a varicella case study.","De la Sen, M.; Ibeas, A.; Garrido, A.",Physica Scripta,,355

Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes and olfactory epithelial cells are likely under-appreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, correlating with reported loss of sense of taste and smell as early indicators of COVID-19 infection, including in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Airway club cells, ciliated cells and type II pneumocytes in the lung, and enterocytes of the gut also express ACE2.

The use of masks has been reported as an essential strategy to prevent coronavirus transmission, but masks can become contaminated rapidly after use. Metals species containing compounds, especially those from the copper group, present properties that can be explored to suppress viral activity. Natural polymers, like alginate, can improve biocompatibility and adjust metal ion availability on hybrid coatings. This study assesses iron, copper, silver, and gold salts and their combination with biopolymers to design surfaces with virucidal properties. Viral inactivation assays with MHV-3 coronavirus strain and cytotoxicity tests with L929 cells were conducted to the hybrid coatings on polypropylene masks. These coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance device, and atomic absorption spectroscopy techniques. Multilayer coatings of alginate-copper sulfate presented 99.99% viral inactivation in a timely release of copper ions.","Bataglioli, Rogério A.; Neto, João B. M.

402789,Impact of Personal Protective Equipment on Intravascular Access Effectiveness,2021,"COVID-19 can worsen the physical health of individuals with serious mental illness, a vulnerable group already facing physical health disparities. COVID-19 is further reducing access to physical health care due to shutdown of services deemed ""non-urgent"" and overcrowding of emergency services. Management of chronic diseases, highly prevalent in this group, is undermined due to exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, reduction in availability of social support, and worsening of negative social determinants of health. In this commentary, we discuss the challenges experienced by this group and offer mitigation strategies to reduce: (1) inequalities in access to physical health care; and (2) disruptions to the management of chronic physical conditions in the face of COVID-19. Recommendations include coordinated efforts by health authorities, primary and mental health care organizations, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. These efforts should ensure equitable access to physical health care and implementation of innovative programs to protect the physical health of people with serious mental illness during and following the pandemic.","Melamed, Osnat C; Hahn, Margaret K; Agarwal, Sri Mahavir; Taylor, Valerie H; Mulsant, Benoit H; Selby, Peter",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,355

413229,A Pinch of Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure: Proactive Dentistry in the Wake of COVID-19,2020,"Stressors caused by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) contribute to increased addictive behaviors in the general population worldwide. Little is known, however, about addictive behaviors of people who have recovered a long time ago, even years, from substance use disorder (SUD). The goal of the present research was to examine the craving for drug use and addictive behaviors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, viewing of pornography, gambling, and shopping online) of people who recovered from SUD, before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: During one week of isolation imposed in Israel following the outbreak of COVID-19 in April, 2020, a self-report questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of 113 people who had recovered from SUD, aged 22-69, 78% men. Results Fifty-one percent of participants reported craving drugs during the isolation period and engaging in addictive behaviors. Significant differences were found in tobacco and alcohol consumption, gambling, and viewing of pornography online, before and after the outbreak of the pandemic, especially in participants who reported having engaged in these addictive behaviors to some extent before the outbreak. A hierarchical linear regression showed a significant explained variance (R 2=44%, p<.001), with stronger feelings of loneliness and shorter length of time free from drug use being associated with stronger craving for drugs. Conclusions: The drug addiction treatment establishment should pay close attention and strengthen communication with people who recovered from SUD. It is necessary to develop real-time anti-craving and anti-replacement addiction interventions to prevent relapses.","Bonny-Noach, Hagit; Gold, Dudi",J Addict Dis,,355

Through all the uncertainty, national governments based their responses to COVID-19 on beliefs and political ideas, which was reflected on the diversity of the responses: liberal, authoritarian, centralized, decentralized, transparent, or opaque. In this article we focus on one of these responses, populism, and seek to understand how populist beliefs drive bureaucratic actions taken by a populist government to handle the health crisis. We conducted a comparative case study between the Mexican populist federal government and the non-populist Jalisco state government. Our findings suggest that the administrative actions chosen by the Mexican populist government were based on negative beliefs towards expert scientific knowledge from outside the government; a disinterest in searching for more information from distant or unfamiliar sources; and a strengthening of flagship programs as the main way to address the upcoming economic crisis. We also found that the Mexican government shows a peculiar manifestation of populism, which we refer as downsizing populism. Our article advances our understanding about how populism may affect the form and function of bureaucracies.","Renteria, Cesar; Arellano-Gault, David",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,355

It is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) that is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus belongs to coronavirus CoV family. It has a fast-spreading potential worldwide, which leads to high mortality regardless of lows death rates. Now some vaccines or a specific drug are approved but not available for every country for disease prevention and/or treatment. Therefore, it is a high demand to identify the known drugs and test them as a possible therapeutic approach. In this critical situation, one or more of these drugs may represent the only option to treat or reduce the severity of the disease, until some specific drugs or vaccines will be developed and/or approved for everyone in this pandemic. In this updated review, the available repurpose immunotherapeutic treatment strategies are highlighted, elucidating the crosstalk between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2. Despite the reasonable data availability, the effectiveness and safety of these drugs against SARS-CoV-2 needs further studies and validations aiming for a better clinical outcome.","Smail, Shukur Wasman; Saeed, Muhammad; Khudhur, Zhikal Omar; Younus, Delan Ameen; Rajab, Mustafa Fahmi; Abdulahad, Wayel Habib; Hussain, Hafiz Iftikhar; Niaz, Kamal; Safdar, Muhammad",Food Chem Toxicol,,355

432030,Management of odontogenic cervicofacial infections presenting to oral and maxillofacial units during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Health systems offer access to unscheduled care through numerous routes; however, it is typically provided by general practitioners (GPs), by emergency medicine doctors in in emergency departments (EDs) and by GPs in out-of-hours GP services such as practitioner cooperatives. Unscheduled healthcare constitutes a substantial portion of healthcare delivery. A systematic review was conducted to establish the factors that influence parents' decision making when seeking unscheduled healthcare for their children. The systematic review question was ""What are the factors that influence the decision making of parents and families seeking unscheduled paediatric healthcare?"" METHOD: Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS, PsycInfo, EconLit) and four grey literature databases (Proquest, Lenus, OpenGrey, Google Scholar) were searched. The titles and abstracts of 3746 articles were screened and full-text screening was performed on 177 of these articles. Fifty-six papers were selected for inclusion in the review. Data relating to different types of unscheduled health services (namely primary care, the emergency department and out-of-hours services) were extracted from these articles. A narrative approach was used to synthesise the extracted data. RESULTS: Several factors were identified as influencing parental preferences and decision making when seeking unscheduled healthcare for their children. A number of the included studies identified pre-disposing factors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) as impacting the healthcare-seeking behaviour of parents. Unscheduled healthcare use was often initiated by the parent's perception that the child's condition was urgent and their need for reassurance. The choice of unscheduled service was influenced by a myriad of factors such as: waiting times, availability of GP appointments, location of the ED, and the relationship that the parent or caregiver had with their GP. CONCLUSION: Policy and planning initiatives do not always reflect how patients negotiate the health system as a single entity with numerous entry points. Altering patients' behaviour through public health initiatives that seek to improve, for instance, health literacy or reducing emergency hospital admissions through preventative primary care requires an understanding of the relative importance of factors that influence behaviour and decision making, and the interactions between these factors.","Nicholson, E; McDonnell, T; De Brún, A; Barrett, M; Bury, G; Collins, C; Hensey, C; McAuliffe, E",BMC Health Serv Res,,355

435970,Personal Protective Equipment Use by Healthcare Workers in Intensive Care Unit During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan: Comparative Analysis With the PPE-SAFE Survey,2020,"Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is currently not recommended in noncritically ill patients for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, the diagnosis is based on the RT-PCR test on a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and abnormal findings on the chest CT scan. However, the sensitivity of the NPS and the specificity of the chest CT scan are low. Results of BAL in case of negative NPS testing are underreported, especially in the subgroup of immunocompromised patients. Objectives: The added value of BAL in the management of unstable, but noncritically ill patients, suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection despite one previous negative NPS and the side effects of the procedure for the patients and the health-care providers, were assessed during the epidemic peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Belgium. Methods: This multicentric study included all consecutive noncritically ill patients hospitalized with a clinical and radiological suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection but with a negative NPS. BAL was performed according to a predefined decisional algorithm based on their state of immunocompetence, the chest CT scan features, and their respiratory status. Results: Among the 55 patients included in the study, 14 patients were diagnosed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, there was a relationship between the cycle threshold of the RT-PCR and the interval of time between the symptom onset and the BAL procedure (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.8, p = 0.0004). Therapeutic management was changed in 33 patients because another infectious agent was identified in 23 patients or because an alternative diagnosis was made in 10 patients. In immunocompromised patients, the impact of BAL was even more marked (change in therapy for 13/17 patients). No significant adverse event was noted for patients or health-care staff. All health-care workers remained negative for SARS-CoV-2 NPS and serology at the end of the study. Conclusions: In this real-life study, BAL can be performed safely in selected noncritically ill patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing significant clinical benefits that outweigh the risks.","Taton, Olivier; Papleux, Emmanuelle; Bondue, Benjamin; Knoop, Christiane; Van Laethem, Sébastien; Bauler, Alain; Martiny, Delphine; Montesinos, Isabel; Delforge, Marie-Luce; Elmaouhab, Kahina; Leduc, Dimitri",Pulm Med,,355
437077,93 An audit of a hospice paracentesis service before and during Covid19,2021,"Human life comes to a standstill as many countries shut themselves off from the work due to the novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that hit the world severely in the first quarter of 2020. All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range: -10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8â¯mg/l decrease) compared with the pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 - April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima.","Yunus, Ali P; Masago, Yoshifumi; Hijioka, Yasuaki",Sci Total Environ,,355
437152,Involving pharmacy students in clinical research: Tips and best practices,2020,"When patients with chronic kidney disease are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) they can face two specific problems: virus-specific immune responses may be impaired and remdesivir, an antiviral drug described to shorten recovery, is contraindicated. Antiviral treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) could be an alternative treatment option. In this case report, we present two kidney transplant recipients and two hemodialysis patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received CP. Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined sequentially by immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay and specific cellular responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot. Before treatment, in both kidney transplant recipients and one hemodialysis patient antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers (&#8804;1:40). ELISpot responses in the four patients were either weak or absent. After CP treatment, we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific cellular responses. After intermittent clinical improvement, one kidney transplant recipient again developed typical symptoms on Day 12 after treatment and received a second cycle of CP treatment. Altogether, three patients clinically improved and could be discharged from the hospital. However, one 83-year-old multimorbid patient deceased. Our data suggest that the success of CP therapy may only be temporary in patients with chronic kidney disease; which requires close monitoring of viral load and antiviral immunity and possibly an adaptation of the treatment regimen.","Lindemann, Monika; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Dolff, Sebastian; Konik, Margarethe; Rohn, Hana; Platte, Maximillian; Thümmler, Laura; Schwarzkopf, Sina; Schipper, Leonie; Bormann, Maren; van de Sand, Lukas; Breyer, Marianne; Klump, Hannes; Knop, Dietmar; Lenz, Veronika; Temme, Christian; Dittmer, Ulf; Horn, Peter A; Witzke, Oliver",J Med Virol,,355
438911,COVID-19 and Corticosteroids: Unfamiliar but Potentially Fatal Infections That Can Arise following Short-Course Steroid Treatment,2021,"Delirium, a form of acute brain dysfunction, is very common in the critically ill adult patient population. Although its pathophysiology is poorly understood, multiple factors associated with delirium have been identified, many of which are coincident with critical illness. To date, no drug or non-drug treatments have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with delirium. Clinical trials have provided a limited understanding of the contributions of multiple triggers and processes of intensive care unit (ICU) acquired delirium, making identification of therapies difficult. Delirium is independently associated with poor long term outcomes, including persistent cognitive impairment. A longer duration of delirium is associated with worse long term cognition after adjustment for age, education, pre-existing cognitive function, severity of illness, and exposure to sedatives. Interestingly, differences in prevalence are seen between ICU survivor populations, with survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome experiencing higher rates of cognitive impairment at early follow-up compared with mixed ICU survivor populations. Although cognitive performance improves over time for some ICU survivors, impairment is persistent in others. Studies have so far been unable to identify patients at higher risk of long term cognitive impairment; this is an active area of scientific investigation.","Wilcox, M Elizabeth; Girard, Timothy D; Hough, Catherine L",BMJ,,355

450233,Public Priorities and Concerns Regarding COVID-19 in an Online Discussion Forum: Longitudinal Topic Modeling,2020,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the response of the radiology workforce to the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on professional practice in India and eight other Middle Eastern and North African countries. It further investigated the levels of fear and anxiety among this workforce during the pandemic. METHODS: A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 22 May-2 June 2020 among radiology workers employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey collected information related to the following themes: (1) demographic characteristics, (2) the impact of COVID-19 on radiology practice, and (3) fear and (4) anxiety emanating from the global pandemic. RESULTS: We received 903 responses. Fifty-eight percent had completed training on infection control required for handling COVID-19 patients. A large proportion (79.5%) of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that personal protective equipment (PPE) was adequately available at work during the pandemic. The respondents reported experiences of work-related stress (42.9%), high COVID-19 fear score (83.3%) and anxiety (10%) during the study period. CONCLUSION: There was a perceived workload increase in general x-ray and Computed Tomography imaging procedures because they were the key modalities for the initial and follow-up investigations of COVID-19. However, there was adequate availability of PPE during the study period. Most radiology workers were afraid of being infected with the virus. Fear was predominant among workers younger than 30 years of age and also in temporary staff. Anxiety occurred completely independent of gender, age, experience, country, place of work, and work status. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is important to provide training and regular mental health support and evaluations for healthcare professionals, including radiology workers, during similar future pandemics.","Elshami, W; Akudjedu, T N; Abuzaid, M; David, L R; Tekin, H O; Cavli, B; Issa, B",,,355
452349,Reusable respirators as personal protective equipment during ENT surgery,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (CoV2) virus, first identified in Wuhan, China, caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which soon became a global pandemic, as labelled by the World Health Organization (WHO). The transmission method of the infection is primarily through droplets of various sizes. The SARS-CoV2 virus leads to a severe respiratory illness which in the first place causes the simulation of the acute respiratory syndrome. In order to diagnose of COVID-19 efficiently, samples with infection probability need to be examined through histopathological methods. Survival chances of the infected can remarkably increase if the virus is diagnosed timely by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. One of the destructive effects of COVID-19 is the formation of ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lungs which might be regarded to be equivalent to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). COVID-19 acts very similarly to SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) which can be inactivated by the chemical compounds of ethanol and sodium hypochlorite. Epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 have been indicated by numerous studies; however, there is still a lack of details of pathologic changes in the lung. The present comprehensive review is an attempt to assess and cover the current state of knowledge on COVID-19 disease based on the histopathologic studies conducted before May 2020.","Balaky, Salah Tofik Jalal; Zaki Abdullah, Sahar Mohammed; Alexander, Markov; Maashi, Marwah Suliman; Alkaim, Ayad F; Shahriyari, Sara; Tabari, Fariba; Kazemi, Elham",Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),,355
453039,Fifteen-minute consultation: Recognition of sickle cell crises in the paediatric emergency department,2021,"Kidneys are one of the targets for SARS-CoV-2, it is reported that up to 36% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection would develop into acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is associated with high mortality in the clinical setting and contributes to the transition of AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Up to date, the underlying mechanisms are obscure and there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19-induced AKI. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms and interactions between Quercetin and SARS-CoV-2 targets proteins by using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The renal protective effects of Quercetin on COVID-19-induced AKI may be associated with the blockade of the activation of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways. Quercetin may also serve as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor by binding with the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL and ACE2, therefore suppressing the functions of the proteins to cut the viral life cycle. In conclusion, Quercetin may be a novel therapeutic agent for COVID-19-induced AKI. Inhibition of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways may be the critical mechanisms by which Quercetin protects kidney from SARS-CoV-2 injury.","Gu, Yue-Yu; Zhang, Min; Cen, Huan; Wu, Yi-Fan; Lu, Zhaoyu; Lu, Fuhua; Liu, Xu-Sheng; Lan, Hui-Yao",PLoS One,,355

This paper proposes a wearable device with the Internet of Things (IoT) integration for real-time monitoring of body temperature the indoor condition via an alert system to the person in quarantine. The alert is transferred when the body thermal exceeds the allowed threshold temperature. Moreover, an algorithm Repetition Spikes Counter (RSC) based on an accelerometer is employed in the role of human activity recognition to realize whether the quarantined person is doing physical exercise or not, for auto-adjustment of threshold temperature. The real-time warning and stored data analysis support the family members/doctors in following and updating the quarantined people's body temperature behavior in the tele-distance. The experiment includes an M5stickC wearable device, a Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer, an infrared thermometer, and a digital temperature sensor equipped with the user's wrist. The indoor temperature and humidity are measured to restrict the virus spread and supervise the room condition of the person in quarantine. The information is transferred to the cloud via Wi-Fi with Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker. The Bluetooth is integrated as an option for the data transfer from the self-isolated person to the electronic device of a family member in the case of Wi-Fi failed connection. The tested result was obtained from a student in quarantine for 14 days. The designed system successfully monitored the body temperature, exercise activity, and indoor condition of the quarantined person that handy during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Hoang, Minh Long; Carratù, Marco; Paciello, Vincenzo; Pietrosanto, Antonio",Sensors (Basel),,355

Brazil is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, ranking second with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide as of mid-June 2020. The ELSI-COVID-19 initiative is based on telephone interviews with participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), conducted on a nationally representative sample of the population aged 50 or older. This initiative aims to provide information on adherence to preventive measures (social distancing, wearing masks, and handwashing/hygiene); reasons for leaving the house, when that was the case; difficulties obtaining medications, medical diagnosis of COVID-19, and receipt of confirmatory results; use of health-care services (recent care-seeking, care-seeking location, care receipt, among other aspects); and mental health (sleep, depression, and loneliness). The first round of telephone interviews was conducted between May 26 and June 8, 2020. The second and third rounds are expected to occur within the coming months.

Interestingly, early imaging studies documented that pulmonary vascular thickening was specifically associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, implying a potential tropism of the virus for the pulmonary vasculature. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with inflammation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage and lung coagulopathy promoting endothelial dysfunction and microthrombosis. These features are strikingly similar to what is seen in pulmonary vascular diseases. Although the consequences of COVID-19 on the pulmonary circulation remain to be explored, several viruses have been previously thought to be involved in the development of pulmonary vascular diseases. Patients with preexisting pulmonary vascular diseases also appear at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The present article reviews the molecular factors shared by coronaviruses infection and pulmonary vasculature defects, and the clinical relevance of pulmonary vascular alterations in the context of COVID-19.","Potus, Francois; Mai, Vicky; Lebret, Marius; Malenfant, Simon; Breton-Gagnon, Emilie; Lajoie, Annie C; Boucherat, Olivier; Bonnet, Sebastien; Provencher, Steeve","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,355
461828,Operating during the COVID-19 pandemic: How to reduce medical error,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected African American populations disproportionately with respect to prevalence, and mortality. Expression profiles represent snapshots of combined genetic, socio-environmental (including socioeconomic and environmental factors), and physiological effects on the molecular phenotype. As such, they have potential to improve biological understanding of differences among populations, and provide therapeutic biomarkers and environmental mitigation strategies. Here, we undertook a large-scale assessment of patterns of gene expression between African Americans and European Americans, mining RNA-Seq data from 25 non-diseased and diseased (tumor) tissue-types. We observed the widespread enrichment of pathways implicated in COVID-19 and integral to inflammation and reactive oxygen stress. Chemokine CCL3L3 expression is up-regulated in African Americans. GSTM1, encoding a glutathione S-transferase that metabolizes reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, is upregulated. The little-studied F8A2 gene is up to 40-fold more highly expressed in African Americans; F8A2 encodes HAP40 protein, which mediates endosome movement, potentially altering the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2. African American expression signatures, superimposed on single cell-RNA reference data, reveal increased number or activity of esophageal glandular cells and lung ACE2-positive basal keratinocytes. Our findings establish basal prognostic signatures that can be used to refine approaches to minimize risk of severe infection and improve precision treatment of COVID-19 for African Americans. To enable dissection of causes of divergent molecular phenotypes, we advocate routine inclusion of metadata on genomic and socio-environmental factors for human RNA-sequencing studies.","Singh, Urminder; Hernandez, Kyle M; Aronow, Bruce J; Wurtele, Eve Syrkin",Sci Rep,,355

465410,Can gendered personal protective equipment design account for high infection rates in female healthcare workers following intubation? A reply,2020,"BACKGROUND: the emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic struck the national and regional health system that needed an effort to reorganise and increase resources to cope with a sudden, uncertain, and previously unknown situation. This study was conducted in the immediate aftermath of this difficult period. OBJECTIVES: to describe clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, and management of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that accessed the emergency department (ED) of the San Luigi Gonzaga hospital of Orbassano (Turin district, Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) in March and April 2020. Furthermore, this study aimed at investigating if a difference in patients characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes was present during time. DESIGN: comparison of different periods in a clinical cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: for each patient who accessed the ED and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 swab, the ED medical record was collected and a descriptive analysis was performed on demographical characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, parameters measured at triage, imaging exams results, lab tests results, separately for patients admitted at the ED in four different periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: discharge from ED, admission to hospital wards (low and high intensity of care), short term in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay. The association between patients' characteristics and the main outcomes was measured using multivariable logistic models. RESULTS: age of patients increased significantly from March to April, together with female prevalence and associated comorbid conditions. A significant difference in symptoms at presentation was not observed nor it was in laboratory test results. Severity at triage and need of intensive care resources were higher in the first weeks, together with the typical clinical presentation with respiratory failure and imaging with signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, in-hospital mortality was higher in the first period. Nevertheless, nearly half of patients in the first period were discharged directly from ED showing mild COVID-19 cases. On the contrary, in April an increasing need of hospitalisation in low intensity of care beds was observed, whereas mild cases stopped to access the ED. CONCLUSIONS: the results of this study suggest that in few weeks of COVID-19 epidemic both management of the patients at the hospital level - and probably at territorial level resulting in a different population who accessed to the ED - and the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients changed.","Caramello, Valeria; Maciotta, Alessandro; De Salve, Alessandro Vincenzo; Gobbi, Valentina; Ruffino, Tommaso Maria; Mazzetti, Giulia; Ricagni, Lorenzo; Ling, Camilla; Arione, Roberto; Boccuzzi, Adriana; Costa, Giuseppe; Sacerdote, Carlotta; Ricceri, Fulvio",Epidemiol Prev,,355

METHODS: We performed a qualitative study at an academic medical center in Portland, Oregon, in Spring 2020. We conducted semi-structured interviews, and conducted a thematic analysis, using an inductive approach, at a semantic level. RESULTS: We enrolled 27 participants, and identified four main themes: 1) shuttered community resources threatened patients' basic survival adaptations; 2) changes in outpatient care increased reliance on hospitals as safety nets; 3) hospital policy changes made staying in the hospital harder than usual; and, 4) care transitions out of the hospital were highly uncertain. DISCUSSION: Hospitalized adults with SUD were further marginalized during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic.

469108,Host proteases as determinants of coronaviral neurotropism and virulence,2020,"We present an ensemble forecast for Wave-3 of COVID-19 in the state of Karnataka, India, using the IISc Population Balance Model for infectious disease spread. The reported data of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases in Karnataka from 1 July 2020 to 4 July 2021 is utilized to tune the models parameters, and an ensemble forecast is done from 5 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. The ensemble is built with 972 members by varying seven critical parameters that quantify the uncertainty in the spread dynamics (antibody waning, viral mutation) and interventions (pharmaceutical, non-pharmaceutical). The probability of Wave-3, the peak date distribution, and the peak caseload distribution are estimated from the ensemble forecast. Our analysis shows that the most significant causal factors are compliance to Covid-appropriate behavior, daily vaccination rate, and the immune escape new variant emergence-time. These causal factors determine when and how severe the Wave-3 of COVID-19 would be in Karnataka. We observe that when compliance to Covid-Appropriate Behavior is good (i.e., lockdown-like compliance), the emergence of new immune-escape variants beyond Sep 21 is unlikely to induce a new wave. A new wave is inevitable when compliance to Covid-Appropriate Behavior is only partial. Increasing the daily vaccination rates reduces the peak active caseload at Wave-3. Consequently, the hospitalization, ICU, and Oxygen requirements also decrease. Compared to Wave-2, the ensemble forecast indicates that the number of daily confirmed cases of children (0-17 years) at Wave-3s peak could be seven times more on average.

We regard these searchers as Web searchers who are suspicious of their own COVID-19 infection (WSSCI). Second, we extracted the location of the WSSCI via the smartphone application. The spatio-temporal distribution of the number of WSSCI are compared with the actual location of the known two clusters. [Result and Discussion] Before the early stage of the cluster development, we could confirm several WSSCI, which demonstrated the basic feasibility of our WSSCI-based approach. However, it is accurate only in the early stage, and it was biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. For the case where the other cluster-related resources, such as fine-grained population statistics, are not available, the proposed metric would be helpful to catch the hint of emerging clusters.","Hisada, Shohei; Murayama, Taichi; Tsubouchi, Kota; Fujita, Sumio; Yada, Shuntaro; Wakamiya, Shoko; Aramaki, Eiji",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10100v1.pdf,355

One of the main reasons of the great impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on society is its unexpected spread, which has not allowed an adequate preparation. The scientific community is fighting against time for the production of a vaccine, but it is difficult to place a safe and effective product on the market as fast as the virus is spreading. Similarly, for drugs that can directly interfere with viral pathways, their production times are long, despite the great efforts made. For these reasons, we analyzed the possible role of non-pharmacological substances such as supplements, probiotics, and nutraceuticals in reducing the risk of Sars-CoV-2 infection or mitigating the symptoms of COVID-19. These substances could have numerous advantages in the current circumstances, are generally easily available, and have negligible side effects if administered at the already used and tested dosages. Large scientific evidence supports the benefits that some bacterial and molecular products may exert on the immune response to respiratory viruses. These could also have a regulatory role in systemic inflammation or endothelial damage, which are two crucial aspects of COVID-19. However, there are no specific data available, and rigorous clinical trials should be conducted to confirm the putative benefits of diet supplementation, probiotics, and nutraceuticals in the current pandemic.","Infusino, Fabio; Marazzato, Massimiliano; Mancone, Massimo; Fedele, Francesco; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; Severino, Paolo; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Santinelli, Letizia; Cavarretta, Elena; Marullo, Antonino G M; Miraldi, Fabio; Carnevale, Roberto; Nocella, Cristina; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Pagnini, Cristiano; Schiavon, Sonia; Pugliese, Francesco; Frati, Giacomo; d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella",Nutrients,,355

509346,Efficacy of personal protective equipment against coronavirus transmission via dental handpieces,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To investigate the possible effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on kidney function and assess the rate of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding/detection in urine. RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the research on the topic suggests that for the moment our ability to estimate whether SARS-CoV-2 is a direct causative agent in acute kidney injury (AKI) or whether it has a cytokine storm effect is limited. During our prospective assessment of 333 patients with COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) it was found that frequency of AKI of 9.6% (32 cases). Despite previous data suggestive of the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in urine, we were unable to identify any traces of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in our group. Both COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, ORâ=â23.09, confidence interval, CI 7.89-67.57, Pâ<â0.001) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) history (ORâ=â7.17, CI 2.09-24.47, Pâ=â0.002) were associated with the AKI rate. SUMMARY: AKI is a relatively frequent condition for patients with COVID-19 and is normally correlated with the severity of the disease and the patient's history of CKD. The available data fail to address whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA is present in urine, whereas our prospective trial data suggest that mRNA is undetectable in urine irrespective of the severity of the disease.","Enikeev, Dmitry; Taratkin, Mark; Efetov, Sergey; Shlomina, Alexandra; Boldyreva, Margarita; Galkina, Irina; Spivak, Leonid; Gitel, Evgeniy; Kuchieva, Agunda; Mikhailov, Vasiliy; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Herrmann, Thomas R W; Kikic, Zeljko; Fomin, Viktor; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Glybochko, Petr",Curr Opin Urol,,355

Because dentists are at a higher risk of contracting the disease, the present study assessed the fear and anxiety among dental practitioners of becoming infected with COVID-19. METHODS: An online cross-sectional questionnaire survey comprising of 9 questions was conducted among dental practitioners of Telangana. Age, gender, qualification, type of practice, years of practice, and place of residence were the demographic variables recorded. The response to each question was recorded in a YES or NO format, and mean fear score was calculated to categorize answers into low and high levels of fear. Comparison of mean fear score was done using t-test for 2 variables and analysis of variance for 3 or more than 3 variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the levels of fear with demographic variables was done. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean fear and anxiety score of this study population reported was high 6.57 ± 2.07, with 58.31% of the population presenting with a low level of fear and anxiety. Only qualification (P = 0.045) and gender (P = 0.035) revealed a significant difference in fear to Q7and Q8, respectively. Irrespective of the age, gender, qualification, type of practice, and years in practice, the levels of fear reported in the present study were very similar. Respondents between 41 and 60 y of age (6.70 ± 2.01 y) and those with individual practices (6.70 ± 2.06 y) exhibited high fear scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates cross-sectional data of fear and anxiety among dental practitioners during the COVID-19 outbreak. Heightened levels of fear observed in this study call for a nationwide analysis of fear among dentists and deliberate management strategies for the same.","Suryakumari, V B P; Pallavi Reddy, Y; Yadav, Sarjeev Singh; Doshi, Dolar; Surekha Reddy, V",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,355

METHODS: The life expectancy, cases, and death numbers of COVID-19 until 30th April 2021 were retrieved from open data to derive the epidemiological profiles and DALYs (including years of life lost (YLL) and years loss due to disability (YLD)) by four periods. The VSL estimates were estimated by using hedonic wage method (HWM) and contingent valuation method (CVM). The estimate of willingness to pay using CVM was based on the meta-regression mixed model. Machine learning method was used for classification. RESULTS: Globally, DALYs (in thousands) due to COVID-19 was tallied as 31,930 from Period I to IV. YLL dominated over YLD. The estimates of VSL were US$591 billion and US$5135 billion based on HWM and CVM, respectively. The estimate of VSL increased from US$579 billion in Period I to US$2160 billion in Period IV using CVM. The higher the human development index (HDI), the higher the value of DALYs and VSL. However, there exits the disparity even at the same level of HDI. Machine learning analysis categorized eight patterns of global burden of COVID-19 with a large variation from US$0.001 billion to US$691.4 billion. CONCLUSION: Global burden of COVID-19 pandemic resulted in substantial health and value of life loss particularly in developed economies. Classifications of such health and economic loss is informative to early preparation of adequate resource to reduce impacts.","Fan, Chiao-Yun; Fann, Jean Ching-Yuan; Yang, Ming-Chin; Lin, Ting-Yu; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi; Liu, Jin-Tan; Yang, Kuen-Cheh",J Formos Med Assoc,,355

Subunit vaccines can avoid potential toxicity associated with traditional whole virion-inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines; however, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines is often poor. A facile method is here reported to produce lipid nanoparticle subunit vaccines that exhibit high immunogenicity and elicit protection against influenza virus. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) immunogens are functionalized on the surface of liposomes via stable metal chelation chemistry, using a scalable advanced microfluidic mixing technology (NanoAssemblr). Immunization of mice with HA-liposomes elicits increased serum antibody titers and superior protection against highly pathogenic virus challenge compared with free HA protein. HA-liposomal vaccines display enhanced antigen deposition into germinal centers within the draining lymph nodes, driving increased HA-specific B cell, and follicular helper T cell responses. This work provides mechanistic insights into highly protective HA-liposome vaccines and informs the rational design and rapid production of next generation nanoparticle subunit vaccines.","Vu, Mai N; Kelly, Hannah G; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Juno, Jennifer A; Esterbauer, Robyn; Davis, Thomas P; Truong, Nghia P; Wheatley, Adam K; Kent, Stephen J",Adv Healthc Mater,,355

Our aim is to report on the clinical characteristics, treatments and prognoses of COVID‐19. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single‐centre, case series of 136 patients who were diagnosed with COVID‐19 at Wuhan Third Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 28 January 2020 and 12 February 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment features and prognoses were summarized. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The 136 patients were divided into a moderate (M) group (n = 103, 75.7%) and a severe and critical (SC) group (n = 33, 24.3%). There were significant differences in the incidences of concomitant chronic medical illnesses (eg, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease), fever, dry cough and dyspnoea among the two groups (P < .05). Compared with those in the M group, lymphocyte count (LYM) decreased significantly in the SC group, while the serum levels of C‐reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine (Cre), D‐dimer, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin (MB) and troponin I (cTnl) increased significantly in the SC group (P < .05). The main therapeutic drugs were antivirals, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, immunomodulators, traditional Chinese medicine preparations and symptomatic support drugs. There were significant differences in the incidences of shock, myocardial injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and renal injury among the two groups (P < .05). Among the 136 patients, 99 (72.7%) were cured, 14 (10.3%) were transferred to other hospital and 23 (16.9%) died. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with chronic diseases are more likely to develop severe or critical COVID‐19 with multiple organ damage or systemic injuries. The improvement of LYM and CRP may be associated with the prognoses of COVID‐19. The combined use of three or more antiviral drugs is to be avoided. The combination of broad‐spectrum antibacterial drugs is not recommended and the risk of drug‐induced liver injury should be monitored. Throughout a patient's hospitalization, their treatment plan should be evaluated and adjusted according to their vital signs, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging changes. Patients should receive effective psychological counselling.","Yang, Qiuxiang; Xie, Ling; Zhang, Wei; Zhao, Lin; Wu, HuaJun; Jiang, Jie; Zou, Jili; Liu, Jianguang; Wu, Jun; Chen, Yonggang; Wu, Jinhu",J Clin Pharm Ther,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449224/,355

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (SCT) are genetic conditions that occur predominantly among Black individuals. It is unknown if individuals with SCD/SCT are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness compared with Black individuals who do not have SCD/SCT. The objective of our study was to compare COVID-19 outcomes, including the disease manifestations, hospitalization, and death, among individuals with SCD/SCT vs Black individuals who do not have SCD/SCT. We leveraged electronic health record data from a multisite research network to identify Black patients with COVID-19 who have SCD/SCT and those who do not have SCD/SCT. During the study period of 20 January 2020 to 20 September 2020, there were 312 patients with COVID-19 and SCD and 449 patients with COVID-19 and SCT. There were 45 517 Black persons who were diagnosed with COVID-19 but who did not have SCD/SCT. After 1:1 propensity score matching (based on age, sex, and other preexisting comorbidities), patients with COVID-19 and SCD remained at a higher risk of hospitalization (relative risk [RR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7) and development of pneumonia (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.4) and pain (RR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.5-4.8) compared with Black persons without SCD/SCT.

However, self-enhancing biases hinder accurate susceptibility perceptions, leaving some individuals to feel invulnerable in the face of acute health risks. Since such biases are prominent characteristics of individuals with narcissistic personality traits, this article empirically examined whether low perceived susceptibility of infection with COVID-19 is related to subclinical narcissism, as measured with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI-16) and the Narcissism Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire (NARQ). We report the findings from a worldwide sample (N = 244), a UK sample before governmental pandemic restrictions (N = 261), a UK sample after restrictions (N = 261) and a pooled data analysis (N = 766). Overall, grandiose narcissism as measured with the NPI-16 predicted lower perceived susceptibility of infection, also after controlling for age and gender, whereas the NARQ Admiration subscale predicted higher perceived susceptibility.

The aims of the study were to investigate continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics in children and adults with T1D during lockdown and to identify their potentially related factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 130 consecutive patients with T1D (30 children (≤12 years), 24 teenagers (13–17 years), and 76 adults (≥18 years)) using either Dexcom or FreeStyle LibreCGM>70% during the study period, without hybrid closed-loop insulin pump. CGM metrics during the 20 days before and the 20 days after lockdown were calculated. By telephonic contact, we performed validated physical activity and perceived stress questionnaires. RESULTS: In children, significantly lower glucose SD (SDglu) (p=0.029) and time below range (TBR)<54 mg/dL (TBR2) (p=0.029) were detected after lockdown. CGM metrics were comparable in teenagers before and during lockdown. After lockdown, adults improved significantly time in range (TIR) 70–180 mg/dL (p<0.001) and remaining metrics, except percent coefficient of variation and TBR2. In adults, considering the changes in SDglu and TIR occurred before and during lockdown, we identified a group with improved TIR and SDglu who performed more physical activity, one with improved glucose variability who was younger than the other patients, and one with worsened glucose variability who showed higher perceived stress than others. CONCLUSION: In patients with T1D during lockdown, CGM metrics mostly improved in children and adults, whereas it was unchanged in teenagers. In adults, age, physical activity, and perceived stress may be relevant contributing factors.","Di Dalmazi, Guido; Maltoni, Giulio; Bongiorno, Claudio; Tucci, Lorenzo; Di Natale, Valeria; Moscatiello, Simona; Laffi, Gilberto; Pession, Andrea; Zucchini, Stefano; Pagotto, Uberto",BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115820/,355

Existing tests, such as RT-qPCR, have limitations including long assay time, low throughput, inadequate sensitivity, and suboptimal portability. Emerging biosensing technologies hold the promise to develop tests that are rapid, highly sensitive, and suitable for point-of-care testing, which could significantly facilitate the testing of COVID-19. Despite that, practical applications of such biosensors in pandemics have yet to be achieved.

A neutralizing antibody CC12.1 which was found in SARS-CoV-2 patient samples provides potential protection from disease. The aim of molecular dynamics simulations is to identify key epitopes that are crucial to the antibody binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) to promote the development of superior antibodies. Binding modes of the antibody were investigated and compared with RBD bound receptor ACE2. Key epitopes were revealed and a distal motif of RBD (residue numbers 473-488) was demonstrated by analyzing dynamic trajectories. Compared to the receptor ACE2, conformation of RBD could be better stabilized through additional interaction of antibody with the distal motif of RBD, which was further found driven by electrostatic complementarity. By further analysis of the extensive hydrogen-bonding networks, residues D405, K417, Y421, Y453, L455, R457, Y473, A475, N487, G502, Y505 of RBD, which mainly interacted with CDR H3/L3 and two conserved motifs SNY, SGGS, were identified as key epitopes. Higher binding free energy calculated after point mutations on key residues confirms the crucial role for the specific binding. Subsequently, mutations of V(H) V98E and V(L) G68D in CC12.1, which could significantly enhance the binding affinity of the antibody, were also proposed. The results indicate the key epitopes for antibody binding and give explanations for failure of neutralization antibody caused by specific residues mutations on structural basis. Simulations of two point mutations on antibody provide feasible information for advanced antibody design.","Wang, Daojiong; Ge, Yushu; Zhong, Bin; Liu, Dan",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037021000933; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021000933?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777333/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.03.021,355

In this narrative review, we examine the impact of the pandemic on significant global health disparities affecting vulnerable populations of psychiatric patients: People of diverse ethnic background and color, children with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, pregnant women, mature adults, and those patients living in urban and rural communities. The identified disparities cause worsened mental health outcomes placing psychiatric patients at higher risk for depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Those psychiatric patients who are ethnic minorities display barriers to care, including collective trauma and structural racism. Sexual and gender minorities with mental illness face discrimination and limited access to treatment. Pregnant women with psychiatric diagnoses show higher exposure to domestic violence. Children with disabilities face a higher risk of worsening behavior. Mature adults with psychiatric problems show depression due to social isolation. Psychiatric patients who live in urban communities face pollutants and overcrowding compared to those living in rural communities, which face limited access to telehealth services. We suggest that social programs that decrease discrimination, enhance communal resilience, and help overcome systemic barriers of care should be developed to decrease global health disparities in vulnerable population.","Diaz, Ailyn; Baweja, Ritika; Bonatakis, Jessica K; Baweja, Raman",World J Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i4.94; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33889535/,355

Celiac disease Adherence Test (CDAT) is a valid English-language questionnaire that is used for assessing the adherence to the GFD. In the present study, we aimed to translate the CDAT questionnaire in Persian and evaluate its validity and reliability. METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, CDAT was translated and back-translated by three bilingual professional translators. Content validity was evaluated by 12 gastroenterologists and nutritionists. To assess the construct validity, 230 patients with celiac disease were randomly selected from the national celiac disease registry database. Internal consistency of the items and test-retest reliability were assessed by Cronbach’s alpha and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). To assess the convergent validity of the questionnaire, the correlation coefficient between the CDAT score and anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (anti-t-TG-IgA) titer was assessed. RESULTS: The content validity index, content validity ratio, and impact score of the Persian version of CDAT (Pv-CDAT) were 0.97, 0.95, and 4.61 respectively. Three significant factors were extracted and according to the confirmatory factor analysis the three-factor model had adequate fitness (chi-square p-value of 0.74, root mean error of approximation: 0.001 [95% CI: 0.001–0.083], comparative fit index: 1, standardized root mean squared residual: 0.04, and coefficient of determination: 0.78). The questionnaire had good feasibility with the floor effect of 3.1% and the ceiling effect of 0.4%. Moreover, it has high internal consistency (Cronbach-alpha: 0.71) and test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.78). The correlations between CDAT categories and anti-tTG-IgA categories showed a significant correlation between the two tests (r = 0.53; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that the Pv-CDAT questionnaire with high validity, reliability, and internal consistency can be used for assessing adherence to the GFD in adult celiac patients in Iran.","Nikniaz, Zeinab; Asghari Jafarabadi, Mohammad; Ghaffarifar, Saeideh; Saeedi, Zahra; Akbari Namvar, Zahra; Shirmohammadi, Masood",BMC Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727540/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-020-01396-8,355

635168,The Impact of Preparedness in Defying COVID-19 Pandemic Expectations in the Lower Mekong Region: A Case Study,2021-01-28,"RNA viruses successfully adapt to various environments by repeatedly producing new mutants, often through generating a number of nucleotide substitutions. To estimate the degree of variation in mutation rates of RNA viruses and to understand the source of such variation, we studied the synonymous substitution rate because synonymous substitution is exempt from functional constraints at the protein level, and its rate reflects the mutation rate to a great extent. We estimated the synonymous substitution rates for a total of 49 different species of RNA viruses, and we found that the rates had tremendous variation by 5 orders of magnitude (from 1.3 × 10(−7) to 6.2 × 10(−2) /synonymous site/year). Comparing the synonymous substitution rates with the replication frequencies and replication error rates for the RNA viruses, we found that the main source of the rate variation was differences in the replication frequency because the rates of replication error were roughly constant over different RNA viruses. Moreover, we examined a relationship between viral life strategies and synonymous substitution rates to understand which viral life strategies affect replication frequencies. The results show that the variation of synonymous substitution rates has been influenced most by either the difference in the infection modes or the differences in the transmission modes. In conclusion, the variation of mutation rates for RNA viruses is caused by different replication frequencies, which are affected strongly by the infection and transmission modes.","Hanada, Kousuke; Suzuki, Yoshiyuki; Gojobori, Takashi",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15014142/,355
636432,Using Flow Disruptions to Examine System Safety in Robotic-Assisted Surgery: Protocol for a Stepped Wedge Crossover Design,2021-02-09,"BACKGROUND: The availability of gene expression data that corresponds to pig immune response challenges provides compelling material for the understanding of the host immune system. Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to confirm and expand our knowledge by combining and studying at one time a vast set of independent studies creating large datasets with increased statistical power. In this study, we performed two meta-analyses of porcine transcriptomic data: i) scrutinized the global immune response to different challenges, and ii) determined the specific response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection. To gain an in-depth knowledge of the pig response to PRRSV infection, we used an original approach comparing and eliminating the common genes from both meta-analyses in order to identify genes and pathways specifically involved in the PRRSV immune response. The software Pointillist was used to cope with the highly disparate data, circumventing the biases generated by the specific responses linked to single studies. Next, we used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software to survey the canonical pathways, biological functions and transcription factors found to be significantly involved in the pig immune response. We used 779 chips corresponding to 29 datasets for the pig global immune response and 279 chips obtained from 6 datasets for the pig response to PRRSV infection, respectively. RESULTS: The pig global immune response analysis showed interconnected canonical pathways involved in the regulation of translation and mitochondrial energy metabolism. Biological functions revealed in this meta-analysis were centred around translation regulation, which included protein synthesis, RNA-post transcriptional gene expression and cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria dysfunctions, associated with stress signalling, were highly regulated. Transcription factors such as MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2 were found in this analysis to be potentially involved in the regulation of the immune response. The host specific response to PRRSV infection engendered the activation of well-defined canonical pathways in response to pathogen challenge such as TREM1, toll-like receptor and hyper-cytokinemia/ hyper-chemokinemia signalling. Furthermore, this analysis brought forth the central role of the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune response and the regulation of anti-inflammatory response. The most significant transcription factor potentially involved in this analysis was HMGB1, which is required for the innate recognition of viral nucleic acids. Other transcription factors like interferon regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 were also involved in the pig specific response to PRRSV infection. CONCLUSIONS: This work reveals key genes, canonical pathways and biological functions involved in the pig global immune response to diverse challenges, including PRRSV infection. The powerful statistical approach led us to consolidate previous findings as well as to gain new insights into the pig immune response either to common stimuli or specifically to PRRSV infection.","Badaoui, Bouabid; Tuggle, Christopher K; Hu, Zhiliang; Reecy, James M; Ait-Ali, Tahar; Anselmo, Anna; Botti, Sara",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23552196/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-220,355

This has a significant effect on the health of the mother and offspring. There is no doubt that screening for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks is important to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there is no consensus about diagnosis and treatment of GDM in early pregnancy. In this narrative review on the current evidence on screening for GDM in early pregnancy, we included 37 cohort studies and eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studies have shown that a high proportion (15–70%) of women with GDM can be detected early in pregnancy depending on the setting, criteria used and screening strategy. Data from observational studies on the potential benefit of screening and treatment of GDM in early pregnancy show conflicting results. In addition, there is substantial heterogeneity in age and BMI across the different study populations. Smaller RCTs could not show benefit but several large RCTs are ongoing. RCTs are also necessary to determine the appropriate cut-off for HbA1c in pregnancy as there is limited evidence showing that an HbA1c ≥6.5% has a low sensitivity to detect overt diabetes in early pregnancy.","Raets, Lore; Beunen, Kaat; Benhalima, Katrien",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803650/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10061257,355

This meta-analysis quantifies the prevalence of mortality among (1) diabetic and (2) non-diabetic, and (3) the prevalence of DM, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Published studies were retrieved from four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and medRxiv) and appraised critically utilizing the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s tool. Meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model. The measures of heterogeneity were ascertained by I- squared (I(2)) and Chi-squared (Chi(2)) tests statistics. Predictors of heterogeneity were quantified using meta-regression models. RESULTS: Of the reviewed 475 publications, 22 studies (chiefly case series (59.09 %)), sourcing data of 45,775 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, were deemed eligible. The weighted prevalence of mortality in hospitlized COVID-19 patients with DM (20.0 %, 95 % CI: 15.0–26.0; I(2), 96.8 %) was 82 % (1.82-time) higher than that in non-DM patients (11.0 %, 95 % CI: 5.0–16.0; I(2), 99.3 %). The prevalence of mortality among DM patients was highest in Europe (28.0 %; 95 % CI: 14.0–44.0) followed by the United States (20.0 %, 95 % CI: 11.0–32.0) and Asia (17.0 %, 95 % CI: 8.0–28.0). Sample size and severity of the COVID-19 were associated (p < 0.05) with variability in the prevalence of mortality. The weighted prevalence of DM among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 20 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 15–25, I(2), 99.3 %). Overall, the quality of the studies was fair. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were appreciably burdened with a high prevalence of DM. DM contributed to the increased risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to non-DM patients, particularly among critically ill patients.

Effective therapies are still awaited due to the lack of understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease. Bearing recent research and clinical observations in mind, the authors propose a novel physiological mechanism of COVID-19 and explain development of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 related hemoglobinopathy. It is a consistent observation that the radiological picture of COVID-19 related ARDS bears more resemblance to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) than typical ARDS. There has been great controversy regarding this proposed similarity. The main argument from those objecting to this comparison is that the etiology is hypoxia in case of HAPE and inflammation in COVID-19 related ARDS. We propose that considering the recent bioinformatics prediction models, COVID-19 might first infect red blood cells via CD147 and cause hemoglobin damage. The resulting hypoxemia may cause pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction leading to HAPE-like lung lesions. The now introduced alveolar hypoxia further exaggerates hemoglobinopathy hypoxemia leading to a vicious cycle. In this review, the authors recommend laboratory experiments to prove these hypotheses. The proposed physiological mechanism has significant therapeutic implications. If proven, the authors suggest the use of exchange transfusion as adjunct therapy and development of anti-CD147 drugs.","Shakoori, Tania Ahmed; Hafeez, Muhammad Mansoor; Malik, Arif",Acta Clin Croat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285445/; https://doi.org/10.20471/acc.2020.59.04.21,355

In addition, we used GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases to elucidate the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. ACE2 was elevated in UCEC and KIRP, and high ACE2 had a favorable prognosis. The expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage in KIRP, B cell, CD4+T cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell immune infiltration levels in UCEC. ACE2 was significantly positively correlated with the type markers of B cells and neutrophils, macrophages in UCEC, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with the type markers of macrophages. High ACE2 expression level had a favorable prognosis in different enriched immune cells subgroups in UCEC and KIRP. And the promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced. What’s more, we found that the expression of ACE2 decreased in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. In conclusion, ACE2 expression increased significantly in UCEC and KIRP, elevated ACE2 was positively correlated with immune infiltration and prognosis. Moreover, tumor tissues may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients with UCEC and KIRP, which may worsen the prognosis.","Yang, Jing; Li, Hongxia; Hu, Shengda; Zhou, Yafeng",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339157/,355
649148,Exposure to a Surrogate Measure of Contamination From Simulated Patients by Emergency Department Personnel Wearing Personal Protective Equipment,2020,"Foreign residents in Japan are amongst the vulnerable groups at risk to disasters in the country. Improvement is crucial in meeting Japan’s vison of zero casualties in major disaster events. If the case of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina is to offer an insight into migrants’ characteristics in mega-disaster situations, then a broader analysis of vulnerabilities is needed to avoid mass casualties should the anticipated megathrust earthquake occur. Hence, this study analyzes the vulnerabilities of foreign residents by utilizing their spatial distribution attributes in the Tokyo metropolitan area. This study uses multiple approaches that combine geographic information systems to analyze secondary and primary datasets. The results reveal that foreign nationals are spatially clustered in some parts of the metropolis, especially within a 7 km radius of Minato city. The densities in these areas alter the earthquake community vulnerability levels from 1.23% to 2.8% and from 5.42% to 13.46%, respectively. Although only 11% of foreign residents are prepared for any disaster, there is a high sense of interaction amongst them and Japanese nationals, which almost eliminates isolation within communities. This study therefore proposes the utilization of some of these attributes in mobilizing specifically targeted evacuation procedures, management of evacuation centers, and disaster risk information dissemination.","Adu-Gyamfi, Bismark; Shaw, Rajib",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921470/,355
650468,Severe odontogenic infections drastically dropped during the COVID19-confinement: because hospitals became sanctuaries or because of the massive interruption in the consumption of NSAIDs?,2020-10-29,"Leishmaniasis is a parasitic neglected tropical disease and result in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from a single ulceration to a progressive and fatal visceral disease. Comprising a limited and highly toxic therapeutic arsenal, new treatments are urgently needed. Targeting delivery of drugs has been a promising approach for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Phosphatidylserine-liposomes have demonstrated superior efficacy in VL, targeting intracellular parasites in host cells through macrophage scavenger receptors. In this work, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the antihelminthic drug nitazoxanide in a nanoliposomal formulation against Leishmania (L.) infantum. Physicochemical parameters of liposomes containing nitazoxanide (NTZ-LP) were determined by dynamic light scattering and small angle X-ray scattering. The efficacy of the formulation was verified in an intracellular amastigote model and in an experimental hamster model. Our findings showed that NTZ-LP was able to eliminate the amastigotes inside the host cell with an IC(50) value of 16 μM. NTZ-LP was labelled a fluorescent probe and by spectrofluorimetry, we observed that the infected macrophages internalized similar levels of the drug to the uninfected cells. The confocal microscopy images confirmed the uptake and demonstrated a diffuse distribution of the NTZ-LP in the cytoplasm of Leishmania-infected macrophages, with the vesicles in a closer proximity to the parasites. For the in vivo efficacy, the liposomal NTZ-LP was administrated intraperitoneally to Leishmania-infected hamsters for 10 consecutive days at 2 mg/kg/day. By qPCR we demonstrated a reduction of the parasite burden by 82% and 50% in the liver (p < 0.05) and spleen (p < 0.05), respectively. NTZ (non-liposomal) was administered at 100 mg/kg/day per oral (p.o.) for the same period, but demonstrated no efficacy. This liposomal formulation ensured a targeting delivery of NTZ to the intracellular parasites, resulting in an good efficacy at a low dose in animals, and it may represent a new candidate therapy for VL.","Pinto, Erika Gracielle; Barbosa, Leandro R.S.; Mortara, Renato A.; Tempone, Andre Gustavo",Chem Biol Interact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33096056/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109296; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009279720315325?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009279720315325,355

Olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is reported as one of the symptoms worldwide. As reported so far, different clinical features have been reported according to outbreak sites and gender; most of the patients, who complained of anosmia or hyposmia, were Europeans. We had a fast review for novel articles about COVID-19 infection and olfactory function. OBSERVATIONS: Rapid reviews for COVID-19 or other viral infection and olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions were done in this review. Up to date, a lot of reports have shown that olfactory dysfunction is related to viral infections but no exact mechanism, clinical course, and definite treatment have been discovered, which is also same in COVID-19. In general, intranasal steroid (INS) and oral steroid for short time help improve the recovery of the olfactory function in case of olfactory dysfunction after virus infection. Considering severe respiratory complications and immunocompromised state of COVID-19, the use of steroid should be limited and cautious because we do not have enough data to support the usage of steroid to treat olfactory dysfunction in the clinical course of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the days of pandemic COVID-19, we should keep in mind that olfactory dysfunctions, even without other upper respiratory infection or otolaryngologic symptoms, might be the early signs of COVID-19.","Kang, Yun Jin; Cho, Jin Hee; Lee, Min Hyeong; Kim, Yeon Ji; Park, Chan-Soon",Auris Nasus Larynx,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anl.2020.05.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0385814620301401; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0385814620301401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32553562/,355
658519,Resident Education in the Time of a Global Pandemic: Development of the Collaborative OMS Virtual Inter-Institutional Didactic (COVID) Program,2020-05-23,"Global warming and the rising prevalence of obesity are well described challenges of current mankind. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic arose as a new challenge. We here attempt to delineate their relationship with each other from our perspective. Global greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have exponentially increased since 1950. The main contributors to such greenhouse gas emissions are manufacturing and construction, transport, residential, commercial, agriculture, and land use change and forestry, combined with an increasing global population growth from 1 billion in 1800 to 7.8 billion in 2020 along with rising obesity rates since the 1980s. The current Covid-19 pandemic has caused some decline in greenhouse gas emissions by limiting mobility globally via repetitive lockdowns. Following multiple lockdowns, there was further increase in obesity in wealthier populations, malnutrition from hunger in poor populations and death from severe infection with Covid-19 and its virus variants. There is a bidirectional relationship between adiposity and global warming. With rising atmospheric air temperatures, people typically will have less adaptive thermogenesis and become less physically active, while they are producing a higher carbon footprint. To reduce obesity rates, one should be willing to learn more about the environmental impact, how to minimize consumption of energy generating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, and to reduce food waste. Diets lower in meat such as a Mediterranean diet, have been estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 72%, land use by 58%, and energy consumption by 52%.","Koch, Christian A.; Sharda, Pankaj; Patel, Jay; Gubbi, Sriram; Bansal, Rashika; Bartel, Michael J.",Horm Metab Res,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1533-2861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496408/,355

Its control is mainly achieved by using live attenuated vaccines. Here we explored the possibilities for rationally attenuating IBV to improve our knowledge regarding the function of IBV accessory proteins and for the development of next-generation vaccines with the recently established reverse genetic system for IBV H52 based on targeted RNA recombination and selection of recombinant viruses in embryonated eggs. To this aim, we selectively removed accessory genes 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b individually, and rescued the resulting recombinant (r) rIBV-Δ3a, rIBV-Δ3b, rIBV-Δ5a and rIBV-Δ5b. In vitro inoculation of chicken embryo kidney cells with recombinant and wild-type viruses demonstrated that the accessory protein 5b is involved in the delayed activation of the interferon response of the host after IBV infection. Embryo mortality after the inoculation of 8-day-old embryonated chicken eggs with recombinant and wild-type viruses showed that rIBV-Δ3b, rIBV-Δ5a and rIBV-Δ5b had an attenuated phenotype in ovo, with reduced titres at 6 h p.i. and 12 h p.i. for all viruses, while growing to the same titre as wild-type rIBV at 48 h p.i. When administered to 1-day-old chickens, rIBV-Δ3a, rIBV-Δ3b, rIBV-Δ5a and rIBV-Δ5b showed reduced ciliostasis in comparison to the wild-type viruses.

A previous report (Virology 2003, 311:16–27) indicated that transfected IBV 3b localized to the nucleus in mammalian cells using a vaccinia-virus expression system. Although we confirmed these findings, we observed cytoplasmic localization of IBV 3b with apparent exclusion from the nucleus in avian cells (IBV normally infects chickens). IBV 3b was virtually undetectable by microscopy in mammalian cells transfected without vaccinia virus and in IBV-infected mammalian cells because of a greatly reduced half-life in these cells. A proteasome inhibitor stabilized IBV 3b in mammalian cells, but had little effect on IBV 3b in avian cells, suggesting that rapid turnover of IBV 3b in mammalian cells is proteasome-dependent while turnover in avian cells may be proteasome-independent.

The nsp14 protein of SARS-CoV-2 houses a 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease activity responsible for removing mismatches that arise during genome duplication. A homology model of nsp10-nsp14 complex was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp14. This exercise showed that ritonavir might bind to the exoribonuclease active site of the nsp14 protein. A model of the SARS-CoV-2-nsp10-nsp14 complex bound to substrate RNA showed that the ritonavir binding site overlaps with that of the 3′ nucleotide of substrate RNA. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA and ritonavir suggested that the drug may bind to the active site of nsp14 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that ritonavir may prevent association with substrate RNA and thus inhibit the exoribonuclease activity of nsp14. Overall, our computational studies suggest that ritonavir may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp14 protein. nsp14 is known to attenuate the inhibitory effect of drugs that function through premature termination of viral genome replication. Hence, ritonavir may potentiate the therapeutic properties of drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin.","Narayanan, Naveen; Nair, Deepak T.",Int J Biol Macromol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813020351977?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33309661/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813020351977; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.038,355

SARS-CoV causes high fever in almost all patients, while SARS-CoV-2 does not. Moreover, analysis of the clinical data revealed that the higher body temperature is a protective factor in COVID-19 patients, making us to hypothesize a temperature-dependent binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 receptor. In this study, our molecular dynamics simulation and protein surface plasmon resonance cohesively proved the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 binding was less affinitive and stable under 40°C (∼18 nM) than the optimum temperature 37°C (6.2nM), while SARS-CoV-ACE2 binding was not (6.4nM vs. 8.5nM), which evidenced the temperature-dependent affinity and explained that higher temperature is related to better clinical outcome. The decreased infection at higher temperature was also validated by pseudovirus entry assay using Vero and Caco-2 cells. We also demonstrated the structural basis of the distinct temperature-dependence of the two coronaviruses. Furthermore, the meta-analysis revealed a milder inflammatory response happened in the early stage of COVID-19, which explained the low fever tendency of COVID-19 and indicated the co-evolution of the viral protein structure and the inflammatory response. The temperature dependence of the binding affinity also indicated that higher body temperature at early stages might be beneficial to the COVID-19 patients.","Zhou, Zhonghua; Yang, Ziyi; Ou, Junxian; Zhang, Hong; Zhang, Qiwei; Dong, Ming; Zhang, Gong",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343834/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037020305304; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020305304?v=s5,355
676276,COVID-19 acquisition risk among ICU nursing staff with patient-driven use of aerosol-generating respiratory procedures and optimal use of personal protective equipment,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) are prone to developing macrothrombosis and microthrombosis. COVID‐19 has been reported to be rarely associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13) severe deficiency, the hallmark of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), induces the formation of platelet, unusually large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer microthrombi. In immune‐mediated TTP, ADAMTS13 adopts specifically an open conformation. The VWF/ADAMTS13 couple may contribute to the microthrombi formation in pulmonary alveolar capillaries in COVID‐19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical features, hemostatic laboratory parameters, VWF/ADAMTS13 axis, and ADAMTS13 conformation in critically ill COVID‐19 patients at admission. METHODS: Fifty three critically ill COVID‐19 patients were enrolled between March 18 and May 9 2020 in a monocentric hospital. RESULTS: The median age was 59 years and the male‐to‐female ratio was 2.8/1. We reported seven pulmonary embolisms and 15 deaths. Biological investigations showed increased fibrinogen and factor V levels, and strongly increased D‐dimers correlated with mortality. No patient presented severe thrombocytopenia nor microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. An imbalance between high VWF antigen levels and normal or slightly decreased ADAMTS13 activity levels (strongly elevated VWF/ADAMTS13 ratio) was correlated with mortality. Three patients had a partial quantitative deficiency in ADAMTS13. We also reported a closed conformation of ADAMTS13 in all patients, reinforcing the specificity of an open conformation of ADAMTS13 as a hallmark of TTP. CONCLUSION: We suggest that slightly decreased or normal ADAMTS13 activity and highly elevated VWF are rather biomarkers reflecting both the strong inflammation and the endothelial damage rather than drivers of the thrombotic process of COVID‐19.","Joly, Bérangère S.; Darmon, Michael; Dekimpe, Charlotte; Dupont, Thibault; Dumas, Guillaume; Yvin, Elise; Beranger, Nicolas; Vanhoorelbeke, Karen; Azoulay, Elie; Veyradier, Agnès",J Thromb Haemost,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219357/,355

This study examined the mental health burden of COVID-19 amongst low-waged migrant workers involved in large-scale dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. Methods: Between 22 June to 11 October 2020, questionnaires were distributed in-person and online to 1011 migrant workers subjected to movement restrictions. Mental health symptoms were assessed using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As covariates, we also assessed participants' socio-demographics, quarantine status, COVID-19 health concerns, financial stability, and exposure to news and misinformation. Linear regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with each of the three DASS-21 subscales. Findings: Complete movement restrictions (e.g., prolonged in-dormitory quarantine) were associated with increased depression and stress symptoms, while being diagnosed with COVID-19 was associated with increased anxiety. Participants who harboured fears about their health or job, perceived their health to be poorer, or had higher exposure to COVID-19 rumours reported higher scores on all three subscales. At a group level, documented rates of severe or extremely severe depression (3.1%, 95% CI: 2.1-4.3%), anxiety (4.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-5.5%), and stress (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.7-2.2%) were similar to those observed in the general population for the host country. Interpretation: The risk factors identified underscore how the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on the mental health of migrant workers.

We compiled a daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 2020 (excluding Wuhan from our analysis due to missing data). Understanding the characteristics of spatiotemporal clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R0 is critical in effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. The prefectures were grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning techniques. We performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to estimate the revised R0 among different regions for prevention planning in an ongoing global pandemic. Finally, our results indicate that the impact of temperature and demographic (different age group percentage compared to the total population) factors on virus transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions will help prioritize segments of a given community/ region for action and provide a visual aid in designing prevention strategies for a specific geographic region. Furthermore, revised estimation and our methodology will aid in improving the human health consequences of COVID-19 elsewhere.","Khan, I.
