However, uncertainties about the epidemiology of emerging pathogens can make it difficult to choose among alternative model structures and assumptions. To assess the potential for uncertainties about emerging pathogens to affect forecasts of their spread, we evaluated the performance 16 forecasting models in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia. Each model featured a different combination of assumptions about human mobility, spatiotemporal variation in transmission potential, and the number of virus introductions. We found that which model assumptions had the most ensemble weight changed through time. We additionally identified a trade-off whereby some individual models outperformed ensemble models early in the epidemic, but on average the ensembles outperformed all individual models. Our results suggest that multiple models spanning uncertainty across alternative assumptions are necessary to obtain robust forecasts for emerging infectious diseases.","Oidtman, Rachel J.; Omodei, Elisa; Kraemer, Moritz U.

These bacteria rely on specific transporters for the acquisition of host-derived sialic acids. Here, we present the first comprehensive genomic and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial sialic acid transporters, leading to the identification of multiple new families and subfamilies. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that sialic acid-specific transport has evolved independently at least eight times during the evolution of bacteria, from within four of the major families/superfamilies of bacterial transporters, and we propose a robust classification scheme to bring together a myriad of different nomenclatures that exist to date. The new transporters discovered occur in diverse bacteria, including Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia, many of which are species that have not been previously recognized to have sialometabolic capacities. Two subfamilies of transporters stand out in being fused to the sialic acid mutarotase enzyme, NanM, and these transporter fusions are enriched in bacteria present in gut microbial communities. Our analysis supports the increasing experimental evidence that competition for host-derived sialic acid is a key phenotype for successful colonization of complex mucosal microbiomes, such that a strong evolutionary selection has occurred for the emergence of sialic acid specificity within existing transporter architectures.","Severi, Emmanuele; Rudden, Michelle; Bell, Andrew; Palmer, Tracy; Juge, Nathalie; Thomas, Gavin H.",Microb Genom,713,5

Liver transplantation is the only effective therapy for this disease. Patients with HPS have significant exercise limitations, impacting their quality of life and associated with poor liver transplant outcomes. Many patients with HPS exhibit orthodeoxia—an improvement in oxygenation in the supine compared to the upright position. We hypothesize that exercise capacity will be superior in the supine compared to the upright position in such patients. METHODS: We propose a randomized controlled crossover trial in patients with moderate HPS (PaO(2) < 80 mmHg) and orthodeoxia (supine to upright PaO(2) decrease > 4 mmHg) comparing the effect of supine vs upright position on exercise. Patients with pulmonary hypertension, FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.65, significant coronary artery disease, disorders preventing or contraindicating use of a cycle ergometer, and/or moderate or severe ascites will be excluded. Participants will be randomized to cycle ergometry in either the supine or upright position. After a short washout period (a minimum of 1 day to a maximum of 4 weeks), participants will crossover and perform an exercise in the alternate position. Exercise will be performed at a constant work rate of 70–85% of the predicted peak work rate until the “stopping time” is reached, defined by exhaustion, profound desaturation, or safety concerns (drop in systolic blood pressure or life-threatening arrhythmia). The primary outcome will be the difference in the stopping time between exercise positions, compared with a repeated measures analysis of variance method with a mixed effects model approach. The model will be adjusted for period effects. P < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. DISCUSSION: HPS patients have hypoxemia leading to significant exercise limitations. If our study is positive, a supine exercise regimen could become a routine prescription for patients with HPS and orthodeoxia, enabling them to exercise more effectively. Future studies could explore the corresponding effects of a supine exercise training regimen on physiologic variables such as long-term exercise capacity, quality of life, dyspnea, and liver transplantation outcomes.

This paper constructs a public security risk prediction model adapted to scene coupling drive by combining with the risk interaction coupling characteristics of HHM-RFRM theory. The qualitative, quantitative filtering, rating and risk assessment of public security risk scenarios are carried out by using Bayesian theorem and model. Combined with the actual data of multidimensional risk scenario, the coupling relationship is effectively analyzed to realize the transition from ""single risk"" to ""coupling risk"" early warning. It is found that the method has strong consistency with the actual data, the evaluation accuracy is further improved, and it has stronger adaptability to the security risk of emergencies evolution.","Wang, Qilei",Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag,713,5

The present research measures in a group of 374 Italian teachers—curricular and specialist support teachers—the relationship between self-perceived instructional competence, self-efficacy, and burnout. The present research, conducted between April and December 2020, represents the second part of a larger study conducted from November 2018 to October 2019, which was replicated during COVID-19. Participants completed an anamnestic questionnaire, the Assessment Teaching Scale, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory in both phases of research; an ad hoc questionnaire (to measure teaching practices) and the Teacher Sense of Self Efficacy Scale were added in the second phase. Data confirm that general level of burnout increased and personal accomplishment was reduced during the pandemic; elevated personal accomplishment appears to be a predictor of emotional, socio-relational, and didactic competences before and during the pandemic. Feelings of frustration and accomplishment represent some manifestations of distress caused by the pandemic condition; these dynamics favor the crystallization of roles and behaviors towards the perception of metacognitive teaching processes.","Pellerone, Monica",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,713,1

I argue that this influence has mainly to do with the ‘politics of representation’, understood both in the sense of meaning production and of theatrical performance. Building on the discursive and stylistic approaches to populism as well as on the post-structuralist literature in Foreign Policy Analysis, this article conceptualizes populism as a set of representational practices in domestic politics that spill over, and affect, foreign policy. By promoting distinct representations of Self and Other in international affairs and by investing foreign policy making as a site to perform a rupture with technocratic elites, populist practices contribute to enable or constrain certain policy choices and mode of diplomatic actions. In Poland, this has translated into a securitization of the EU, a partial de-Europeanization of the national interest and a re-shuffling of partnership prioritizations, as well as in disruptive and ‘undiplomatic’ comments on the part of the PiS foreign policy executive.","Cadier, David",Comp Eur Polit,713,1

Weak and elderly individuals, and those with chronic diseases such as hematological malignancies are prone to develop severe pneumonia. The humoral immunity of patients with multiple myeloma is prevalently low, and their inferior immunity further deteriorates during chemotherapy. For patients with onco-hematological malignancies infected with 2019-nCoV during the first chemotherapy cycle, the clinical treatment experience is lacking. The present study is a report of a 61-year-old patient newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the key 2019-nCoV outbreak area, who suffered severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia during the first chemotherapy cycle. The present case report demonstrated that a rapidly progressive and severe form of pneumonia was a specific clinical feature of COVID-19, especially in immunocompromised patients with cancer. The treatment strategy combining timely suspending chemotherapy, early intervention using intravenous immunoglobulin, interferon α inhalation and oral antiviral drugs was effective. Therefore, in the pandemic environment, it is strongly recommend that the risk of 2019-nCoV infection is assessed prior to chemotherapy.","Li, Ziping; Chen, Yan; Yang, Bohan; Song, Haiping; Chen, Wanxin; Zhou, Hao",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,713,33

Currently, there is no specific therapy or vaccine with proven effectiveness for MERS-CoV infections. METHODS: A combination of ribavirin and interferon therapy was used for the treatment of five MERS-CoV-positive patients. We reviewed the therapeutic schedule and the outcome of these patients. RESULTS: All patients were critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with adjunctive corticosteroids and were on mechanical ventilation at the time of initiation of therapy. The median time from admission to therapy with ribavirin and interferon was 19 (range 10–22) days. None of the patients responded to the supportive or therapeutic interventions and all died of their illness. CONCLUSIONS: While ribavirin and interferon may be effective in some patients, our practical experience suggests that critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities who are diagnosed late in the course of their illness may not benefit from combination antiviral therapy as preclinical data suggest. There is clearly an urgent need for a novel effective antiviral therapy for this emerging global threat.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Momattin, Hisham; Dib, Jean; Memish, Ziad A.",Int J Infect Dis,713,24

In this study, we examined the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the potent disinfectant Cleverin, the major disinfecting component of which is chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) and the results were compared with that of sodium hypochlorite in the presence or absence of 0.5% or 1.0% fetal bovine serum (FBS). When SARS-CoV-2 viruses were treated with 0.8 ppm ClO(2) or sodium hypochlorite, viral titre was decreased only by 1 log TCID(50)/mL in 3 min. However, the viral titre was decreased by more than 4 logs TCID(50)/mL when treated with 80 ppm of each chemical for 10 sec regardless of presence or absence of FBS. It should be emphasized that treatment with 24 ppm of ClO(2) inactivated more than 99.99% SARS-CoV-2 within 10 sec or 99.99% SARS-CoV-2 in 1 min in the presence of 0.5% or 1.0% FBS, respectively. In contrast, 24 ppm of sodium hypochlorite was able to inactivate only 99% or 90% SARS-CoV-2 in 3 min under similar conditions. Notably, except ClO(2) the other components of Cleverin such as sodium chlorite, decaglycerol monolaurate and silicone showed no significant antiviral activity. Altogether, the results strongly suggest that although ClO(2) and sodium hypochlorite are strong antiviral agents in absence of organic matters but in presence of organic matters ClO(2) is a more potent antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 than sodium hypochlorite.","Hatanaka, Noritoshi; Xu, Bingting; Yasugi, Mayo; Morino, Hirofumi; Tagishi, Hideaki; Miura, Takanori; Shibata, Takashi; Yamasaki, Shinji",J Hosp Infect,713,24

CVT management continues to evolve, with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) emerging as an alternative to warfarin. A 44-year-old Asian female, with no past medical history, presented to the emergency room (ER) with complaints of nonproductive cough and left-sided headache. She denied a history of COVID-19 vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2 testing (with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) was positive. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed left transverse sinus hyperdensity, consistent with dense vein sign, and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) confirmed the presence of thrombus. The initial treatment included subcutaneous enoxaparin with headache resolution, and she was discharged on apixaban. Five weeks later, a non-contrast head CT showed resolution of the dense vein sign and recanalisation of left transverse sinus was seen on MRV. This report has highlighted the need for increased awareness of coagulopathy and thrombotic events, including cerebral venous thrombosis, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Unremitting headache, in context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be evaluated with appropriate neurovascular imaging. Controlled studies are required to compare the safety and efficacy of DOACs with warfarin for management of cerebral venous thrombosis.","Khan, Faisal; Sharma, Neha; Ud Din, Moin; Chetram, Ryan",Clin Pract,713,16
