13497,Three-gene prognostic biomarkers for seminoma identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis,2020-10-26,"BACKGROUND: Outcome prediction for patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) is essential yet challenging. Evidence showed that patients with DOC lasting 1 year or longer after a brain injury were less likely to recover. However, the reasons why outcomes of DOC patients differ greatly remain unclear. With a variety of analytical methods and through quantitative behavioral assessments, we aimed to track the progression of a patient with severe brain injury, in order to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DOC. CASE PRESENTATION: We performed a longitudinal study for a 52-year-old male DOC patient who has remained in the state for 1.5 years with comprehensive rehabilitative therapies. The patient underwent 3 times of assessments of Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and ultra-high-field 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both topologic properties and brain microstructure were analyzed to track disease progression. We observed dynamic increases of fiber densities with measurements at three time points (t1:1.5 M, t2:7.5 M t3:17.5 M). Specifically, fiber densities of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus nerve fiber bundles improved mostly in the visual, verbal, and auditory subscales, which was consistent with the CRS-R scores. Moreover, the graph-theory analyses demonstrated that network topologic properties showed an improvement although the disease duration exceeded 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: DOC patients with a course longer than 1 year remain possible to improve, and including evaluation methods such as WM connectome analysis and graph theory could be potentially valuable for a more precise assessment of patients with a longer course of DOC.","Li, Xiaoxia; Tan, Xufei; Wang, Pinyi; Hu, Xiaohua; Dong, Yan; Zhang, Xiaotong; Luo, Benyan",BMC Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594973/,820
22804,Mysterious disease spreads in China,2005-07-25,"The Ecology of Infectious Diseases (EID) program is a joint National Science Foundation–National Institutes of Health initiative to produce predictive understanding of disease dynamics, with a focus on diseases with an environmental component. The interdisciplinary research projects funded by this program take advantage of the wide range of theoretical and methodological advances developed over the past 30 years. The challenge for disease ecology is to unravel these systems, discover how complex they truly are, and to determine if they can be predicted and controlled using targeted environmental, public health, or medical interventions. Between 1999 and 2005, a total of 42 research awards were made under the EID program. EID projects have had affects on policy in two areas: adoption of novel interventions on a local scale and use of models by government agencies for the purpose of allocating public health resources. The past 6 years have been an exciting time for the field of disease ecology; we expect the coming years to be even more exciting and productive.","Scheiner, Samuel M.; Rosenthal, Joshua P.",Ecohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088405/,820

Cells infected with Herpes Simplex Virus‐1 (HSV‐1), but not uninfected cells, exhibit nuclear staining upon the addition of dF‐EdU and a fluorescent azide. The incorporation of the dF‐EdU into DNA depends on its phosphorylation by a herpes virus thymidine kinase (TK). Crystallographic analyses revealed how dF‐EdU is well accommodated in the active site of HSV‐1 TK, but steric clashes prevent dF‐EdU from binding human TK. These results provide the first example of pathogen‐enzyme‐dependent incorporation and labeling of bioorthogonal functional groups in human cells.","Neef, Anne B.; Pernot, Lucile; Schreier, Verena N.; Scapozza, Leonardo; Luedtke, Nathan W.",Angew Chem Weinheim Bergstr Ger,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159771/,820

If bowel resection is necessary, a muscle-split or Pfannenstiel incision is also required. The avoidance of any laparotomy could decrease surgical stress response, give a faster return to normal bowel function, decrease post-operative pain and reduce wound complications and incisional hernias. We assessed post-operative outcome after a full laparoscopic sigmoid resection for bowel endometriosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-one patients who underwent elective full laparoscopic sigmoid resection for bowel endometriosis from September 2009 to September 2010 were matched for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists class and BMI to 21 patients who underwent a conventional laparoscopic sigmoid resection. Groups were compared for peri-operative factors, complications, length of hospital stay, post-operative pain (Visual Analog Scale: VAS), analgesics consumption and inflammatory response (plasma C-reactive protein: CRP). RESULTS Median operating time was 15 min shorter with transrectal specimen extraction (P = 0.003). VAS-scores and use of analgesics were higher in the conventional laparoscopic group (P = 0.0005). Mean CRP-level tended to be higher in the transrectal specimen extraction group (38%, P = 0.054) but there was no difference in increase in CRP level between groups (P = 0.15). There were no anastomotic leaks or reinterventions in either group, and the median hospital stay was similar. At follow-up, no wound infections or incisional hernias were observed and no patients reported anal dysfunction. CONCLUSION Full laparoscopic sigmoid resection reduced operating times and decreased post-operative VAS-scores and analgesic requirements compared with the conventional laparoscopic sigmoid resection for bowel endometriosis.","Wolthuis, A M; Meuleman, C; Tomassetti, C; D'Hooghe, T; Fieuws, S; Penninckx, F; D'Hoore, A",Human reproduction,https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/der072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21427115/,820

120858,[The Peripheral Neuropathy and Myopathy Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Correlated New Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2)].,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES There is growing support within the therapy professions for using talking therapy in alternative environments, such as outdoor spaces. The aim of the present study was to further understand how the organizational culture in clinical psychology may prevent or enable practitioners to step outside the conventional indoor consulting room. DESIGN Informed grounded theory methodology was used within a pragmatist philosophy. METHODS Participants (N = 15; nine male, six female) were identified using theoretical sampling. The sample consisted of experts and leaders within the profession of clinical psychology (e.g., heads of services, training programme directors, chairs of professional bodies, and developers of therapy models; M years in the profession = 34.80, SD = 9.77). One-to-one interviews and analysis ran concurrently over 9 months (April-December 2020). Mason's model of safe uncertainty was drawn upon to illuminate and organize themes. RESULTS The main themes comprised organizational factors that either support a practitioner in maintaining a position of curiosity and flexibility towards the environment where therapy is located ('environmental safe uncertainty'), or push them towards adopting a more fixed position ('environmental certainty'). Themes included influences from therapy traditions, accessibility of alternative environments, internalized risk, workplace subcultures, business models, biomedical approaches, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Whether therapy is located in a consulting room, outdoors, clients' homes, or digitally, practitioners, clients, and services are encouraged to maintain a position of environmental safe uncertainty. PRACTITIONER POINTS The therapy process and outcomes are influenced by the physical environment in which talking therapy is situated. Practitioners have often remained fixed in their preferred therapy environment, such as the indoor consulting room, without exploring the potential benefits of alternative environments or involving the client in this decision-making (i.e., 'environmental certainty'). Outdoor environments, as well as other alternatives to the consulting room (e.g., digital, home visits, and public places), can support access to therapy, subsequent engagement, and therefore health care equity. Practitioners and clients are encouraged to adopt a position of 'environmental safe uncertainty', which is defined as having openness, critical curiosity, and collaboration regarding the therapy environment and the possibility of other environments being more conducive to therapy.","Cooley, Sam J; Jones, Ceri R; Moss, Duncan; Robertson, Noelle",The British journal of clinical psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117797/,820

149241,Nonviral methods for siRNA delivery.,2009,"INTRODUCTION The objective of this study is to assess the usefulness of an evaluation system of surgical skills based on motion analysis of laparoscopic instruments. METHOD This system consists of a physical laparoscopic simulator and a tracking and assessment system of technical skills in laparoscopy. Six surgeons with intermediate experience (between 1 and 50 laparoscopic surgeries) and 5 experienced surgeons (more than 50 laparoscopic surgeries) took part in this study. All participants were right-handed. The subjects performed 3 repetitions of a cutting task on synthetic tissue with the right hand, dissection of a gastric serous layer, and a suturing task in the dissection previously done. Objective metrics such as time, path length, speed of movements, acceleration and motion smoothness were analyzed for the instruments of each hand. RESULTS In the cutting task, experienced surgeons show less acceleration (P=.014) and a smoother motion (P=.023) using the scissors. Regarding the dissection activity, experienced surgeons need less time (P=.006) and less length with both instruments (P=.006 for dissector and P=.01 for scissors). In the suturing task, experienced surgeons require less time (P=.037) and distance travelled (P=.041) by the dissector. CONCLUSIONS This study shows the usefulness of the evaluation system for the cutting, dissecting, and suturing tasks. It represents a significant step in the development of advanced systems for training and assessment of surgical skills in laparoscopic surgery.","Sánchez-Margallo, Juan A; Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco M; Pagador Carrasco, José B; Oropesa García, Ignacio; Gómez Aguilera, Enrique J; Moreno del Pozo, José",Cirugia espanola,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2013.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23668944/,820

To define molecular subtypes of EC, we perform mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomics profiling of EC tumors and adjacent non-tumor tissues, revealing a catalog of proteins and phosphosites that are dysregulated in ECs. The EC cohort is stratified into two molecular subtypes-S1 and S2-based on proteomic analysis, with the S2 subtype characterized by the upregulation of spliceosomal and ribosomal proteins, and being more aggressive. Moreover, we identify a subtype signature composed of ELOA and SCAF4, and construct a subtype diagnostic and prognostic model. Potential drugs are predicted for treating patients of S2 subtype, and three candidate drugs are validated to inhibit EC. Taken together, our proteomic analysis define molecular subtypes of EC, thus providing a potential therapeutic outlook for improving disease outcomes in patients with EC.","Liu, Wei; Xie, Lei; He, Yao-Hui; Wu, Zhi-Yong; Liu, Lu-Xin; Bai, Xue-Feng; Deng, Dan-Xia; Xu, Xiu-E; Liao, Lian-Di; Lin, Wan; Heng, Jing-Hua; Xu, Xin; Peng, Liu; Huang, Qing-Feng; Li, Cheng-Yu; Zhang, Zhi-Da; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Guo-Rui; Gao, Xiang; Wang, Shao-Hong; Li, Chun-Quan; Xu, Li-Yan; Liu, Wen; Li, En-Min",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25202-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400640/,820

For example, for SARS-CoV-2, the elderly are often preferentially protected. For diseases of plants and animals, certain sub-populations can drive mitigation because they are intrinsically more valuable for ecological, economic, socio-cultural or political reasons. Here we use optimal control theory to identify strategies to optimally protect a “high value” sub-population when there is a limited budget and epidemiological uncertainty. We use protection of the Redwood National Park in California in the face of the large ongoing state-wide epidemic of sudden oak death (caused by Phytophthora ramorum) as a case study. We concentrate on whether control should be focused entirely within the National Park itself, or whether treatment of the growing epidemic in the surrounding “buffer region” can instead be more profitable. We find that, depending on rates of infection and the size of the ongoing epidemic, focusing control on the high value region is often optimal. However, priority should sometimes switch from the buffer region to the high value region only as the local outbreak grows. We characterise how the timing of any switch depends on epidemiological and logistic parameters, and test robustness to systematic misspecification of these factors due to imperfect prior knowledge.","Bussell, Elliott H.; Cunniffe, Nik J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.10.459742,820
184854,Two-way antigenic cross-reactivity between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and group 1 animal CoVs is mediated through an antigenic site in the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein.,2007,"BackgroundThe London Ambulance Service (LAS) runs an Emergency Responder (ER) scheme, where trained volunteers respond to 999 calls in blue-light rapid response vehicles (RRVs), alongside the statutory ambulance service response.The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented surge in call volume which, combined with reduced staffing of double-crewed ambulances (DCAs) due to illness, severely impaired the service’s ability to respond to calls.In response to this, as well as increasing volunteer RRV shifts, ERs were given additional up-skill training to work with regular ambulance service clinicians on DCAs, thus increasing the number of DCAs available to attend calls.This study aims to review the response to the COVID-19 pandemic provided by ERs.MethodA retrospective review was conducted of all ER shifts on volunteer RRVs and the service’s front-line DCAs. Data from the same time period (March 1 – April 30) was compared between 2019 (pre-pandemic period) and 2020 (pandemic period). The statistical significance of proportions was calculated using the χ2 test.ResultsThe absolute number of RRV hours volunteered by ERs increased by 34.2% (2,017 to 2,707), resulting in a 21.2% increase in RRV shifts (227 to 275) during the pandemic period. Furthermore, the proportion of C1 (life-threatening) incidents attended by ER RRVs doubled (32.4% vs 61.1%, p < 0.0001). In addition to RRV shifts, ERs volunteered 1,222 hours on DCAs during the pandemic, resulting in 125 additional DCA resources available. The combined total hours provided by ERs (RRV/DCA) increased by 94.8% (2,017 to 3,929).DiscussionVolunteer responders are a valuable resource during times of surge. In addition to volunteer RRV shifts, they have to the potential to assist ambulance service clinicians on DCAs. Future pandemic or winter-pressure plans should incorporate volunteer responders. This study predominantly looked at volunteer capacity, and further work is required to investigate patient-centred outcomes.","Shadman, Aziz Nijhawan Aditi Palfreyman-Jones Samantha Hartley-Sharpe Chris",Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2021-999.28,820

METHODS: Adult patients with at least one erenumab written prescription/administration between May 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019 were identified from the Optum De-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) database (index date = date of the first erenumab prescription/administration). Patient demographics and characteristics, acute and preventive medications used prior to initiation of erenumab, and the initial prescriber specialty were examined. In addition, the shifting or trends of patient characteristics over time were analyzed among subgroups of patients based on when they initiated erenumab. RESULTS: A total of 14,774 eligible patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Most patients were female (86.4%), average age 46.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 13.1) years, Caucasian (88.7%), non-Hispanic (91.8%), and commercially insured (59.8%) at the index date. During the 12-month pre-index period, commonly observed selected comorbid conditions included anxiety (30.6%), depression (28.2%), and cardiovascular diseases (26.4%), and the mean (SD) Elixhauser comorbidity score was 1.7 (5.5). The most common provider specialty at erenumab initiation was neurologist/headache specialist (46.5%). Over time, there was a decrease in mean baseline Elixhauser comorbidity score at erenumab initiation, an increase in general practitioners prescribing initial erenumab, and increased utilization in patients with less severe migraine overall (a proxy of the declining trend in chronic migraine and triptan use). CONCLUSION: Early use of erenumab post approval focused on patients with more severe disease and a high comorbidity index rating. Over time, utilization of this preventive medication occurred in a broader population of patients with migraine, with increased use by general practitioners and those outside of headache centers.","Fang, Juanzhi; Korrer, Stephanie; Johnson, Jonathan C; Cheadle, Mark A; Shah, Roshani; Ferraris, Matias L; Lopez, Cristina",Adv. ther,,820

METHODS: During a passive heating protocol (lower leg 42 °C water submersion) the maximum ion reabsorption rates from the chest, forearm and thigh were measured, alongside other thermophysiological responses. The maximum ion reabsorption rate was defined as the inflection point in the slope of the relation between galvanic skin conductance and sweat rate. RESULTS: The maximum ion reabsorption rate at the forearm, chest and thigh (0.29 ± 0.16, 0.33 ± 0.15, 0.18 ± 0.16 mg/cm2/min, respectively) were weakly correlated with age (r &#8804; - 0.232, P &#8805; 0.05) and salivary aldosterone concentrations (r &#8804; - 0.180, P &#8805; 0.179). A moderate positive correlation was observed between maximum ion reabsorption rate at the thigh and VO2max (r = 0.384, P = 0.015). Salivary aldosterone concentration moderately declined with age (r = - 0.342, P = 0.021). Whole body sweat rate and pilocarpine-induced sudomotor responses to iontophoresis increased with VO2max (r &#8805; 0.323, P &#8804; 0.027) but only moderate (r = - 0.326, P = 0.032) or no relations (r &#8804; - 0.113, P &#8805; 0.256) were observed with age. CONCLUSION: The eccrine sweat glands' maximum ion reabsorption rate is not affected by age, spanning 50-84 years. Aldosterone concentration in an aged cohort does not appear to modulate the ion reabsorption rate. We provide further support for maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness to attenuate any decline in sudomotor function.","Gerrett, N; Amano, T; Inoue, Y; Kondo, Narihiko",Eur. j. appl. physiol,,820

279769,Low-Cost Polyester-Tipped 3-Dimensionally-Printed Nasopharyngeal Swab for the Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020,"The recent coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented limitations in person-to-person contact, elective surgeries, and even traumatic injuries, leaving potential gaps in training and skill development. Surgical programs have had to adapt with the rapid implementation of surgical simulation curricula, collaborative lecture series, and greater focus on online learning. Using models, simulation, and virtual learning, we have accommodated for restrictions and operative volume from coronavirus disease of 2019. The goal was to establish a durable system of extra-clinical training that would increase patient safety and collaborative knowledge sharing. From our simulated interventions, we noted maintenance of skills despite low operative volumes, low temporal or monetary commitment especially when compared with operating room time, and engagement from both learners (medical students and junior residents) and teachers (senior residents and staff physicians). Our experience with transition to a virtual curriculum with involvement of multiple institutions has also resulted in greater diversity of lectures, increased frequency of academics, and high levels of participation. In this article, we discuss our department's experience with these alterations and the path for surgical training moving forward. We have seen multiple benefits to advancement of nonclinical specialty-specific simulation and virtual didactics. While some of these efforts may require some early expenditure, both monetary and temporal, to establish the program infrastructure, they are easy to apply, confer substantial added value, and appear durable. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

289453,Insights into the development of effective materials to suppress replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020,"CONTEXT: Point-of-care testing (POCT) is inherently spatial, that is, performed where needed, and intrinsically temporal, because it accelerates decision making. POCT efficiency and effectiveness have the potential to facilitate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, decrease risks of co-infections for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare. OBJECTIVES: To assess AMR identification using POCT, describe the United States AMR Diagnostic Challenge, and improve global standards of care for infectious diseases. Data Sources PubMed, WWW, and other sources were searched for papers focusing on AMR and POCT. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated abstracts, URLs, and PDFs representing ~500 articles assessed for relevance. Panelist insights at Triâ¢Con 2020 in San Francisco and finalist POC technologies competing for a US $20,000,000 AMR prize are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Co-infections represent high risks for COVID-19 patients. POCT potentially will help target specific pathogens, refine choices for antimicrobial drugs, and prevent excess morbidity and mortality. POC assays that identify patterns of pathogen resistance can help tell us how infected individuals spread AMR, where geospatial hotspots are located, when delays cause death, and how to deploy preventative resources. Shared AMR data ""clouds"" could help reduce critical care burden during pandemics and optimize therapeutic options, similar to use of antibiograms in individual hospitals. Multidisciplinary healthcare personnel should learn the principles and practice of POCT, so they can meet needs with rapid diagnostic testing. The stakes are high. AMR is projected to cause millions of deaths annually and cumulative financial loses in the trillions by 2050.","Kost, Gerald J",Arch. pathol. lab. med. (1976),,820
304934,Development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) thermal inactivation method with preservation of diagnostic sensitivity,2020,"Disrupting pathways to negative outcomes in children and adolescents who have caregivers with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is of the highest priority if we are to gain control over the opioid epidemic. This population is at very high risk for becoming the next generation of individuals with SUD, as well as other types of psychopathology and eventual juvenile/criminal justice involvement. In addition to experiencing severe/chronic adversities during their development, these youth are now further propelled toward these negative trajectories due to the COVID-19 crisis which substantially compounds the issues (e.g., estrangement from otherwise normalizing social influences, such as school, nondelinquent peers, extended families, health care, etc.) for both the young person and the parent with SUD. We review the literature establishing the linkages between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and pathways to SUD. Our focus is particularly on opportunities for intervention across development using family-based programs that directly address parenting skills and trauma. Invoking structural level change to merge SUD treatment and evidence-based family intervention infrastructures in communities promise to both reduce externalizing behaviors and internalizing symptoms in these youth, as well as reinforce recovery in the parents. Currently, these systems do not intersect, thus, children do not often receive programming and treatment of caregivers for SUD is less effective without engagement of the family unit.","Fishbein, Diana Kingston Sharon",Journal of Applied Research on Children,,820

Evolutionary and psychological research has shown that touch is an important part of bond-building and emotion communication; loneliness is intimately related to these elements as well. In this paper, we ask whether physical contact reduces feelings of loneliness -which might derive from evolutionary ancient bonding mechanisms-despite a cultural context that is relatively non-tactile. Method: An experimental study (40 participants, 13 males) tested for observable effects of touch on loneliness scores in a low-contact culture to analyse whether they respond positively to that stimulus despite cultural training against it. Results: Participants exposed to physical contact reported significantly lower neglect scores from their close relationships in a short loneliness scale, thus suggesting that there is an underlying mechanism that persists despite enculturation. The effects were particularly strong among single people, which could mean that lower loneliness among married people might be partly explained by the regular availability of physical contact. Participants in the experimental condition also showed a faster reduction in heart rate, interpreted as a sign of physiological wellbeing. Conclusions: These findings help to specify mechanisms within the evolutionary theoretical framework of loneliness that link internal feelings to environmental cues.

It is unclear if the presence of GI symptoms is associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. We aim to assess if GI symptoms could be used for prognostication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to a tertiary medical center in Brooklyn, NY, from March 18, 2020, to March 31, 2020, with COVID-19. The patients' medical charts were reviewed for the presence of GI symptoms at admission, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms (cases) were compared with COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms (control). RESULTS: A total of 150 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included, of which 31 (20.6%) patients had at least 1 or more of the GI symptoms (cases). They were compared with the 119 COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms (controls). The average age among cases was 57.6 years (SD 17.2) and control was 63.3 years (SD 14.6). No statistically significant difference was noted in comorbidities and laboratory findings. The primary outcome was mortality, which did not differ between cases and controls (41.9 vs. 37.8%, p = 0.68). No statistically significant differences were noted in secondary outcomes, including the length of stay (LOS, 7.8 vs. 7.9 days, p = 0.87) and need for mechanical ventilation (29 vs. 26.9%, p = 0.82). DISCUSSION: In our study, the presence of GI manifestations in COVID-19 at the time of admission was not associated with increased mortality, LOS, or mechanical ventilation.","Ramachandran, Preethi; Onukogu, Ifeanyichkwu; Ghanta, Snigdha; Gajendran, Mahesh; Perisetti, Abhilash; Goyal, Hemant; Aggarwal, Alok",Dig Dis,,820
344517,A Teaching Experience Aimed at Health Professionals During the Second Wave Pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2021,"An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R0of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57%, and it is 2.37% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.","Carcione, José M.; Santos, Juan E.; Bagaini, Claudio; Ba, Jing",Front. Public Health,,820

PLL embeds learning opportunities in places where families regularly go (e.g., bus stops, supermarkets, and laundromats) and transforms them into engaging and enriched learning hubs. Learning outside the classroom in museums, libraries, and with digital media has been growing in importance and was further accentuated due to the coronavirus disease. As a result, the role of families and the community has been elevated as a critical component of education. To address gaps in school readiness and achievement, policy makers have largely focused on formal learning environments. But these efforts neither address nor harness the 80% of time young children spend outside of the classroom with their families.

We aimed to investigate the influence of the Dutch lockdown on cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) and investigate relations with change in mental wellbeing and experienced psychosocial stressors during the lockdown. DESIGN: Explorative longitudinal baseline-, pre- and during lockdown survey study. SETTING: The Netherlands, on-line between January 2019 and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Community sample of 120 monthly to daily cannabis users and reference group of 63 non-using controls. MEASUREMENTS: Change in cannabis use and CUD symptom severity from baseline to pre- to post-lockdown. Change in cannabis use motives, mental health, quality of social relationships and job status from pre- to post-lockdown. FINDINGS: In cannabis users, lockdown related to increased cannabis use [B = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26-3.66, P = 0.024], but not CUD symptom severity. Cannabis users experienced 30% job loss and increased loneliness [P < 0.001, Bayes factor (BF)10 > 100], while contact with partners (P = 0.005, BF10 = 8.21) and families improved (P < 0.001, BF10 = 19.73), with no differences between cannabis users and control. Generally, mental health problems (all Ps > 0.277, all BF10 < 0.139) did not change, but individual differences were significant and severity of cannabis use pre-lockdown, COVID-19-related worries, change in anxiety, expansion motives, social motives and family contact all uniquely related to variance in change in cannabis use or CUD. CONCLUSIONS: While cannabis use among daily cannabis users in the Netherlands increased at the group level during the period of COVID-19 lockdown, the effect of the first months of lockdown on cannabis use disorder severity and mental wellbeing varied significantly among individual daily cannabis users.","Cousijn, Janna; Kuhns, Lauren; Larsen, Helle; Kroon, Emese",Addiction,,820

OBJECTIVE: Summarize the prevalence of risk factors and adverse outcomes and determine their associations in COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for case-series and observational studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through August 31, 2020. Data were analyzed by fixed-effects meta-analysis using Shore's adjusted confidence intervals to address heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seventy-seven studies comprising 38906 hospitalized patients met inclusion criteria; 21468 from the US-Europe and 9740 from China. Overall prevalence of death [% (95% CI)] from COVID-19 was 20% (18-23%); 23% (19-27%) in the US and Europe and 11% (7-16%) for China. Of those that died, 85% were aged&#8805;60 years, 66% were males, and 66%, 44%, 39%, 37%, and 27% had hypertension, smoking history, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), respectively. The case fatality risk [%(95% CI)] were 52% (46-60) for heart disease, 51% (43-59) for COPD, 48% (37-63) for chronic kidney disease (CKD), 39% for chronic liver disease (CLD), 28% (23-36%) for hypertension, and 24% (17-33%) for diabetes. Summary relative risk (sRR) of death were higher for age&#8805;60 years [sRR = 3.6; 95% CI: 3.0-4.4], males [1.3; 1.2-1.4], smoking history [1.3; 1.1-1.6], COPD [1.7; 1.4-2.0], hypertension [1.8; 1.6-2.0], diabetes [1.5; 1.4-1.7], heart disease [2.1; 1.8-2.4], CKD [2.5; 2.1-3.0]. The prevalence of hypertension (55%), diabetes (33%), smoking history (23%) and heart disease (17%) among the COVID-19 hospitalized patients in the US were substantially higher than that of the general US population, suggesting increased susceptibility to infection or disease progression for the individuals with comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Public health screening for COVID-19 can be prioritized based on risk-groups. Appropriately addressing the modifiable risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes could reduce morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19; public messaging can be accordingly adapted.","Dorjee, Kunchok; Kim, Hyunju; Bonomo, Elizabeth; Dolma, Rinchen",PLoS One,,820
414816,Development of machine learning models to predict RT-PCR results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with influenza-like symptoms using only basic clinical data,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic represents an unprecedented traumatic stressor to mental health. Psychological distress is considered a reliable proxy for psychopathology and can be negatively influenced by childhood trauma through sensitization effects. Emotion dysregulation has been proposed as a potential mediator of this mechanism. We aimed to test this hypothesis in a national Italian sample assessed in the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between psychological distress and childhood trauma in 500 healthy participants assessed through a survey-based study, after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic lockdown in Italy. Levels of psychological distress and history of childhood trauma were obtained using the Kessler-10 (K10) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. We used bootstrapped mediation analysis to test the mediator role of emotional dysregulation, measured through the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, on the effect of childhood trauma on psychological distress. RESULTS: In total, 190 (38%) reported psychological distress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Individuals with psychological distress experienced more childhood trauma, specifically emotional abuse (F = 23.51, df = 1, p < 0.001) and neglect (F = 10.98, df = 1, p = 0.001). After modelling the effect of emotional dysregulation, the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress resulted in indirect effects and mediated by deficits in emotion regulation mechanisms (bootstrapped lower level of confidence interval = 0.345, upper level of confidence interval = 0.598). CONCLUSION: Childhood trauma is associated with increased vulnerability to the stressful effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Our data suggest that emotional dysregulation may represent a dimension mediating the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress and may be considered as specific target for interventions aiming at empowering resilience.","Janiri, Delfina; Moccia, Lorenzo; Dattoli, Luigi; Pepe, Maria; Molinaro, Marzia; De Martin, Valentina; Chieffo, Daniela; Di Nicola, Marco; Fiorillo, Andrea; Janiri, Luigi; Sani, Gabriele",Aust N Z J Psychiatry,,820
447616,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: a dilemma for dental health care professionals,2020,"Introduction COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing global health emergency. Pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including hypertension have a higher risk for severe illness, cardiac damage, and death. Therefore, strategies for cardiovascular protection in COVID-19 are urgently needed, in addition to the development of vaccines against COVID-19. Previously, it has been reported that several SARS-CoV-1 genes including encoded Envelope (E) protein, open reading frame (ORF) 3a, are capable of forming viral channels in mammalian cells and damaging the cells via activation of apoptotic or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. In addition, SARS-CoV-1 patients are found to possess antibodies against ORF3a, indicating that this protein was expressed at the surface of the host cells. Moreover, a recent clinical report confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect cardiomyocytes. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the linkage between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac risk are unclear. Hypothesis SARS-CoV-2 genes including ORF3a can be expressed in cardiomyocytes after virus infection, and subsequently dysregulate cardiac functions. Methods HEK293T cells and H9c2 cardiac myoblasts were transfected with ORF3a and utilized for biochemical, cell biological, and electrophysiological assays. Numerical model of rabbit ventricular action potential was used to evaluate the role of ORF3a on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia. Results Although ORF3a sequences from SARS-CoV-1 and -CoV-2 have 72% similarity, ORF3a from SARS-CoV-2 maintains high homology with SARS-CoV-1 in the protein sequences of the transmembrane domains and the pore, which are critical for forming ion channels. We found that SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a is expressed at plasma membrane and outer mitochondrial membrane as assessed by protein fractionation, mitochondrial digestion, and live-cell imaging. Whole cell patch clamp revealed that ORF3a can form K+-permeable channels at the plasma membrane with similar channel properties as the endogenous transient outward K+ current (Ito). Moreover, numerical simulations suggest that increased Ito amplitude (mimicking increase of ORF3a expression) may dysregulate Ca2+ transient and increase the risk for early afterdepolarization in response to increased heart rate. Lastly, we found that ORF3a promotes apoptotic signaling activation, but not ER stress signaling, assessed by caspase activity and the expression of major ER chaperones, respectively. Conclusion ORF3a from SARS-CoV-2 forms K+-permeable channels at the plasma membrane and dysregulates cardiac Ca2+ handling and electrophysiology. ORF3a can also be expressed at the mitochondria and activate oxidative stress signaling, which exacerbates the risk of arrhythmia. Targeting SARS-CoV-2 viroporins including ORF3a may reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death and cardiac damage in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CVDs.","Polina, Iuliia Guo Yugene Jhun Bong Sook Tolkacheva Elena O-Uchi Jin",The FASEB Journal,,820

Many countries, including the United States, responded to the pandemic by issuing stay-at-home orders/shelter-in-place orders (SaHOs/SiPOs) to their citizens. By April 2020, more than 90% of the U.S. population was subject to an order. SaHOs/SiPOs raise a number of complex issues for the police, ranging from concerns about infringement of constitutional rights to potential sanctions for violations of an order. This article delves into the issues surrounding SaHOs/SiPOs and highlights their complexity for the police. First, we examine the ""why the police?"" question, and point to key features of their role which make enforcement of SaHOs/SiPOs the proper business of the police. Second, we examine the relevant legal doctrines that can serve as the basis for police actions against violators of orders, most notably the special needs doctrine. Last, we offer police legitimacy as a lens for viewing the appropriateness of police responses to violators of SaHOs/SiPOs.","White, Michael D; Fradella, Henry F",Am J Crim Justice,,820

A growing number of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed to address this challenge. These models improve their expressive power by incorporating auxiliary information in molecules while inevitably increase their computational complexity. In this work, we aim to design a GNN which is both powerful and efficient for molecule structures. To achieve such goal, we propose a molecular mechanics-driven approach by first representing each molecule as a two-layer multiplex graph, where one layer contains only local connections that mainly capture the covalent interactions and another layer contains global connections that can simulate non-covalent interactions. Then for each layer, a corresponding message passing module is proposed to balance the trade-off of expression power and computational complexity. Based on these two modules, we build Multiplex Molecular Graph Neural Network (MXMNet). When validated by the QM9 dataset for small molecules and PDBBind dataset for large protein-ligand complexes, MXMNet achieves superior results to the existing state-of-the-art models under restricted resources.","Zhang, Shuo; Liu, Yang; Xie, Lei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07457v1.pdf,820

The model, which makes use of a limited number of parameters, in spite of its simplicity is able of capturing the essential physical features of the epidemic spread highlighting the essential role of the restrictive measures and in particular the timeliness of their application for the containment of the most dramatic consequences. This work also confirms how the epidemic spread, if considered during its statistical-regime evolution, can be properly described - and hence probably better understood - using languages and methodologies typically adopted for chemical processes, such as the Mass Action Law and Chemical Kinetics.","Amadei, A.; Aschi, M.",Rivista di Biologia,,820

This new condition is heterogenous but resembles Kawasaki disease (KD), a well-known but poorly understood and clinically heterogenous pediatric inflammatory condition for which weak associations have been found with a myriad of viral illnesses. Epidemiological data clearly indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is the trigger for MIS-C, which typically occurs about 1 mo after infection. These findings support the hypothesis of viral triggers for the various forms of classic KD. We further suggest that rare inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) altering the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie the pathogenesis of MIS-C in some children. The discovery of monogenic IEIs underlying MIS-C would shed light on its pathogenesis, paving the way for a new genetic approach to classic KD, revisited as a heterogeneous collection of IEIs to viruses.","Sancho-Shimizu, Vanessa; Brodin, Petter; Cobat, Aurélie; Biggs, Catherine M; Toubiana, Julie; Lucas, Carrie L; Henrickson, Sarah E; Belot, Alexandre; Tangye, Stuart G; Milner, Joshua D; Levin, Michael; Abel, Laurent; Bogunovic, Dusan; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Zhang, Shen-Ying",J. exp. med,,820

Healthcare workers remain at the forefront of this battle, and like prior pandemics face mental health challenges along with physical risks. We aimed to study the perceived stress and possible posttraumatic stress in the frontline workers exposed to active COVID-19 duties in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. METHODOLOGY: A special voluntary, anonymous, survey-based Google questionnaire was designed with mandatory consent form and queries to clarify inclusion exclusion criteria. Tools included valid, reliable self-administered scales, namely General Health Questionnaire 12, Perceived Stress Scale and Impact of Events Scales-Revised. A purposive sampling method was adopted, by posting the survey questionnaire on WhatsApp groups of doctors, interns, and nurses working on active COVID-19 duty in Andhra Pradesh. RESULTS: About 69.7% of the frontline workers recorded higher perceived stress and definitive posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was found in 34.8%, with psychological distress recorded in 53%. CONCLUSION: The higher levels of perceived stress discovered in the vast majority with definitive PTSD features in a third of the sample indicates the need for provision of mental health support proactively among frontline workers on active COVID-19 duty.","Das, Keya; Ryali, V.

We report our experience of using VKM successfully to treat 5 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and its chemical profile. CASE REPORT: A family with 5 members age ranges between 13 to 77, both male and females, one with preexisting renal impairment, SARS CoV-2 positive with mild to moderate category were treated with VKM along with the specific dietary practice. The drug was consumed at home quarantine. Real-Time RT PCR from oropharynx swab, X-ray/CT scan chest, hematology, renal function, liver function, body temperature and oxygen saturation were assessed. Blood parameters were repeated after completion of therapy to assess the safety aspect of mercury drug. Chemical profile of the drug was done using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: With the first dose, the oxygen saturation was improved. Within 3 days of therapy, all symptoms (fever, body pain, cough, and loss of taste) were normalized and renders the Real-Time RT PCR negative for COVID-19. There was no observed side effects and damage to renal and liver.

App-based contact tracing has the potential to optimise the resources of overstretched public health departments. However, its efficiency is dependent on wide-spread adoption. We aimed to identify the proportion of people who had downloaded the Australian Government COVIDSafe app and examine the reasons why some did not. Method: An online national survey with representative quotas for age and gender was conducted between May 8 and May 11 2020. Participants were excluded if they were a healthcare professional or had been tested for COVID-19. Results: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 were excluded, 13 declined, and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Of survey participants, 37% had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 19% intended to, 28% refused, and 16% were undecided. Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (25%) and technical concerns (24%). Other reasons included a belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app is unnecessary (16%), distrust in the Government (11%), and apathy (11%). In addition, COVIDSafe knowledge varied with confusion about its purpose and capabilities. Conclusion: For the COVIDSafe app to be accepted by the public and used correctly, public health messages need to address the concerns of its citizens, specifically in regards to privacy, data storage, and technical capabilities.
