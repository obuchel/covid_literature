581,581,581,Identification of CD8(+ )cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes from porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus matrix protein in BALB/c mice,8.391887,7.0648394,2011-05-30,"Twenty-seven nanopeptides derived from the matrix (M) protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were screened for their ability to elicit a recall interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response from the splenocytes of BALB/c mice following DNA vaccination and a booster vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus rWR-PRRSV-M. We identified two peptides (amino acid residues K(93)FITSRCRL and F(57)GYMTFVHF) as CD8(+ )cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. These peptides elicited significant numbers of IFN-γ secreting cells, compared with other M nonapeptides and one irrelevant nonapeptide. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the former is an H-2K(d)-restricted CTL epitope, and the latter is an H-2D(d)-restricted CTL epitope. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment among different PRRSV M sequences submitted to GenBank indicated that these two CTL epitopes are strongly conserved, and they should therefore be considered for further research on the mechanisms of cellular immune responses to PRRSV.","Zhang, Weijun; Lin, Yan; Bai, Yu; Tong, Tiegang; Wang, Qun; Liu, Nihong; Liu, Guangliang; Xiao, Yihong; Yang, Tao; Bu, Zhigao; Tong, Guangzhi; Wu, Donglai",Virol J,214,28
979,979,979,Identification of serum proteomic biomarkers for early porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) infection,8.307822,6.918495,2012-08-08,"BACKGROUND: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most significant swine diseases worldwide. Despite its relevance, serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection, when clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a weak anti-viral response and persistent infection, have not yet been identified. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a reproducible, accurate, and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum. This work describes the SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera of 60 PRRSV-positive and 60 PRRSV-negative, as measured by PCR, asymptomatic Large White piglets at weaning. Sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin (< 4.52 μg/mL) were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1–200 kDa were obtained with the CM10, IMAC30, and H50 surfaces. RESULTS: A total of 200 significant peaks (p < 0.05) were identified in the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed in the validation phase. The majority of peaks (42) were up-regulated in PRRSV-positive piglets, while 5 were down-regulated. A panel of 14 discriminatory peaks identified in fraction 1 (pH = 9), on the surface CM10, and acquired at low focus mass provided a serum protein profile diagnostic pattern that enabled to discriminate between PRRSV-positive and -negative piglets with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 73%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SELDI-TOF MS profiling of sera from PRRSV-positive and PRRSV-negative asymptomatic piglets provided a proteomic signature with large scale diagnostic potential for early identification of PRRSV infection in weaning piglets. Furthermore, SELDI-TOF protein markers represent a refined phenotype of PRRSV infection that might be useful for whole genome association studies.","Genini, Sem; Paternoster, Thomas; Costa, Alessia; Botti, Sara; Luini, Mario Vittorio; Caprera, Andrea; Giuffra, Elisabetta",Proteome Sci,214,1
4140,4140,4140,Temporal Dynamics of Co-circulating Lineages of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,8.314525,6.910475,2019-11-01,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is the most important endemic pathogen in the U.S. swine industry. Despite control efforts involving improved biosecurity and different vaccination protocols, the virus continues to circulate and evolve. One of the foremost challenges in its control is high levels of genetic and antigenic diversity. Here, we quantify the co-circulation, emergence and sequential turnover of multiple PRRSV lineages in a single swine-producing region in the United States over a span of 9 years (2009–2017). By classifying over 4,000 PRRSV sequences (open-reading frame 5) into phylogenetic lineages and sub-lineages, we document the ongoing diversification and temporal dynamics of the PRRSV population, including the rapid emergence of a novel sub-lineage that appeared to be absent globally pre-2008. In addition, lineage 9 was the most prevalent lineage from 2009 to 2010, but its occurrence fell to 0.5% of all sequences identified per year after 2014, coinciding with the emergence or re-emergence of lineage 1 as the dominant lineage. The sequential dominance of different lineages, as well as three different sub-lineages within lineage 1, is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage. As host populations build immunity through natural infection or vaccination toward the most common variant, this dominant (sub-) lineage may be replaced by an emerging variant to which the population is more susceptible. An analysis of patterns of non- synonymous and synonymous mutations revealed evidence of positive selection on immunologically important regions of the genome, further supporting the potential that immune-mediated selection shapes the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics for this virus. This has important implications for patterns of emergence and re-emergence of genetic variants of PRRSV that have negative impacts on the swine industry. Constant surveillance on PRRSV occurrence is crucial to a better understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of co-circulating viral lineages. Further studies utilizing whole genome sequencing and exploring the extent of cross-immunity between heterologous PRRS viruses could shed further light on PRRSV immunological response and aid in developing strategies that might be able to diminish disease impact.","Paploski, Igor Adolfo Dexheimer; Corzo, Cesar; Rovira, Albert; Murtaugh, Michael P.; Sanhueza, Juan Manuel; Vilalta, Carles; Schroeder, Declan C.; VanderWaal, Kimberly",Front Microbiol,214,28

After 100 days of passage, the endogenous virus [Neuro-2A (JHMV) end] released by this culture was unable to induce the syncytia typical of MHV-JHM and the endogenous virus was not temperature-sensitive. The Neuro-2A (JHMV) culture was cured of virus production by passage under neutralizing antibody [Neuro-2A (JHMV) Ab]. The Neuro-2A (JHMV) and the Neuro-2A (JHMV) Ab cultures were as susceptible to heterologous infection with mengovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus as the uninfected Neuro-2A culture. However, the Neuro-2A (JHMV) and Neuro-2A (JHMV) Ab cultures were partially resistant to homologous superinfection by MHV-JHM and the closely related MHV-A59. Virus related to MHV-JHM was rescued from the antibody-cured cells by cell fusion. The synthesis of MHV-JHM specific antigens by Neuro-2A (JHMV) cells, Neuro-2A (JHMV) Ab cells and 17 Cl-1 cells infected by Neuro-2A (JHMV) end was studied by SDS-PAGE. The genomic RNAs of MHV-JHM and Neuro-2A (JHMV) end were compared by oligonucleotide mapping. The results of the protein and RNA studies indicated that the genome of Neuro-2A (JHMV) end was substantially modified from the genome of MHV-JHM, but the modifications did not significantly alter the molecular size of the viral-specific proteins.","Leibowitz, J.

A review.,8.279402,7.207625,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Qualitative evidence synthesis is increasingly used alongside reviews of effectiveness to inform guidelines and other decisions. To support this use, the GRADE-CERQual approach was developed to assess and communicate the confidence we have in findings from reviews of qualitative research. One component of this approach requires an appraisal of the methodological limitations of studies contributing data to a review finding. Diverse critical appraisal tools for qualitative research are currently being used. However, it is unclear which tool is most appropriate for informing a GRADE-CERQual assessment of confidence. METHODOLOGY We searched for tools that were explicitly intended for critically appraising the methodological quality of qualitative research. We searched the reference lists of existing methodological reviews for critical appraisal tools, and also conducted a systematic search in June 2016 for tools published in health science and social science databases. Two reviewers screened identified titles and abstracts, and then screened the full text of potentially relevant articles. One reviewer extracted data from each article and a second reviewer checked the extraction. We used a best-fit framework synthesis approach to code checklist criteria from each identified tool and to organise these into themes. RESULTS We identified 102 critical appraisal tools: 71 tools had previously been included in methodological reviews, and 31 tools were identified from our systematic search. Almost half of the tools were published after 2010. Few authors described how their tool was developed, or why a new tool was needed. After coding all criteria, we developed a framework that included 22 themes. None of the tools included all 22 themes. Some themes were included in up to 95 of the tools. CONCLUSION It is problematic that researchers continue to develop new tools without adequately examining the many tools that already exist. Furthermore, the plethora of tools, old and new, indicates a lack of consensus regarding the best tool to use, and an absence of empirical evidence about the most important criteria for assessing the methodological limitations of qualitative research, including in the context of use with GRADE-CERQual.","Munthe-Kaas, Heather Menzies; Glenton, Claire; Booth, Andrew; Noyes, Jane; Lewin, Simon",BMC medical research methodology,214,1

The anatomical continuity of the uterine cavity with the cervix makes the Papanicolaou (Pap) test accessible to evaluate signs of disease shed from the endometrium. Our aim was to determine the sensitivity of routine Pap test in endometrial carcinoma detection and its relationship with clinico-pathologic factors. We performed a systematic review of studies reporting Pap test results prior to diagnosis of or surgery for endometrial carcinoma between 1990 and 2018 in PubMed or Web of Science. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. We identified 45 studies including a total of 6599 women with endometrial cancer. Abnormal Pap test results prior to diagnosis of or surgery for endometrial carcinoma were observed in 45% (95% CI, 40%-50%) of study participants. This percentage was significantly higher among those of non-endometrioid histology compared with endometrioid subtypes (77% [95% CI, 66%-87%] vs 44% [95% CI, 34%-53%], respectively; P heterogeneity <.001). Several clinico-pathologic factors were related to a higher percentage of abnormal Pap test results, including high-stage, myometrial invasion >50%, high histological grade, positive peritoneal cytology, presence of lymph node metastasis, cervical involvement, and lymphovascular invasion (P heterogeneity <.05 for all variables). Routine cervical cytology can detect endometrial cancer in almost half of patients, whereas sensitivity is higher among individuals with non-endometrioid histology or more advanced cancers. This review summarizes the current clinical and prognostic value of cervical cytology in endometrial carcinoma. Recent technological developments using molecular biomarkers may improve accuracy for early cancer detection.","Frias-Gomez, Jon; Benavente, Yolanda; Ponce, Jordi; Brunet, Joan; Ibáñez, Raquel; Peremiquel-Trillas, Paula; Baixeras, Nuria; Zanca, Alba; Piulats, Josep Maria; Aytés, Álvaro; Matias-Guiu, Xavier; Bosch, Francesc Xavier; de Sanjosé, Silvia; Alemany, Laia; Costas, Laura",Cancer cytopathology,214,10

Here, we demonstrated that the symbiosis of Vigna radiata (mung bean) with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA110 is determined by NopE, and this symbiosis is highly dependent on host genotype. NopE specifically triggered incompatibility with V. radiata cv. KPS2, but it promoted nodulation in other varieties of V. radiata, including KPS1. Interestingly, NopE1 and its paralogue NopE2, which exhibits calcium-dependent autocleavage, yield similar results in modulating KPS1 nodulation. Furthermore, NopE is required for early infection and nodule organogenesis in compatible plants. Evolutionary analysis revealed that NopE is highly conserved among bradyrhizobia and plant-associated endophytic and pathogenic bacteria. Our findings suggest that V. radiata and B. diazoefficiens USDA110 may use NopE to optimize their symbiotic interactions by reducing phytohormone-mediated ETI-type (PmETI) responses via salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis suppression.","Piromyou, Pongdet; Nguyen, Hien P; Songwattana, Pongpan; Boonchuen, Pakpoom; Teamtisong, Kamonluck; Tittabutr, Panlada; Boonkerd, Nantakorn; Alisha Tantasawat, Piyada; Göttfert, Michael; Okazaki, Shin; Teaumroong, Neung",Scientific reports,214,1

Increase in blood uric acid level is a frequent side effect of favipiravir. Here, we discussed the mechanism of blood uric acid elevation during favipiravir treatment. Favipiravir is metabolized to an inactive metabolite M1 by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, and excreted into urine. In the kidney, uric acid handling is regulated by the balance of reabsorption and tubular secretion in the proximal tubules. Favipiravir and M1 act as moderate inhibitors of organic anion transporter 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3), which are involved in uric acid excretion in the kidney. In addition, M1 enhances uric acid reuptake via urate transporter 1 (URAT1) in the renal proximal tubules. Thus, favipiravir is thought to decrease uric acid excretion into urine, resulting in elevation of uric acid levels in blood. Elevated uric acid levels were returned to normal after discontinuation of favipiravir, and favipiravir is not used for long periods of time for the treatment of viral infection. Thus, the effect on blood uric acid levels was subclinical in most studies. Nevertheless, the adverse effect of favipiravir might be clinically important in patients with a history of gout, hyperuricemia, kidney function impairment (in which blood concentration of M1 increases), and where there is concomitant use of other drugs affecting blood uric acid elevation.","Mishima, Eikan; Anzai, Naohiko; Miyazaki, Mariko; Abe, Takaaki",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,214,17

Virus nucleic acid real-time RT-PCR testing has become the current standard diagnostic method but high demand could lead to shortages. Therefore, we propose a detection strategy using a one-step nested RT-PCR. METHODOLOGY The nucleotide region in the ORF1ab gene that has the greatest differences between the human coronavirus and the bat coronavirus was selected. Primers were designed after that sequence. All diagnostic primers are species-specific since the 3´ end of the sequence differs from that of other species. A primer set also creates a synthetic positive control. Amplified products were seen in a 2.5% agarose gel, as well as in an SYBR Green-Based Real-Time RT-PCR. RESULTS Amplification was achieved for the positive control and specific regions in both techniques. CONCLUSIONS This new technique is flexible and easy to implement. It does not require a real-time thermocycler and can be interpreted in agarose gels, as well as adapted to quantify the viral genome. It has the advantage that if the coronavirus mutates in one of the key amplification nucleotides, at least one pair can still amplify, thanks to the four diagnostic primers.","Meza-Robles, Carmen; Barajas-Saucedo, Carlos E; Tiburcio-Jimenez, Daniel; Mokay-Ramírez, Karen A; Melnikov, Valery; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Iram P; Martinez-Fierro, Margarita L; Garza-Veloz, Idalia; Zaizar-Fregoso, Sergio A; Guzman-Esquivel, José; Ramirez-Flores, Mario; Newton-Sanchez, Oscar A; Espinoza-Gómez, Francisco; Delgado-Enciso, Osiris G; Centeno-Ramirez, Alba Sh; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan",Journal of infection in developing countries,214,8

Although open offices promote communication among co-workers, privacy issues surface as well as increased risks from such health concerns as viral infections and pandemics. On the other hand, territorial offices protect worker privacy and reduce infection risks. Unfortunately, such arrangements often hinder communication among co-workers. Although a physical office must satisfy different needs under various scenarios with limited space, the lack of flexibility in furniture designs prevents dynamic space management. In this paper, we propose a self-actuated stretchable partition whose physical height, width, and position can dynamically change to create secure workplaces (e.g., against privacy and infectious risks) without inhibiting group collaboration. To support secure workplace layouts and space reconfigurations, the partitions' height, length, and position are adapted automatically and dynamically. First, we consider the design space of a self-actuated stretchable partition and implement a proof-of concept prototype with a height-adjustable stand, a roll-up screen, and a mobile robot. We then show some example application scenarios to discuss potential future actuated-territorial offices. © 2021 ACM.","Onishi, Y.; Takashima, K.; Fujita, K.; Kitamura, Y.","2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Making Waves, Combining Strengths, CHI EA 2021",214,1

Methods: A virtual survey was given to 196 administrative workers of a bank in Lima Peru. The survey consisted of four sections: consent form, sociodemographic data, risk factors of the work system and questions about comfort and MSD. Descriptive data was presented in percentages and associations were established with the chi-square statistic test. The significance level was 0.05. Results: The rate of musculoskeletal discomfort reached 96%, the most frequent body regions being the neck (91%), upper back (89%) and lower back region (89%). Regarding the work-home system, 49% of the study subjects worked in the bedroom and/or the living room, 32% had a desk, 18% used an adjustable chair, 37% worked at a dining table and 34% indicated that domestic activities overlapped with their work activities. The workers’ greatest perceived benefit was spending time with their families (59%). MSD was associated mainly with organisational factors (p <0.01). Comfort was associated with the backrest and type of seat, along with factors related to the environment and work tasks (p <0.05). Conclusion: Work-home systems are not prepared for performing office work. They raise MSD rates and reduce the quality of work, as perceived by workers. Spending time with family acted as a protective and negative factor. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Escobar Galindo, C. M.; Rodriguez Rojas, R.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with SARS in Hong Kong and to identify predictors of mortality. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Quarantine hospital for patients with SARS in Hong Kong. PATIENTS 267 consecutive patients hospitalized from 26 February to 31 March 2003 for probable or confirmed SARS. MEASUREMENTS Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic measures; 3-month mortality rate. RESULTS According to our case definition, there were 227 cases of confirmed SARS and 40 cases of probable SARS. Common presenting symptoms were fever (99% of patients), chills (74%), malaise (63%), and myalgia (50%). Laboratory findings included lymphopenia (73%), thrombocytopenia (50%), hyponatremia (60%), and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (47%) and C-reactive protein (75%). During hospitalization, incidence of diarrhea (53%), anemia (53%), and acute renal failure (6%) increased. Sixty-nine patients (26%) required intensive care because of respiratory failure. The 3-month mortality rate was 12% (95% CI, 8% to 16%). Factors contributing to mortality were respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and nosocomial sepsis. On multivariate Cox regression, age older than 60 years (relative risk, 5.10 [CI, 2.30 to 11.31]; P < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 3.8 micro kat/L at presentation (relative risk, 2.20 [CI, 1.03 to 4.71]; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION Because of the longer follow-up period in our cohort, the mortality rate in these patients is higher than rates reported in previous studies.

Excessive prescription of antibiotics by doctors has resulted in increased antimicrobial resistance. This led to our objective of determining the percentage of doctors in Pakistan prescribing antibiotics for the treatment of common cold and to know about their knowledge in preventing the spread of this disease. METHODS It was a cross-sectional descriptive study, conducted in 9 cities of Pakistan including Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Multan and D.G. Khan over a period of 03 months -from October to December, 2013. Questionnaire regarding the disease spread and its treatment was distributed among 300 randomly selected doctors in nine cities of Pakistan from both public and private sector. RESULTS Eighteen percent of the doctors prescribe antibiotics for common cold. Only 113 (37.7%) doctors correctly responded that mean incubation period for common cold was 1-2 days. Two hundred and nine (69.7%) answered correctly that cold weather increases susceptibility to common cold. Only 84 (28%) responded correctly by choosing that regular and frequent hand-washing with good quality soaps was the most effective way to prevent spread of this disease in day-to-day life. CONCLUSIONS Antibiotics are being prescribed for treatment of common cold by a large proportion of doctors. There is insufficient knowledge among our doctors regarding the factors which aggravate or alleviate common cold symptoms as well as the methods by which these infections can be prevented.","Rehman, Muneeb-Ur-; Tariq, Naseer Alam; Ahmed, Mamoon; Ahmad, Maryam; Zahid, Areej; Chaudhry, Quratulain; Tahir, Bisma; Islam, Zoraiz Ul; Ud Din, Zahoor Mohi","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",214,9

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, with postdischarge telemonitoring of individuals hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 at the first month after hospital discharge, as part of a comprehensive telerehabilitation program. SETTING: Private verticalized health care network specialized in the older population. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals hospitalized because of COVID-19. We included 1696 consecutive patients, aged 71.8±13.0 years old and 56.1% female. Comorbidities were present in 82.3% of the cases (N=1696). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dependence for basic activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) using the Barthel Index and Lawton's Scale. We compared the outcomes between participants admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) vs those admitted to the ward. RESULTS: Participant were followed up for 21.8±11.7 days after discharge. During postdischarge assessment, independence for ADL was found to be lower in the group admitted to the ICU than the ward group (61.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 55.8%-66.2%] vs 72.7% [95% CI, 70.3%-75.1%], P<.001). Dependence for IADL was also more frequent in the ICU group (84.6% [95% CI, 80.4%-88.2%] vs 74.5%, [95% CI, 72.0%-76.8%], P<.001). Individuals admitted to ICU required more oxygen therapy (25.5% vs 12.6%, P<.001), presented more shortness of breath during routine (45.2% vs 34.5%, P<.001) and nonroutine activities (66.3% vs 48.2%, P<.001), and had more difficulty standing up for 10 minutes (49.3% vs 37.9% P<.001). The rehabilitation treatment plan consisted mostly of exercise booklets, which were offered to 65.5% of participants. The most referred rehabilitation professionals were psychologists (11.8%), physical therapists (8.0%), dietitians (6.8%), and speech-language pathologists (4.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals hospitalized because of COVID-19 present high levels of disability, dyspnea, dysphagia, and dependence for both ADL and IADL. Those admitted to the ICU presented more advanced disability parameters.","Leite, Victor Figueiredo; Rampim, Danielle Bianchini; Jorge, Valeria Conceição; de Lima, Maria do Carmo Correia; Cezarino, Leandro Gonçalves; da Rocha, Cleber Nunes; Esper, Rodrigo Barbosa",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,214,16

Similarities between the spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 warrant exploring S2. Possible benefits of employing S2 in therapies and vaccines include the structural conservation of S2, extant cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in populations (due to prior exposure to common cold coronaviruses), the steric neutralization potential of antibodies against S2, and the stronger memory B-cell and T-cell responses. More research is necessary on the effect of glycans on the accessibility and stability of S2, SARS-CoV-2 mutants that may affect infectivity, the neutralization potential of antibodies produced by memory B-cells, cross-reactive T-cell responses, antibody-dependent enhancement, and antigen competition.

However, lignocellulose recalcitrance hinders microbial degradation, especially in case of contaminated materials such as creosote (CRO)-treated wood, which necessitates appropriate processing in order to eliminate pollution. This study might be the first to explore a novel bacterial consortium SST-4, for decomposing birchwood sawdust, capable of concurrently degrading lignocellulose and CRO compounds. Afterwards, SST-4 which stands for molecularly identified bacterial strains Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BSW-11, Shewanella putrefaciens BSW-18, Bacillus cereus BSW-23, and Novosphingobium taihuense BSW-25 was evaluated in terms of biological sawdust pre-treatment, resulting in effective lignocellulose degradation and 100% removal of phenol and naphthalene. Subsequently, the maximum biogas production observed was 18.7 L/kg VS, while cumulative methane production was 162.8 L/kg VS, compared to 88.5 without microbial pre-treatment. The cumulative energy production from AD-I and AD-II through biomethanation was calculated as 3177.1 and 5843.6 KJ/kg, respectively. The pretreatment process exhibited a significant increase in the energy yield by 83.9%.

However, most of the current COVID-19 clinical practices and trials do not take sex as consideration. Methods: We performed an unbiased sex-based comparative analysis for the clinical outcomes, peripheral immune cells, and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels of 1,558 males and 1,499 females COVID-19 patients from a single center. The lymphocyte subgroups were measured by Flow cytometry. Total antibody, Spike protein (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)- specific IgM and IgG levels were measured by chemiluminescence. Results: We found that the mortality and ICU admission rates were approximately 2-fold higher in males than that in females (P<0.005). Survival analysis revealed that sex is an independent prognostic factor for COVID-19 (Hazard ratio=2.2, P=0.003). The concentration of inflammatory factors in peripheral blood was significantly higher in males. Besides, the renal and hepatic abnormality induced by COVID-19 was more common in males during the hospitalization. The analysis of lymphocyte subsets revealed that the percentage of CD19+ B cell and CD4+ T cell was significantly higher in females (P<0.001) during hospitalization, indicating the stronger humoral immunity in females than males. Notably, the protective IgG sharply increased and reached a peak in the fourth week after symptom onset in females, while gradually increased and reached a peak in the seventh week in males. Conclusions: The unfavorable prognosis of male COVID-19 patients may result from the weak humoral immunity and indolent antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. Early medical intervention and close monitoring are important, especially for male COVID-19 patients. Hormonal or convalescent plasma therapy may help improve the immunity of males to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, K.; Huang, B.; Cai, Y.; Wang, Z.; Li, L.; Wu, L.; Zhu, M.; Li, J.; Wu, M.; Li, W.; Wu, W.; Zhang, L.; Xia, X.; Wang, S.; Wang, Q.",,214,26

Both are experienced across the life course and are of increasing concern in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review seeks to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between loneliness and unemployment in working age individuals, and in particular the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle with combined healthcare outcomes. A systematic search was undertaken in Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and EconLit from inception to December 2020. PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed throughout this review, study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and results were summarised in a narrative synthesis. English language studies evaluating the relationship between loneliness and unemployment in higher income western countries were included. Thirty-seven studies were identified; 30 cross-sectional and 7 longitudinal. Loneliness was measured by a direct question or loneliness scale while unemployment was self-reported or retrieved from a national register. A positive association between unemployment and increased loneliness was observed across all studies. Thus, across the life-course a clear yet complex relationship exists between unemployment and greater experience of loneliness. The magnitude of this relationship increases with the severity of loneliness and appears to peak at age 30–34 and 50–59. Logistic regression provided the greatest consistency at statistical significance revealing at least a 40% increase in the likelihood of reporting loneliness when unemployed. Recent longitudinal studies identified in this review found higher levels of loneliness following job loss, but also that loneliness was predictive of unemployment suggesting potential bi-directionality in the relationship. This bi-directionality may create a multiplier effect between loneliness and unemployment to form a self-reinforcing relationship and greater health concerns for those most at risk. Thus, review findings suggest the need for cross-sector awareness and intervention to tackle both loneliness and unemployment.","Morrish, N.; Medina-Lara, A.",Soc Sci Med,214,1

Plastics in terms of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and other single-use medical equipment along with packaging solutions owing to their inherent properties have emerged as a life-savior for protecting the health and safety of the frontline health workers and the common citizens during the pandemic. However, plastics have been deemed as evil polluter due to their indiscriminate littering and mismanagement amid increased plastic usage and waste generation during this unprecedented crisis. This article reviews and assesses to dwell upon whether plastics in the time of pandemic are acting as protector of the public health or polluter of the environment. Considering the utilities and limitations of plastic along with its management or mismanagement, and the fate, an equitable appraisal suggests that the consumers' irresponsible behavior, and attitude and poor awareness, and the stress on waste management infrastructure in terms of collection, operation, and financial constraints as the major drivers, leading to mismanagement, turn plastic into an evil polluter of the environment. Plastic can be a protector if managed properly and complemented by the circular economy strategies in terms of reduction, recycle and recovery, and thereby preventing leakage into the environment. To safeguard the supply chain of PPEs, several decontamination techniques have been adopted worldwide ensuring their effective reprocessing to prioritize the circular economy within the system. Policy guidelines encouraging to adopt safer practices and sustainable technical solutions along with consumers' education for awareness creation are the need of the hour for preventing plastic to turn from protector with high utility to polluter.","Parashar, Neha; Hait, Subrata",Sci Total Environ,214,12

Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients. The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease. Material and Methods: We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. A cohort of 67 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group. For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined. The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups. Results: At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480–747) vs. 455 (352.5–588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels >400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group. The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0–834.0) vs. 567 (472.5–644.50); p = 0.0003). Conclusion: Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.","Di Micco, Pierpaolo; Russo, Vincenzo; Carannante, Novella; Imparato, Michele; Rodolfi, Stefano; Cardillo, Giuseppe; Lodigiani, Corrado",J Clin Med,214,15

METHODS: All acute appendicitis admissions (281 patients) between 1/1/2018-4/30/2020 were reviewed. Two groups were created: 6 weeks before (Group A) and 6 weeks after (Group B) the date elective surgeries were postponed in Massachusetts for COVID-19. Acute appendicitis incidence and disease characteristics were compared between the groups. Similar time periods from 2018 to 2019 were also compared. RESULTS: Fifty-four appendicitis patients were categorized in Group A and thirty-seven in Group B. Those who underwent surgery were compared and revealed a 45.5% decrease (CI: 64.2,-26.7) in uncomplicated appendicitis, a 21.1% increase (CI:3.9,38.3) in perforated appendicitis and a 29% increase (CI:11.5,46.5) in gangrenous appendicitis. Significant differences in the incidence of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis were also noted when comparing 2020 to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: The significant increase in complicated appendicitis and simultaneous significant decrease in uncomplicated appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that patients are not seeking appropriate, timely surgical care.","Orthopoulos, Georgios; Santone, Elizabeth; Izzo, Francesca; Tirabassi, Michael; Pérez-Caraballo, Aixa M.; Corriveau Ccrp, Nicole; Jabbour, Nicolas",Am J Surg,214,32
