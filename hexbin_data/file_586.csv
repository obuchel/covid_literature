3571,3571,3571,A graph-based evidence synthesis approach to detecting outbreak clusters: An application to dog rabies,12.388327,4.244428,2018-12-17,"Early assessment of infectious disease outbreaks is key to implementing timely and effective control measures. In particular, rapidly recognising whether infected individuals stem from a single outbreak sustained by local transmission, or from repeated introductions, is crucial to adopt effective interventions. In this study, we introduce a new framework for combining several data streams, e.g. temporal, spatial and genetic data, to identify clusters of related cases of an infectious disease. Our method explicitly accounts for underreporting, and allows incorporating preexisting information about the disease, such as its serial interval, spatial kernel, and mutation rate. We define, for each data stream, a graph connecting all cases, with edges weighted by the corresponding pairwise distance between cases. Each graph is then pruned by removing distances greater than a given cutoff, defined based on preexisting information on the disease and assumptions on the reporting rate. The pruned graphs corresponding to different data streams are then merged by intersection to combine all data types; connected components define clusters of cases related for all types of data. Estimates of the reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases infected by an infectious individual in a large population), and the rate of importation of the disease into the population, are also derived. We test our approach on simulated data and illustrate it using data on dog rabies in Central African Republic. We show that the outbreak clusters identified using our method are consistent with structures previously identified by more complex, computationally intensive approaches.","Cori, Anne; Nouvellet, Pierre; Garske, Tini; Bourhy, Hervé; Nakouné, Emmanuel; Jombart, Thibaut",PLoS Comput Biol,586,1

A primer set derived from the 5′‐UTR/VP coding region junction was able to amplify all the rhinovirus serotypes tested. Enteroviruses were either not amplified by these primer pairs or produced a band of larger size that could easily be discriminated from the rhinovirus‐specific product. In contrast, primers embedded in the 5′‐UTR region alone were able to amplify both rhinovirus and enterovirus RNA. It is shown that rhino‐viruses could be specifically typed by sequencing the amplicon derived from this 5′‐UTR set. The sequences of the 5′‐UTR region often previously unsequenced rhinoviruses were derived. The sequences obtained cluster into two groups: 18,41, 15, 30, 63, 31,56, and 44; and 17, 69, and 70. Ampliconsfrom serotypes 17, 69, and 70 also group by sequence with the equivalent region of HRV14 from the genetic database, while the others group with 2 and 89. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, inc.","Mori, Julie; Clewley, Jonathan P.",J Med Virol,586,1

Spontaneous breathing may offer multiple physiologic benefits in these patients, including decreased need for sedation, preserved diaphragm activity and improved cardiovascular function. However, excessive effort to breathe due to high respiratory drive may lead to patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI), even in the absence of mechanical ventilation. In the present review, we focus on the physiological and clinical implications of control of respiratory drive in ARDS patients. We summarize the main determinants of neural respiratory drive and the mechanisms involved in its potentiation, in health and ARDS. We also describe potential and pitfalls of the available bedside methods for drive assessment and explore classical and more “futuristic” interventions to control drive in ARDS patients.","Spinelli, Elena; Mauri, Tommaso; Beitler, Jeremy R.; Pesenti, Antonio; Brodie, Daniel",Intensive Care Med,586,1

Recently, previous studies have conducted extensive research on air pollution and air quality monitoring. Despite this, the fields of air pollution and air quality monitoring remain plagued with unsolved problems. In this study, the Pollution Weather Prediction System (PWP) is proposed to perform air pollution prediction for outdoor sites for various pollution parameters. In the presented research work, we introduced a PWP system configured with pollution-sensing units, such as SDS021, MQ07-CO, NO2-B43F, and Aeroqual Ozone (O(3)). These sensing units were utilized to collect and measure various pollutant levels, such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO(2), and O(3), for 90 days at Symbiosis International University, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The data collection was carried out between the duration of December 2019 to February 2020 during the winter. The investigation results validate the success of the presented PWP system. In the conducted experiments, linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN)-based AQI (air quality index) predictions were performed. Furthermore, the presented study also found that the customized linear regression methodology outperformed other machine-learning methods, such as linear, ridge, Lasso, Bayes, Huber, Lars, Lasso-lars, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and ElasticNet regression methodologies, and the customized ANN regression methodology used in the conducted experiments. The overall AQI values of the air pollutants were calculated based on the summation of the AQI values of all the presented air pollutants. In the end, the web and mobile interfaces were developed to display air pollution prediction values of a variety of air pollutants.","Pandya, Sharnil; Ghayvat, Hemant; Sur, Anirban; Awais, Muhammad; Kotecha, Ketan; Saxena, Santosh; Jassal, Nandita; Pingale, Gayatri",Sensors (Basel),586,13
13514,13514,13514,Plant Disease Classification: A Comparative Evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Learning Optimizers,12.070336,2.1819036,2020-10-06,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Store-operated calcium channels constituted from the proteins Orai and STIM are important targets for development of new drugs, especially for the treatment of auto-immune diseases. Also, interference with channel function is linked to reduced cancer cell progression, making these channels potential targets for anti-cancer drug development. Therefore, inhibitors need to be evaluated for both their binding selectivity and their potential to interfere with cancer progression. Here, we investigated the inhibitor Synta66 and determined its site of binding via both patch clamp recordings and computational approaches and evaluated its potency as anti-cancer agent in glioblastoma multiforme cells. Our findings show that Synta66 is a highly selective ligand to the Orai1 pore and efficiently blocks store operated calcium entry in glioblastoma cells. Still, in the tested cell lines, Synta66 did not reduce cell viability. We therefore suggest Synta66 as a precise tool to observe interference of store-operated Orai1 channel function in vitro and of resulting downstream effects. ABSTRACT: The Ca(2+) sensor STIM1 and the Ca(2+) channel Orai1 that form the store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) channel complex are key targets for drug development. Selective SOC inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of auto-immune and inflammatory responses and are also deemed promising anti-neoplastic agents since SOC channels are linked with enhanced cancer cell progression. Here, we describe an investigation of the site of binding of the selective inhibitor Synta66 to the SOC channel Orai1 using docking and molecular dynamics simulations, and live cell recordings. Synta66 binding was localized to the extracellular site close to the transmembrane (TM)1 and TM3 helices and the extracellular loop segments, which, importantly, are adjacent to the Orai1-selectivity filter. Synta66-sensitivity of the Orai1 pore was, in fact, diminished by both Orai1 mutations affecting Ca(2+) selectivity and permeation of Na(+) in the absence of Ca(2+). Synta66 also efficiently blocked SOC in three glioblastoma cell lines but failed to interfere with cell viability, division and migration. These experiments provide new structural and functional insights into selective drug inhibition of the Orai1 Ca(2+) channel by a high-affinity pore blocker.","Waldherr, Linda; Tiffner, Adela; Mishra, Deepti; Sallinger, Matthias; Schober, Romana; Frischauf, Irene; Schmidt, Tony; Handl, Verena; Sagmeister, Peter; Köckinger, Manuel; Derler, Isabella; Üçal, Muammer; Bonhenry, Daniel; Patz, Silke; Schindl, Rainer",Cancers (Basel),586,13

Although knee arthroplasty is generally successful, it takes months to recover physical function. Preoperative physical function is known to predict postoperative outcomes and exercise can improve preoperative physical function. However, patients with KOA have difficulty exercise on land due to pain and stiffness, while water exercise can be better tolerated. We hypothesized that preoperative water exercise to improve preoperative physical function will improve postoperative outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: We enrolled 43 participants who were scheduled for elective TKA in 4–8 weeks and scored at or below 50th percentile in mobility assessment tool-sf (MAT-sf). All enrolled participants were assessed on 1) clinical osteoarthritis symptom severity using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), 2) physical function using Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), 3) self-reported mobility using Mobility Assessment Tool-short form (MAT-sf), 4) depression using Geriatric Depression Scale-short form (GDS-sf), 5) cognitive function using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Blood samples for high-sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were stored at − 80 °C then all samples were analyzed together. All the enrolled participants were randomly assigned to the aquatic exercise intervention (AEI) or usual care group. Sixty minute sessions of AEI was conducted three times a week for 4–8 weeks. Participants in both groups were evaluated within 1 week before their scheduled surgery, as well as 4 weeks after the surgery. RESULTS: The mean age was 67.1 (±6.2), 44% were female, 74% were White. There is no statistically significant difference in combined outcome of any complication, unscheduled ER visit, and disposition to nursing home or rehab facility by AEI. However, AEI was associated with more favorable outcomes: WOMAC scores (p < 0.01), chair-stand (p = 0.019), MAT-sf as well as improved depression (p = 0.043) and cognition (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: 4–8 weeks of aquatic exercise intervention resulted in improved functional outcomes as well as improved depression and cognition in elderly patients undergoing TKA. A larger study is warranted to explore the role of water exercise in clinical and functional outcomes of TKA.","Kim, Sunghye; Hsu, Fang-Chi; Groban, Leanne; Williamson, Jeff; Messier, Stephen",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,586,13

This is often done to improve access beyond traditional in-person care and enhance care quality. Recent studies have indicated that better outcomes of using these initiatives and technologies may be achieved when patients and their family members are engaged in all aspects of planning, implementation, use, and evaluation. However, little guidance exists for how health care administrators can achieve effective engagement in digital health initiatives specifically. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to document processes related to planning and implementing patient and family engagement (PFE) in digital health initiatives. This information will be used to develop tangible resources (eg, a field guide) that other organizations can use to implement PFE approaches for digital health initiatives in their organizations. METHODS: A previously developed multidimensional conceptual framework for PFE in health and health care contexts will be used to guide this work. To understand the intricacies involved in using PFE approaches in digital health strategies, a case study will be conducted. More specifically, this work will employ an embedded single-case design with PFE in digital health initiatives at a large Canadian mental health and addictions teaching hospital. Multiple digital health projects being undertaken at the study site will be explored to better understand where the PFE is intended to support the design, implementation, and operation of the digital health platform or technology. These projects will form the individual units of analysis. Data collection will involve field notes and artifact collection by a participant observer and interviews with the various digital health project teams. Data analysis will include a content and thematic analysis, triangulation of the findings, and a chronological mapping of data to a PFE process. RESULTS: Funding for this work was provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), via a Health System Impact Fellowship. As of August 2020, digital health projects that will form the case study units have been identified, and the participant observer has started to embed themselves into these projects. Although the development and collection of field notes and artifacts, respectively, have begun, interviews have not been conducted. The study is expected to conclude in September 2021. Once this study is complete, the development of a field guide and resources to support the uptake of PFE strategies in digital health will begin. CONCLUSIONS: By better understanding the processes involved in PFE in digital health projects, guidance can be provided to relevant stakeholders and organizations about how to do this work in an effective manner. It is then anticipated that with the increasing use of PFE approaches, there may be improved uptake, experience, and outcomes associated with using digital health technologies.

Herein, we investigated the relationship between vitamin D status and overweight/obesity status, insulin resistance (IR), systemic inflammation as well as oxidative stress (OS). Anthropometric and laboratory assessments of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and glycemic, pro-inflammatory and OS biomarkers were performed in a sample of 47 patients with T2DM who were divided into categories based on overweight and degree of obesity. The main findings were: the overweight/obesity status correlated negatively with the degree of serum 25(OH)D deficiency (ρ = −0.27) with a trend towards statistical significance (p = 0.069); the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was significantly different (p = 0.024) in patients with 25(OH)D deficiency, as was total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) in patients with severe serum 25(OH)D deficiency as compared to those with 25(OH)D over 20 ng/mL (TOS: p = 0.007, OSI: p = 0.008); and 25(OH)D had a negative indirect effect on TOS by body mass index (BMI), but BMI was not a significant mediator of the studied relationship. In a setting of overweight and increasing degree of obesity, patients with T2DM did not display decreasing values of 25(OH)D. Subjects with the lowest values of 25(OH)D presented the highest values of BMI. Patients with 25(OH)D deficiency were more insulin resistant and showed increased OS but no elevated systemic inflammation. The negative effect of 25(OH)D on TOS did not seem to involve BMI as a mediator.","Cătoi, Adriana Florinela; Iancu, Mihaela; Pârvu, Alina Elena; Cecan, Andra Diana; Bidian, Cristina; Chera, Elisabeta Ioana; Pop, Ioana Delia; Macri, Adrian Maximilian",Nutrients,586,1

Higher yields and other related vegetative attributes were improved at 10 and 15 mg/L sodium selenate application. At a concentration of 10 mg/L sodium selenate, photosynthetic pigments, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were enhanced in both cultivars, but the “Graffiti” cultivar responded stronger than the “Clapton” cultivar. The glucosinolates were accumulated in response to selenium fortification and the highest amounts were found in the “Graffiti” cultivar at 10 mg/L. Selenium accumulated concentration-dependently and rose with higher fertilization levels. In general, foliar application of selenium at 10 mg/L led to an accumulation of secondary metabolites and also positively affected the growth and yield of florets.","Saeedi, Mahboobeh; Soltani, Forouzandeh; Babalar, Mesbah; Izadpanah, Fatemeh; Wiesner-Reinhold, Melanie; Baldermann, Susanne",Plants (Basel),586,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out of BP on singleton normal pregnancies in Mexico City. Measurements followed a standardised methodology using automated electronic devices. Reference values of systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were constructed. Maternal and gestation characteristics effects on BP were tested. The reference ranges of BP were adjusted for significant variables. RESULTS: On 1,056 women of 33 years old mean age and 160.0 cm mean height, 1,915 measurements were made between 5 and 41 weeks of gestational age (GA) with 65.0 kg of mean weight. The median BP throughout pregnancy was 102.7/67.2 ± 9.3/7.4 SD mmHg, and 79.0 ± 7.4 SD mmHg the MAP. BP had a quadratic relationship with GA, being the lowest in 2(nd) trimester. SBP and DBP had a r = 0.71 linear correlation. Maternal weight had the most significant effect on SBP and MAP; height, on DBP. Maternal age, ethnic origin, parity, tobacco habit and family history had differential effects on BP. Gestation had no significant effect on SBP multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: BP resulted lower than conventional standard for pregnant women. Diagnostic criteria for hypertension in pregnancy must be revised; reference values can be adjusted by maternal and gestation characteristics.","Oviedo-Cruz, Héctor; Cortés-Martínez, Marco A.",Arch Cardiol Mex,586,13

The Indian Council of Medical Research has identified carbapenems, polymyxins (PE and PB) as key antimicrobials which require restriction in hospitals. We describe epidemiology of PB and PE use following implementation of an Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) in a 1300-bed, private, tertiary-care center in Southern India. METHODS: An ASP was established at Amrita Hospital in Feb 2016 consisting of an administrative champion, hospitalist, microbiologist, intensivist and 5 pharmacists. Institutional guidelines for polymyxins were established and disseminated. The ASP team performed daily post-prescriptive reviews, evaluated and tracked appropriateness of PB and PE use, including administration of a loading dose (LD), maintenance dose (MD), frequency, route and duration of therapy. ASP recommendations and compliance were recorded. RESULTS: During the 12-month study period (Feb ‘16-Jan ‘17), 348 patients received 295 PE and 94 PB courses. Mean age was 50 yrs and 73% were male. Patients on Medicine and Hematology/Oncology teams accounted for 42% of all prescriptions. The most common infections were bacteremia (34%), pneumonia (29%) and UTI (23%). Pathogens were recovered in 69% (269/389) of cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae 23% (90/389) and Acinetobacter baumanii11 % (45/389) were most common. 290 (75%) of polymyxin course were judged to be inappropriate (78% of PE and 22% of PB). The most frequent reasons for inappropriate therapy included incorrect frequency of administration (64% for PB and 58% for PE), inappropriate MD (60% for PB and 48% for PE) and wrong duration of therapy (54% for PE and 48% for PB). 95% of incorrect MD for both PE and PB were too low. The reasons for inappropriateness were similar for both polymyxins.While all inappropriate LD episodes for PB (n = 22 %) were due to lack of a LD, errors for PE (n = 34%) involved either omission of LD or administration of LD that was too low.ASP recommendations were made in 190 instances with 58% provider compliance. CONCLUSION: Review of PB and PE use in our hospital indicates a high percentage of inappropriate use and highlights stewardship opportunities for improving care of patients with resistant infections.

We further show how these lessons are relevant to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Commonly, emergency response organisations, like the URCS or hospitals, are ill equipped to handle longer lasting emergencies. These emergencies require special measures that combine ad-hoc action, continuous awareness over longer time periods, and the collaboration of multiple actors such as the government, public health institutions and other non-governmental organisations (NGOs). RESULTS: From our study we can translate seven lessons learnt which are important for managing long-term public health emergencies such as pandemics: (1) centralised pooling and management of resources; (2) engagement of local communities in response efforts; (3) the need to continuously recruit and train staff; (4) the establishment of adjusted working patterns to prevent staff exhaustion; (5) cooperation of involved agencies with security for enforcing measures; (6) the revision of funding frameworks; and (7) the use of global positioning system (GPS) data to identify population movement patterns. CONCLUSION: Although still speculative at this stage, we apply these lessons to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We argue that immediate action in the areas of resource pooling and control over critical resources, in the engagement of trusted and respected individuals in risk communication, in the continuous training and hiring of new staff, and in the appropriation of GPS tracking data is called for in managing SARS-CoV-2 by policy makers, NGOs and other involved agencies.","Geiger, Daniel; Harborth, Lisa; Mugyisha, Alex",,586,11

Agents have different profit valuations of items and we allow an incompatibility relation between pairs of items described in terms of a conflict graph. Hence, every feasible allocation of items to the agents corresponds to a partial coloring, that is, a collection of pairwise disjoint independent sets. The sum of profits of vertices/items assigned to one color/agent should be optimized in a maxi-min sense. We derive complexity and algorithmic results for this problem, which is a generalization of the classical Partition and Independent Set problems. In particular, we show that the problem is strongly NP-complete in the classes of bipartite graphs and their line graphs, and solvable in pseudo-polynomial time in the classes of cocomparability graphs and biconvex bipartite graphs.","Chiarelli, Nina; Krnc, Matjaž; Milanič, Martin; Pferschy, Ulrich; Pivač, Nevena; Schauer, Joachim",Combinatorial Algorithms,586,1

The running times of all our algorithms are essentially optimal as they run in linear time. One of the main ideas behind obtaining these algorithms is the detection and careful exploitation of sortedness present in the input representation for any graph without loss of generality. This observation alone is powerful enough to design some basic linear time in-place algorithms, but more non-trivial graph problems require extra techniques which, we believe, may find other applications while designing in-place algorithms for different graph problems in future.","Chakraborty, Sankardeep; Sadakane, Kunihiko; Satti, Srinivasa Rao",Combinatorial Algorithms,586,1

This paper proposes a new approach to the measurement of the polarization phenomenon based on fuzzy set. Fuzzy approach provides a new perspective whose elements admit degrees of membership. Since reality is not black and white, a polarization measure should include this key characteristic. For this purpose we analyze polarization metric properties and develop a new risk of polarization measure using aggregation operators and overlapping functions. We simulate a sample of [Formula: see text] cases across a 5-likert-scale with different distributions to test our measure. Other polarization measures were applied to compare situations where fuzzy set approach offers different results, where membership functions have proved to play an essential role in the measurement. Finally, we want to highlight the new and potential contribution of fuzzy set approach to the polarization measurement which opens a new field to research on.","Guevara, Juan Antonio; Gómez, Daniel; Robles, José Manuel; Montero, Javier",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,586,1

It hinges on visual development of the interface and business logic but also on easy integration with data stores and services while delivering robust applications that scale. Data integration increasingly means accessing a variety of NoSQL stores. Unfortunately, the diversity of data and processing models, that make them useful in the first place, is difficult to reconcile with the simplification of abstractions exposed to developers in a low-code platform. Moreover, NoSQL data stores also rely on a variety of general purpose and custom scripting languages as their main interfaces.

However, processing data from individuals and companies in third-party infrastructures raises several privacy concerns. To this end, different secure analytics techniques and systems have recently emerged. These initial proposals leverage specific cryptographic primitives lacking generality and thus having their application restricted to particular application scenarios. In this work, we contribute to this thriving body of knowledge by combining two complementary approaches to process sensitive data. We present SafeSpark, a secure data analytics framework that enables the combination of different cryptographic processing techniques with hardware-based protected environments for privacy-preserving data storage and processing. SafeSpark is modular and extensible therefore adapting to data analytics applications with different performance, security and functionality requirements. We have implemented a SafeSpark’s prototype based on Spark SQL and Intel SGX hardware. It has been evaluated with the TPC-DS Benchmark under three scenarios using different cryptographic primitives and secure hardware configurations. These scenarios provide a particular set of security guarantees and yield distinct performance impact, with overheads ranging from as low as 10% to an acceptable 300% when compared to an insecure vanilla deployment of Apache Spark.","Carvalho, Hugo; Cruz, Daniel; Pontes, Rogério; Paulo, João; Oliveira, Rui",Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems,586,1

India is no exception although showing relatively delayed increase in number of cases. Multilayered diagnostics for mass scaled screening is inevitable during and especially after the peak is passed and life is moving towards normalcy. First level of screening currently used in India is mainly based on temperature and has possibility of false positives and false negative (fever as a symptom has not yet been developed although infected). We propose here another augmentation or an intermediate level of screening, depending on the usage, based on assessing olfactory functions. It is established with multiple publications reporting degrading (hyposmia) or loss of sense (anosmia) of smell for infected patients. This paper presents a recently developed technology and device that uses olfactory sense detection using a novel device that is capable of generating precise level of smell digitally, and repeatedly in contactless manner. The device is designed to work with a mobile app that can trigger selected smell or combinations and further can be programmed to give standard or customised smell tests. Estimated capital and running cost are low since one (out of 25) canister filled with of 0.1 ml volume of essential smell oil can serve hundreds of tests. The prototype is tested to work for a desired smell generation and is available for further tweaking for rapid screening of subjects as per the requirements.","Gandhi, Prasanna; Bafna, Ratnesh; Arabale, Girish; Engineer, Sunu; Phadke, Sanjay",Trans Indian Natl,586,1

In many respects, this introduction is consonant with Gregory Ulmer’s theorization of ‘electracy,’ which crops up now and again throughout the chapters that follow. Ulmer develops his own ‘electorate transversal,’ a remarkable combination of Spinoza with Nietzsche where pain and pleasure (or sadness and joy) as experiences are theorized within this changed contemporary digitalized world. My emphasis, however, rests with Deleuze and Guattari who play a dominant position throughout this book. In this introduction, I review several important developments to grasp ‘designer capitalism,’ the most prominent being ‘the stack’ by Benjamin Bratton and ‘surveillance capitalism’ by Shoshana Zuboff. Both help us grasp the power of platform capitalism and the place of Big Data in it.

In the current scenario, it is required to come up with innovative solutions to protect health care providers, such innovations should be made in to usable products with limited resources available due to lock down condition prevailing in the market and should be provided to them instantly. Main routes of infection of COVID-19 disease are, direct contact with objects that has virus on it and indirect contact by inhaling droplets emitted through sneezes and cough of patients. Healthcare providers can avoid direct contact with objects having virus by using proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). However, they are at risk of transmissions by microscopic aerosol particles consisting of the residual solid components of evaporated respiratory droplets, which are tiny enough (< 5 μm) to remain airborne for hours created by cough and sneeze.

On March 2nd, 2020, the state authorities announced the end of face-to-face teaching in schools and universities. Then nothing suggests that a week later all classes went canceled. However, this unusual fact does not end with the teaching–learning process, forcing all educational institutions, as well as the teaching community to reinvent themselves to continue with online teaching. This is the only possible way to do it. The authors must face a specific scenario to readapt the learning-teaching process. The way of teaching of the University of La Rioja is online but it will have to face some problems. The Polytechnic University of Madrid classroom education is compulsory, so there is a big gap between what teachers are used to and what they will have to face. This crisis makes us reflect on new technologies as necessary and essential tools in the new teaching–learning scenario presented. But it must also go beyond considering only the tools available to do it. Reflection must also consider the members of this process and those who eventually make possible education to take place.","Nuere, Silvia; de Miguel, Laura",Tech Know Learn,586,1

It is associated with a high mortality rate due to late presentation and delayed surgical intervention, which involves sutureless or sutured techniques. Comprehensive literature review failed to identify any case of intra-operative right ventricular heart rupture followed by myocardial repair and a complete recovery after a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old previously healthy gentleman presented complaining of a new onset shortness of breath for 2 months. A large mediastinal mass was found on chest imaging and biopsy revealed a thymoma. Patient received a neoadjuvant Cisplatin/Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide (CAP) regimen chemotherapy then sternotomy and thymectomy en bloc with anterior pericardium. Post-thymectomy, the patient continued to be hypotensive in recovery despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. He was sent back to theatre, aggressive fluid resuscitation continued, surgical site exploration was done by reopening the sternum, and the bleeding source was identified and controlled, but intraoperative asystole developed. During internal cardiac massage, the right ventricle ruptured with a 3 cm defect which was successfully repaired using a pericardial patch without a bypass machine due to unavailability at our cancer center. The patient remained dependent on mechanical ventilation through tracheostomy for a total of 2 months due to bilateral phrenic nerve paralysis, was discharged from ICU to the surgical floor 66 days after the operation and weaned off ventilator support after 85 days, adequate respiratory and physical rehabilitation followed. Patient is doing very well now with excellent performance, and free of tumor recurrence 30 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Right ventricular rupture is rarely described outside the context of myocardial infarction and valvular heart disease. Tumor proximity to the heart and neoadjuvant cardiotoxic chemotherapy are the proposed causes for precipitating the cardiac rupture in our case. Post-surgical patients who receive early physical rehabilitation and respiratory physiotherapy have improved survival and outcome.","Abdel Jail, Riad; Abou Chaar, Mohamad K.; Al-Qudah, Obada; Abu Zahra, Khalil; Al-Hussaini, Maysa; Gharaibeh, Azza",J Cardiothorac Surg,586,13

Several contingency plans warned police to expect a large and potentially overwhelming increase in demand from the public during a pandemic, but (to the author’s knowledge) there is no empirical work on police demand during a major public health emergency. This study used calls-for-service data from 10 large cities in the USA to analyse how calls for service changed during the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, compared to forecasts of call volume based on data from previous years. Contrary to previous warnings, overall the number of calls went down during the early weeks of the pandemic. There were substantial reductions in specific call types, such as traffic collisions, and significant increases in others, such as calls to dead bodies. Other types of calls, particularly those relating to crime and order maintenance, continued largely as before. Changes in the frequency of different call types present challenges to law enforcement agencies, particularly since many will themselves be suffering from reduced staffing due to the pandemic. Understanding changes to calls in detail will allow police leaders to put in place evidence-based plans to ensure they can continue to serve the public.","Ashby, Matthew P J",,586,1

In real environments, applying a recovery policy can be a feasible strategy to handle disruptions. Hence, in this study, a recovery policy has been addressed in the form of reallocating suppliers to alternative cross-docks or altering the transportation strategy to move shipments. In addition to cross-dock location design, the optimum capacity of opened cross-docks will be determined considering the loads that will be served by each cross-docking center under regular and disruption conditions. A mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation is presented for the problem and is then linearized to present an efficient model. In order to solve it, two Lagrangian relaxation algorithms are designed and tested on 40 problem instances with different values of parameters. The results achieved by GAMS/CPLEX are compared with those of two algorithms and some analyses are performed on the solutions. Moreover, as the case study, the focus has been placed on logistic part of a car-manufacturing company with a vast supply chain network, containing more than 600 suppliers. The logistic strategies have been applied in order to reduce the transportation cost through the supply chain network and diminish the disruption subsequences in such a network. Based on the results, some managerial recommendations are presented.","Hasani Goodarzi, Asefeh; Zegordi, Seyed Hessameddin; Alpan, Gülgün; Nakhai Kamalabadi, Isa; Husseinzadeh Kashan, Ali",Oper Res Int J,586,1

Existing NVX systems execute diversified program variants on a single host. This means the level of inter-variant diversity will be limited to what a single platform can offer, without costly emulation. This paper presents DMON , a novel distributed NVX design that executes native program variants across multiple heterogeneous hosts. Our approach greatly increases the level of diversity between the simultaneously running variants that can be supported, encompassing different ISAs and ABIs.

First, as with general-purpose computation, every allocation must be paired with a matching de-allocation. Second, space can only be safely de-allocated if its contents are restored to their initial value from allocation time. Generally speaking, the state of the art provides limited partial solutions, either leaving both constraints to programmers’ assertions or imposing a stack discipline to address the first constraint and leaving the second constraint to programmers’ assertions. We propose a novel approach based on the idea of fractional types. As a simple intuitive example, allocation of a new boolean value initialized to [Image: see text] also creates a value [Image: see text] that can be thought of as a garbage collection (GC) process specialized to reclaim, and only reclaim, storage containing the value [Image: see text]. This GC process is a first-class entity that can be manipulated, decomposed into smaller processes and combined with other GC processes. We formalize this idea in the context of a reversible language founded on type isomorphisms, prove its fundamental correctness properties, and illustrate its expressiveness using a wide variety of examples.

Conspiracy worldviews have been connected to refusal to trust science, the biomedical model of disease, and legal means of political engagement in previous research. In three studies from the United States (N = 220; N = 288) and the UK (N = 298), we went beyond this focus on a general conspiracy worldview and tested the idea that different forms of conspiracy beliefs despite being positively correlated have distinct behavioral implications.

These microcontrollers often need to communicate with each other to exchange payload and control information in a bidirectional manner. Today’s well-established communication protocols in MCUs either do not fit modern transmission speed requirements or do have an inappropriate master-slave attribute, which does not allow the communication partners to have equal bus access rights. Therefore, this paper introduces an extension of the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to allow an equally distributed access right for the communication interface between two microcontrollers. It simultaneously does fit modern transmission speed requirements of a common network interface, so that the message transmission does not constitute a bottleneck in data processing.

It allows to distribute tasks to processing nodes in a self-organizing way while neither having a single-point-of-failure nor requiring external user input. Node failures are detected automatically, resulting in relocation of any affected tasks to operational nodes. This provides self-healing capabilities if sufficient computational resources are available. Our extension allows tasks to have priorities and enables self-healing by gracefully degrading the system based on the task priorities if the computational resources are not sufficient to completely self-heal the system. We present our extension and analyze its worst-case time bounds for self-configuration as well as self-healing. Quickly degrading the system in overload situations requires a strategy deciding which tasks to stop in such situations.

Its use in agriculture is controversial as many people believe that it could harm human health; however, there is no clear evidence to support. METHODOLOGY: The pangolin P. fungorum (pangolin Pf) genome has a genomic size of approximately 7.7 Mbps with N50 of 69,666 bps. Our study showed that pangolin Pf is a Paraburkholderia fungorum supported by evidence from the core genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis and the ANI analysis. Functional analysis has shown that the presence of a considerably large number of genes related to stress response, virulence, disease, and defence. Interestingly, we identified different types of secretion systems in the genome of pangolin Pf, which are highly specialized and responsible for a bacterium’s response to its environment and in physiological processes such as survival, adhesion, and adaptation. The pangolin Pf also shared some common virulence genes with the known pathogenic member of the Burkholderiales. These genes play important roles in adhesion, motility, and invasion. CONCLUSION: This study may provide better insights into the functions, secretion systems and virulence of this pangolin-associated bacterial strain. The addition of this genome sequence is also important for future comparative analysis and functional work of P. fungorum.","Tan, Ka Yun; Dutta, Avirup; Tan, Tze King; Hari, Ranjeev; Othman, Rofina Y.; Choo, Siew Woh",PeerJ,586,1

In contrast to monolayer cell culture methods which were developed to achieve proliferation of animal cells in the beginning of in vitro biology, the advancements in 3D culture methods are designed to promote cellular differentiation, and to achieve in vivo–like 3D structure and organotypic functions. This project was conceived through the Society for In Vitro Biology to draw on the expertise of individual scientists with special expertise in organotypic cultures of selected tissues or associated interrogation methods to prepare individual-focused reviews in this series. This introductory manuscript will review the early achievements of animal cell culture in monolayer culture and the limitations of that approach to reproduce functioning organ systems. Among these are the nature and 3D architecture of the substrate on which or in which the cells are grown, physical and mechanical clues from the substrate, cell-cell interactions, and defined biochemical factors that trigger the induction of the 3D organotypic differentiation. The organoid culture requires a source of cells with proliferative capacity (ranging from tissue-derived stem or immortalized cells to the iPSC cultures), a suitable substrate or matrix with the mechanical and stimulatory properties appropriate for the organotypic construct and the necessary stimulation of the culture to drive differentiation of the cell population to form the functioning organotypic construct. Details for each type of organotypic construct will be provided in the following papers.","Hayden, Patrick J.; Harbell, John W.",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,586,1

The developmental trend reveals a substantial change in the volume of publications recently, although the overall volume of research is still relatively low. Findings identify that, although quantitative methods were the most commonly used, qualitative and mixed methods of research have undergone a marked increase in the past ten years. However, as the majority of articles have been exploratory-oriented, intervention and experimental studies are largely lacking, resulting in the “so-what” story being missing. A functionalist perspective suggests that knowledge production in teacher emotion research is either at a late first stage or an emerging second stage.

The study group received dexmedetomidine and fentanyl, while the control remifentanil and midazolam. In a prospective cohort study, we encompassed 72 cycles/patients. The administered dose of propofol per patient and fertilization rates were the primary outcomes, while anesthesiological parameters and IVF/ICSI outcomes were the secondary endpoints; (3) Results: We found a significant increase in propofol consumption in the study compared to the control group (77.0 ± 10.6 mg vs. 12.1 ± 6.1; p < 0.001), but fertilization rates were similar (p = 0.469). From the secondary anesthesiological outcomes, the post anesthesia discharge scores were better in the control group (15.0 (13.5 min) vs. 5.0 (10.0 min), p = 0.028). From the IVF/ICSI secondary outcome parameters, we found a higher quality of embryos on day three in the study compared to the control group (p = 0.040). The comparison of the other secondary outcomes yielded non-significant differences; (4) Conclusions: The use of dexmedetomidine, as an alternative agent during OR, was associated with higher propofol consumption as a rescue dose compared to remifentanil but was linked with similar fertilization rates and higher quality of embryos produced.","Matsota, Paraskevi; Sidiropoulou, Tatiana; Vrantza, Tereza; Boutsikou, Maria; Midvighi, Elena; Siristatidis, Charalampos",J Clin Med,586,33

These biomarkers can be harmful or beneficial to an organism and still perform crosstalk, acting through the endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine pathways. This study aims to review the crosstalk between adipokines, myokines, and hepatokines. Far beyond understanding the actions of each biomarker alone, it is important to underline that these cytokines act together in the body, resulting in a complex network of actions in different tissues, which may have beneficial or non-beneficial effects on the genesis of various physiological disorders and their respective outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Overweight individuals secrete more pro-inflammatory adipokines than those of a healthy weight, leading to an impaired immune response and greater susceptibility to inflammatory and infectious diseases. Myostatin is elevated in pro-inflammatory environments, sharing space with pro-inflammatory organokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), resistin, and chemerin. Fibroblast growth factor FGF21 acts as a beta-oxidation regulator and decreases lipogenesis in the liver. The crosstalk mentioned above can interfere with homeostatic disorders and can play a role as a potential therapeutic target that can assist in the methods of diagnosing metabolic syndrome and CVD.","de Oliveira dos Santos, Ana Rita; de Oliveira Zanuso, Bárbara; Miola, Vitor Fernando Bordin; Barbalho, Sandra Maria; Santos Bueno, Patrícia C.; Flato, Uri Adrian Prync; Detregiachi, Claudia Rucco P.; Buchaim, Daniela Vieira; Buchaim, Rogério Leone; Tofano, Ricardo José; Mendes, Claudemir Gregório; Tofano, Viviane Alessandra Capelluppi; dos Santos Haber, Jesselina F.",Int J Mol Sci,586,17

The level of profit reinvestment primarily depends on the life cycle of companies, and the choice of the optimal growth rate, determined by the growth model, is the basis for sustainable development of companies. The universality of the models is confirmed by the possibility of their application regardless of the availability of companies shares, dividend payments and organization forms, which allowed the authors to reduce the restrictions on the sample.

Thus, the Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) technique is essential in the domain of image retrieval. Due to the growing medical image data, the searching or retrieving a relevant image from the dataset is a major problem. To address this problem, this paper propose a new medical image retrieval technique, namely Multiple Kernel Scale Invariant Feature Transform-based Deep Recurrent Neural Network (MKSIFT-Deep RNN) using the image contents. The goal is to present an effective tool that can be utilized for effective retrieval of image from huge medical image database. Here, MKSIFT is adapted for extracting the relevant features obtained from acquired input image. Moreover, MKSIFT evaluates the key point descriptor using kernels functions, wherein the weights are allocated to kernels. The feature vectors are employed in the Deep RNN for classifying the images by training the classifier, which is considered as training phase. In testing phase, a set of query images is given to the classifier which adapts Tanimoto similarity for retrieving the images.

Enhancing tactile charts with audio feedback can replace Braille labels and provide more structured information than pure tactile graphics. Current approaches lack especially in support of gestural interaction to develop useful interaction concepts for audio-tactile charts. Many approaches make use of non-standard hardware or are less mobile. That is why we investigated digital pens and their capability to increase data analysis with tactile charts. We compared two digital pens, in particular, the TipToi[Formula: see text] pen and the Neo SmartPen M1. First, we evaluated the implementation and feasibility of five basic gestures. While the TipToi[Formula: see text] is not suitable to support rich touch gestures, the Neo SmartPen showed in a pilot study good support of single-tap, double-tap as well as hold and line gestures. On that basis, we implemented the first prototype to demonstrate the potential of digital pens to support data analysis tasks with audio-tactile scatterplots. Afterwards, we evaluated the prototype in a pilot study with one participant. The study shows high indications for the usefulness of the presented system. The usage of the digital pen can improve the readability of a tactile chart. Our system provides audio-feedback for given tactile scatterplots in an accessible and automatic way.

Conducting such evaluations of systems which require complex domain knowledge is often impossible, as disabled users do not exist or are very rare. This paper presents a user evaluation method to address this problem, consigliere evaluation. A consigliere evaluation has the disabled user as the main participant, but they are assisted by an advisor, or consigliere, who understands the complex domain; the consigliere is in turn, monitored by an accessibility expert, who acts as an enforcer. As in all user evaluations, the disabled participant undertakes a series of tasks. But in a consigliere evaluation, if the task requires some particular domain knowledge or skill, the role of the consigliere is to provide appropriate information. However, it is easy for the consigliere, who usually does not have knowledge of the accessibility domain, to provide information not specifically about the domain, but about how to do the task in general. So the role of the enforcer, who is an accessibility expert, is to ensure this does not happen, and also to provide assistance and explanation if accessibility issues arise that the disabled participant cannot solve. The paper illustrates the consigliere method with a case study, the evaluation of Skillsforge, an online system used by a number of universities to manage progress of postgraduate students. This system requires considerable domain knowledge of the terminology and progression requirements for these students. It is used by university administrative staff, academic staff who supervise postgraduate students or are involved in monitoring students and the students themselves. The case study illustrates how the consigliere evaluation method works and some of the things which need to be considered in conducting the evaluation appropriately.","Petrie, Helen; Samaddar, Sanjit; Power, Christopher; Merdenyan, Burak",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,586,17

For each of these industries, the companies we explored made decisions about which business functions to perform themselves and which functions to outsource to partners. For example, during its early years when it sold books online, Amazon built its own website so customers could place orders online. It relied on partners, such as Ingram, a leading book wholesaler, to fulfill those orders. As the company expanded its product line and dramatically increased its order volume, those fulfillment partners could not meet Amazon’s service quality standards – particularly during peak periods of demand. Amazon responded by building its own fulfillment network – consisting of warehouses, trucks, airplanes, and the people and systems needed to operate them. Amazon’s decision to backward integrate into logistics has put pressure on its fulfillment partners and changed the structure of the logistics industry. While it began by operating with few physical assets, the ecommerce industry’s ability to fulfill demanding service standards – for example, shipping the right products quickly without breaking them – depends on building an asset-heavy logistics network. Simply put, logistics has become an essential part of ecommerce. That fundamental shift has implications for ecommerce companies, store-based retailers, and the logistics industry.","Cohan, Peter S.",Goliath Strikes Back,586,1

One of the most common pathways of species introduction is represented by intentional or accidental escapes from confined environments, including zoos, farms and enclosures. A feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy since 2016 after escaping from a zoological garden. In 2020, only three individuals were confirmed to be still present within a 40-hectare area, following a field survey. We carried out questionnaires with the resident human population to determine the local perception and the acceptance of two possible management actions, i.e., direct killing and surgical sterilization. Llamas are quite docile domestic animals, thus local perception was, in general, very positive and also linked to the exotic origin of the species, making llamas a welcome observation and a pleasant surprise. The observed decline of this population may be due to predation by wolves and poaching, together with the lack of suitability of natural environment, which may have prevented llamas establishing an invasive population. In this context, however, individual removal action should be conducted before the population shows a demographic rebound. ABSTRACT: Since 2016, a feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy after escaping from a zoological garden and starting to reproduce. We updated demographic status and distribution of this population and investigated societal perception towards the llama presence and management in the area through a standard questionnaire. Field data were collected through direct (transects traveled by car and on foot) and indirect (newspapers, social networks and online platforms) research. The feral population appears to be declining. In July 2020, the population was represented by three individuals (one male and two females), identified also through photoidentification, most likely located within a 40-hectare area. The majority of citizens are aware of the presence of feral llamas and show a positive attitude toward them and a negative one toward management actions. The case of feral llamas in Italy is an evident example of unsafe management of a species which should have kept in a zoo and which, once set free, was able to catalyze the attention of the general public. The decline of this population limits the need of drastic management actions that, given the appreciation expressed by people and press toward these animals, would have been at risk of conflict with the public opinion. Removal action should be rapidly taken, i.e., before any demographic rebound and before the population becomes a stable feature of the local landscape.","Gargioni, Carlo; Monaco, Andrea; Francesco Ficetola, Gentile; Lazzeri, Lorenzo; Mori, Emiliano",Animals (Basel),586,1

Water not only provides a protective shell for the virus in which it is enveloped, but enhances its binding with the human cell. Therefore, one may conclude that the dehydration of the hydrated virus makes it much more vulnerable, due to the fact that if it is exposed to many chemicals it will be deactivated; even by particles in air, such as ozone, singlet oxygen and pollutants. Thermodynamically, the dehydration may be facilitated at higher temperature, low humidity, and exposure to deliquescent materials. We have concluded that if the contaminated air passes over or through some water absorbents, like calcium chloride, with enough time contact, the virus is expected to become dehydrated and deactivated shortly afterward. If the time contact is not enough for the deactivation, the air may be exposed to the blue or UVC lights as well.

Our objective was to assess two-year changes in diet quality among subgroups of the Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) cohort. METHODS: In August 2020, an online COVID-19 survey that assessed food group intakes, meal sources, and COVID-related questions was completed by a subgroup of 2,335 CPS-3 participants. Paired t-tests evaluated reported change in behaviors from 2018 to 2020. A diet quality score assigned higher points for greater frequency of foods recommended by cancer prevention guidelines, and lower points for foods that are not recommended. RESULTS: While diet quality improved slightly, on average, from 2018 to 2020, consumption of component food groups decreased (P < 0.001), with the greatest decreases in vegetables and whole grains. The greatest decrease in vegetable intake occurred in Black participants, as well as participants who gained weight. On average, Asian/Pacific Islander participants increased fruit consumption. Participants who lost ≥20 pounds had the greatest decrease in refined grain consumption and greatest improvements in diet quality. Low diet quality scores during the pandemic were associated with being male, current smoking, less education, lower physical activity, higher BMI, and weight gain of ≥20 pounds since 2018. Participants who worried about food insecurity, were at high risk of COVID-19 complications, and reported more COVID-related stressors also had lower scores. Changes in diet quality did not appear to vary by other demographic factors. On average, total alcohol intake decreased in most groups examined. Frequency of meals from all sources decreased (P < 0.001), and the greatest decreases were observed in full-service restaurants and prepared ready-to-eat meals. CONCLUSIONS: Undesirable changes in diet during the pandemic, particularly decreases in vegetables and whole grains, may contribute to weight gain, poor metabolic health, and subsequent higher risk of chronic disease.

Silver has served as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial since ancient times but suffers from major challenges such as moderate antimicrobial activity, nonspecific toxicity, and difficulty to be visualized in situ. Here, we propose a new photoactive silver nanoagent that relies on a photosensitizer-triggered cascade reaction to liberate Ag(+) on bacterial surfaces exclusively, allowing the precise killing of MDR bacteria. Additionally, the AgNP core acts as a backgroundless surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate for imaging the distribution of the nanoagents on bacterial surfaces and monitoring their metabolic dynamics in the infection sites. Methods: In this strategy, the photoactive antibacterial AgNP was decorated with photosensitizers (Chlorin e6, Ce6) and Raman reporter (4-Mercaptobenzonitrile, 4-MB) to provide new opportunities for clinically monitoring and fighting MDR bacterial infections. Upon 655 nm laser activation, the Ce6 molecules produce ROS efficiently, triggering the rapid release of Ag(+) from the AgNP core to kill bacteria. Poly[4-O-(α-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucopyranose] (GP) was introduced as bacteria-specific targeting ligands. SERS spectra of the prepared GP-Ce6/MB-AgNPs were recorded after injecting for 0.5, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h to track the dynamic metabolism of the nanoagents and thus guiding the antibacterial therapy. Results: This new antimicrobial strategy exerts a dramatically enhanced antibacterial activity. The in vitro antibacterial efficiencies of this non-antibiotic technique were up to 99.6% against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 98.8% against Escherichia coli (EC), while the in vivo antibacterial efficiencies for MRSA- and Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA)-infected mice models were 96.8% and 93.6%, respectively. Besides, backgroundless SERS signal intensity of the wound declined to the level of normal tissue until 24 h, indicating that the nanoagents had been completely metabolized from the infected area. Conclusion: Given the backgroundless monitoring ability, high antibacterial efficacy, and low toxicity, the photoactive cascading agents would hold great potential for MDR-bacterial detection and elimination in diverse clinical settings.","Xu, Zhiwen; Zhang, Cai; Yu, Yunjian; Li, Wenshuai; Ma, Zhuang; Wang, Jingjing; Zhang, Xinge; Gao, Hongmei; Liu, Dingbin",Nanotheranostics,586,1

However, it is almost impossible for a potential tourist to look through the massive online reviews related to tourist attractions (TAs) so that he/she can make the most appropriate decision. To this end, this paper proposes a recommender system to rank the alternative TAs through online reviews based on aspect-level sentiment analysis and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) with intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy information. In this methodology, the aspects that the experienced tourists concern are extracted from online reviews to construct a three-level evaluation system (including target layer, criteria layer and sub-criteria layer), which not only ensures the comprehensive evaluation of TAs as much as possible, but also reduces the complexity of the decision-making process. Then, the online reviews related to these sub-criteria are transformed into the corresponding intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy performance scores through aspect-level sentiment analysis. Furthermore, in order to obtain the final ranking result that more in line with the expectations of the potential tourist, the preference information from the potential tourist and experienced tourists is integrated to determine the weights of criteria. Subsequently, the intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS (IHF-TOPSIS) method is proposed to rank the alternative TAs. Finally, a case study is provided to verify the validity and applicability of the methodology.","Qin, Yong; Wang, Xinxin; Xu, Zeshui",Int,586,1

Drawing from fifty-three depth interviews with both corporate responsibility practitioners, and managers in non-profit organizations who together work on CSR projects, we describe their experiences of the social and organizational environment, the CSR practices that are undertaken in this context, and the intended and unintended consequences of such work. Using Bauman’s theorization of ethics, including adiaphora and moral distancing, and Borţun’s interpretation of Romanianness, we then theorize liquid CSR as an ambivalence between adiaphoric practice (instrumental morality, careerism and self-interest) and the moral impulse to do good, resulting in both intended (short-term promotion and competitive victimhood) and unintended consequences (a potential for corruption and collateral beneficiaries).","Grigore, Georgiana; Molesworth, Mike; Vontea, Andreea; Basnawi, Abdullah Hasan; Celep, Ogeday; Jesudoss, Sylvian Patrick",J Bus Ethics,586,1

We investigated the change in plasma apelin level in HF patients versus control and non-HF patients. The plasma level of apelin was measured by ELISA and plasma level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) by fluorescence immunoassay. We included 101 patients with HF, 32 patients without HF and 20 controls. The three groups did not differ in general and clinical characteristics. Plasma levels of apelin and BNP were both higher in HF patients than non-HF patients and controls. Plasma levels of apelin and BNP were not correlated. Plasma level of BNP was increased with increasing New York Heart Association grade and apelin level was decreased. Apelin level was lower in HF patients with NYHA grade IV than in controls and non-HF patients. Apelin level had 75% diagnostic value for HF, and BNP level had 96.8% diagnostic value. At a cutoff of 6.44 ng/mL apelin level, sensitivity was 69.3%, and specificity 97.1%. However, the diagnostic of apelin for NYHA II patients was higher than that of BNP (99.6% vs. 96.1%). These results suggested that apelin might be particularly useful in association with BNP in mild HF patients.","Han, Ling; Jie, Bingzhang; Luo, Jingguang; Chen, Liwei; Jia, Ye; Guo, Like; Zhao, Yan; Chen, Xin; Zhu, Xiaogang; Teng, Xu; Qi, Yongfen",Amino acids,586,30

To improve efficiency of transduction, we explored surgical approaches to virus delivery in vivo. METHODS A technique was developed for retrograde surgical perfusion into the rat biliopancreatic duct with a test adenovirus containing a construct coexpressing green fluorescent protein, the latter for detection of infected cells. RESULTS Pancreatic islets isolated after acute pancreatic infusion and cultured for 2 days showed expression in the entire islet and in almost all islets. When rats were recovered from the surgery, and then islets isolated at 1 and 8 weeks after surgery, we continued to see extensive islet green fluorescent protein expression, albeit at more reduced levels at 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS This strategy of surgical pancreatic ductal perfusion of viruses is an effective way to transduce or reduce gene expression in pancreatic islets for both acute and chronic study.","Banks, Kate; Qin, Tairan; Liang, Tao; Wang, An Jing; Gaisano, Herbert Y",Pancreas,586,17

Our purpose was to investigate and to clarify the important surgical factors affecting wound score after TKA. METHODS A total of 139 knees in 128 patients (mean 73 years) without severe comorbidity were enrolled in the present study. All primary unilateral or bilateral TKAs were done using the same skin incision line, measured resection technique, and wound closure technique using unidirectional barbed suture. In terms of the wound healing, Hollander Wound Evaluation Score (HWES) was assessed on postoperative day 14. We performed multiple regression analysis using stepwise method to identify the factors affecting HWES. Variables considered in the analysis were age, sex, body mass index (kg/m(2)), HbA1C (%), femorotibial angle (degrees) on plain radiographs, intraoperative patella eversion during the cutting phase of the femur and the tibia in knee flexion, intraoperative anterior translation of the tibia, patella resurfacing, surgical time (min), tourniquet time (min), length of skin incision (cm), postoperative drainage (ml), patellar height on postoperative lateral radiographs, and HWES. HWES was treated as a dependent variable, and others were as independent variables. RESULTS The average HWES was 5.0 ± 0.8 point. According to stepwise forward regression test, patella eversion during the cutting phase of the femur and the tibia in knee flexion and anterior translation of the tibia were entered in this model, while other factors were not entered. Standardized partial regression coefficient was as follows: 0.57 in anterior translation of the tibia and 0.38 in patella eversion. CONCLUSIONS Fortunately, in the present study using the unidirectional barbed suture, major wound healing problem did not occur. As to the surgical technique, intraoperative patella eversion and anterior translation of the tibia should be avoided for quality cosmesis in primary TKA.","Harato, Kengo; Tanikawa, Hidenori; Morishige, Yutaro; Kaneda, Kazuya; Niki, Yasuo",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,586,19

This study examined the rate of successful gallbladder specimen extraction through an overtube and hypothesized that preoperative ultrasound findings could predict successful specimen passage. METHODS Gallbladder specimens from patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were measured, and an attempt was made to pull the specimens through a commercially available overtube with an inner diameter of 16.7-mm. A radiologist blinded to the outcomes reviewed the available preoperative ultrasound measurements from these patients. Ultrasound dimensions including gallbladder length, width, and depth; wall thickness; common bile duct diameter; and size of the largest gallstone (LGS) were recorded. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether ultrasound findings and patient characteristics (age, body mass index [BMI], and sex) could predict the ability of a specimen to pass through the overtube. RESULTS Of 57 patients, 44 (77%) who had preoperative ultrasounds available for electronic review were included in the final analysis. Gallstones were present in 35 (79%) of these 44 patients. Intraoperative gallbladder perforation occurred in 18 (41%) of the 44 patients, and 16 (36%) of the 44 gallbladders could be extracted through the overtube. Measurement of LGS was possible for 23 patients, and indeterminate gallstone size (IGS) was determined for 12 patients. The rate for passage of perforated versus intact gallbladders was similar (40% vs. 23%; p = 0.054). The LGS (odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.33; p = 0.021) and IGS (OR, 22.97; 95% CI, 1.99-265.63; p = 0.025) predicted failed passage on multivariate logistic regression analysis. The passage rate was 80% for LGS smaller than 10 mm or no stones present, 18% for LGS 10 mm or larger, and 8% for IGS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION A majority of cholecystectomy specimens cannot pass through an endoscopic overtube. Preoperative ultrasound findings can predict successful specimen extraction. An IGS or a gallstone 10 mm or larger should be considered a relative contraindication to transgastric NOTES cholecystectomy.","Santos, Byron F; Auyang, Edward D; Hungness, Eric S; Desai, Kush R; Chan, Edward S; van Beek, Darren B; Wang, Edward C; Soper, Nathaniel J",Surgical endoscopy,586,8

This study evaluated the impact of both devices on outcomes in patients with sepsis and concurrent gram-negative bacteremia. METHODS This quasi-experimental study included a retrospective pre-implementation and a prospective post-implementation group. Patients ≥18 years old with gram-negative bacteremia were included. Patients with neutropenia, pregnancy, were transferred from an outside hospital with active bloodstream infection, or polymicrobial bacteremia were excluded. Blood culture incubation in the BacT/ALERT 3D and microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing from culture plate growth was used prior to implementation of BacT/ALERT VIRTUO and Accelerate Pheno. MALDI-TOF identification directly from blood culture was used pre- and post-implementation. Time to gram-stain, identification, susceptibility reporting, initiation of narrow spectrum gram-negative therapy at 72 hours, 30-day inpatient mortality, sepsis resolution, and hospital length of stay were evaluated. RESULTS 116 patients were included (63 pre-implementation, 53 post-implementation). Median time to gram-stain and susceptibility results were significantly shorter post-implementation (P < 0.001). The post-implementation group had an improved hazard for narrow spectrum gram-negative therapy at 72 hours (HR [95% CI] = 2.685 [1.348 - 5.349]), reduced hazard for 30-day inpatient mortality (aHR: 0.150 [0.026 - 0.846]) and improved sepsis resolution (77.8% vs. 92.5%, P = 0.030). Hospital length of stay was unchanged between groups. CONCLUSION The implementation of BacT/Alert VIRTUO and the Accelerate Pheno system improved microbiology laboratory processes, antibiotic utilization processes and clinical outcomes.

However, these guidelines did not review some potentially useful strategies, such as the use of an endotracheal tube with an ultrathin cuff membrane, an endotracheal tube with a low-volume/low-pressure cuff, a device for continuous monitoring of the endotracheal tube cuff pressure, a device to remove biofilm from the inner site of the endotracheal tube, and saline instillation before tracheal suctioning. Only a few guidelines analyze the time of tracheostomy, and so no firm recommendations can be made regarding its importance. In addition, the guidelines diverge on the use of heat and moisture exchangers or heated humidifiers and on the use of an endotracheal tube coated with antimicrobial agents. The current review focuses on measures of VAP prevention for which there is no clear recommendation, or the use of which is controversial. A review of the literature suggests that the use of an endotracheal tube with an ultrathin and tapered-shape cuff membrane and coated in antimicrobial agents may reduce the risk of VAP. These features offer an attractive way to optimize the VAP prevention capacity of endotracheal tubes with a lumen for subglottic secretion drainage. We believe that early tracheostomy should be considered, based on the length reduction of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay, reduction of mortality, and on patient comfort, although early tracheostomy has not yet been shown to favorably impact the incidence of VAP. We believed that heat and moisture exchangers should be considered based on the benefits in terms of cost savings. More research is necessary to clarify the role of continuous cuff pressure monitoring, removal of biofilm formation in the endotracheal tubes, and routine saline instillation before tracheal suctioning.","Lorente, Leonardo; Blot, Stijn; Rello, Jordi",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,586,5

Progression of these viral infections to lower respiratory tract may prove fatal, especially in HCT recipients. Increasing evidence on the successful use of ribavirin (alone or in combination with immunomodulators) for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections in HM patients and HCT recipients is available from retrospective studies; however, prospective clinical trials are necessary to establish its efficacy with confidence. The impact on progression to pneumonitis and/or mortality of treating parainfluenza virus infections with available (ribavirin) or investigational (DAS181) antiviral agents still needs to be determined. Influenza infections have been successfully treated with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir or zanamivir); however, the efficacy of these agents for influenza pneumonia has not been established, and immunocompromised patients are highly susceptible to emergence of antiviral drug resistance, most probably due to prolonged viral shedding. Infection control measures and an appreciation of the complications following respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients remain crucial for reducing transmission. Future studies should focus on strategies to identify patients at high risk for increased morbidity and mortality from these infections and to determine the efficacy of novel or available antiviral drugs.","Chemaly, Roy F; Shah, Dimpy P; Boeckh, Michael J",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,586,1

Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of administering the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery screening module (NAB-S) to patients with aSAH, assessed its value in predicting the ability to return to work and characterized clinical as well as neuropsychological recovery over the period of 24 months. METHODS A total of 104 consecutive patients treated for aSAH were recruited. After acute treatment, follow up visits were conducted at 3, 12 and 24 months after the hemorrhage. NAB-S, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and physical examination were performed at each follow up visit. RESULTS The NAB-S could be administered to 64.9, 75.9 and 88.9% of the patients at 3, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Moderate impairment of two or more neuropsychological domains (e.g speech, executive function, etc.) significantly correlated with inability to return to work at 12 and 24 months as well as poor outcome assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) at 3, 12 and 24 months. The number of patients with favorable outcomes significantly increased from 25.5% at discharge to 56.5 and 57.1% at 3 and 12 months, respectively, and further increased to 74.1% after 24 months. CONCLUSION The NAB-S can be administered to the majority of patients with aSAH and can effectively detect clinically relevant neuropsychological deficits. Clinical recovery after aSAH continues for at least 24 months after the hemorrhage which should be considered in the design of future clinical trials.","Walter, Johannes; Grutza, Martin; Vogt, Lidia; Unterberg, Andreas; Zweckberger, Klaus",BMC neurology,586,1

We assessed the effect of graphene oxide (GO) on tomato plants at the seedling and mature stages in terms of morphological and biochemical indices. GO treatment significantly improved the shoot/stem growth of tomato in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the cortical cells number, cross-sectional area, diameter and vascular-column area. In addition, GO also promoted the morphological development of the root system and increased biomass accumulation. The surface area of root tips and hairs of tomato plants treated with 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L GO were significantly greater compared to the untreated control. At the molecular level, GO induced the expression of root development-related genes (SlExt1 and LeCTR1) and inhibited the auxin-responsive gene (SlIAA3). However, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L GO significantly increased the root auxin content, which in turn increased the number of fruits and hastened fruit ripening compared to the control plants. Taken together, GO can improve the tomato growth when used at the appropriate concentration, and is a promising nano-carbon material for agricultural use.","Guo, Xuhu; Zhao, Jianguo; Wang, Runmei; Zhang, Hongchi; Xing, Baoyan; Naeem, Muhammad; Yao, Tianjun; Li, Rongqing; Xu, Rongfang; Zhang, Zhaofeng; Wu, Jiaxian",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,586,1

However, there is significant uncertainty about the risks of cause-specific mortality in- and out-of-treatment. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the association between methadone or buprenorphine with cause-specific mortality among opioid-dependent persons. METHODS We searched six online databases to identify relevant cohort studies, calculating all-cause and overdose-specific mortality rates during periods in- and out-of-treatment. We pooled mortality estimates using multivariate random effects meta-analysis of the crude mortality rate per 1000 person-years of follow-up as well as relative risks comparing mortality in-versus-out of treatment. RESULTS 32 cohort studies (representing 150,235 participants, 805,423.6 person-years, and 9112 deaths met eligibility criteria. Crude mortality rates were substantially higher among methadone cohorts than buprenorphine cohorts. Relative risk reduction was substantially higher with methadone relative to buprenorphine when time in-treatment was compared to time out-of-treatment. Furthermore, the greatest mortality reduction was conferred during the first four weeks of treatment. Mortality estimates were substantially heterogeneous, and varied significantly by country, region, and by the nature of the treatment provider. CONCLUSION Precautions are necessary for the safer implementation of opioid agonist therapy, including baseline assessments of opioid tolerance, ongoing monitoring during the induction period, education of patients about the risk of overdose, and coordination within healthcare services.","Bahji, Anees; Cheng, Breagh; Gray, Samantha; Stuart, Heather",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,586,1

However, issues relating to implementation have been reported in countries where menu labelling has been introduced on a voluntary or mandatory basis. The aim of this mixed methods systematic review is to synthesise the empirical evidence on the barriers and facilitators to implementation of menu labelling interventions to support healthy food choices. METHODS This review will use the 'best fit' framework synthesis approach to synthesise qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods evidence. Peer-reviewed publications will be accessed through PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus. Grey literature will be accessed through Google Scholar, OpenGrey, RIAN, EThOS, ProQuest, WorldCat, Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and public health organisation websites. Screening reference lists, citation chaining and contacting authors of all included studies will be undertaken. There will be no restriction on menu labelling scheme or format, publication year or language; however, only primary research studies relevant to supply-side stakeholders will be eligible for inclusion. Study quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. At least two independent reviewers will perform study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal; if consensus is required, another independent reviewer will be consulted. A combination of deductive coding, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research as the a priori framework, and inductive analysis, using secondary thematic analysis, will be used. The overall process will assist in the construction of a new evidence-based conceptual model regarding the implementation of menu labelling interventions. The new model will be assessed for bias and a sensitivity analysis performed. DISCUSSION Given the growing consensus that a systemic, sustained portfolio of obesity prevention strategies, delivered at scale, is needed to address the obesity epidemic, greater understanding of the practical issues relating to implementation of such strategies is required. Findings from this review will be used to develop a set of best-practice guidelines to enhance the adoption, implementation and sustainability of menu labelling interventions across countries worldwide.

INTERVENTION We compared neonatal transmission rates between those neonates who experienced bonding versus those who were separated. RESULTS A total of 1989 women were screened for SARS-CoV-2, from which 86 tested positive. Out of 31 analyzed pregnancies, five women (16%) were admitted to ICU and required mechanical ventilation. From the remaining 26 (84%), 17 (65%) opted for rooming-in, 12 (46%) for STSC, and 16 (61%) fed the infants with breastmilk (11 direct breastfeedings and five pumped the breast milk). All neonatal tests for SARS-CoV-2 returned negative. CONCLUSION Our results have illustrated that maternal bonding appears safe in neonates born to mothers that are SARS-CoV-2 positive.","Cojocaru, Liviu; Crimmins, Sarah; Sundararajan, Sripriya; Goetzinger, Katherine; Elsamadicy, Emad; Lankford, Allison; Turan, Ozhan M; Turan, Sifa","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",586,16

METHODS Non-reinforced and laser safe ETTs were suspended in a mechanical model imitating endoscopic airway surgery. A CO2 laser set at 5-30 watts was fired at the ETT at oxygen concentrations ranging from 21% to 88%. The process was repeated using a radiofrequency ablation (RFA) device. All trials were repeated to ensure accuracy. RESULTS The CO2 laser ignited a fire when contacting a non-reinforced ETT in under 2 seconds at oxygen concentrations as low as 44%. The CO2 laser could not ignite a laser safe ETT under any conditions, unless it struck the non-reinforced distal tip of the ETT. With the RFA, a fire could not be ignited with either reinforced or non-reinforced ETTs. CONCLUSIONS RFA presents no risk of ignition in simulated airway surgery. CO2 lasers should be utilized with a reinforced ETT or no ETT, as fires can easily ignite when lasers strike a non-reinforced ETT. Decreasing the fraction of inspired oxygen reduces the risk of fire.","Roy, Soham; Smith, Lee P",American journal of otolaryngology,586,1

Many guidelines have been developed for treating children with COVID-19. The quality of the existing guidelines and the consistency of recommendations remains unknown. Therefore, we aim to review the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for children with COVID-19 systematically. Methods We systematically searched Medline, Embase, guideline-related websites, and Google. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool and Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in HealThcare (RIGHT) checklist were used to evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of the included guidelines, respectively. The consistency of recommendations across the guidelines and their supporting evidence were analyzed. Results Twenty guidelines were included in this study. The mean AGREE II score and mean RIGHT reporting rate of the included guidelines were 37% (range, 22-62%) and 52% (range, 31-89%), respectively. As for methodological quality, no guideline was classified as high, one guideline (5%) moderate, and 19 (95%) low. In terms of reporting quality, one guideline (5%) was rated as high, 12 guidelines (60%) moderate, and seven (35%) low. Among included guidelines, recommendations varied greatly in the use of remdesivir (recommend: 25%, not recommend: 45%, not report: 30%), interferon (recommend: 15%, not recommend: 50%, not report: 35%), glucocorticoids (recommend: 50%, not recommend: 20%, not report: 30%), and intravenous immune globulin (recommend: 35%, not recommend: 30%, not report: 35%). None of the guidelines cited clinical trials from children with COVID-19. Conclusions The methodological and reporting quality of guidelines for treating children with COVID-19 was not high. Recommendations were inconsistent across different guidelines. The supporting evidence from children with COVID-19 was very limited.","Li, Qinyuan; Zhou, Qi; Xun, Yangqin; Liu, Hui; Shi, Qianling; Wang, Zijun; Zhao, Siya; Liu, Xiao; Liu, Enmei; Fu, Zhou; Chen, Yaolong; Luo, Zhengxiu",Annals of translational medicine,586,1

METHODS A retrospective review of patients with chronic bucket-handle medial meniscal tears that had been repaired with meniscal sutures was undertaken. The following criteria for inclusion were adopted: minimum tear length of 2 cm and chronic medial meniscal tear identified at the time of arthroscopy. The tears were susceptible to dislocation with probing. Data collected included demographic, clinical, radiologic, and surgical data. Postoperative healing was assessed with the clinical criteria of Barrett et al. The International Knee Documentation Committee rating, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level were determined, and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate healing in accordance with the criteria of Henning et al. RESULTS Twenty-four patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean time from injury to surgery was 10 months (range, 2 to 60 months). Sixteen patients underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 1 patient underwent posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and 6 patients underwent meniscus repair only. A median of 5 sutures (range, 3 to 6 sutures) were used for repair. Four cases (all of which had undergone meniscus repair only) required revision. Complete healing was achieved in 83% of cases according to the criteria of Barrett et al. The mean follow-up time was 48 months (range, 24 to 112 months). An International Knee Documentation Committee rating of A or B was achieved in the 20 patients who did not require revision. The median Lysholm score was 95 (range, 92 to 100). The median Tegner activity level before injury was 7, and it remained unchanged after surgery in all cases. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that repair of chronic bucket-handle meniscal tears can lead to good clinical outcomes and a relatively low (17%) failure rate. In addition, repairs of isolated meniscal tears had a significantly higher risk of failure than repairs performed in conjunction with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Higher INR targets are often used in Western compared with East Asian countries. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence for the efficacy and safety of lower versus higher INR targets in Western and East Asian left-sided mechanical heart valve patients. We searched Western databases including Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline, and Embase as well as Chinese databases including SinoMed, CNKI, and Wanfang Data in addition to grey literature for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and observational studies. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) using random-effects model. Low and high INR targets were defined by the individual studies. We identified nine RCTs, including six Western (n = 5496) and three East Asian (n = 209) trials, and 17 observational studies, including two Western (n = 3199) and 15 East Asian (n = 5485) studies. In the RCTs, lower compared with higher targets were associated with similar rates of thromboembolism (2.4 vs. 2.3%; RR: 1.14, 95% CI 0.82, 1.60, I2 = 0%) and lower rates of both total bleeding (21.9 vs. 40.9%, RR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28, 0.78, I2 = 88%) and major bleeding. RCT data showed no statistical heterogeneity by region. These effects were consistent in the observational data. We downgraded the quality of evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. In patients with left-sided contemporary mechanical heart valves, low quality evidence suggests lower INR targets are associated with similar rates of thromboembolism and moderate quality evidence suggests lower rates of bleeding.","Pandey, Arjun K; Xu, Ke; Zhang, Li; Gupta, Saurabh; Eikelboom, John; Lopes, Renato D; Crowther, Mark; Belley-Côté, Emilie P; Whitlock, Richard P",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,586,17

This study aimed to examine differences in rates and types of pharmacist interventions related to COVID-19 and medication dispensing errors (MDEs) across community pharmacies with and without telepharmacy services. METHODS This was a prospective, disguised, observational study conducted over four months (from March 2020 to July 2020) in 52 community pharmacies (26 with and 26 without telepharmacy) across all seven states of the United Arab Emirates using proportionate random sampling. A standardised data-collection form was developed to include information about patient status, pharmacist interventions and MDEs. RESULTS The test (telepharmacy) group pharmacies provided pharmaceutical care to 19,974 patients, of whom 6371 (31.90%) and 1213 (6.07%) were probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19, respectively. The control group pharmacies provided care to 9151 patients, of whom 1074 (11.74%) and 33 (0.36%) were probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19, respectively. Rates of MDEs and their subcategories, prescription-related errors and pharmacist counselling errors across pharmacies with telepharmacy versus those without remote services were 15.81% versus 19.43% (p < 0.05), 5.38% versus 10.08% (p < 0.05) and 10.42% versus 9.35% (p > 0.05), respectively.

Guidelines recommend that DVT prophylaxis should be guided by an assessment of the individual patient's risk. The authors aimed to develop and test models to predict DVT risk. METHODS The Clots in Legs Or sTockings after Stroke (CLOTS) Trial 1 randomised 2518 immobile patients with acute stroke to thigh-length graduated compression stockings (GCS) or no GCS and CLOTS Trial 2 randomised 3114 to thigh-length or below-knee GCS. The authors collected potential predictive variables at baseline and detected DVTs with compression duplex ultrasound scans at about 7-10 days and 25-30 days. The authors developed models with logistic regression to predict DVT in 1242 Trial 2 patients who had two scans and tested the models in the 1422 Trial 1 patients with two scans by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS 168 (11.8%) patients in Trial 1 and 122 (9.8%) in Trial 2 had proximal DVTs. A model based on the Trial 2 cohort contained four of the 12 baseline variables: dependent before stroke (OR=3.62, 95% CI 2.15 to 6.08), unable to lift arms off bed (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.90), history of DVT/pulmonary embolism (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.98 to 6.88) and diabetes (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99). The AUC in the development cohort was 0.65 but only 0.57, 95% CI (0.53 to 0.61) in the Trial 1 cohort, indicating poor discrimination. CONCLUSIONS Unfortunately, models based on clinical factors alone discriminate poorly between immobile patients with stroke at high and low risk, and would not facilitate individual tailoring of DVT prophylaxis strategies.","Dennis, Martin; Sandercock, Peter; Reid, John; Graham, Catriona; Murray, Gordon; Venables, Graham; Rudd, Anthony; Bowler, Gill","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",586,19

The healing process of bone fractures is greatly dependent on infiltrated macrophages. The macrophages are categorized into M1 or M2 phenotypes with different functions. This study is aimed to address the potential role of subtypes of macrophages in the process of fracture healing in patients with TBI. METHODS Twenty-five cases of clavicle fracture alone (CF group) and 22 cases of clavicle fracture concomitant with TBI (CFT group) were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Callus tissues were harvested during operations. The expressions of COX-2, CD206, and CD68 were measured with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS The percentages of M2 macrophages in total macrophages increased after bone fracture in both groups, while the percentages of M1-type macrophages are decreased. Interestingly, the increased percentages of M2 macrophages are significantly higher in CFT group than in CF group. Compared to CF group, the fracture callus volume was much larger (21.9 vs 8.5 cm3) and the fracture healing time was much shorter (82.2 vs 127.0 days) in CFT group. The percentage of M2 macrophages was negatively correlated with fracture healing time in patients (r = - 0.575, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that the percentages of M2 macrophages in callus tissues increased dramatically during the repairing stage in both CF and CFT group. Percentages of M2 macrophages are associated with accelerated fracture healing in patients with TBI. M2 macrophage polarization during the stage of bone regeneration may play a vital role in promoting bone fracture healing.","Zhang, Ran; Liang, Yi; Wei, Shuxiang",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,586,1

Models estimate that without intervention, over the next 50 years 12.2 million new cases of cervical cancer will occur, nearly 60% of which are preventable only through CSM. Given that more than 80% of the cervical cancer occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), scaling up sustainable CSM programs in these countries is a top priority for achieving the global elimination goals. Multiple technologies have been developed and validated to meet this need. Now it is critical to identify strategies to implement these technologies into complex, adaptive health care delivery systems. As part of the coordinated cervical cancer elimination effort, we applied a systems thinking lens to reflect on our experiences with implementation of HPV-based CSM programs using the WHO health systems framework. While many common health system barriers were identified, the effectiveness of implementation strategies to address them was context dependent; often reflecting differences in stakeholder's belief in the quality of the evidence supporting a CSM algorithm, the appropriateness of the evidence and algorithm to context, and the 'implementability' of the algorithm under realistic assessments of resource availability and constraints. A structured planning process, with early and broad stakeholder engagement, will ensure that shared-decisions in CSM implementation are appropriately aligned with the culture, values, and resource realities of the setting.","Gravitt, Patti E; Silver, Michelle I; Hussey, Heather M; Arrossi, Silvina; Huchko, Megan; Jeronimo, Jose; Kapambwe, Sharon; Kumar, Somesh; Meza, Graciela; Nervi, Laura; Paz-Soldan, Valerie A; Woo, Yin Ling",Preventive medicine,586,16

We aimed to explore the interrelationship between the clinical and epidemiological factors that characterize rotavirus hospitalizations in Spain using information from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS). Using ICD-9-CM codes, we classified acute gastroenteritis (AGE) cases by principal diagnosis fields and then categorized their comorbidities, complications, and epidemiological features by secondary fields. A multivariable, logistic, step-wise regression model was then constructed. We identified 1657 ARGE cases from 17 415 cases of AGE. Rotavirus hospitalizations were associated with place of residence, age, and season (P < 0·0001), as well as with dehydration [odds ratio (OR) 12·44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·52-40·38], intravenous rehydration (OR 1·74, 95% CI 1·29-2·35), metabolic acidosis (OR 1·51, 95% CI 1·24-1·83), respiratory tract infections (RTIs) (OR 1·60, 95% CI 1·09-1·98), and concomitant AGE (OR 1·52, 95% CI 1·03-2·25).

This knowledge but also the many uncertainties concerning coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in particular with respect to the level of contagiousness of different samples sent to pathology and biology laboratories, rapidly effected the collection for translational research projects, notably of samples from patients with thoracic cancers. However, it is still difficult to evaluate the current and the near impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this domain. It is essential in this context to be reminded of good practice for the management of biological samples for research, notably concerning the biosafety and security procedures. Moreover, new recommendations concerning the traceability and use of human lung cancer samples from tissue and different biofluids may rapidly be issued in the near future. This review aims to discuss the new challenges and constraints encountered by pathologists, biobankers and researchers within the framework of collection and the use of samples from patients with lung cancer for research while taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hofman, Paul",Translational lung cancer research,586,2

We evaluated the role of dexmedetomidine and magnesium sulphate on pressor responses to laryngoscopy and intubation as compared to placebo, when depth of anaesthesia was maintained at a constant bispectral index (BIS) range 40-50 (±5). Methods One hundred and twenty patients were randomised to receive either dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg (Group DS), magnesium sulphate 30 mg/kg diluted in 100 ml saline (Group MS) or 100 ml normal saline (Group NS) 15 min before induction of anaesthesia in a double blind manner. After achieving BIS 40-50 (±5), laryngoscopy and intubation were performed. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were recorded pre-drug, after drug, at intubation, at intervals of 1 min till 5 min, then every 2 min till 10 min and every 10 min for 30 min. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test and one way analysis of variance. Results SBP, DBP and HR fell in the DS and MS groups. No significant changes in BP were seen in the NS group at induction and after intubation. HR rose in the NS group (P < 0.001) at induction from 86.35 ± 9.05 to 95.35 ± 11.60 at 2 min. Patients in DS and MS groups had significantly lower HR, SBP and DBP at laryngoscopy and intubation. Conclusion At BIS levels 40-50 (±5) there was no pressor response to intubation in the NS Group.

A patient representative participated in all aspects of this project. DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL (Inception -2017). STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting primary research studies on building the capacity of hospitalised adult patients to participate in care which described or included one or more structured or systematic interventions and described the outcomes for at least the key stakeholder group were included. DATA EXTRACTION Title and abstract screening and full text screening were conducted by pairs of trained reviewers. One reviewer extracted data, which were verified by a second reviewer. Interventions were classified according to seven aspects of care relevant to hospital settings. BCTs identified in the articles were assigned through consensus of three reviewers. RESULTS Database searches yielded a total 9899 articles, resulting in 87 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Interventions directed at building patient capacity to participate in care while hospitalised were categorised as those related to improving: patient safety (20.9%); care coordination (5.7%); effective treatment (5.7%) and/or patient-centred care using: bedside nursing handovers (5.7%); communication (29.1%); care planning (14%) or the care environment (19.8%). The majority of studies reported one or more positive outcomes from the defined intervention. Adding new elements (objects) to the environment and restructuring the social and/or physical environment were the most frequently identified BCTs. CONCLUSIONS The majority of studies to build capacity for participation in care report one or more positive outcomes, although a more comprehensive analysis is warranted.","Goodridge, Donna; McDonald, Meghan; New, Lucia; Scharf, Murray; Harrison, Elizabeth; Rotter, Thomas; Watson, Erin; Henry, Chrysanthus; Penz, Erika D",BMJ open,586,19

Cell delivery using injectable biomaterial carriers offers promise to restore disc height and biomechanical function, while providing a functional niche for delivered cells to repair degenerated tissues. This systematic review advances the injectable IVD cell delivery biomaterials field by characterising its current state and identifying themes of promising strategies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to screen the literature and 183 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. Cellular and biomaterial inputs, and biological and biomechanical outcomes were extracted from each study. Most identified studies targeted nucleus pulposus (NP) repair. No consensus exists on cell type or biomaterial carrier, yet most common strategies used mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) delivery with interpenetrating network/co-polymeric (IPN/CoP) biomaterials composed of natural biomaterials. All studies reported biological outcomes with about half the studies reporting biomechanical outcomes. Since the IVD is a load-bearing tissue, studies reporting compressive and shear moduli were analysed and two major themes were found. First, a competitive balance, or 'seesaw' effect, between biomechanical and biological performance was observed. Formulations with higher moduli had inferior cellular performance, and vice versa. Second, several low-modulus biomaterials had favourable biological performance and matured throughout culture duration with enhanced extracellular matrix synthesis and biomechanical moduli. Findings identify an opportunity to develop next-generation biomaterials that provide high initial biomechanical competence to stabilise and repair damaged IVDs with a capacity to promote cell function for long-term healing.","Panebianco, C J; Meyers, J H; Gansau, J; Hom, W W; Iatridis, J C",European cells & materials,586,1

Launched on September 15, 2018, ELFIN is expected to have a >2.5 year lifetime. Its primary science objective is to resolve the mechanism of storm-time relativistic electron precipitation, for which electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are a prime candidate. From its ionospheric vantage point, ELFIN uses its unique pitch-angle-resolving capability to determine whether measured relativistic electron pitch-angle and energy spectra within the loss cone bear the characteristic signatures of scattering by EMIC waves or whether such scattering may be due to other processes. Pairing identical ELFIN satellites with slowly-variable along-track separation allows disambiguation of spatial and temporal evolution of the precipitation over minutes-to-tens-of-minutes timescales, faster than the orbit period of a single low-altitude satellite (Torbit ∼ 90 min). Each satellite carries an energetic particle detector for electrons (EPDE) that measures 50 keV to 5 MeV electrons with Δ E/E < 40% and a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) on a ∼72 cm boom that measures magnetic field waves (e.g., EMIC waves) in the range from DC to 5 Hz Nyquist (nominally) with <0.3 nT/sqrt(Hz) noise at 1 Hz. The spinning satellites (Tspin ∼ 3 s) are equipped with magnetorquers (air coils) that permit spin-up or -down and reorientation maneuvers. Using those, the spin axis is placed normal to the orbit plane (nominally), allowing full pitch-angle resolution twice per spin. An energetic particle detector for ions (EPDI) measures 250 keV - 5 MeV ions, addressing secondary science. Funded initially by CalSpace and the University Nanosat Program, ELFIN was selected for flight with joint support from NSF and NASA between 2014 and 2018 and launched by the ELaNa XVIII program on a Delta II rocket (with IceSatII as the primary). Mission operations are currently funded by NASA. Working under experienced UCLA mentors, with advice from The Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel, more than 250 undergraduates have matured the ELFIN implementation strategy; developed the instruments, satellite, and ground systems and operate the two satellites. ELFIN's already high potential for cutting-edge science return is compounded by concurrent equatorial Heliophysics missions (THEMIS, Arase, Van Allen Probes, MMS) and ground stations. ELFIN's integrated data analysis approach, rapid dissemination strategies via the SPace Environment Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), and data coordination with the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO) optimize science yield, enabling the widest community benefits. Several storm-time events have already been captured and are presented herein to demonstrate ELFIN's data analysis methods and potential. These form the basis of on-going studies to resolve the primary mission science objective. Broad energy precipitation events, precipitation bands, and microbursts, clearly seen both at dawn and dusk, extend from tens of keV to >1 MeV. This broad energy range of precipitation indicates that multiple waves are providing scattering concurrently. Many observed events show significant backscattered fluxes, which in the past were hard to resolve by equatorial spacecraft or non-pitch-angle-resolving ionospheric missions. These observations suggest that the ionosphere plays a significant role in modifying magnetospheric electron fluxes and wave-particle interactions. Routine data captures starting in February 2020 and lasting for at least another year, approximately the remainder of the mission lifetime, are expected to provide a very rich dataset to address questions even beyond the primary mission science objective.","Angelopoulos, V; Tsai, E; Bingley, L; Shaffer, C; Turner, D L; Runov, A; Li, W; Liu, J; Artemyev, A V; Zhang, X-J; Strangeway, R J; Wirz, R E; Shprits, Y Y; Sergeev, V A; Caron, R P; Chung, M; Cruce, P; Greer, W; Grimes, E; Hector, K; Lawson, M J; Leneman, D; Masongsong, E V; Russell, C L; Wilkins, C; Hinkley, D; Blake, J B; Adair, N; Allen, M; Anderson, M; Arreola-Zamora, M; Artinger, J; Asher, J; Branchevsky, D; Capitelli, M R; Castro, R; Chao, G; Chung, N; Cliffe, M; Colton, K; Costello, C; Depe, D; Domae, B W; Eldin, S; Fitzgibbon, L; Flemming, A; Fox, I; Frederick, D M; Gilbert, A; Gildemeister, A; Gonzalez, A; Hesford, B; Jha, S; Kang, N; King, J; Krieger, R; Lian, K; Mao, J; McKinney, E; Miller, J P; Norris, A; Nuesca, M; Palla, A; Park, E S Y; Pedersen, C E; Qu, Z; Rozario, R; Rye, E; Seaton, R; Subramanian, A; Sundin, S R; Tan, A; Turner, W; Villegas, A J; Wasden, M; Wing, G; Wong, C; Xie, E; Yamamoto, S; Yap, R; Zarifian, A; Zhang, G Y",Space science reviews,586,1

Additionally, we aim to generate insights into the drivers of cost variability within one medical domain. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a retrospective study at a breast clinic in Belgium. We used 14 anonymous patient files for conducting our analysis. RESULTS Significant cost variations within each molecular subtype and across molecular subtypes were found. For the luminal A classification, the cost differential amounts to roughly 166%, with the greatest treatment cost amounting to US$29 780 relative to US$11 208 for a patient requiring fewer medical activities. The major driver for these cost variations relates to disease characteristics. For the luminal B classification, a cost difference of roughly 242% exists due to both disease-related and patient-related factors. The average treatment cost for triple negative patients amounted to US$26 923, this is considered to be a more aggressive type of cancer. The overall cost for HER2-enriched is driven by the inclusion of Herceptin, thus this subtype is impacted by disease characteristics. Cost variability across molecular classifications is impacted by the severity of the disease, thus disease-related factors are the major drivers of cost. CONCLUSIONS Given the cost challenge in healthcare, the need for greater cost transparency has become imperative. Through our analysis, we generate initial insights into the drivers of cost variability for breast cancer. We found evidence that disease characteristics such as severity and more aggressive cancer forms such as HER2-enriched and triple negative have a significant impact on treatment cost across the different subtypes. Similarly, patient factors such as age and presence of gene mutation contribute to differences in treatment cost variability within molecular subtypes.","Roman, Erin; Cardoen, Brecht; Decloedt, Jan; Roodhooft, Filip",BMJ open,586,1

As surgical technique has evolved, together with the adoption of enhanced recovery after surgery pathways, the routine insertion of feeding jejunostomy tubes appears to be changing. MATERIALS AND METHODS A survey was constructed using Google Forms. The link was distributed to consultant upper gastrointestinal surgeons via the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons' membership database. Results were collated and analysed using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS A total of 55 responses were received from 28 units across the UK; 27 respondents (49.1%) no longer routinely use feeding jejunostomy in upper gastrointestinal resections, oesophagectomy or gastrectomy. The most common primary feeding modality used by these respondents was oral diet 17 (65.4%), with total parenteral nutrition (19.2%) and nasojejunal (11.5%) routes also being used. Respondents who used feeding jejunostomies inserted them primarily for oesophagectomy (n = 27; 96.4%), with fewer surgeons using them in extended total gastrectomy (n = 12; 42.9%) and total gastrectomy (n = 11; 39.3%). Of the total, 20 surgeons (71.4%) would insert the jejunostomy using an open approach, with 19 (67.9%) employing a Witzel tunnel. Eleven respondents (39.3%) would continue feeding via the jejunostomy after discharge. Some 24 responders thought that feeding jejunostomies did not facilitate the enhanced recovery after surgery pathway (strongly and slightly disagree), whereas 17 considered that they did (strongly and slightly agree); 13 responders did not have strong views either way. CONCLUSIONS There is a split in current practice regarding the usage of feeding jejunostomies. There is also a division of opinion on the role of feeding jejunostomy in enhanced recovery after surgery.","Ireland, P; Jaunoo, S",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,586,33

This paper aims to describe the situation of road traffic crashes and casualties during the period of complete lockdown. Methods: This study used secondary data from two sources: Nepal Police and media reports between 24 March and 14 June 2020 (because the government lifted the nationwide lockdown from 15 June 2020). Available details of crashes, deaths, and injuries for this period were extracted from media reports and the summary data that was obtained from the Police. We have included data from both sources in the results. Results: Nepal Police recorded 1,801 incidents of road crashes during the 82 days of the COVID-19 lockdown with 256 deaths (on average 3.1 deaths daily) and 1,824 injuries (on average 22.2 injuries daily). Motorcycles comprised over 21% of all vehicles involved in crashes. Ambulances and other vehicles for essential services were also found to be involved in crashes. Speeding itself was the cause for almost a quarter of the incidents during the lockdown. Conclusions: Although a reduction in the number of road crashes and related injuries and fatalities was observed, this reduction was not as substantial as anticipated during the heavy restrictions on vehicular movement imposed during the lockdown. Media reports were mainly found to be reporting the crashes where deaths occurred, but police records also included nonfatal injuries. The incidence of crashes in this period shows that it is important to work for road safety to save lives from road traffic crashes in Nepal.","Sedain, Bhagabati; Pant, Puspa Raj",F1000Research,586,0

The use of nucleoside-modified mRNA as a pharmacological agent opens immense opportunities for therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic molecular interventions. In particular, mRNA-based drugs may specifically modulate immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, for immunotherapy of oncologic, infectious and other conditions. The key challenge, however, is that T cells are notoriously resistant to transfection by exogenous mRNA. Here, we report that conjugating CD4 antibody to LNPs enables specific targeting and mRNA interventions to CD4+ cells, including T cells. After systemic injection in mice, CD4-targeted radiolabeled mRNA-LNPs accumulated in spleen, providing ∼30-fold higher signal of reporter mRNA in T cells isolated from spleen as compared with non-targeted mRNA-LNP. Intravenous injection of CD4-targeted LNP loaded by Cre recombinase-encoding mRNA provided specific dose-dependent loxP-mediated genetic recombination, resulting in reporter gene expression in about 60% and 40% of CD4+ T cells in spleen and lymph nodes, respectively. T cell phenotyping showed uniform transfection of T cell subpopulations, with no variability in uptake of CD4-targeted mRNA-LNP in naive, central memory, and effector cells. The specific and efficient targeting and transfection of mRNA to T cells established in this study provides a platform technology for immunotherapy of devastating conditions and HIV cure.","Tombácz, István; Laczkó, Dorottya; Shahnawaz, Hamna; Muramatsu, Hiromi; Natesan, Ambika; Yadegari, Amir; Papp, Tyler E; Alameh, Mohamad-Gabriel; Shuvaev, Vladimir; Mui, Barbara L; Tam, Ying K; Muzykantov, Vladimir; Pardi, Norbert; Weissman, Drew; Parhiz, Hamideh",Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,586,1

Defining QOL in pediatric CMT can help physicians monitor disease burden clinically and in trials. We identified items pertaining to QOL in children with CMT and conducted validation studies to develop a pediatric CMT-specific QOL outcome measure (pCMT-QOL). METHODS Development and validation of the pCMT-QOL patient-reported outcome measure was iterative, involving identifying relevant domains, item pool generation, prospective pilot testing and clinical assessments, structured focus-group interviews, and psychometric testing. Testing was conducted in children with CMT seen at participating sites from the USA, United Kingdom, and Australia. RESULTS We conducted systematic literature reviews and analysis of generic QOL measures to identify six domains relevant to QOL in children with CMT. 60 items corresponding to those domains were developed de novo, or identified from literature review and CMT-specific modification of items from the pediatric Neuro-QOL measures. The draft version underwent prospective feasibility and face content validity assessments to develop a working version of the pCMT-QOL measure. From 2010-2016, the pCMT-QOL working version was administered to 398 children ages 8-18 seen at the participating study sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium. The resulting data underwent rigorous psychometric analysis, including factor analysis, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, IRT analysis, and longitudinal analysis, to develop the final pCMT-QOL patient-reported outcome measure. INTERPRETATION The pCMT-QOL patient-reported outcome measure is a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of health-related QOL for children with CMT. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of this trial was to compare colon J pouch (CJP) with transverse coloplasty pouch (TCP) reconstruction with regard to functional results, perioperative mortality and morbidity. As there is considerable uncertainty over the true anastomotic leak rate in patients with a TCP, the study analysed short-term outcome data. METHODS Elective patients suitable for either procedure after sphincter-saving low anterior resection were eligible. Randomization took place during surgery. The primary endpoint was the rate of late evacuation problems after 2 years; secondary endpoints were anastomotic leak rate, perioperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Between 21 October 2002 and 5 December 2005, 149 patients were randomized. All 76 patients randomized to TCP had the procedure compared with 68 of the 73 patients (93 percent) randomized to CJP. Both groups were comparable with regard to demographic and clinical characteristics. Surgical complications (CJP: 19 percent; TCP: 18 percent) and the overall anastomotic leak rate (8 percent) were equally distributed in both groups. CONCLUSION This trial demonstrated a comparable early outcome for TCP and CJP. This contradicts previous reports suggesting a higher leak rate after TCP.

Obesity surgery seems to offer solutions for both. The objective of this study was to show the effect of obesity surgery on the diabetic profile. METHODS Data on obesity surgery in Germany (2005-2011) were collected from the Institute of Quality Assurance at the research university. Follow-up of the diabetic profile at 1, 2, and up to 6 years after surgery was done. RESULTS Among 17,670 patients, 5,506 (31.2%) were diabetics. Follow-up was accomplished in 87.4%, 82.5%, and 68.9% of eligible patients at 1, 2, and up to 6 years, respectively, after surgery. Of the study participants, 38.2% were insulin-treated (IT) patients and 61.8% were noninsulin-treated patients (NIT). Of the patients' procedures, 2878 (52.3%) Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses (RYGB), 1711 (31.1%) sleeve gastrectomies (SG), 679 (12.3%) laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands (LAGB), 165 (3%) biliopancreatic diversions with duodenal switch (BPD/DS), and 68 (1.3%) biliopancreatic diversions (BPD) were performed. Female gender percentage and mean body mass index (BMI) were significantly higher in the RYGB and LAGB groups. Mean age was significantly higher in BPD/DS group. At 1 year, remission/improvement (RI) percentage was 83.5%, 82.5%, 67.8%, 93.4%, and 84.8% after RYGB, SG, LAGB, BPD, and BPD/DS, respectively. At 2 years, RI% was 84.9%, 79.5%, 67.7%, 94.5%, and 90.9% after RYGB, SG, LAGB, BPD, and BPD/DS, respectively. At late follow-up, RI% was 83.2%, 59.5%, 58.9%, 100%, and 86.4% after RYGB, SG, LAGB, BPD, and BPD/DS, respectively. IT patients showed insignificantly higher RI% than NIT patients at all follow-up points. Malabsorptive procedures (RYGB, BPD, and BPD/DS) showed a significantly higher RI% than restrictive procedures (LAGB and SG) at late follow-up. CONCLUSION Obesity surgery has promising antidiabetic efficacy, especially in IT patients.

Secondary objectives were to identify patients who were upset with the postponement of their PFD procedures and to identify factors that are associated with being upset because of the delay in care. METHODS This was a cross-sectional, survey-based study of women from a single urban, academic practice using a novel questionnaire. The study cohort included women whose PFD surgeries or office procedures were postponed between March 17 and April 30, 2020. RESULTS Ninety-eight women had surgeries postponed; 68 (70%) responded to our questionnaire. Nearly half of the respondents (32/68, 47.1%) were upset about their procedures being postponed. Upset patients reported a greater impact of PFD symptoms on their mood than those who were not upset (P = 0.002). Those who were upset were also more likely to report feelings of isolation (P = 0.006), fear that their PFD would worsen because of delayed care (P < 0.001), and anxiety over surgery postponement (P < 0.001) than those who were not upset about the delays. When controlling for anxiety, social isolation, and impact of PFD symptom, anxiety (adjusted odds ratio = 15.7; 95% confidence interval = 3.7-66.6) and feeling of isolation (adjusted odds ratio = 9.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-63.7) remained associated with increased odds of being upset because of procedure delays.

The aim of this systematic review was to assemble available data regarding the oral and gut microbiota in pSS and to compare them to data from healthy individuals and patients with dry symptoms without a diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome or lupus disease to identify dysbiosis and discuss the results. Methodology Using the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed studies that compared the oral and gut microbiota of Sjögren's patients and controls. The PubMed database and Google Scholar were searched. Results Two-hundred and eighty-nine studies were found, and 18 studies were included: 13 referred to the oral microbiota, 4 referred to the gut microbiota, and 1 referred to both anatomical sites. The most frequent controls were healthy volunteers and patients with sicca symptoms. The most common analysis method used was 16S-targeted metagenomics. The results were mostly heterogeneous, and the results regarding diversity were not always in accordance. Dysbiosis in pSS was not confirmed, and reduced salivary secretion seems to explain more microbial changes than the underlying disease. Conclusion These heterogeneous results might be explained by the lack of a standardized methodology at each step of the process and highlight the need for guidelines. Our review provides evidence that sicca patients seem to be more relevant than healthy subjects as a control group.","Doaré, Elise; Héry-Arnaud, Geneviève; Devauchelle-Pensec, Valérie; Alegria, Guillermo Carvajal",Frontiers in immunology,586,31

In the tropics, understanding the drivers of these changes can be difficult due to a lack of documented legacy conditions or continuous monitoring that can distinguish between intra- and inter-annual variation. Over the last forty years (1980-2020), Lake Yojoa, located in Honduras, has shifted from an oligotrophic to mesotrophic ecosystem as evidenced by a loss of water clarity. To assess the changes that have occurred in Lake Yojoa as well as putative drivers for those changes, we compared Secchi depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations at bimonthly intervals for the three years between 1979-1983 and again at 16-day intervals for the two most recent years (2018-2020). While we found little change in TP between legacy and contemporary data, we found concurrent changes to seasonal trends in Secchi depth and DIN. Seasonal peaks in DIN coincident with mixing suggest that accumulation of ammonium in the hypolimnion during stratification, and release to the epilimnion with mixing maintains algal abundance in what was previously a nutrient-limited, clear water phase, driving a change in the overall trophic state. This interaction of seasonal dynamics with trophic state illustrates a key phenomenon in how physical structure and nutrients interact in monomictic tropical lakes and highlights the importance of warm anoxic hypolimnions to the biogeochemistry that governs the trophic state of these societally important ecosystems.","Fadum, Jemma M.; Hall, Ed K.",bioRxiv,586,13

The coronavirus outbreak of December 2019 has already infected millions all over the world and continues to spread on. Just when the curve of the outbreak had started to flatten, many countries have again started to witness a rise in cases which is now being referred as the 2nd wave of the pandemic. A thorough analysis of time-series forecasting models is therefore required to equip state authorities and health officials with immediate strategies for future times. This aims of the study are three-fold: (a) To model the overall trend of the spread; (b) To generate a short-term forecast of 10 days in countries with the highest incidence of confirmed cases (USA, India and Brazil); (c) To quantitatively determine the algorithm that is best suited for precise modelling of the linear and non-linear features of the time series. The comparison of forecasting models for the total cumulative cases of each country is carried out by comparing the reported data and the predicted value, and then ranking the algorithms (Prophet, Holt-Winters, LSTM, ARIMA, and ARIMA-NARNN) based on their RMSE, MAE and MAPE values. The hybrid combination of ARIMA and NARNN (Nonlinear Auto-Regression Neural Network) gave the best result among the selected models with a reduced RMSE, which proved to be almost 35.3% better than one of the most prevalent method of time-series prediction (ARIMA). The results demonstrated the efficacy of the hybrid implementation of the ARIMA-NARNN model over other forecasting methods such as Prophet, Holt Winters, LSTM, and the ARIMA model in encapsulating the linear as well as non-linear patterns of the epidemical datasets.","Prajapati, Samyak; Swaraj, Aman; Lalwani, Ronak; Narwal, Akhil; Verma, Karan; Singh, Ghanshyam; Kumar, Ashok",,586,1

This crisis has highlighted two important aspects: 1) the healthcare systems are not designed to deal with such a major health challenge and 2) the older people represent the social categories most exposed to this virus. In this pandemic context, the current need for additional resources in the field of healthcare overlapped a pre-existing challenge of healthcare systems, manifested as a permanent increase in the incidence of chronic diseases related to lifestyle changes and ageing population. This situation proved both the current vulnerabilities and the need for new capabilities. In this respect, the required services are based on smart technology, available nearby or at home, which can provide a continuous self and autonomous care. Consequently, the challenge is to develop these technologies, integrating them in a reliable care product, in order to facilitate the shifting from overloaded hospitals to outpatient settings. Therefore, the pandemic impact can be mitigated by a new model of user centred medical ecosystem focused on the need for protection, prevention and assisting home care of the older people by integrating new digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data, cloud computing or blockchain). For this purpose, a simplified approach of a proposed future ecosystem of digital services is described below, representing a potential elderly-centred digital solution that can lead in any other future pandemic context to better preventive measures for the community, earlier diagnosis and faster treatment resolution for the patient. © 2021 IEEE.","Marinescu, I.

The traditional single method process may not ensure the selection of relevant features. The selections of features are susceptible to the changes in input data, and thus fail to perform consistently. These challenges can be overcome by having a robust feature selection algorithm that generates a subset of original features and evaluates the candidate set to check for its relevance. Also, it determines the feasibility of the selected subset of features. The fundamental tasks of selecting feature subset minimize the complexity of the model and help to facilitate the further processing of the model. The limitations of using single feature selection technique can be reduced by combining multiple techniques to generate the effective features. There is a need to design efficient approaches and technique for estimating the feature relevance. This ensemble approach will help to include diversity at input data level, as well as the computational technique. The proposed method—Ensemble Bootstrap Genetic Algorithm (EnBGA)—generates the effective feature subset for the multi-source heterogeneous data.

PBs of data is continuously being collected from the end users such as Uber drivers, riders, restaurants, eaters and so on everyday. There is a lot of valuable information to be processed and many decisions must be made in seconds for a variety of use cases such as customer incentives, fraud detection, machine learning model prediction. In addition, there is an increasing need to expose this ability to different user categories, including engineers, data scientists, executives and operations personnel which adds to the complexity. In this paper, we present the overall architecture of the real-time data infrastructure and identify three scaling challenges that we need to continuously address for each component in the architecture. At Uber, we heavily rely on open source technologies for the key areas of the infrastructure. On top of those open-source software, we add significant improvements and customizations to make the open-source solutions fit in Uber's environment and bridge the gaps to meet Uber's unique scale and requirements. We then highlight several important use cases and show their real-time solutions and tradeoffs. Finally, we reflect on the lessons we learned as we built, operated and scaled these systems.","Fu, Yupeng; Soman, Chinmay",,586,1

This compound has remarkable potential pharmacological properties, including being anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, anticonvulsant, antidepressant, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective. Recent studies have reported piperine activity as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2, which caused COVID-19. Nevertheless, the clinical use of piperine is still limited, due to its poor water solubility and bioavailability;therefore, various approaches have been developed in order to solve these limitations. This review summarises recent studies (i.e. uploaded to electronic databases in the last 10 y) regarding strategies that have been investigated to improve piperine’s solubility and pharmacokinetic properties, using ‘piperine’, ‘solubility’, ‘bioavailability’, and ‘formulation’ as keywords. Articles that have focused on piperine as the main compound were selected and sorted based on their modification and formulation types. Studies reported various approaches: from derivatives and analogue synthesis, crystal engineering, complexation, particle size reduction (micro-and nanonisation), and lipid-and polymer-based drug delivery systems, to inorganic and hybrid nanoparticles. This review also highlights limitations and challenges for these approaches and encourages further studies to optimise piperine’s potential benefits.","Salsabila, H.; Fitriani, L.; Zaini, E.",International Journal of Applied Pharmaceutics,586,20

Patients often present with generalised symptoms resulting in delays in diagnosis. Complications are common and patients can have long inpatient stays due to intravenous antibiotic requirement. The POET study highlighted non inferiority of oral antibiotic switch in stable patients with left sided IE. The aim of our study is to characterise the IE patient population at our DGH, analyse their management, review adherence of our Endocarditis Team to the ESC 2015 guidelines (figure 1) and to review discharge information and advice, to identify areas for improvement. Methods This was a retrospective study of medical records for patients treated at our DGH with a diagnosis of IE between 1 Oct 2019 and 30 Sep 2020. Demographics, patient characteristics (table 1), IE risk factors, presentation, management, discharge information, patient feedback, and cost analysis was carried out. Adherence of our Endocarditis Team to ESC 2015 guidelines was reviewed. Results Between October 2019 and September 2020, 14 patients were diagnosed with IE according to the Duke Criteria. The median age was 75 (60-89) years and 68.7% of patients were male. 7 patients had a prosthetic valve and 3 had a cardiac device in situ. All patients had CVR risk factors, 50% had T2DM, 36% had renal disease. Only 2 patients had documentation of dental history. The majority of patients (n=12) presented via the Emergency Department. 86% of patients completed a 6-week antibiotic course. Only 14% of patients were managed as outpatients. 21% of patients required surgical management. All patients were reviewed by the Endocarditis Team. All patients were followed up appropriately. Only 1 patient had documented advice regarding dental care. 1 patient died and many patients had complications (figure 2). IE patient support group feedback highlighted concerns regarding delay in diagnosis, challenges of a long inpatient stay and benefits of hearing from other patients about their experiences. Conclusion IE is a rare disease. Documentation of some IE risk factors, and documented discharge advice was poor at our centre. Our Endocarditis Team meet weekly, have a significant input in IE patient management and ensure adequate follow up is arranged for patients. We plan to join an international IE registry. An IE ward round proforma has been created along with a teaching session for staff to improve awareness and understanding of IE. A discharge information pack including information on IE, dental advice and IE and dental warning cards has been created. We plan for a virtual IE support group given current COVID-19 restrictions. We plan to create an outpatient IE treatment pathway with potential for improvement in patient experience and potential for significant cost savings.","Eveson, L.; Nicholson, H.; Patel, A.; MacFarlane, C.; Parker, A.; Garner, D.; Sturridge, L.",Heart,586,1

In this context, researchers are concerned about the effects of inequality on the economy, and this concern is even more marked now, when the world is facing a new crisis that seems the equal of, or even more devastating than the last Great Recession as a consequence of Covid-19. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies which consider the effects of inequality on entrepreneurship. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between inequality and entrepreneurship in the context of an economic downturn. We focus on the 17 autonomous communities in Spain during the Great Recession (2007–2013). Using unbalanced panel data, we study the effect on entrepreneurial activity, differentiating between total, necessity- and opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, our results offer new empirical evidence concerning the relationship between growing inequality and entrepreneurial activity, showing significant differences from results in the existing literature. Second, we explain how, in a recessionary context of highly restricted financial resources, inequality can negatively affect total, necessity- and opportunity-based entrepreneurship, preventing a large part of the population from engaging in this activity.","Sánchez-López, Celia de Paz-Báñez Manuela A.",Sustainability,586,1

The colonization rate of HCWs or the hospital setting that contributes most to MRSA colonization is less clear. In this study, we studied new resident physicians (PGY- 1), as a model for HCWs, to measure their colonization rate and hypothesized that the incidence of colonization would increase during their first year. Methodology We prospectively enrolled PGY-1 residents of multiple specialties at three academic medical centers. After obtaining informed consent, PGY- 1 residents were tested for MRSA in June 2019 before starting any clinical rotations and then retested every three to four months thereafter. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic forced us to end the study early. If MRSA-positive, residents were treated with 2% mupirocin and retested for a cure. For comparison, upper-level residents (PGY-2-5) were also enrolled to obtain a baseline prevalence of colonization. Results We enrolled 80 PGY-1 and 81 PGY-2-5 residents in the study. The baseline prevalence of MRSA colonization was 4.94% (4/81) in PGY-2-5 residents and 2.50% (2/80) for new PGY-1 residents;however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.68). The cumulative yearly incidence of developing MRSA colonization in PGY1 residents was 4.51%. MRSA colonization was successfully treated in 75% of cases. Conclusions PGY-1 residents had a lower MRSA colonization rate compared to PGY-2-5 residents, although this was not statistically significant. PGY-1 residents had a small incidence of developing MRSA colonization while working in the hospital. Further research is needed to determine if this is clinically relevant to HCWs or their patients.","Gutovitz, S.; Hart, L.; Parisio-Poldiak, N.; Smith, M.; Dickson, L.; Warrington, S.; Thacker, S.; Janke, A.",Cureus,586,16

This study aimed to determine effectiveness of reminders using mobile messaging applications (messaging apps) in improving outpatient attendance and medication adherence among patients with depression. METHODS This was a parallel, open-label randomised controlled trial with participants recruited from psychiatric outpatient services of a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur and a secondary hospital in Melaka. Adults (≥18 years) diagnosed with major depressive disorder; capable of reading and understanding English or Bahasa Malaysia; prescribed with at least one antidepressant and owns a smart phone were subsequently randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment reminders (intervention) or standard treatment without reminders (control), using a computergenerated randomisation programme. The intervention group received two reminder categories: Outpatient appointment reminders (a day before appointment); and medication reminders (weekly basis). Participants were followed-up over two months. We utilised Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to measure the severity of depression; and Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS) to assess medication adherence. Primary outcomes were outpatient attendance rates and medication adherence assessed at two months. Secondary outcomes included changes in depression severity within each group at two months; comparison of changes in depression severity between both groups; preferences of participants towards treatment reminders, and reasons for non-attendance among participants. This trial was registered with the National Medical Research Registry, NMRR-19-3466-52001. RESULTS Between February and April 2020, 183 participants were randomised to each group, of whom 179 reached study endpoint (91 [98.9%] of 92 in intervention group and 88 [96.7%] of 91 in control group). All recruited participants (n=183) were analysed using intention-to-treat approach. At two months, intervention group has significantly higher outpatient attendance rates (76.8%) than control group (56.4%) (p=0.002), and reported higher medical adherence percentage (mean difference 23.1, [95%CI 0.4, 35.8]; p<0.001). There was also significant difference in the MADRS score change between both groups (mean difference 3.4, [95%CI 0.4, 6.3]; p=0.025). Treatment reminders preferences among participants varied; forgetfulness was the most commonly reported reason (53%) for missing outpatient appointments. CONCLUSION Reminders through mobile messaging applications significantly improved outpatient attendance and medication adherence among patients with depression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 138 patients with SARS were analyzed. Three radiologists in consensus retrospectively assessed the frontal chest radiographs obtained at presentation and during treatment (n = 2045) for the distribution (each lung was divided into upper, middle, and lower zones) and extent of lung parenchymal abnormality. Clinical end points included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. RESULTS Thirty-six (26.1%) patients required ICU care, and eight (5.8%) died. The patients who required ICU care and/or died had more extensive consolidation on chest radiographs obtained initially (median percentage of consolidation, 3.30%, with interquartile range [IR] of 1.70%-8.78% vs 1.70% [IR, 0%-3.30%]; P < .001) and on day 7 after fever onset (median percentage of consolidation, 15.00% [IR, 6.48%-28.73%] vs 5.00% [IR, 2.50%-7.50%]; P < .001) than did surviving patients who did not require ICU care. Patients with involvement of more than one lung zone on initial and day 7 chest radiographs were more likely to require ICU care and/or die than were those with involvement of one or fewer zones (P < .001). Patients with bilateral pneumonic changes at presentation were more likely to have an adverse outcome than were those with unilateral pneumonia (P < .001). Involvement of more than one lung zone at baseline chest radiography was an independent predictor of ICU admission and/or death (odds ratio, 3.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 9.32; P = .037) after adjustments for other significant factors (ie, patient age, and baseline neutrophil count and lactate dehydrogenase level).

Two sets of 4 photographs-the same man in formal attire, a white coat, greens, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) standard precautions attire, and the same woman in formal attire, a white coat, greens, and SARS standard precautions attire-were shown to the children and their caregiver. Both were asked which physician's attire he or she liked the most and which he or she liked the least. Parents filled out a questionnaire regarding their experiences in the pediatric emergency department during the SARS epidemic. RESULTS The children selected the physician in SARS standard precautions attire as most liked 17.5% of the time and least liked 53.3% of the time. The parents selected the physician in SARS standard precautions attire as most liked 0% of the time and least liked 94.8% of the time. CONCLUSIONS Physicians wearing standard precautions attire while working in the pediatric emergency department need to be aware that this attire may negatively impact their relationship with pediatric patients 4 to 8 years of age.","Truong, Jennifer; Jain, Shailly; Tan, Jesslin; Keegan, David; Matsui, Doreen; Rieder, Michael J",Pediatric emergency care,586,1

Four cynomologus macaques were inoculated with this reovirus (BYD1) in an attempt to replicate the infection and pathology observed in SARS. The body temperature of the infected monkeys was monitored three times a day, and blood and fecal samples were periodically collected for specific immunology determinations. On days 7 and 33 after inoculation, necropsies for pathological accessment and pathogen isolation were performed. The four infected macaques developed a fever on days 3 and 4 after inoculation, and maintainted a febrile state for 4-6 days. The highest temperature in the animals recorded was 40.4 degrees C. After a recovery phase, the macaques developed a second febrile condition. Antibody titers against the reovirus injected by the intravenous route occurred in higher number than those in the nasal cavity. Four macaque monkeys demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by hemorrhagic pneumonia, serosanguineous exudates, formation of hyaline membranes, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, which were similar to those that have been noted in SARS patients. Lymphocytes decreased in the cortex of the lymph node and in the white pulp of the spleen. ReoV was detected in pneumonic tissue by virus isolation and RT-PCR. The macaques infected with the newly isolated reovirus developed a fever, diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary interstitial inflammation similar to that noted in SARS patients.

A hybrid interferon, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) B/D, and a mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA interferon (IFN) inducer, Ampligen (poly I:poly C124), were the only compounds that potently inhibited virus titres in the lungs of infected mice as assessed by CPE titration assays. When mice were dosed intraperitoneally (i.p.) with IFN-alpha B/D once daily for 3 days beginning 4 h after virus exposure, SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected mice was reduced by 1 log10 at 10,000 and 32,000 IU; at the highest dose of 100,000 IU, virus lung titres were below detectable limits. Ampligen used i.p. at 10 mg/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure also reduced virus lung titres to below detectable limits. Nelfinavir, beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, calpain inhibitor VI, 3-deazaneplanocin A and Alferon (human leukocyte IFN-alpha-n3) did not significantly reduce lung virus titres in mice. Anti-inflammatory agents, chloroquine, amodiaquin and pentoxifylline, were also inactive in vivo, suggesting that although they may be useful in ameliorating the hyperinflammatory response induced by the virus infection, they will not significantly reduce the replication of the virus, the inducer of inflammatory response. Thus, anti-inflammatory agents may only be useful in treating virus lung infections if used in combination with agents that inhibit virus replication. In summary, the data suggest that induction of IFN by mismatched dsRNA or actual treatment with exogenous IFN-alpha can inhibit SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of mice.","Barnard, Dale L; Day, Craig W; Bailey, Kevin; Heiner, Matthew; Montgomery, Robert; Lauridsen, Larry; Chan, Paul K S; Sidwell, Robert W",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,586,11

MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study was conducted among the general population in Saudi Arabia above 18 years of age. The data were collected online, by questionnaire containing 20 questions using Google form, in both Arabic and English, and were distributed to friends, families, and relatives through mail, WhatsApp groups, and Twitter. The questionnaire was randomly given out to the people living in five provinces of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS A sum of 1,713 participants responded to the online survey. The greatest number of participants were at the age between 31 years and 45 years (36.6%) and 56.4% were females. The results showed that 74.6% have not registered for the vaccination and 44.9% responded not to take the vaccine. About 60.80% were concerned about the side effects, and 48.2% were worried about the allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. About 49.1% of participants agreed that preventive measures, such as wearing mask, social distance, and using sanitizers, keep the virus away, and 53.20% believes that being exposed to disease naturally is safer for the immune system. Around 23.90% believes that vaccination cannot reduce the possibility of getting COVID-19. CONCLUSION In the present study, the negative attitudes and afraid of the side effects of the vaccine are the most reasons for indecision and rejection about COVID-19 vaccine. For the future COVID-19 vaccination campaign not to fail, the Ministry of Saudi Arabia should closely follow the vaccination development processes, inform the public transparently, and consider public's concerns. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The results of the current study will help the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia to attempt proactive missions by featuring the significance of immunization to the population and empowering vaccine take-up and acceptance.","Alduwayghiri, Eyad M; Khan, Nubesh",The journal of contemporary dental practice,586,1

Expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is abnormal in many cancers. Nevertheless, system analysis of TMPRSS2-ERG (T2E) abnormalities in metastatic thyroid cancer remains to be elucidated. Method: Using genomic and chromatin data, we demonstrate a unique cis-regulatory landscape between non-T2E and T2E-positive metastatic thyroid cancers, including clusters of regulatory elements (COREs). We attempt to describe the effect of T2E silencing on the cis-regulatory structure in metastatic thyroid cancers and its phase with the obvious phenotype characteristics of T2E-positive metastatic thyroid cancers. Results: These differences were linked by the ERG (erythroblast transformation-specific related gene) co-opts of FoxA1 and HOXB13, which realized T2E specific transcription profile. The study also demonstrated the T2E-specific CORE in an ERG site of structural rearrangement, which is due to the expansion of the T2E locus and contributes to its up-expression. Ultimately, we demonstrate that T2E-specific transcription profile is the basis of vulnerability of CBF-1/RBP-Jκ pathway. In fact, CBF-1/RBP-Jκ pathway inhibits the invasion and growth of T2E-positive thyroid tumors. Conclusion: This study indicates that the overexpression of ERG co-option has a unique cis-regulatory structure in T2E positive thyroid tumors, which induces drug dependence on CBF-1/RBP-Jκ signal. Our study solved the genetic and epigenetic variation of T2E in metastatic thyroid cancer for the first time. It is worth noting that further functional and clinical validation is needed as our study is a bioinformatics analysis.","Hu, A.; Cao, F. F.; Lu, D.; Yang, L.

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 by itself is not an indication for cesarean section. Different publications demonstrated the efficacy of neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia for delivery. Although SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a certain neurotropism, neuraxial block was not associated with neurological damage in COVID-19 parturients, and seems as safe and effective as in normal situations. It permits to avoid a general anesthesia in case of intrapartum cesarean section. Epidural failure is a concern: it may lead to a general anesthesia in case of emergency cesarean section. Local protocols and well-trained anesthesiologists will be helpful. COVID-19 patients require special circuits and every step (transfer to and from theatre, recovery, analgesia, and so on) should be planned in advance. For cesarean section under general anesthesia, personal protection equipment must be enhanced. Postoperative analgesia with neuraxial opioids, NSAIDs, or regional blocks are recommended. COVID-19 and pregnancy increase the risk of thrombosis, so thromboprophylaxis has to be considered and protocolized. SUMMARY: Anesthetic care for delivery in COVID-19 parturients should include neuraxial blocks. Special attention should be paid on the risk of thrombosis.","Guasch, Emilia; Brogly, Nicolas; Gilsanz, Fernando",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,586,1

These electret layers are essential for the efficient filtration of difficult-to-capture small particles, yet the exact nature of electrostatic capture with respect to the charge on both the particles and the electret fibres as well as the effect of the immediate environment remain unclear. Here, we explore in detail the electrostatic interactions between the surface of a single charged electret fibre and a model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics coupled to a detailed spike protein charge regulation model, we show how pH and salt concentration drastically change both the scale and the sign of the interaction. Furthermore, the configuration of the few spike proteins closest to the electret fibre turns out to be as important for the strength of the interaction as their total number on the virus envelope, a direct consequence of spike protein charge regulation. The results of our work elucidate the details of virus electrostatics and contribute to the general understanding of efficient virus filtration mechanisms.","Javidpour, Leili; BoZic, AnZe; Naji, Ali; Podgornik, Rudolf",Soft Matter,586,10

The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals. The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test. It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus.","Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Mahadev, Srihari; Schwartz, Robert E; Shah, Shawn; Sampath, Kartik; Schnoll-Sussman, Felice; Brown, Robert S; Carr-Locke, David; Cohen, David E; Sharaiha, Reem Z",World J Gastroenterol,586,26

The faster spread of these diseases, in a moderately short timeframe, is threatening the overall population wellbeing and conceivably the economy. The inadequacy of conventional diagnostic tools in terms of time consuming and complex laboratory-based diagnosis process is a major challenge to medical care. In present era, the development of point-of-care testing (POCT) is in demand for fast detection of infectious diseases along with ""on-site"" results that are helpful in timely and early action for better treatment. In addition, POCT devices also play a crucial role in preventing the transmission of infectious diseases by offering real-time testing and lab quality microbial diagnosis within minutes. Timely diagnosis and further treatment optimization facilitate the containment of outbreaks of infectious diseases. Presently, efforts are being made to support such POCT by the technological development in the field of internet of medical things (IoMT). The IoMT offers wireless-based operation and connectivity of POCT devices with health expert and medical centre. In this review, the recently developed POC diagnostics integrated or future possibilities of integration with IoMT are discussed with focus on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like malaria, dengue fever, influenza A (H1N1), human papilloma virus (HPV), Ebola virus disease (EVD), Zika virus (ZIKV), and coronavirus (COVID-19). The IoMT-assisted POCT systems are capable enough to fill the gap between bioinformatics generation, big rapid analytics, and clinical validation.

However, the crisis also simultaneously increased stress on families while decreasing their desire to hospitalize youth for a nonmedical issue. Hence, the need for a PHP remained high. Health care organizations worked diligently to create a secure telehealth platform (tele-PHP) to be delivered to patients in their home environments. This article describes the development and implementation of child and adolescent tele-PHPs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These new programs were started in mid-March 2020, and changes were implemented over the next 3 to 4 weeks. Overall, patients and families have been receptive to behavioral health services delivered through telemedicine. While tele-PHPs are the most plausible solution to continue behavioral health care for these patients, some challenges were observed during this process. Besides procedural and technological challenges associated with creating a virtual setup, other difficulties include variable patient engagement, specific treatment-related challenges, and system-related changes. These challenges are addressed through psychoeducation, provision of online measures to assess treatment outcomes, and efforts to optimize parent engagement prior to treatment initiation for better treatment adherence. Initial experiences during a time of crisis suggest that tele-PHP services can be a viable long-term treatment option in the future during both a disaster and routine times to improve access for those who otherwise cannot take advantage of such services. Long-term effectiveness of these interventions still needs to be explored.","Baweja, Raman; Verma, Shikha; Pathak, Meenal; Waxmonsky, James G",Prim. care companion CNS disord. (Online),586,1

To study spreading patterns of muscle weakness, we analyze spatiotemporal binary muscle strength data, which indicates whether observed muscle strengths are impaired or healthy. We propose a hidden Markov model-based approach that assumes the observed disease status depends on two latent disease states. The model enables us to estimate the incidence rate of ALS disease and the probability of disease state transition. Specifically, the latter is modeled by a logistic autoregression in that the spatial network of susceptible muscles follows a Markov process. The proposed model is flexible to allow both historical muscle conditions and their spatial relationships to be included in the analysis. To estimate the model parameters, we provide an iterative algorithm to maximize sparse-penalized likelihood with bias correction, and use the Viterbi algorithm to label hidden disease states.

The results showed that the solar system media was suitable for use by elementary school students as evidenced by the results of the validity of the media expert with a validity value of 90% with the feasible category. The validity of media eligibility is based on the suitability of images, colors, fonts, text layout, images, animation and sound. While the validity of material experts reached 83% based on core competence (KI), indicators, suitability with children's cognitive development. Meanwhile, 87% of linguists were categorized as feasible based on the level of language development of students. Thus the solar system media products are valid and suitable for use in learning in elementary schools.","Sahari, Sutrisno; Wahyudi,",Jurnal Pendidikan Dasar Nusantara,586,16

Epilepsy is the most common neurological disease in childhood and adolescence. The aim of this study was to determine anxiety levels among the mothers of children under follow-up for epilepsy in our clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study group consisted of the mothers of epilepsy patients who were under follow-up in the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic of the tertiary care center and were scheduled for a routine examination during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mothers' anxiety levels according to the Beck Anxiety Inventory and their opinions about COVID-19 in relation to their child were assessed and compared based on whether the mother/patient attended their appointments in person and whether the child had frequent or infrequent seizures. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety level between the mothers of 64 children with epilepsy who attended their appointment during the pandemic and those of the mothers of 52 who did not attend their appointment. However, the mothers of children with frequent seizures had significantly higher anxiety levels. CONCLUSION: Anxiety level of mothers whose children have frequent seizures was significantly higher compared to mothers whose children have infrequent seizures. It is important to be aware about this point and using telemedicine approach in suitable population and postpone routine outpatient follow-up appointments as much as possible.","Celik, Halil; Acikel, Sadettin Burak; Ozdemir, Fatih Mehmet Akif; Aksoy, Erhan; Oztoprak, Ulkuhan; Cucu, Ergin; Kucur, Ozge; Ceylan, Nesrin; Yuksel, Deniz",Eur Neurol,586,26

To that end, the overarching aims of this study were to understand students' attitude toward and knowledge of COVID-19 and examine the predictors of their attitude toward hand hygiene. DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study, conducted in Saudi Arabia, enrolled interns from diverse healthcare-related fields. The questionnaire was divided into three sections: sociodemographic data, knowledge of COVID-19, and attitude toward hand hygiene. The data was expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). RESULTS: In all, 371 responses were analyzed. The median knowledge score was 20, which was considered good. There were no statistically significant differences across age, hospital setting, or gender. Of the 254 respondents who had attended an educational session, 167 (65%) had a good knowledge score and 83 (33%) had a moderate score, compared with only four (2%) who had a poor score. The cumulative median score of the respondents' attitudes was 6 (IQR [2]), which reflects a suboptimal attitude-only 38 (22%) reported a good attitude. The predicted effect of knowledge on attitude (good/suboptimal) was statistically significant (p = 0.02) using univariate logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a strong need to encourage the current training program that targets hand hygiene practices among students in healthcare-related fields, especially prior to the internship year.","Aldhahi, Monira; Almutairi, Rahaf; Alluhaidan, Wejdan; Alshammari, Anwar; Almarzuqi, Raghad; Altaleb, Hanan; Alsayegh, Noura; Almuaither, Tarfa",,586,22

The study was conducted at 2 sites (Paris, France, and Beirut, Lebanon), followed the same training and testing protocols, and involved six detection dogs (three explosive detection dogs, one search and rescue dog, and two colon cancer detection dogs). A total of 177 individuals were recruited for the study (95 symptomatic COVID-19 positive and 82 asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals) from five hospitals, and one underarm sweat sample per individual was collected. The dog training sessions lasted between one and three weeks. Once trained, the dog had to mark the COVID-19 positive sample randomly placed behind one of three or four olfactory cones (the other cones contained at least one COVID-19 negative sample and between zero and two mocks). During the testing session, a COVID-19 positive sample could be used up to a maximum of three times for one dog. The dog and its handler were both blinded to the COVID-positive sample location. The success rate per dog (i.e., the number of correct indications divided by the number of trials) ranged from 76% to 100%. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated success rate was most of the time higher than the success rate obtained by chance after removing the number of mocks from calculations. These results provide some evidence that detection dogs may be able to discriminate between sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 individuals and those from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals. However, due to the limitations of this proof-of-concept study (including using some COVID-19 samples more than once and potential confounding biases), these results must be confirmed in validation studies.","Grandjean, Dominique; Sarkis, Riad; Lecoq-Julien, Clothilde; Benard, Aymeric; Roger, Vinciane; Levesque, Eric; Bernes-Luciani, Eric; Maestracci, Bruno; Morvan, Pascal; Gully, Eric; Berceau-Falancourt, David; Haufstater, Pierre; Herin, Gregory; Cabrera, Joaquin; Muzzin, Quentin; Gallet, Capucine; Bacqué, Hélène; Broc, Jean-Marie; Thomas, Leo; Lichaa, Anthony; Moujaes, Georges; Saliba, Michele; Kuhn, Aurore; Galey, Mathilde; Berthail, Benoit; Lapeyre, Lucien; Capelli, Anthoni; Renault, Steevens; Bachir, Karim; Kovinger, Anthony; Comas, Eric; Stainmesse, Aymeric; Etienne, Erwan; Voeltzel, Sébastien; Mansouri, Sofiane; Berceau-Falancourt, Marlène; Dami, Aimé; Charlet, Lary; Ruau, Eric; Issa, Mario; Grenet, Carine; Billy, Christophe; Tourtier, Jean-Pierre; Desquilbet, Loïc",PLoS One,586,30

Severe cases often develop respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation and with critical cases progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Control of hyperinflammation has been proposed as a possible therapeutic avenue for COVID-19; extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) modalities offer an attractive mean to ameliorate maladaptive inflammation. With this work, we evaluated the longitudinal changes of systemic inflammatory markers in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with blood purification using AN69ST (oXiris®) haemofilter. METHODS: We performed a time-series analysis of 44 consecutive COVID-19 cases treated with the AN69ST (oXiris®) cytokine adsorbing haemofilter (CAH) according to local practice; we visualize longitudinal results of biochemical, inflammatory, blood gas, and vital sign parameters focussing on systemic levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. RESULTS: All patients were treated with &#8805;1 cycle extracorporeal continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) with CAH; of these, 30 severe patients received CVVH-CAH within 4-12 h of admission after recognizing a hyper-inflammatory state. Another 14 patients admitted with mild-to-moderate symptoms progressed to severe disease and were placed on EBP during hospitalization. The treatment was associated with a reduction of ferritin, CRP, fibrinogen, several inflammatory markers, and a resolution of numerous cytopenias. The observed mortality across the cohort was 36.3%. CONCLUSION: EBP with CAH was associated with a decrease in CRP, and control of IL-6 and procalcitonin.","Rosalia, Rodney Alexander; Ugurov, Petar; Neziri, Dashurie; Despotovska, Simona; Kostoska, Emilija; Veljanovska-Kiridjievska, Lidija; Kuzmanov, Dimche; Trifunovski, Aleksandar; Popevski, Dijana; Villa, Gianluca; Mitrev, Zan",Blood Purif,586,17

METHOD: This qualitative study was carried out with 17 nurses. The interviews were carried out individually and online. The data were analysed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. RESULTS: From the analyses of the data, four key themes have emerged as follows: 'needs', 'anger', 'questioning' and 'decision'. Needs include visibility, support, adaptation and sleep/rest. Nurses were angry because of their unmet expectations, feelings of injustice, and selfish and insensitive behaviours they faced. They questioned their profession and decided to either alienate from the profession or continue with the gains they had made. CONCLUSION: This study found that nurses perceived an imbalance between their efforts and their achievements. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: This study provides evidence for nursing managers to anticipate problems that may arise both during and after the outbreak.

In an ageing society, Sweden's end-of-life (EoL) care is increasingly professionalised and specialised, but there is little community involvement. One goal of Studio DöBra was therefore to support community engagement with EoL-related topics. Another goal was to create opportunities for interaction between children and older adults as there are few intergenerational meeting places. Two iterations of Studio DöBra were developed (2016, 2018) in different Swedish cities, utilising a community-based participatory research approach. Project groups comprised first author MK and representatives of community organisations such as meeting places for older adults, after-school centres and artistic organisations. Each iteration engaged eight children and eight older adults in a series of five workshops. This article investigates how children and older adults motivate their participation, their experiences of participating and ways in which they were affected by participation. We also investigate how parents reflect on their child's participation in Studio DöBra. Older adults, children and their parents were interviewed after each Studio DöBra. An inductive qualitative process guided by interpretive description was used to analyse the transcripts. Findings indicate that participants acted as individuals with agency in connecting across generations and in creating spaces for engaging with EoL-topics, not only in Studio DöBra but also in their social networks.

Among its many effects, hypertension increases central artery stiffness which in turn is both an initiator and indicator of disease. Despite extensive clinical, animal, and basic science studies, the biochemomechanical mechanisms by which hypertension drives aortic stiffening remain unclear. In this paper, we show that a new computational model of aortic growth and remodeling can capture differential effects of induced hypertension on the thoracic and abdominal aorta in a common mouse model of disease. Because the simulations treat the aortic wall as a constrained mixture of different constituents having different material properties and rates of turnover, one can gain increased insight into underlying constituent-level mechanisms of aortic remodeling. Model results suggest that the aorta can mechano-adapt locally to blood pressure elevation in the absence of marked inflammation, but large increases in inflammation drive a persistent maladaptive phenotype characterized primarily by adventitial fibrosis. Moreover, this fibrosis appears to occur via a marked increase in the rate of deposition of collagen having different material properties in the absence of a compensatory increase in the rate of matrix degradation. Controlling inflammation thus appears to be key to reducing fibrosis, but therapeutic strategies should not compromise the proteolytic activity of the wall that is essential to mechanical homeostasis.","Latorre, Marcos; Bersi, Matthew R; Humphrey, Jay D",Int J Eng Sci,586,30

Thus, achieving not just vaccine equality (i.e., similar allocation of vaccine supply proportional to its population across jurisdictions) but equity (i.e., preferential access and administra-tion to those who have been most affected by COVID-19 disease) is an important goal. The CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) uses 15 indicators grouped into four themes that comprise an overall SVI measure, resulting in 20 metrics, each of which has national and state-specific county rankings. The 20 metric-specific rankings were each divided into lowest to highest tertiles to categorize counties as low, moderate, or high social vulnerability counties. These tertiles were combined with vaccine administration data for 49,264,338 U.S. residents in 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) who received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose during December 14, 2020-March 1, 2021. Nationally, for the overall SVI measure, vaccination coverage was higher (15.8%) in low social vulnerability counties than in high social vulnerability counties (13.9%), with the largest coverage disparity in the socioeconomic status theme (2.5 percentage points higher coverage in low than in high vulnerability counties). Wide state variations in equity across SVI metrics were found. Whereas in the majority of states, vaccination coverage was higher in low vulnerability counties, some states had equitable coverage at the county level. CDC, state, and local jurisdictions should continue to monitor vaccination coverage by SVI metrics to focus public health interventions to achieve equitable coverage with COVID-19 vaccine.","Hughes, Michelle M; Wang, Alice; Grossman, Marissa K; Pun, Eugene; Whiteman, Ari; Deng, Li; Hallisey, Elaine; Sharpe, J Danielle; Ussery, Emily N; Stokley, Shannon; Musial, Trieste; Weller, Daniel L; Murthy, Bhavini Patel; Reynolds, Laura; Gibbs-Scharf, Lynn; Harris, LaTreace; Ritchey, Matt D; Toblin, Robin L",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,586,21

Several studies have reported that manual analysis hinders the application of microvascular microscopy in a clinical setting. In this paper, we present a fully automated state-of-the-art system, called CapillaryNet, that can quantify skin nutritive capillary density and red blood cell velocity from handheld microscopy videos. Moreover, CapillaryNet measures several novel microvascular parameters that researchers were previously unable to quantify, i.e. capillary hematocrit and Intra-capillary flow velocity heterogeneity. Our system has been used to analyze skin microcirculation videos from various patient groups (COVID-19, pancreatitis, and acute heart diseases). Our proposed system excels from existing capillary detection systems as it combines the speed of traditional computer vision algorithms and the accuracy of convolutional neural networks.","Helmy, Maged; Dykyy, Anastasiya; Truong, Tuyen Trung; Ferreira, Paulo; Jul, Eric",,586,20

The study was conducted online, during the general lockdown in the country, and 358 individuals (239 females) participated (mean age = 36.89; SD = 12.15). A perception of personal control over the condition, negative emotions towards the pandemic, and self-efficacy to cope with the current anti-pandemic measures were related to psychological distress. Also, a significant interaction between representation clusters and self-efficacy to cope with potential future difficulties (i.e., after the anti-pandemic measures are ended), was found. Specifically, the association between this type of self-efficacy and psychological distress was significant only for the 'low-impact' representations cluster (i.e., a perception of the pandemic as less burdensome and more controllable). The findings indicate that the factors which, according to previous research and theory, are significantly related to psychological distress during a health threat, are important also in times of a pandemic. They also suggest a potential adaptation-promoting synergy between pandemic-related self-efficacy and a more positive representation of COVID-19, as far as psychological distress is conerned. Thus, these factors may serve as the basis for the development of pandemic-related health behavior promotion programs.","Karademas, Evangelos C; Thomadakis, Christophoros",Curr Psychol,586,7

Recently, studies revealed that self-DNA from by-products of chromosome instability and tumors could activate the cGAS-STING pathway, and subsequently promote or inhibit tumor development. However, the prognostic value and correlations with immune infiltrates of the cGAS-STING pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been clarified. In the present study, we used the Molecular Signatures Database, Oncomine, UALCAN, Human Protein Atlas, Kaplan-Meier plotter, LinkedOmics, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource databases. Overexpression of XRCC5, IRF3, TRIM21, STAT6, DDX41, TBK1, XRCC6, TREX1, PRKDC, and TMEM173 was markedly correlated with clinical stages and pathological grades in HCC. Moreover, higher mRNA expression of XRCC5, XRCC6, and PRKDC was significantly related with shorter overall survival. However, higher mRNA expression of IFI16, STAT6, NLRC3, and TMEM173 was associated with favorable overall survival. Our results suggested that the kinase targets of the cGAS-STING pathway included the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (LCK and LYN), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family kinases (ATM and ATR), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1). Furthermore, we identified significant correlations among the expression of cGAS-STING pathway and infiltration of B cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in HCC. The expression of the cGAS-STING pathway also exhibited strong relationships with diverse immune marker sets in HCC. These findings suggest that cGAS-STING pathway members may be used as prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets HCC patients.","Qi, Zhenhua; Yan, Fang; Chen, Dongtai; Xing, Wei; Li, Qiang; Zeng, Weian; Bi, Bingtian; Xie, Jingdun",Biosci. rep,586,21

The aim of this observational study is to explore the impact of healthcare professional involvement on the adherence of patients to an eHealth platform. We evaluated the usage of an eHealth platform by patients who used the platform individually compared with patients in a blended setting, where healthcare professionals were involved. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, log data from September 2011 until January 2018 were extracted from the eHealth platform Curavista. Patients with COPD who completed at least one Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) were included for analyses (n = 299). In 57% (n = 171) of the patients, the eHealth platform was used in a blended setting, either in hospital (n = 128) or primary care (n = 29). To compare usage of the platform between patients who used the platform independently or with a healthcare professional, we applied propensity score matching and performed adjusted Poisson regression analysis on CCQ-submission rate. RESULTS: Using the eHealth platform in a blended setting was associated with a 3.25 higher CCQ-submission rate compared to patients using the eHealth platform independently. Within the blended setting, the CCQ-submission rate was 1.83 higher in the hospital care group than in the primary care group. CONCLUSION: It is shown that COPD patients used the platform more frequently in a blended care setting compared to patients who used the eHealth platform independently, adjusted for age, sex and disease burden.

The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), the cryogenic spectrometer of the Athena space X-ray observatory of the European Space Agency will be developed by a large international consortium. The travel footprint associated with the development of the X-IFU is to be minimized. For that purpose, a travel footprint calculator has been developed and first released to the X-IFU consortium members. The calculator uses seven different emission factors and methods differing by up to a factor of ~5 for the same flying distance. The observed differences illustrate the lack of standards and regulations for computing the footprint of flight travels and are explained primarily, though partly, by different accountings of non-CO2 effects. The calculator enables us to compute the travel footprint of a large set of travels and can help identify a meeting place that minimizes the overall travel footprint for a large set of possible city hosts, e.g. cities with large airports. The calculator also includes the option for a minimum distance above which flying is considered the most suitable transport option ; below that chosen distance, the emission of train journeys are considered. To demonstrate its full capabilities, the calculator is first run on one of the largest scientific meetings; the fall meeting of the AGU and meetings of the IPCC for which it is used to compute the location that would minimize the travel footprint. Then the travel footprint of X-IFU is estimated to be ~500 tons of CO2-eq/yr. With this paper, the on-line travel footprint calculator is released to the science community (abridged).","Barret, Didier",,586,16

Unfractionated heparin, a glycosaminoglycan that must bind to antithrombin as a cofactor, is currently the standard anticoagulant adopted during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Antithrombin, beyond being a potent natural anticoagulant, acts in the cross-talk between coagulation and inflammatory system through anticoagulation and coagulation-independent effects. OBJECTIVES: In this review, we describe, in the adult setting of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the pathophysiological rationale for antithrombin use, the current practice of administration, and the effects of antithrombin on anticoagulation, bleeding, and outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Studies on adults (18 years or older) on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation published from 1995 to 2018 in order to evaluate the use of antithrombin. RESULTS: In adults on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, antithrombin supplementation has a highly pathophysiological rationale since coagulation factor consumption, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and endothelial activation are triggered by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Eleven articles are focused on the topic but among the authors there is no consensus on the threshold for supplementation (ranging from 70% to 80%) as well as on the dose (rarely standardized) and time of administration (bolus vs continuous infusion). Consistently, antithrombin is considered able to achieve better anticoagulation targets in or not in the presence of heparin resistance. The impact of antithrombin administration on bleeding still shows contrasting results. CONCLUSION: Antithrombin use in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be investigated on the threshold for supplementation, dose, and time of administration.","Piacente, Claudia; Martucci, Gennaro; Miceli, Vitale; Pavone, Gaetano; Papeo, Anna; Occhipinti, Giovanna; Panarello, Giovanna; Lorusso, Roberto; Tanaka, Kenichi; Arcadipane, Antonio",Perfusion,586,16

Our proposed work uses probabilistic classifiers like tree-based algorithms and deep neural networks to perform a statistically rigorous goodness-of-fit test of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data.","Dalmasso, Niccolo; Vincent, Galen; Hammerling, Dorit; Lee, Ann B.",,586,1

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance and urgency of enhancing WASH coverage to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission and other healthcare-associated infections. As a part of COVID-19 preparedness and response interventions, the Government of Zimbabwe, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and civil society organizations conducted WASH assessments in 50 HCFs designated as COVID-19 isolation facilities. Assessments were based on the Water and Sanitation for Health Facility Improvement Tool (WASH FIT), a multi-step framework to inform the continuous monitoring and improvement of WASH services. The WASH FIT assessments revealed that one in four HCFs did not have adequate services across the domains of water, sanitation, health care waste, hand hygiene, facility environment, cleanliness and disinfection, and management. The sanitation domain had the largest proportion of health care facilities with poor service coverage (42%). Some of the recommendations from this assessment include the provision of sufficient water for all users, Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM)- and disability-friendly sanitation facilities, handwashing facilities, waste collection services, energy for incineration or waste treatment facilities, cleaning supplies, and financial resources for HCFs.

We examined the relationship between proliferative and inflammatory properties of tissue macrophages by defining the impact of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway, a central regulator of self-renewal, in alveolar macrophages (AMs) . Activation of ß-catenin by Wnt ligand inhibited AM proliferation and stemness, but promoted inflammatory activity. In a murine influenza viral pneumonia model, ß-catenin-mediated AM inflammatory activity promoted acute host morbidity; in contrast, AM proliferation enabled repopulation of reparative AMs and tissue recovery following viral clearance. Mechanistically, Wnt treatment promoted ß-catenin-HIF-1&#945; interaction and glycolysis-dependent inflammation while suppressing mitochondrial metabolism and thereby, AM proliferation. Differential HIF-1&#945; activities distinguished proliferative and inflammatory AMs in vivo. This ß-catenin-HIF-1&#945; axis was conserved in human AMs and enhanced HIF-1&#945; expression associated with macrophage inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Thus, inflammatory and reparative activities of lung macrophages are regulated by ß-catenin-HIF-1&#945; signaling, with implications for the treatment of severe respiratory diseases.","Zhu, Bibo; Wu, Yue; Huang, Su; Zhang, Ruixuan; Son, Young Min; Li, Chaofan; Cheon, In Su; Gao, Xiaochen; Wang, Min; Chen, Yao; Zhou, Xian; Nguyen, Quynh; Phan, Anthony T; Behl, Supriya; Taketo, M Mark; Mack, Matthias; Shapiro, Virginia S; Zeng, Hu; Ebihara, Hideki; Mullon, John J; Edell, Eric S; Reisenauer, Janani S; Demirel, Nadir; Kern, Ryan M; Chakraborty, Rana; Cui, Weiguo; Kaplan, Mark H; Zhou, Xiaobo; Goldrath, Ananda W; Sun, Jie",Immunity,586,29

Initial reports were mainly on people with type 2 diabetes, although recent surveys have shown that individuals with type 1 diabetes are also at risk of severe COVID-19. The reason for worse prognosis in people with diabetes is likely to be multifactorial, thus reflecting the syndromic nature of diabetes. Age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease, obesity, and a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulative state all probably contribute to the risk of worse outcomes. Glucose-lowering agents and anti-viral treatments can modulate the risk, but limitations to their use and potential interactions with COVID-19 treatments should be carefully assessed. Finally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection itself might represent a worsening factor for people with diabetes, as it can precipitate acute metabolic complications through direct negative effects on ß-cell function. These effects on ß-cell function might also cause diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with diabetes, hyperglycaemia at hospital admission in individuals with unknown history of diabetes, and potentially new-onset diabetes.","Apicella, Matteo; Campopiano, Maria Cristina; Mantuano, Michele; Mazoni, Laura; Coppelli, Alberto; Del Prato, Stefano",Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol,586,16

A previous analysis was based on the assumption that the number of nasopharyngeal swabs would be constant. However, the number of daily swabs is now more than five times what it was when we did our previous analysis. Therefore, here we consider the time evolution of the ratio of the new daily cases to number of swabs, which is more representative of the evolution of the pandemic when the number of swabs is increasing or changing in time. We consider a number of possible distributions representing the evolution of the pandemic in Italy, and we test their prediction capability over a period of up to 6 weeks. The results show that a distribution of the type of Planck black body radiation law provides very good forecasting. The use of different distributions provides an independent possible estimate of the uncertainty. We then consider five possible trajectories for the number of daily swabs and we estimate the potential dates of a substantial reduction in the number of new daily cases. We then estimate the spread in a substantial reduction, below a certain threshold, of the daily cases per swab among the Italian regions. We finally perform a Monte Carlo simulation with 25,000 runs to evaluate a random uncertainty in the prediction of the date of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed daily cases per swab.","Ciufolini, Ignazio; Paolozzi, Antonio",Eur Phys J Plus,586,1

It happened with Tuberculosis (TB) and is happening with COVID-19. Due to its dynamic nature, this group of diseases must be studied in the context of the social determinants of health. Aim: To describe the epidemiological behavior of COVID-19 in response to the control strategies implemented by the Chilean Ministry of Health and its similarities with the socio-economic distribution of TB in the Metropolitan Region (MR) of Chile. Material and Methods: The 2018 Tuberculosis rates and average income of districts belonging to the MR were described, as well as the incidence rates of COVID-19. A Pearson correlation analysis was applied between the rates of both diseases, to assess similarities in the epidemiological distribution patterns. Results: The RM accounts for over 50% of the total national cases of COVID-19. After the implementation of selective quarantines, only four districts in the RM managed to control the outbreak (those with the highest incomes). In the rest, a clear increase in cases was observed. The districts with the highest increase in cases were the most disadvantaged, and those with the highest TB rates during 2018, with a correlation coefficient of 0.6. Conclusions: Control policies cannot deepen health inequalities.

We found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) that recognize a complex consisting of platelet factor 4 and heparin similar to those developed in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HIT), however, independent of heparin exposure. These antibodies activate platelets in the presence of TLR9 stimuli, stimuli that are prominent in COVID-19. Strikingly, 4 out of 42 antibodies cloned from IgG1 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RBD-binding B cells could activate platelets. These antibodies possessed, in the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3, an RKH or Y &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; motif that we recently described among platelet-activating antibodies cloned from HIT patients. RKH and Y &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; motifs were prevalent among published RBD-specific antibodies, and 3 out of 6 such antibodies tested could activate platelets. Features of platelet activation by these antibodies resemble those by pathogenic HIT antibodies. B cells with an RKH or Y &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; motif were robustly expanded in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted in November 2020, about 9 months after starting the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, among 8000 Japanese men and women aged 25-64 years. Participants asked for the changes after starting the COVID-19 pandemic in health status, workload, daily life, and health behavior. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to elucidate factors associated with deterioration in general health status. RESULTS: A deterioration in general health status was reported by 17.0% of male and 19.4% of female. There has been a clear shift to sedentary life with decreasing moderate activity and increasing screen time. The multivariate analysis revealed that deteriorated work style, increased burden of housework, decreased moderate activity, increased digital media exposure, and increased body weight were significantly associated with deteriorating health status. CONCLUSION: Both men and women have experienced significant changes in workload and lifestyle since the COVID-19 pandemic started.

Loss-of-function mutations of MC4R constitute the most common monogenic cause of early-onset extreme obesity in humans, whereas gain-of-function mutations appear to be protective. In particular, two relatively frequent alleles carrying the non-synonymous coding mutations V103I or I251L have been associated with lower risks of obesity and type-2 diabetes. Although V103I and I251L MC4Rs showed more efficient signaling in transfected cells, their specific effects in live animals remain unexplored. Here, we investigated whether the introduction of V103I and I251L mutations into the mouse MC4R leads to a lean phenotype and provides protection against an obesogenic diet. METHODS: Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated two novel strains of mice carrying single nucleotide mutations into the mouse Mc4r which are identical to those present in V103I and I251L MCR4 human alleles, and studied their phenotypic outcomes in mice fed with normal chow or a high-fat diet. In particular, we measured body weight progression, food intake and adiposity. In addition, we analyzed glucose homeostasis through glucose and insulin tolerance tests. RESULTS: We found that homozygous V103I females displayed shorter longitudinal length and decreased abdominal white fat, whereas homozygous I251L females were also shorter and leaner due to decreased weight in all white fat pads examined. Homozygous Mc4rV103I/V103I and Mc4rI251L/I251L mice of both sexes showed improved glucose homeostasis when challenged in a glucose tolerance test, whereas Mc4rI251L/I251L females showed improved responses to insulin. Despite being leaner and metabolically more efficient, V103I and I251L mutants fed with a hypercaloric diet increased their fasting glucose levels and adiposity similar to their wild-type littermates. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results demonstrate that mice carrying V103I and I251L MC4R mutations displayed gain-of-function phenotypes that were more evident in females. However, hypermorphic MC4R mutants were as susceptible as their control littermates to the obesogenic and diabetogenic effects elicited by a long-term hypercaloric diet, highlighting the importance of healthy feeding habits even under favorable genetic conditions.","Rojo, Daniela; McCarthy, Clara; Raingo, Jesica; Rubinstein, Marcelo",Mol Metab,586,8

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: A convenience sample of 296 mild coronavirus disease 2019 patients were recruited from a Fangcang hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, from 3rd March to 5th March, 2020. Participants were assessed using a sociodemographic and clinical characteristics questionnaire, and Symptom Check List 90. The binary logistic regression was utilized to explore the influencing factors of psychological symptoms of patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: In total, 296 of 299 patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 participated in the study (response rate: 99.0%). The findings revealed that 12.8% patients with mild symptoms have mental-health problems; the most common psychological symptoms are phobic anxiety (58.4%), paranoid ideation (50.7%), and psychoticism (40.2%). Female patients [OR=3.587, 95%CI (1.694-7.598)] and those having physical symptoms currently [OR =2.813, 95%CI (1.210-6.539)] are at higher risk, while those in the middle duration of hospitalization [OR =0.278, 95% CI (0.121-0.639)] protect against mental-health problems. CONCLUSIONS: The minority of patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 were still suffering from psychological symptoms. Health-care providers are recommended to pay particular attention to screening these high-risk groups (females, those in the initial stages of hospitalization and those with physical symptoms currently) and implement targeted psychological care as required. IMPACT: This study found that most patients of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Fangcang hospital exhibited normal mental-health at par with the general Chinese norm and the minority of them were suffering from psychological symptoms. The findings can provide a reference for health-care providers to screen high-risk psychological symptoms groups and implement targeted psychological intervention for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019.","Li, Juan; Yang, Zhen; Zhang, Jie; Wang, An-Ni; Wang, Xiao; Dong, Li-Li; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Wei, Rui-Hong; Li, Yi-Fei; Zhang, Jing-Ping",J. adv. nurs,586,25

The author witnessed, in real time, the ways in which residents were engaging with the containment measures that were instituted as part of the political leadership’s attempt to flatten the curve of COVID-19. What was observed in an urban slum was particularly poignant and illuminating. The observations captured how, for residents of the urban slum, social distancing is more an aspiration than an attainable reality. Indeed, social distancing is impossible if such a protocol does not come with concomitant economic support targeted to the most socially vulnerable in society.","Wasdani, Kishinchand Poornima; Prasad, Ajnesh",Local Environ.,586,33

Initial data suggest that the virus has low mutation rates, but its large genome could facilitate recombination, insertions, and deletions, as has been described in other coronaviruses. Here, we deep-sequenced the complete SARS-CoV-2 S gene from 18 patients (10 with mild and 8 with severe COVID-19), and found that the virus accumulates deletions upstream and very close to the S1/S2 cleavage site (PRRAR/S), generating a frameshift with appearance of a stop codon. These deletions were found in a small percentage of the viral quasispecies (2.2%) in samples from all the mild and only half the severe COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that the virus may generate free S1 protein released to the circulation. We suggest that natural selection has favoured a ""Don't burn down the house"" strategy, in which free S1 protein may compete with viral particles for the ACE2 receptor, thus reducing the severity of the infection and tissue damage without losing transmission capability.","Andrés, Cristina; Garcia-Cehic, Damir; Gregori, Josep; Piñana, Maria; Rodriguez-Frias, Francisco; Guerrero-Murillo, Mercedes; Esperalba, Juliana; Rando, Ariadna; Goterris, Lidia; Codina, Maria Gema; Quer, Susanna; Martín, Maria Carmen; Campins, Magda; Ferrer, Ricard; Almirante, Benito; Esteban, Juan Ignacio; Pumarola, Tomás; Antón, Andrés; Quer, Josep",Emerg Microbes Infect,586,23

We aimed to assess the magnitude and correlates of stigma in these survivors, on return to their communities. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based, exploratory study conducted by the postgraduate department of psychiatry, in collaboration with the postgraduate department of chest medicine, Govt. medical college, Srinagar. The study was performed among COVID-19 survivors, who attended the outpatient department after their discharge from the hospital. Socio-demographic characteristics were recorded through semi-structured proforma. Stigma was measured by the stigma questionnaire. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 91 survivors consented to participate in the study. Almost half (46.2%) of them were in the age group of 30-49 years and close to two-thirds (68.1%) were males. About three-fourths (74.7%) were from the urban background. The mean time from hospital discharge to study entry was 11.7±5.1 [Range(R) = 7-21] days. 98% of survivors provided at least one stigma endorsing response and the total mean stigma score was 28.5±7.1[R = 6-39]. The mean stigma sub-scores were highest for enacted stigma (7.6±1.8) [R = 2-9] and externalized stigma (15.0±4.1) [R = 1-20]. Enacted stigma was significantly high in males as compared to females. Enacted stigma and internalized stigma were both associated with education. Enacted stigma, externalized stigma, disclosure concerns, and total stigma was significantly associated with the occupation. Being unemployed and time since discharge were identified as independent predictors of total stigma. CONCLUSION: Our study results showed high levels of enacted and externalized stigma among COVID-19 survivors. Enacted stigma was more among males and in those who were highly educated. Survivor centered and community-driven anti-stigma programs are the need of the hour to promote the recovery and community re-integration of these survivors.","Dar, Shabir Ahmad; Khurshid, Syed Quibtiya; Wani, Zaid Ahmad; Khanam, Aaliya; Haq, Inaamul; Shah, Naveed Nazir; Shahnawaz, Mir; Mustafa, Hena",PLoS One,586,16

For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.","Meinert, Edward; Milne-Ives, Madison; Surodina, Svitlana; Lam, Ching",JMIR Public Health Surveill,586,7

Objective: However, access to the impact of access & use of online learning resources, to what extent, these students are satisfied with online learning amid COVID-19 particularly in handling new challenges are critical to explore. Therefore, in this paper, we aimed to assess and compare the access & use of online learning of Bruneians and Pakistanis amid enforced lockdown imposed by the governments using a five-items satisfaction scale underlying existing literature. Method: For this, a cross-sectional study was done in the first half of June 2020 after the pandemic situation among 320 students' across Pakistan and Brunei and strata with a pre-defined questionnaire. Data were analyzed with statistical software package SPSS 2.0. Results: The finding showed that there is a relationship between students' satisfaction and access & use of online learning. Outcomes of the survey suggest that Bruneian are more satisfied (50%) with the use of online learning amid lockdown as compared to Pakistanis (35.9%). Living in the Urban area as compared to a rural area is also a major factor contributing to satisfaction with the access and use of online learning for both Bruneian and Pakistanis. Moreover, previous experience with the use of online learning is observed prevalent among Bruneians (P=.000), while among friends and family is using online learning (P=.000) were encouraging factors contributed to satisfaction with the use of online learning among Pakistanis amid COVID-19. Correlation results suggest that access and use factors of online learning amid COVID-19 were positively associated with satisfaction among both populations amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. LIMITATIONS: Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed a notable proportion of the pregnant women who exhibited mild anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Targeted interventions in improving sleep conditions might help alleviate gestational anxious and depressive symptoms.","Lin, Wei; Wu, Bo; Chen, Bin; Lai, Guiying; Huang, Shengbin; Li, Shaoli; Liu, Kefu; Zhong, Chuyan; Huang, Weikang; Yuan, Shixin; Wang, Yueyun",J. affect. disord,586,16

Computed tomographies (CT) of the lungs are effective for assessing the state of the infection. Unfortunately, labeling CT scans can take a lot of time and effort, with up to 150 minutes per scan. We address this challenge introducing a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system that accelerates the labeling of CT scan images. Conventionally, active learning methods require the labelers to annotate whole images with full supervision, but that can lead to wasted efforts as many of the annotations could be redundant. Thus, our system presents the annotator with unlabeled regions that promise high information content and low annotation cost. Further, the system allows annotators to label regions using point-level supervision, which is much cheaper to acquire than per-pixel annotations. Our experiments on open-source COVID-19 datasets show that using an entropy-based method to rank unlabeled regions yields to significantly better results than random labeling of these regions. Also, we show that labeling small regions of images is more efficient than labeling whole images. Finally, we show that with only 7\% of the labeling effort required to label the whole training set gives us around 90\% of the performance obtained by training the model on the fully annotated training set.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the rate of AKI among the hospitalized population with COVID-19 and to identify the risk factors associated with AKI among patients with diabetes. Material and Methods. This retrospective cohort study included 254 patients (127 with diabetes and 127 without diabetes) who were admitted for COVID-19 to a tertiary hospital in Tehran, Iran, between February and May 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes, radiological findings, and laboratory data, including data on AKI, hematuria, and proteinuria were recorded and analyzed. Results: Of 254 patients, 142 (55.9%) were male and the mean (± SD) age was 65.7 years (±12.5). In total, 58 patients (22.8%) developed AKI during hospitalization, of whom 36 patients had diabetes (p = 0.04); most patients (74.1%) had stage 1 or 2 AKI. Also, 8 patients (13.8%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT) after developing AKI. Regardless of diabetes status, patients who developed AKI had significantly higher mortality rates compared with patients who did not develop AKI (p = 0.02). Hematuria and proteinuria were observed in 38.1% and 55% of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that invasive mechanical ventilation, proteinuria, HBA1c level, history of cardiovascular disease, and use of statins were independent risk factors for AKI development in patients with diabetes. Conclusion: Results of this study showed that AKI develops in a considerable percentage of patients with COVID-19, especially in those with diabetes, and is significantly associated with mortality.","Khalili, Shayesteh; Sabaghian, Tahereh; Sedaghat, Meghdad; Soroureddin, Zahra; Askari, Elham; Khalili, Neda",J Diabetes Res,586,20

The nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships. An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is given for the basic SI (""susceptible-infective"") network contagion model, which focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main result is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of the system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network models, including""removed""(R) and""exposed""(E) classes, are formulated. These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic modelling.","Hurd, T.

The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODOLOGY: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained daily blanket testing rate of &#8805; 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of &#8805; 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of &#8805; 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our model predicts that active isolation of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic individuals, through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for the control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia, but it would come at a high cost.","Sichone, Joseph; Sinkala, Musalula; Munsaka, Sody; Kikonko, Mervis; Simuunza, Martin",PLoS One,586,16

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been promptly applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 owing to its high amplification efficacy and less requirement of the thermal cycler. However, the vast majority of these LAMP-based assays depend on the non-specific detection of LAMP products, which can not discern the undesirable amplificons, likely to yield unreliable results. Herein, a sequence-specific LAMP assay was reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 using proofreading enzyme-mediated probe cleavage (named Proofman), which could realize real-time and visual detection without uncapping. This assay, introducing a proofreading enzyme and the fluorogenic probe to reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-Proofman-LAMP), can specifically detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a detection limit of 100 copies. In addition to the real-time analysis, the assay is capable of endpoint visualization under a transilluminator within 50 min, providing a convenient reporting manner under the setting of point-of-care testing (POCT). In combination with different fluorophores, the one-pot multiplex assay was successfully achieved to detect multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 and inner control simultaneously. In summary, the development of RT-Proofman-LAMP offers a versatile and highly-specific method for fast field screening and laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2, making it a promising platform in COVID-19 diagnosis.","Ding, Sheng; Chen, Gangyi; Wei, Yinghua; Dong, Juan; Du, Feng; Cui, Xin; Huang, Xin; Tang, Zhuo",Biosens Bioelectron,586,30

While remotely delivering and assessing technology is not new, there are few methods available in the literature that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, and none for older adults specifically. Older adults comprise a very diverse population, including in terms of their experience with and access to technology, making this a challenging endeavor. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to remotely deliver and conduct usability testing for a mobile health technology intervention for older adult participants enrolled in a clinical trial of the technology. This paper describes the methodology used, its successes, and its limitations. METHODS: We developed a conceptual model for remote operations, called the Framework for Agile and Remote Operations (FAR Ops), that combined the general requirements for spaceflight operations with Agile project management processes to quickly respond to this challenge. Using this framework, we iteratively created ""care packages"" that differed in their contents based on participant needs and were sent to study participants in order to deliver the study intervention (a medication management app) and assess its usability. Usability data was collected using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a novel usability questionnaire developed to collect more in-depth data. RESULTS: In the first 6 months of the project, we successfully delivered 21 care packages. We succeeded in designing and deploying a minimum viable product in less than 6 weeks, generally maintained a 2-week sprint cycle, and achieved a 40-50% return rate for both usability assessment instruments. We hypothesize that lack of engagement due to the pandemic and our use of asynchronous communication channels contributed to the return rate of usability assessments being lower than desired. We also provide general recommendations for performing remote usability testing with diverse populations based on the results of our work, including implementing screen-sharing capabilities when possible, and determining participant preference for phone or email communications. CONCLUSIONS: The FAR Ops model allowed our team to adopt remote operations for our mHealth trial, in response to interruptions from COVID-19. This approach can be useful for other research or practical projects, under similar circumstances or to improve efficiency, cost, effectiveness, and participant diversity in general. In addition to offering a replicable approach, this paper tells the often-untold story of practical challenges faced by mobile health projects and practical strategies used to address them.","Hill, Jordan R; Harrington, Addison B; Adeoye, Philip; Campbell, Noll L; Holden, Richard J",,586,23

Respiratory tract infection is one of the commonest causes of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). There has not been evidence suggesting the link between COVID-19 and AECOPD, especially in places with dramatic responses in infection control with universal masking and aggressive social distancing. METHODS: This is a retrospective study to assess the number of admissions of AECOPD in the first three months of 2020 in Queen Mary Hospital with reference to the admissions in past five years. Log-linear model was used for statistical inference of covariates, including percentage of masking, air quality health index and air temperature. RESULTS: The number of admissions for AECOPD significantly decreased by 44.0% (95% CI 36.4%-52.8%, p < 0.001) in the first three months of 2020 compared with the monthly average admission in 2015-2019. Compare to same period of previous years, AECOPD decreased by 1.0% with each percent of increased masking (p < 0.001) and decreased by 3.0% with increase in 1 °C in temperature (p = 0.045). The numbers of admissions for control diagnoses (heart failure, intestinal obstruction and iron deficiency anaemia) in the same period in 2020 were not reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The number of admissions for AECOPD decreased in first three months of 2020, compared with previous years. This was observed with increased masking percentage and social distancing in Hong Kong. We postulated universal masking and social distancing during COVID-19 pandemics both contributed in preventing respiratory tract infections hence AECOPD.","Chan, King Pui Florence; Ma, Ting Fung; Kwok, Wang Chun; Leung, Jackson Ka Chun; Chiang, Ka Yan; Ho, James Chung Man; Lam, David Chi Leung; Tam, Terence Chi Chun; Ip, Mary Sau Man; Ho, Pak Leung",Respir Med,586,16

The key embodiment of traditional medicines is the holistic system of approach in the management of human diseases. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is an ongoing pandemic, which has emerged as the major health threat worldwide and is causing significant stress, morbidity and mortality. Studies from the individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown significant immune dysregulation and cytokine overproduction. Neutrophilia and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio has been correlated to poor outcome due to the disease. Neutrophils, component of innate immune system, upon stimulation expel DNA along with histones and granular proteins to form extracellular traps (NETs). Although, these DNA lattices possess beneficial activity in trapping and eliminating pathogens, NETs may also cause adverse effects by inducing immunothrombosis and tissue damage in diseases including Type 2 Diabetes and atherosclerosis. Tissues of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects showed microthrombi with neutrophil-platelet infiltration and serum showed elevated NETs components, suggesting large involvement and uncontrolled activation of neutrophils leading to pathogenesis and associated organ damage. Hence, traditional Ayurvedic herbs exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may act in a manner that might prove beneficial in targeting over-functioning of neutrophils and there by promoting normal immune homeostasis. In the present manuscript, we have reviewed and discussed pathological importance of NETs formation in SARS-CoV-2 infections and discuss how various Ayurvedic herbs can be explored to modulate neutrophil function and inhibit NETs formation in the context of a) anti-microbial activity to enhance neutrophil function, b) immunomodulatory effects to maintain neutrophil mediated immune homeostasis and c) to inhibit NETs mediated thrombosis.","Joshi, Manjunath B; Kamath, Archana; Nair, Aswathy; Yt, Pooja; Sriranjini, Sitaram J; Gangadharan, G G; Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu",,586,21

The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, as the only current gold standard for screening infected cases, yields a relatively high false positive rate and low sensitivity on asymptomatic subjects. The use of chest X-ray radiography (CXR) images coupled with deep- learning (DL) methods for image classification, represents an attractive adjunct to or replacement for RT-PCR testing. However, its usage has been widely debated over the past few months and its potential effectiveness remains unclear. A number of DL-based methods have been proposed to classify the COVID-19 cases from the normal ones, achieving satisfying high performance. However, these methods show limited performance on the multi-class classification task for COVID-19, pneumonia and normal cases, mainly due to two factors: 1) the textures in COVID-19 CXR images are extremely similar to that of pneumonia cases, and 2) there are much fewer COVID-19 cases compared to the other two classes in the public domain. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed to learn a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model for accurately classifying COVID-19 and pneumonia cases from other normal cases by the use of CXR images. In addition to training the model by use of conventional classification loss which measures classification accuracy, the proposed method innovatively employs a reconstruction loss measuring image fidelity and an adversarial loss measuring class distribution fidelity to assist in the training of the main DCNN model to extract more informative features to support multi-class classification. The experiment results on a COVID-19 dataset demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy compared to other existing DL-based methods. The experiment on another cancer dataset further implies the potential of applying the proposed methods in other medical imaging applications. © 2021 SPIE.","Fan, Z.; He, S.; Ruan, S.; Wang, X.; Li, H.","Medical Imaging 2021: Image-Guided Procedures, Robotic Interventions, and Modeling",586,17

The COVID-19 epidemic has expanded dramatically. The epidemic lockdown of COVID-19 affected air quality due to severe changes in human behavior. Recent research shows that air quality has improved during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social lockdown measures. Africa can avoid outbreaks of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, with cleaner air. However, monitoring air pollution over the continent has required complex efforts to track air quality due to policies, borders, and the continent's nature. Now, satellite data can monitor air quality in cities and countries and bridge the gap in African countries without ground sensors. This paper examines the impact of lockdown on COVID-19 on air pollution in Africa. This study included measurements of the total column concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) from the tropospheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 precursor satellite. This study analyzed the global carbon dioxide concentration in Africa before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic from 15 March to 6 June 2019 and 2020. The results here indicate a small decrease in the CO levels because more than nine hundred million people in Africa depend on energy sources polluted for household uses, resulting from woodburning, kerosene, and charcoal. Many millions of people in Africa live in small crowded houses, bad ventilation and building materials. These dangers cause rising air pollution. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Gharbia, R.; Hassanien, A.

The primary outcome was composites of death, admission to intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The secondary outcome was mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate CCIS as the independent risk factor for death.Among 5621 patients, the high CCIS (&#8805; 3) group showed higher proportion of elderly population and lower plasma hemoglobin and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts.

This study aimed to investigate the suitable timing to transfer D6 blastocysts in FET cycles and to identify factors affecting clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and early miscarriage rate (EMR) in FET cycles with blastocysts. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1788 FET cycles with blastocysts. There were 518 cycles with D6 blastocysts, and 1270 cycles with blastocysts formed and cryopreserved on day 5 (D5 blastocysts) (D5 group). According to the blastocyst transfer timing, the cycles with D6 blastocysts were divided into cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 5 (D6-on-D5 group, 103 cycles) and cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 6 (D6-on-D6 group, 415 cycles). The chi-square test, independent t-test or Mann-Whitney test, and logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The CPR and implantation rate (IR) were significantly higher in the D6-on-D5 group than in the D6-on-D6 group (55.3% vs. 37.3%, 44.8% vs. 32.6%, P < 0.01). The CPR and IR were significantly higher in the D5 group than in the D6-on-D5 group (66.0% vs. 55.3%, 62.1% vs. 44.8%, P < 0.05), and the EMR was significantly lower in the D5 group than in the D6-on-D5 group (11.2% vs. 21.1%, P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that transfer D6 blastocysts on day 5, instead of day 6, could significantly increase the CPR (odds ratio[OR]: 2.031, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.296-3.182, P = 0.002). FET cycles with D6 blastocysts transferred on day 5 had a higher EMR than those with D5 blastocysts (OR: 2.165, 95% CI: 1.040-4.506, P = 0.039). Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) cycles exhibited a higher EMR than natural cycles (OR: 1.953, 95% CI: 1.254-3.043, P = 0.003), while no difference was observed in the CPR (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the suitable timing to transfer D6 blastocysts in FET cycles may be day 5, and D6 blastocyst transfer on day 6 in FET cycles should be avoided. D6 blastocysts transfer and HRT cycles may be associated with a higher EMR.","Xu, Huiling; Qiu, Shumin; Chen, Xiaojing; Zhu, Suqin; Sun, Yan; Zheng, Beihong",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,586,16

This led to coverage of over 9000 deg2 during O3. The delay between the gravitational-wave candidate trigger and the first observation was below 1.5 hour for 50 % of the alerts. We did not detect any electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational-wave candidates during O3, likely due to the very large localisation areas (on average thousands of degrees squares) and relatively large distance of the candidates (above 200 Mpc for 60 % of BNS candidates). We derive constraints on potential kilonova properties for two potential binary neutron star coalescences (GW190425 and S200213t), assuming that the events' locations were imaged.","Antier, S.; Agayeva, S.; Almualla, M.; Awiphan, S.; Baransky, A.; Barynova, K.; Beradze, S.; Blasek, M.; Boer, M.; Burkhonov, O.; Christensen, N.; Coleiro, A.; Corre, D.; Coughlin, M.

Faecal CP discriminates between inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases of the gut and portraits the disease course of human IBD. Recent studies revealed insights into biological functions of the CP subunits S100A8 and S100A9 during orchestration of an inflammatory response at mucosal surfaces across organ systems. In this review, we summarise longitudinal evidence for the evolution of CP from biomarker to rheostat of mucosal inflammation and suggest an algorithm for the interpretation of faecal CP in daily clinical practice. We propose that mechanistic insights into the biological function of CP in the gut and beyond may facilitate interpretation of current assays and guide patient-tailored medical therapy in IBD, a concept warranting controlled clinical trials.","Jukic, Almina; Bakiri, Latifa; Wagner, Erwin F.; Tilg, Herbert; Adolph, Timon E.",Gut,586,24

Considerations using a simple model of growth,12.124566,2.1707792,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Early descriptions of patients admitted to hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a lower prevalence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than would be expected for an acute respiratory disease like COVID-19, leading to speculation that inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) might protect against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or the development of serious sequelae. We assessed the association between ICS and COVID-19-related death among people with COPD or asthma using linked electronic health records (EHRs) in England, UK. METHODS: In this observational study, we analysed patient-level data for people with COPD or asthma from primary care EHRs linked with death data from the Office of National Statistics using the OpenSAFELY platform. The index date (start of follow-up) for both cohorts was March 1, 2020; follow-up lasted until May 6, 2020. For the COPD cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 35 years or older, had COPD, were a current or former smoker, and were prescribed an ICS or long-acting β agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABA–LAMA) as combination therapy within the 4 months before the index date. For the asthma cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had been diagnosed with asthma within 3 years of the index date, and were prescribed an ICS or short-acting β agonist (SABA) only within the 4 months before the index date. We compared the outcome of COVID-19-related death between people prescribed an ICS and those prescribed alternative respiratory medications: ICSs versus LABA–LAMA for the COPD cohort, and low-dose or medium-dose and high-dose ICSs versus SABAs only in the asthma cohort. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between exposure categories and the outcome in each population, adjusted for age, sex, and all other prespecified covariates. We calculated e-values to quantify the effect of unmeasured confounding on our results. FINDINGS: We identified 148 557 people with COPD and 818 490 people with asthma who were given relevant respiratory medications in the 4 months before the index date. People with COPD who were prescribed ICSs were at increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared with those prescribed LABA–LAMA combinations (adjusted HR 1·39 [95% CI 1·10–1·76]). Compared with those prescribed SABAs only, people with asthma who were prescribed high-dose ICS were at an increased risk of death (1·55 [1·10–2·18]), whereas those given a low or medium dose were not (1·14 [0·85–1·54]). Sensitivity analyses showed that the apparent harmful association we observed could be explained by relatively small health differences between people prescribed ICS and those not prescribed ICS that were not recorded in the database (e value lower 95% CI 1·43). INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support a major role for regular ICS use in protecting against COVID-19-related death among people with asthma or COPD. Observed increased risks of COVID-19-related death can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.

The present study is one of the first Italian nationwide survey within the first period of the COVID-19 outbreak aimed to understand the social and psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: An online survey collected information on sociodemographic data, history of direct or indirect contact with COVID-19, and other information concerning the COVID-19 emergency. The General Psychological Well-Being Index and a modified version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, focused on the COVID-19 experience, assessed the respondents' general psychological condition. Results: Of 1,639 respondents equally distributed in the Italian territory, 5.1% reported PTSD symptomatology, and 48.2% evidenced lower psychological well-being linked to COVID-19 diffusion. Lower psychological well-being was significantly higher in women, younger than 50 years, and with health risk factors. Lower psychological well-being was also detected in individuals who did not know if they were infected, who have had direct exposure or were uncertain about their exposure to COVID-19, or who knew infected people. Regarding the social and behavioral consequences, respondents perceived worsening in demographic, economic, social, and relational conditions. Moreover, they reported increased film viewing, cookhouse time, social media use, and decreased physical activity. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a risk factor for psychological diseases in the Italian population, as previously reported in the Chinese people. About half of the respondents reported a significant psychological impact. Moreover, we confirmed the role of restraining measures that led to modify lifestyles, social perception, and confidence in the institutions. These results underline the need for further studies aimed to develop psychological interventions to minimize the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Favieri, Francesca; Forte, Giuseppe; Tambelli, Renata; Casagrande, Maria",Front Psychiatry,586,21

Here, we presented a 33-year-old female patient with COVID-19, reporting acute-onset paranoid delusions symptoms, insomnia and irritability. Cranial MRI showed an hyperintense signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum with decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, which might possibly indicate the presence of cytotoxic edema related to the brain involvement of the infection. Following the completion of SARS-CoV-2 treatment, both cytotoxic edema and psychiatric symptoms resolved. In light of this report, we suggest that either heightened immune response and direct viral infection that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to such psychiatric manifestations and neuropsychiatric monitoring should be performed in patients with COVID-19.

RECENT FINDINGS: The restructuring of cardiovascular services to preserve hospital beds and personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic had a profound effect on healthcare delivery around the world with unintended consequences. In the United States, a significant 38% reduction in CCL activations for STEMI was noted in the early phase of the pandemic. Similarly, a 34% decline in utilization of invasive angiography, an 18% reduction in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), and a 19% increase in door-to-balloon (D2B) times were also observed. These trends coincided with a significant increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and late MI presentations. A shift to pharmacological reperfusion has been advocated in Asia, which resulted in increased morbidity and mortality. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has negatively affected many aspects of STEMI care, including timely access to mechanical reperfusion, which has resulted in increased morbidity and mortality. Balancing optimal STEMI care with the risk of infection to healthcare workers during the pandemic is challenging.

We assess the possible explanations ranging from issues of ascertainment, historically lower opportunities for spillover, aspects of human demographic changes, as well as features of pathogen biology and pre-existing adaptive immunity to related viruses. We describe how successful emergent viral species must triangulate transmission, virulence, and host immunity to maintain circulation. Characterizing factors that might shape the limits of viral persistence can delineate promising research directions to better understand the combinations of pathogens and contexts most likely to lead to spillover.","Rice, Benjamin L.; Douek, Daniel C.; McDermott, Adrian B.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Metcalf, C.

To assess trends across populations for which CoViD-19 deaths might not be available by age and sex, an indirect age-and-sex adjustment can still be performed. The corresponding Comparative CoViD-19 Mortality Ratio (CCMR) only requires population age and sex compositions. To compare CoViD-19 and overall mortality levels, the Crude Death Rate (CDR) and life expectancy at birth for recent calendar years are the most widely available overall mortality indicators. Readily comparable to an annual CDR, a Crude CoViD-19 Death Rate (CCDR) can be calculated for periods of any duration. CoViD-19-induced declines in projected life expectancy at birth for 2020 can also be calculated from existing life tables. We calculate the CCMR and CCDR for the period from their first CoViD-19 death to the present using US age and sex data and current estimates of CoViD-19 deaths in 166 Countries whose population composition is available from the UN, 28 Provinces in China, the 50 United States and DC. Across these 245 populations, 14 States and 11 Countries have CCMR values above 1—the US value by construction. Most affected to date, the period CCDR in New York exceeds its CDR for the most recent year available (7.83 per thousand in 2017). We also calculate CCMR and CCDR values corresponding to projections for the 50 States and DC, and for 49 countries, for which we can additionally calculate reductions in 2020 life expectancy at birth using UN life tables. This suggests life-expectancy reductions between .5 and 1 year for 7 European Countries, 3 South-American Countries and the US. The .55 reduction in the U.S. amounts to nearly twice the largest single-year decline induced by HIV/AIDS (−.3 between 1992 and 1993) or the total decline induced by opioid overdoses (also −.3 between 2014 and 2017), and would bring US life expectancy at birth down to its lowest level since 2008. As current CoViD-19 death counts likely underestimate the total increase in deaths and current projections do not account for possible new infection waves later this year, the impact on 2020 life expectancies at birth should be expected to exceed these figures.","Heuveline, Patrick; Tzen, Michael",medRxiv,586,30

To identify non-specific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalisation due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (area under the curve − AUC) for positive and negative cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) exam. C-reactive protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalisation could have happened due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate-to-severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils and age.","Ishikawa, G.; Argenti, G.; Fadel, C.

Clinical use is primarily limited to prophylaxis due to delayed second-cycle parasite death at 1–3 µM serum concentrations. DOX concentrations > 5 µM kill parasites with first-cycle activity but are thought to involve off-target mechanisms outside the apicoplast. We report that 10 µM DOX blocks apicoplast biogenesis in the first cycle and is rescued by isopentenyl pyrophosphate, an essential apicoplast product, confirming an apicoplast-specific mechanism. Exogenous iron rescues parasites and apicoplast biogenesis from first- but not second-cycle effects of 10 µM DOX, revealing that first-cycle activity involves a metal-dependent mechanism distinct from the delayed-death mechanism. These results critically expand the paradigm for understanding the fundamental antiparasitic mechanisms of DOX and suggest repurposing DOX as a faster acting antimalarial at higher dosing whose multiple mechanisms would be expected to limit parasite resistance.","Okada, Megan; Guo, Ping; Nalder, Shai-anne; Sigala, Paul A",eLife,586,23

NiV can cause Acute Lung Injury (ALI) in humans, and human-to-human transmission has been observed in recent outbreaks of NiV. While the exact route of transmission to humans is not known, we have previously shown that NiV can efficiently infect human respiratory epithelial cells. The molecular mechanisms of NiV-associated ALI in the human respiratory tract are unknown. Thus, there is an urgent need for models of henipavirus infection of the human respiratory tract to study the pathogenesis and understand the host responses. Here, we describe a novel human lung xenograft model in mice to study the pathogenesis of NiV. Following transplantation, human fetal lung xenografts rapidly graft and develop mature structures of adult lungs including cartilage, vascular vessels, ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and primitive “air” spaces filled with mucus and lined by cuboidal to flat epithelium. Following infection, NiV grows to high titers (10(7) TCID(50)/gram lung tissue) as early as 3 days post infection (pi). NiV targets both the endothelium as well as respiratory epithelium in the human lung tissues, and results in syncytia formation. NiV infection in the human lung results in the production of several cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IP-10, eotaxin, G-CSF and GM-CSF on days 5 and 7 pi. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NiV can replicate to high titers in a novel in vivo model of the human respiratory tract, resulting in a robust inflammatory response, which is known to be associated with ALI. This model will facilitate progress in the fundamental understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis and virus-host interactions; it will also provide biologically relevant models for other respiratory viruses.","Valbuena, Gustavo; Halliday, Hailey; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Goez, Yenny; Rockx, Barry",PLoS Pathog,586,6

This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of Jordanian physicians toward public health surveillance of communicable disease. A cross-sectional study was conducted among resident doctors who were working in 4 main Ministry of Health hospitals and 2 teaching hospitals in Jordan in September 2017. A self-administered paper-based questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire collected information about sociodemographic and practice-related characteristics of physicians and included items to assess their knowledge of surveillance and reporting practices. This study included 223 physicians (152 males and 71 females). About 60.1% of the residents were graduates from medical schools in Jordan and the remaining (39.9%) were graduates from medical schools in other countries. Approximately two thirds of residents (62.3%) were doing their residency in Ministry of Health hospitals and the rest (37.7%) in 2 teaching hospitals. Only 44.8% of physicians had defined surveillance correctly. Only 27.4% of physicians had been educated or trained on surveillance. About 39.5% of physicians had filled at least one report form during their practice. The main reasons for not reporting mandatory diseases were high workload (49.8%) and being not trained on reporting diseases (46.6%).

Mapping the trajectories of variants, we found that while some have become ‘endemic’ to the Bronx, other, novel variants rose in prevalence in the late summer/early fall.

METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed medical records including socio-demographics, past medical history, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, treatment and disease outcome of 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 54 years (IQR: 38–64), and there was no significant gender difference (51% of male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (55 [34%]), diabetes (31 [19%]) and obesity (13 [8%]). Fever (93 [58%]), cough (92 [57%]), fatigue (87 [54%]), shortness of breath (72 [45%]) and myalgia (33 [21%]) were the most common symptoms, upon admission. Patients were categorized into mild (92 [57%]), moderate (19 [12%]) and severe (49 [31%]). Severe patients were older and were more likely to have comorbidities, compared to mild ones. The majority of patients (92% [147 of 160]) patients received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate. Regression model revealed that older age, lower SpO2, higher heart rate and elevated AST at admission were all risk factors associated with in-hospital death. The prevalence of COVID-19 and malaria co-infection was 0.63% and 70 (44%) of all patients received antimalarial treatment before hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that the epidemiological and clinical feature of COVID-19 patients in Kinshasa are broadly similar to previous reports from other settings. Older age, lower SpO2, tachycardia, and elevated AST could help to identify patients at higher risk of death at an early stage of the illness. Plasmodium spp co-infection was not common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Matangila, Junior Rika; Nyembu, Ritha Kibambe; Telo, Gloire Mosala; Ngoy, Christian Djuba; Sakobo, Taty Msueun; Massolo, Joel Mbembo; Muyembe, Blandine Mbo; Mvwala, Richard Kapela; Ilunga, Cedric Kabemba; Limbole, Emmanuel Bakilo; Ntalaja, Jeff Mukengeshay; Kongo, Roger Minga",PLoS One,586,16

However, the burnout of village doctors is gravely threatening the stability of rural primary medical system step by step. This study systematically evaluated the effects of personality, work engagement and alexithymia on burnout of village doctors, and further measured and assessed the mediating effect of alexithymia and work engagement in the association between personality and burnout. METHODS: The subjects were 2684 village doctors in Jining, Shandong Province, China, from May to June 2019. Sociodemographic characteristics, alexithymia, personality, work engagement and job burnout were quantitated by self-completed questionnaire and measured by Likert 5–7 scale. One-way ANOVA, Person correlation analysis, and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used for statistical analysis and mediating effect evaluation. RESULTS: 2693 questionnaires were collected in total, of which 2684 were valid, with an effective rate of 96.2%. 65.2% of village doctors were diagnosed with burnout, and 54.3% showed moderate to severe emotional exhaustion, 61.6% showed moderate to severe low sense of personal achievement, and 33.9% showed moderate to severe depersonalization burnout. Personality had a direct positive effect on work engagement (β = 0.50, p < 0.001), a direct negative effect on alexithymia (β = − 0.52, p < 0.001) and burnout (β = − 0.50, p < 0.001) respectively. Work engagement had a direct negative effect on burnout (β = − 0.10, p < 0.001), while alexithymia had a direct positive effect on burnout (β = 0.16, p < 0.001). In the path between personality and burnout, both work engagement 95%CI:(− 0.17)–(− 0.08), and alexithymia 95%CI:(− 0.36)–(− 0.09), have significant mediating effects. These results strongly confirm that personality, alexithymia, and work engagement are early and powerful predicators of burnout. CONCLUSION: According to the results, medical administrators should pay attention to the personality characteristics of village doctors in vocational training, practice selection and job assignment, encourage village doctors to reflect on their own personality actively, and to reduce job burnout by obtaining necessary social support, constructing reasonable achievable career expectations, improving time management ability, and participating in psychological counselling programs.

Despite the application of, for example, the “Polluter Pays” principle in South African environmental legislation, to generators of waste, which would include veterinarians, there appears to be little awareness of and even less enforcement of the legislation in this regard. This paper reports on a 2001–2003 survey of management practices of the five waste contractors servicing just over half of the veterinarians in Durban, South Africa’s second largest city. Some of their activities, when evaluated in terms of the legislation, guidelines and policies relating to waste handling and disposal, were found to be non-compliant. Since any discussion on waste management should take cognisance of waste from generation to final disposal, the responsibility of veterinarians as waste generators is also discussed in the light of the recent developments in health care waste management in South Africa. This study presents a review of past and current policies, legislation and guidelines that have application to veterinary waste.

Here, we develop an attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing ZIKV prM-E-NS1 as a polyprotein. This vectored vaccine candidate is attenuated in mice, where a single immunization induces ZIKV-specific antibody and T cell immune responses that provide protection against ZIKV challenge. Co-expression of prM, E, and NS1 induces significantly higher levels of Th2 and Th17 cytokine responses than prM-E. In addition, NS1 alone is capable of conferring partial protection against ZIKV infection in mice even though it does not induce neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate that attenuated rVSV co-expressing prM, E, and NS1 is a promising vaccine candidate for protection against ZIKV infection and highlights an important role for NS1 in ZIKV-specific cellular immune responses.","Li, Anzhong; Yu, Jingyou; Lu, Mijia; Ma, Yuanmei; Attia, Zayed; Shan, Chao; Xue, Miaoge; Liang, Xueya; Craig, Kelsey; Makadiya, Nirajkumar; He, Jennifer J.; Jennings, Ryan; Shi, Pei-Yong; Peeples, Mark E.; Liu, Shan-Lu; Boyaka, Prosper N.; Li, Jianrong",Nat Commun,586,16

METHODS: The clinical characteristics and laboratory findings, including cytokine and lymphocyte subsets, were obtained from the electronic medical records of patients in Wuhan Tongji Hospital. RESULTS: This study included 836 patients with confirmed COVID-19. In total, 699 (83.6%) were cured and discharged, and 137 (16.4%) died. Our analysis revealed that age ≥ 65 years, male sex, malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, dizziness, respiratory rate > 20 bpm, heart rate > 100 bpm, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, neutrophils > 6.3×109/L, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, D-dimer ≥ 0.5 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase > 250 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase > 40 U/L, total bilirubin > 26 μmol/L, albumin < 35 g/L, blood urea nitrogen > 9.5 mmol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 90 ml/min/1.73, elevated cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ≥ 900 pg/ml, C-reactive protein ≥ 25 mg/L, procalcitonin ≥ 0.05 ng/ml and ferritin > 400 μg/L were associated with death in patients with COVID-19. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 90 ml/min/1.73, elevated cardiac troponin I, C-reactive protein ≥ 25 mg/L and procalcitonin ≥ 0.05 ng/ml were predictive of mortality. Regarding immune responses, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα were remarkably higher in the deceased group at admission, and the levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα in the deceased group showed a rapid increase; the dynamics of these cytokines were highly consistent with disease deterioration. Lymphocyte subset analysis revealed that the deceased patients showed significant decreases in lymphocyte counts, especially helper T cells, suppressor T cells and NK cells.

METHODS: Data were collected from publicly available sources, including the County Health Rankings and the New York Times. The dependent variable was the percent of county residents who reported frequently or always wearing a mask when in public. County demographics and voting patterns served as controls. Two-levels random effects regression models were used to examine the study hypotheses. RESULTS: Results indicate that, after considering the effects of the controls, Health Behaviors were positively associated with mask wearing, the Physical Environment held a negative association, and Clinical Care and Social and Behavioral Factors were unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that patterns of healthy behaviors can help predict compliance with public health mandates that can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. From an instutitional theory perspective, the data suggest counties develop collective values and norms around health. Thus, public health officials can seek to alter governance structures and normative behaviors to improve healthy behaviors.","Cunningham, George B.; Nite, Calvin",BMC Public Health,586,17

This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS. Methods The epidemiology of GBS cases reported via the UK National Immunoglobulin Database were studied from 2016-2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the cohort study, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society reported all cases of GBS during the pandemic. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases were compared. Results The UK GBS incidence from 2016-2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100,000 people per year. GBS and COVID-19 incidence varied between regions and did not correlate (r = 0.06, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.63, p=0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-2019. Forty-seven GBS cases were included in the cohort study (13 definite, 12 probable COVID-19 and 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome. Intubation was more frequent in the COVID-19+ve cohort (7/13, 54% vs 5/22, 23% in COVID negative) thought to be related directly to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Conclusions This study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS.

Hospital-based care for COVID-19 is often needed, particularly among older adults. However, a key barrier to accessing hospital care in sub-Saharan Africa is travel time to the nearest health-care facility. To inform the geographical targeting of additional health-care resources, we aimed to estimate travel time at a 1 km × 1 km resolution to the nearest hospital and to the nearest health-care facility of any type for adults aged 60 years and older in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We assembled a dataset on the geolocation of health-care facilities, separately for hospitals and any type of health-care facility and including both private-sector and public-sector facilities, using data from the OpenStreetMap project and the Kenya Medical Research Institute–Wellcome Trust Programme. Population data at a 1 km × 1 km resolution were obtained from WorldPop. We estimated travel time to the nearest health-care facility for each 1 km × 1 km grid using a cost–distance algorithm. Findings 9·6% (95% CI 5·2–16·9) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time to the nearest hospital of 6 h or longer, varying from 0·0% (0·0–3·7) in Burundi and The Gambia to 40·9% (31·8–50·7) in Sudan. For the nearest health-care facility of any type (whether primary, secondary, or tertiary care), 15·9% (95% CI 10·1–24·4) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time of 2 h or longer, ranging from 0·4% (0·0–4·4) in Burundi to 59·4% (50·1–69·0) in Sudan. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa contained populated areas in which adults aged 60 years and older had a travel time to the nearest hospital of 12 h or longer and to the nearest health-care facility of any type of 6 h or longer. The median travel time to the nearest hospital for the fifth of adults aged 60 years or older with the longest travel times was 348 min (IQR 240–576; equal to 5·8 h) for the entire population of sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from 41 min (34–54) in Burundi to 1655 min (1065–2440; equal to 27·6 h) in Gabon. Interpretation Our high-resolution maps of estimated travel times to both hospitals and health-care facilities of any type can be used by policy makers and non-governmental organisations to help target additional health-care resources, such as makeshift hospitals or transport programmes to existing health-care facilities, to older adults with the least physical access to care. In addition, this analysis shows the locations of population groups most likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to health-care facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform the efforts of countries to improve physical access to care for conditions that are common among older adults in the region, such as chronic non-communicable diseases.

This instrument couples the forward small-angle single particle counting method with the lateral group particle photometry method in a single device. The mass concentration of four sizes of inhalable particles in the environment can be detected simultaneously in a large area in real-time without using a particle impactor. Different from the traditional light scattering instrument, this new optical instrument can detect darker particles with strong light absorption, and the measurement results mainly depend on the particle size and ignore the properties of the particles. Comparative experiments have shown that the instrument can detect particles with different properties by simply calibrating the environmental density parameters, and the measurement results have good stability and accuracy.","Zhang, Rongrui; Zhao, Heng",Sensors (Basel),586,11

Many genetic counselors (GCs) moved from in-person to telehealth services. Others were redeployed by choice or necessity, using their expertise to provide COVID-19 care and education. For some, their employment status changed due to budgetary constraints or decreasing referrals. This study surveyed North American GCs to assess the relative use of genetic counseling Practice-Based Competencies (PBCs) as a proxy for the skills used during the first wave of the pandemic, whether GCs were in their current role or in new or adjusted roles. A secondary aim was to determine whether GCs believe their training should be refocused in view of the workforce shifts posed by the pandemic. The survey comprised closed- and open-ended questions and was completed in full by 97 respondents. The study population was representative of the general genetic counseling workforce in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, age, and practice area when compared to the National Society of Genetic Counselors 2020 Professional Status Survey. Most participants (97.9%) indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a change to their work, and 89.7% used at least one PBC at a different frequency than before the pandemic. The most significant change was the adaptation of genetic counseling skills for varied service delivery models: 83.5% of respondents indicated that their roles and responsibilities moved to a remote setting and/or utilized telehealth. The majority of participants felt competent using the PBCs during the pandemic. Major themes that emerged from the qualitative data were as follows: (a) adaptation of service delivery, (b) translation of genetic counseling skills, and (c) provision of psychosocial support. This study highlights practice changes for GCs due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the increased use of, and need for focused training in, varied service delivery models.","Wagner, Naomi E; Witherington, Sarah; Waldman, Larissa; Ryan, Lauren; Hardy, Melanie W",Journal of genetic counseling,586,5

A wide array of causal links connecting CVD and COVID-19 baffle the overall prognosis as well as the efficacy of the given therapeutic interventions. At the centre of this puzzle lies ACE2 that works as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2, and functional expression of which is also needed to minimize vasoconstriction otherwise would lead to high blood pressure. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to reduce the functional expression of ACE2. Given these circumstances, it might be advisable to consider a treatment plan for COVID-19 patients with CVD in an approach that would neither aggravate the vasodeleterious arm of the renin-angiotensinogen-aldosterone system (RAAS) nor compromise the vasoprotective arm of RAAS but is effective to minimize or if possible, inhibit the viral replication. Given the immune modulatory role of Zn in both CVD and COVID-19 pathogenesis, zinc supplement to the selective treatment plan for CVD and COVID-19 comorbid conditions, to be decided by the clinicians depending on the cardiovascular conditions of the patients, might greatly improve the therapeutic outcome. Notably, ACE2 is a zinc metalloenzyme and zinc is also known to inhibit viral replication.","Manjurul Karim, Muhammad; Sultana, Shahnaz; Sultana, Rokaia; Rahman, Mohammad Tariqur",J Infect Public Health,586,1

Paratesticular leiomyosarcoma represents a very rare subtype of sarcoma. Here we describe a 57-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and a voluminous mass in the right paratesticular region. At the appearance of the scrotal mass 9 months prior, he had refused to undergo a urological evaluation due to fear of contracting COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: CD146+ circulating endothelial cells (CD146+ CECs) and their progenitors (CEPs) are increased in cardiovascular, thrombotic, infectious and cancer diseases. The present study was designed to investigate their kinetics in Covid‐19 patients. METHOD: We used a validated flow cytometry procedure to enumerate viable and apoptotic CD146+ CECs and CEPs in Covid‐19 patients during the course of the disease and in patients who recovered. RESULT: Viable CEPs/mL were significantly increased in Covid‐19 patients compared to healthy controls. This increase was observed in patients with mild symptoms and not further augmented in patients with severe symptoms. In patients who recovered, CEPs decreased, but were in a range still significantly higher than normal controls. Regarding mature CD146+ CECs, in Covid‐19 patients their absolute number was similar to those observed in healthy controls, but the viable/apoptotic CD146+ CEC ratio was significantly different. Both mild and severe Covid‐19 patients had significantly less apoptotic CD146+ CECs compared to healthy controls. Patients who recovered had significantly less CD146+ CECs/mL when compared to controls as well as to mild and severe Covid‐19 patients. A positive correlation was found between the copies of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in the cellular fraction and apoptotic CEPs/mL in severe Covid‐19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD146+ CECs and CEPs might be investigated as candidate biomarkers of endothelial damage in Covid‐19 patients.","Mancuso, Patrizia; Gidaro, Antonio; Gregato, Giuliana; Raveane, Alessandro; Cremonesi, Paola; Quarna, Jessica; Caccia, Sonia; Gusso, Luca; Rusconi, Stefano; Giacomelli, Andrea; Cogliati, Chiara; Bertolini, Francesco",J Thromb Haemost,586,21

One of the most important clinical manifestations is pneumonia and the subsequent worsening of the hyperinflammatory state and cytokine storm. Tocilizumab (TCB) is a recombinant humanized, anti-human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1k (IgG1k) subclass that acts against soluble and membrane-bound interleukin six receptors (IL-6R). There is wide use of TCB in rheumatic diseases. However, recently this medication has been used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tocilizumab application in COVID-19 patients with a high risk of a cytokine storm shows a positive response in reducing the mortality rate. Moreover, TCB minimizes the time needed to recover, improves oxygenation, shortens the duration of vasopressor support, and reduces the likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore we provide an overview of recent studies to understand the efficacy of this drug under various circumstances, including COVID-19 and rheumatic pathologies. This article also explores and integrates the different treatment possibilities in prominent anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory-related symptoms. The preliminary data demonstrate promising results regarding the efficacy of TCB use in severe COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials, with adequate sample sizes and sufficient follow-up periods, are needed to form conclusions and establish treatment recommendations.","Grygiel-Górniak, Bogna; Shaikh, Osama; Kumar, Nikita Niranjan; Hsu, Shao Heng; Samborski, Włodzimierz",Reumatologia,586,1

As the infrastructure of aviation industry, the airport network is one of the most important indicators of economic growth. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the Chinese airport network (CAN) via complex network theory. It is found that although the topology of CAN has remained steady during the past few years, there are many dynamic switchings inside the network, which have changed the relative importance of airports and airlines. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic continues to grow in an exponential form and has evident seasonal fluctuations. We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities.","Zhang, Jun; Cao, Xian-Bin; Du, Wen-Bo; Cai, Kai-Quan",Physica A,586,20
