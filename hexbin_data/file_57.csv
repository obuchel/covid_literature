80,Association and Host Selectivity in Multi-Host Pathogens,2006-12-20,"The distribution of multi-host pathogens over their host range conditions their population dynamics and structure. Also, host co-infection by different pathogens may have important consequences for the evolution of hosts and pathogens, and host-pathogen co-evolution. Hence it is of interest to know if the distribution of pathogens over their host range is random, or if there are associations between hosts and pathogens, or between pathogens sharing a host. To analyse these issues we propose indices for the observed patterns of host infection by pathogens, and for the observed patterns of co-infection, and tests to analyse if these patterns conform to randomness or reflect associations. Applying these tests to the prevalence of five plant viruses on 21 wild plant species evidenced host-virus associations: most hosts and viruses were selective for viruses and hosts, respectively. Interestingly, the more host-selective viruses were the more prevalent ones, suggesting that host specialisation is a successful strategy for multi-host pathogens. Analyses also showed that viruses tended to associate positively in co-infected hosts. The developed indices and tests provide the tools to analyse how strong and common are these associations among different groups of pathogens, which will help to understand and model the population biology of multi-host pathogens.","Malpica, José M.; Sacristán, Soledad; Fraile, Aurora; García-Arenal, Fernando",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762347/,57
95,Global Surveillance of Emerging Influenza Virus Genotypes by Mass Spectrometry,2007-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Effective influenza surveillance requires new methods capable of rapid and inexpensive genomic analysis of evolving viral species for pandemic preparedness, to understand the evolution of circulating viral species, and for vaccine strain selection. We have developed one such approach based on previously described broad-range reverse transcription PCR/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of base compositions of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, NP) are used to provide sub-species identification and infer influenza virus H and N subtypes. Using this approach, we detected and correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates, representing 30 different H and N types, including 29 avian H5N1 isolates. Further, direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected over a seven-year period (1999–2006) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes with >97% sensitivity and specificity. Base composition derived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100% concordance to previously established clades. Ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons (2005–2006) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating H3N2 strains worldwide. Mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1% of these recent samples providing a view into viral evolution. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, rapid RT-PCR/ESI-MS analysis can be used to simultaneously identify all species of influenza viruses with clade-level resolution, identify mixed viral populations and monitor global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes. This high-throughput method promises to become an integral component of influenza surveillance.","Sampath, Rangarajan; Russell, Kevin L.; Massire, Christian; Eshoo, Mark W.; Harpin, Vanessa; Blyn, Lawrence B.; Melton, Rachael; Ivy, Cristina; Pennella, Thuy; Li, Feng; Levene, Harold; Hall, Thomas A.; Libby, Brian; Fan, Nancy; Walcott, Demetrius J.; Ranken, Raymond; Pear, Michael; Schink, Amy; Gutierrez, Jose; Drader, Jared; Moore, David; Metzgar, David; Addington, Lynda; Rothman, Richard; Gaydos, Charlotte A.; Yang, Samuel; St. George, Kirsten; Fuschino, Meghan E.; Dean, Amy B.; Stallknecht, David E.; Goekjian, Ginger; Yingst, Samuel; Monteville, Marshall; Saad, Magdi D.; Whitehouse, Chris A.; Baldwin, Carson; Rudnick, Karl H.; Hofstadler, Steven A.; Lemon, Stanley M.; Ecker, David J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876795/,57
161,Ubiquitination Is Required for Effective Replication of Coxsackievirus B3,2008-07-09,"BACKGROUND: Protein ubiquitination and/or degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) have been recognized as critical mechanisms in the regulation of numerous essential cellular functions. The importance of the UPS in viral pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent. Using murine cardiomyocytes, we have previously demonstrated that the UPS plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an important human pathogen associated with various diseases. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the interplay between the UPS and CVB3, focusing on the role of ubiquitination in viral lifecycle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As assessed by in situ hybridization, Western blot, and plaque assay, we showed that proteasome inhibition decreased CVB3 RNA replication, protein synthesis, and viral titers in HeLa cells. There were no apparent changes in 20S proteasome activities following CVB3 infection. However, we found viral infection led to an accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates, accompanied by a decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin, implicating an important role of ubiquitination in the UPS-mediated viral replication. Using small-interfering RNA, we demonstrated that gene-silencing of ubiquitin significantly reduced viral titers, possibly through downregulation of protein ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and/or degradation. Inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes apparently enhances the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. Finally, by immunoprecipitation, we showed that coxsackieviral polymerase 3D was post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and such modification might be a prerequisite for its function in transcriptional regulation of viral genome. CONCLUSION: Coxsackievirus infection promotes protein ubiquitination, contributing to effective viral replication, probably through ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase.","Si, Xiaoning; Gao, Guang; Wong, Jerry; Wang, Yahong; Zhang, Jingchun; Luo, Honglin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440516/,57
179,Analysis of synonymous codon usage and evolution of begomoviruses,2008-08-29,"Begomoviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses and cause severe diseases in major crop plants worldwide. Based on current genome sequence analyses, we found that synonymous codon usage variations in the protein-coding genes of begomoviruses are mainly influenced by mutation bias. Base composition analysis suggested that the codon usage bias of AV1 and BV1 genes is significant and their expressions are high. Fourteen codons were determined as translational optimal ones according to the comparison of codon usage patterns between highly and lowly expressed genes. Interestingly the codon usages between begomoviruses from the Old and the New Worlds are apparently different, which supports the idea that the bipartite begomoviruses of the New World might originate from bipartite ones of the Old World, whereas the latter evolve from the Old World monopartite begomoviruses.","Xu, Xiao-zhong; Liu, Qing-po; Fan, Long-jiang; Cui, Xiao-feng; Zhou, Xue-ping",Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2528880?pdf=render,57
402,Class II Transactivator (CIITA) Enhances Cytoplasmic Processing of HIV-1 Pr55Gag,2010-06-24,"BACKGROUND: The Pr55(gag) (Gag) polyprotein of HIV serves as a scaffold for virion assembly and is thus essential for progeny virion budding and maturation. Gag localizes to the plasma membrane (PM) and membranes of late endosomes, allowing for release of infectious virus directly from the cell membrane and/or upon exocytosis. The host factors involved in Gag trafficking to these sites are largely unknown. Upon activation, CD4+ T cells, the primary target of HIV infection, express the class II transcriptional activator (CIITA) and therefore the MHC class II isotype, HLA-DR. Similar to Gag, HLA-DR localizes to the PM and at the membranes of endosomes and specialized vesicular MHC class II compartments (MIICs). In HIV producer cells, transient HLA-DR expression induces intracellular Gag accumulation and impairs virus release. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that both stable and transient expression of CIITA in HIV producer cells does not induce HLA-DR-associated intracellular retention of Gag, but does increase the infectivity of virions. However, neither of these phenomena is due to recapitulation of the class II antigen presentation pathway or CIITA-mediated transcriptional activation of virus genes. Interestingly, we demonstrate that CIITA, apart from its transcriptional effects, acts cytoplasmically to enhance Pr160(gag-pol) (Gag-Pol) levels and thereby the viral protease and Gag processing, accounting for the increased infectivity of virions from CIITA-expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that CIITA enhances HIV Gag processing, and provides the first evidence of a novel, post-transcriptional, cytoplasmic function for a well-known transactivator.","Porter, Kristen A.; Kelley, Lauren N.; George, Annette; Harton, Jonathan A.; Duus, Karen M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892040/,57
590,GI-type T4SS-mediated horizontal transfer of the 89K pathogenicity island in epidemic Streptococcus suis serotype 2,2011-03-11,"Pathogenicity islands (PAIs), a distinct type of genomic island (GI), play important roles in the rapid adaptation and increased virulence of pathogens. 89K is a newly identified PAI in epidemic Streptococcus suis isolates that are related to the two recent large-scale outbreaks of human infection in China. However, its mechanism of evolution and contribution to the epidemic spread of S. suis 2 remain unknown. In this study, the potential for mobilization of 89K was evaluated, and its putative transfer mechanism was investigated. We report that 89K can spontaneously excise to form an extrachromosomal circular product. The precise excision is mediated by an 89K-borne integrase through site-specific recombination, with help from an excisionase. The 89K excision intermediate acts as a substrate for lateral transfer to non-89K S. suis 2 recipients, where it reintegrates site-specifically into the target site. The conjugal transfer of 89K occurred via a GI type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded in 89K, at a frequency of 10(−6) transconjugants per donor. This is the first demonstration of horizontal transfer of a Gram-positive PAI mediated by a GI-type T4SS. We propose that these genetic events are important in the emergence, pathogenesis and persistence of epidemic S. suis 2 strains.","Li, Ming; Shen, Xiaodong; Yan, Jinghua; Han, Huiming; Zheng, Beiwen; Liu, Di; Cheng, Hao; Zhao, Yan; Rao, Xiancai; Wang, Changjun; Tang, Jiaqi; Hu, Fuquan; Gao, George F",Mol Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132442/,57
666,Porcine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and analysis of their peptide-binding specificities,2011-07-08,"In all vertebrate animals, CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are controlled by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. These are highly polymorphic peptide receptors selecting and presenting endogenously derived epitopes to circulating CTLs. The polymorphism of the MHC effectively individualizes the immune response of each member of the species. We have recently developed efficient methods to generate recombinant human MHC-I (also known as human leukocyte antigen class I, HLA-I) molecules, accompanying peptide-binding assays and predictors, and HLA tetramers for specific CTL staining and manipulation. This has enabled a complete mapping of all HLA-I specificities (“the Human MHC Project”). Here, we demonstrate that these approaches can be applied to other species. We systematically transferred domains of the frequently expressed swine MHC-I molecule, SLA-1*0401, onto a HLA-I molecule (HLA-A*11:01), thereby generating recombinant human/swine chimeric MHC-I molecules as well as the intact SLA-1*0401 molecule. Biochemical peptide-binding assays and positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries were used to analyze the peptide-binding motifs of these molecules. A pan-specific predictor of peptide–MHC-I binding, NetMHCpan, which was originally developed to cover the binding specificities of all known HLA-I molecules, was successfully used to predict the specificities of the SLA-1*0401 molecule as well as the porcine/human chimeric MHC-I molecules. These data indicate that it is possible to extend the biochemical and bioinformatics tools of the Human MHC Project to other vertebrate species.

822,"Replication, Neurotropism, and Pathogenicity of Avian Paramyxovirus Serotypes 1–9 in Chickens and Ducks",2012-04-30,"Avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 1–9 have been isolated from many different avian species. APMV-1 (Newcastle disease virus) is the only well-characterized serotype, because of the high morbidity, mortality, and economic loss caused by highly virulent strains. Very little is known about the pathogenesis, replication, virulence, and tropism of the other APMV serotypes. Here, this was evaluated for prototypes strains of APMV serotypes 2–9 in cell culture and in chickens and ducks. In cell culture, only APMV-1, -3 and -5 induced syncytium formation. In chicken DF1 cells, APMV-3 replicated with an efficiency approaching that of APMV-1, while APMV-2 and -5 replicated to lower, intermediate titers and the others were much lower. Mean death time (MDT) assay in chicken eggs and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) test in 1-day-old SPF chicks demonstrated that APMV types 2–9 were avirulent. Evaluation of replication in primary neuronal cells in vitro as well as in the brains of 1-day-old chicks showed that, among types 2–9, only APMV-3 was neurotropic, although this virus was not neurovirulent. Following intranasal infection of 1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens, replication of APMV types 2–9 was mostly restricted to the respiratory tract, although APMV-3 was neuroinvasive and neurotropic (but not neurovirulent) and also was found in the spleen. Experimental intranasal infection of 3-week-old mallard ducks with the APMVs did not produce any clinical signs (even for APMV-1) and exhibited restricted viral replication of the APMVs (including APMV-1) to the upper respiratory tract regardless of their isolation source, indicating avirulence of APMV types 1–9 in mallard ducks. The link between the presence of a furin cleavage site in the F protein, syncytium formation, systemic spread, and virulence that has been well-established with APMV-1 pathotypes was not evident with the other APMV serotypes.","Kim, Shin-Hee; Xiao, Sa; Shive, Heather; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3340391/,57
1012,Brain Transcriptome-Wide Screen for HIV-1 Nef Protein Interaction Partners Reveals Various Membrane-Associated Proteins,2012-12-17,"HIV-1 Nef protein contributes essentially to the pathology of AIDS by a variety of protein-protein-interactions within the host cell. The versatile functionality of Nef is partially attributed to different conformational states and posttranslational modifications, such as myristoylation. Up to now, many interaction partners of Nef have been identified using classical yeast two-hybrid screens. Such screens rely on transcriptional activation of reporter genes in the nucleus to detect interactions. Thus, the identification of Nef interaction partners that are integral membrane proteins, membrane-associated proteins or other proteins that do not translocate into the nucleus is hampered. In the present study, a split-ubiquitin based yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify novel membrane-localized interaction partners of Nef. More than 80% of the hereby identified interaction partners of Nef are transmembrane proteins. The identified hits are GPM6B, GPM6A, BAP31, TSPAN7, CYB5B, CD320/TCblR, VSIG4, PMEPA1, OCIAD1, ITGB1, CHN1, PH4, CLDN10, HSPA9, APR-3, PEBP1 and B3GNT, which are involved in diverse cellular processes like signaling, apoptosis, neurogenesis, cell adhesion and protein trafficking or quality control. For a subfraction of the hereby identified proteins we present data supporting their direct interaction with HIV-1 Nef. We discuss the results with respect to many phenotypes observed in HIV infected cells and patients. The identified Nef interaction partners may help to further elucidate the molecular basis of HIV-related diseases.","Kammula, Ellen C.; Mötter, Jessica; Gorgels, Alexandra; Jonas, Esther; Hoffmann, Silke; Willbold, Dieter",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524239/,57
1015,BUHO: A MATLAB Script for the Study of Stress Granules and Processing Bodies by High-Throughput Image Analysis,2012-12-20,"The spontaneous and reversible formation of foci and filaments that contain proteins involved in different metabolic processes is common in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) belong to a novel family of cellular structures collectively known as mRNA silencing foci that harbour repressed mRNAs and their associated proteins. SGs and PBs are highly dynamic and they form upon stress and dissolve thus releasing the repressed mRNAs according to changes in cell physiology. In addition, aggregates containing abnormal proteins are frequent in neurodegenerative disorders. In spite of the growing relevance of these supramolecular aggregates to diverse cellular functions a reliable automated tool for their systematic analysis is lacking. Here we report a MATLAB Script termed BUHO for the high-throughput image analysis of cellular foci. We used BUHO to assess the number, size and distribution of distinct objects with minimal deviation from manually obtained parameters. BUHO successfully addressed the induction of both SGs and PBs in mammalian and insect cells exposed to different stress stimuli. We also used BUHO to assess the dynamics of specific mRNA-silencing foci termed Smaug 1 foci (S-foci) in primary neurons upon synaptic stimulation. Finally, we used BUHO to analyze the role of candidate genes on SG formation in an RNAi-based experiment. We found that FAK56D, GCN2 and PP1 govern SG formation. The role of PP1 is conserved in mammalian cells as judged by the effect of the PP1 inhibitor salubrinal, and involves dephosphorylation of the translation factor eIF2α. All these experiments were analyzed manually and by BUHO and the results differed in less than 5% of the average value. The automated analysis by this user-friendly method will allow high-throughput image processing in short times by providing a robust, flexible and reliable alternative to the laborious and sometimes unfeasible visual scrutiny.","Perez-Pepe, Marcelo; Slomiansky, Victoria; Loschi, Mariela; Luchelli, Luciana; Neme, Maximiliano; Thomas, María Gabriela; Boccaccio, Graciela Lidia",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527446/,57
1089,Max Bergmann lecture Protein epitope mimetics in the age of structural vaccinology‡,2013-01-24,"This review highlights the growing importance of protein epitope mimetics in the discovery of new biologically active molecules and their potential applications in drug and vaccine research. The focus is on folded β-hairpin mimetics, which are designed to mimic β-hairpin motifs in biologically important peptides and proteins. An ever-growing number of protein crystal structures reveal how β-hairpin motifs often play key roles in protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions. This review illustrates how using protein structures as a starting point for small-molecule mimetic design can provide novel ligands as protein–protein interaction inhibitors, as protease inhibitors, and as ligands for chemokine receptors and folded RNA targets, as well as novel antibiotics to combat the growing health threat posed by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The β-hairpin antibiotics are shown to target a β-barrel outer membrane protein (LptD) in Pseudomonas sp., which is essential for the biogenesis of the outer cell membrane. Another exciting prospect is that protein epitope mimetics will be of increasing importance in synthetic vaccine design, in the emerging field of structural vaccinology. Crystal structures of protective antibodies bound to their pathogen-derived epitopes provide an ideal starting point for the design of synthetic epitope mimetics. The mimetics can be delivered to the immune system in a highly immunogenic format on the surface of synthetic virus-like particles. The scientific challenges in molecular design remain great, but the potential significance of success in this area is even greater.

1121,Marked Variability in the Extent of Protein Disorder within and between Viral Families,2013-04-19,"Intrinsically disordered regions in eukaryotic proteomes contain key signaling and regulatory modules and mediate interactions with many proteins. Many viral proteomes encode disordered proteins and modulate host factors through the use of short linear motifs (SLiMs) embedded within disordered regions. However, the degree of viral protein disorder across different viruses is not well understood, so we set out to establish the constraints acting on viruses, in terms of their use of disordered protein regions. We surveyed predicted disorder across 2,278 available viral genomes in 41 families, and correlated the extent of disorder with genome size and other factors. Protein disorder varies strikingly between viral families (from 2.9% to 23.1% of residues), and also within families. However, this substantial variation did not follow the established trend among their hosts, with increasing disorder seen across eubacterial, archaebacterial, protists, and multicellular eukaryotes. For example, among large mammalian viruses, poxviruses and herpesviruses showed markedly differing disorder (5.6% and 17.9%, respectively). Viral families with smaller genome sizes have more disorder within each of five main viral types (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA+, dsRNA, retroviruses), except for negative single-stranded RNA viruses, where disorder increased with genome size. However, surveying over all viruses, which compares tiny and enormous viruses over a much bigger range of genome sizes, there is no strong association of genome size with protein disorder. We conclude that there is extensive variation in the disorder content of viral proteomes. While a proportion of this may relate to base composition, to extent of gene overlap, and to genome size within viral types, there remain important additional family and virus-specific effects. Differing disorder strategies are likely to impact on how different viruses modulate host factors, and on how rapidly viruses can evolve novel instances of SLiMs subverting host functions, such as innate and acquired immunity.","Pushker, Ravindra; Mooney, Catherine; Davey, Norman E.; Jacqué, Jean-Marc; Shields, Denis C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3631256/,57
1155,Dual Host-Virus Arms Races Shape an Essential Housekeeping Protein,2013-05-28,"Transferrin Receptor (TfR1) is the cell-surface receptor that regulates iron uptake into cells, a process that is fundamental to life. However, TfR1 also facilitates the cellular entry of multiple mammalian viruses. We use evolutionary and functional analyses of TfR1 in the rodent clade, where two families of viruses bind this receptor, to mechanistically dissect how essential housekeeping genes like TFR1 successfully balance the opposing selective pressures exerted by host and virus. We find that while the sequence of rodent TfR1 is generally conserved, a small set of TfR1 residue positions has evolved rapidly over the speciation of rodents. Remarkably, all of these residues correspond to the two virus binding surfaces of TfR1. We show that naturally occurring mutations at these positions block virus entry while simultaneously preserving iron-uptake functionalities, both in rodent and human TfR1. Thus, by constantly replacing the amino acids encoded at just a few residue positions, TFR1 divorces adaptation to ever-changing viruses from preservation of key cellular functions. These dynamics have driven genetic divergence at the TFR1 locus that now enforces species-specific barriers to virus transmission, limiting both the cross-species and zoonotic transmission of these viruses.","Demogines, Ann; Abraham, Jonathan; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael; Sawyer, Sara L.",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665890/,57
1214,Expression of Recombinant Antibodies,2013-07-29,"Recombinant antibodies are highly specific detection probes in research, diagnostics, and have emerged over the last two decades as the fastest growing class of therapeutic proteins. Antibody generation has been dramatically accelerated by in vitro selection systems, particularly phage display. An increasing variety of recombinant production systems have been developed, ranging from Gram-negative and positive bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi, insect cell lines, mammalian cells to transgenic plants and animals. Currently, almost all therapeutic antibodies are still produced in mammalian cell lines in order to reduce the risk of immunogenicity due to altered, non-human glycosylation patterns. However, recent developments of glycosylation-engineered yeast, insect cell lines, and transgenic plants are promising to obtain antibodies with “human-like” post-translational modifications. Furthermore, smaller antibody fragments including bispecific antibodies without any glycosylation are successfully produced in bacteria and have advanced to clinical testing. The first therapeutic antibody products from a non-mammalian source can be expected in coming next years. In this review, we focus on current antibody production systems including their usability for different applications.","Frenzel, André; Hust, Michael; Schirrmann, Thomas",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725456/,57
1223,A Protective and Safe Intranasal RSV Vaccine Based on a Recombinant Prefusion-Like Form of the F Protein Bound to Bacterium-Like Particles,2013-08-12,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of respiratory tract disease in infants and the elderly. Currently, no licensed vaccine against RSV is available. Here we describe the development of a safe and effective intranasal subunit vaccine that is based on recombinant fusion (F) protein bound to the surface of immunostimulatory bacterium-like particles (BLPs) derived from the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis. Different variants of F were analyzed with respect to their conformation and reactivity with neutralizing antibodies, assuming that F proteins mimicking the metastable prefusion form of RSV F expose a more extensive and relevant epitope repertoire than F proteins corresponding to the postfusion structure. Our results indicate that the recombinant soluble ectodomain of RSV F readily adopts a postfusion conformation, generation of which cannot be prevented by C-terminal addition of a trimerization motif, but whose formation is prevented by mutation of the two furin cleavage sites in F. While the putative postfusion form of F is recognized well by the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab, this is much less so for the more potently neutralizing, prefusion-specific antibodies D25 and AM22. Both addition of the trimerization motif and mutation of the furin cleavage sites increased the reactivity of F with D25 and AM22, with the highest reactivity being observed for F proteins in which both these features were combined. Intranasal vaccination of mice or cotton rats with BLPs loaded with this latter prefusion-like F protein (BLP-F), resulted in the potent induction of F-specific immunoglobulins and in significantly decreased virus titers in the lungs upon RSV challenge. Moreover, and in contrast to animals vaccinated with formalin-inactivated RSV, animals that received BLP-F exhibited high levels of F-specific secretory IgA in the nose and RSV-neutralizing antibodies in sera, but did not show symptoms of enhanced disease after challenge with RSV.","Rigter, Alan; Widjaja, Ivy; Versantvoort, Hanneke; Coenjaerts, Frank E.

1287,GenomeFingerprinter: The Genome Fingerprint and the Universal Genome Fingerprint Analysis for Systematic Comparative Genomics,2013-10-29,"BACKGROUND: No attention has been paid on comparing a set of genome sequences crossing genetic components and biological categories with far divergence over large size range. We define it as the systematic comparative genomics and aim to develop the methodology. RESULTS: First, we create a method, GenomeFingerprinter, to unambiguously produce a set of three-dimensional coordinates from a sequence, followed by one three-dimensional plot and six two-dimensional trajectory projections, to illustrate the genome fingerprint of a given genome sequence. Second, we develop a set of concepts and tools, and thereby establish a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA). Particularly, we define the total genetic component configuration (TGCC) (including chromosome, plasmid, and phage) for describing a strain as a systematic unit, the universal genome fingerprint map (UGFM) of TGCC for differentiating strains as a universal system, and the systematic comparative genomics (SCG) for comparing a set of genomes crossing genetic components and biological categories. Third, we construct a method of quantitative analysis to compare two genomes by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. Specifically, we define the geometric center and its geometric mean for a given genome fingerprint map, followed by the Euclidean distance, the differentiate rate, and the weighted differentiate rate to quantitatively describe the difference between two genomes of comparison. Moreover, we demonstrate the applications through case studies on various genome sequences, giving tremendous insights into the critical issues in microbial genomics and taxonomy. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a method, GenomeFingerprinter, for rapidly computing, geometrically visualizing, intuitively comparing a set of genomes at genome fingerprint level, and hence established a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis, as well as developed a method of quantitative analysis of the outcome dataset. These have set up the methodology of systematic comparative genomics based on the genome fingerprint analysis.","Ai, Yuncan; Ai, Hannan; Meng, Fanmei; Zhao, Lei",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3812135/,57

We also reconstructed long sequences (1503-6557 nt) related to at least nine other viruses.

1357,Immunosuppressive Drugs Modulate the Replication of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) in a Hydrodynamic Injection Mouse Model,2014-01-21,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and recurrence are common in patients under immunosuppression and can be controlled by hepatitis B immunoglobulin, antivirals, and hepatitis B vaccine. However, the detailed analysis of HBV infection under immunosuppression is essential for the prophylaxis and therapy for HBV reactivation and recurrence. In this study, HBV replication and T cell responses were analyzed in a HBV-transfected mouse model under immunosuppressive therapy. During the treatment, HBV replication was at a high level in mice treated with dexamethasone, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide, whereas was terminated in mice treated with mycophenolate mofetil. After the withdrawal, HBV replication was at low or high levels in the dexamethasone-treated mice or in both cyclosporine- and cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The early withdrawal of cyclosporine allowed the recovery of suppressed T cell responses and led to subsequent HBV clearance, while the adoptive immune transfer to the mice with HBV persistence led to HBV suppression. Taken together, long-term HBV persistence under immunosuppression depends on the immunosuppressive drugs used and on the treatment duration and is mediated by the suppressed intrahepatic CD8 T cell response. These data may be helpful for individualized immunosuppressive therapy in patients with high risk of HBV reactivation and recurrence, and the mouse system is suitable for studying HBV reactivation and recurrence under immunosuppression.","Wang, Junzhong; Wang, Baoju; Huang, Shunmei; Song, Zhitao; Wu, Jun; Zhang, Ejuan; Zhu, Zhenni; Zhu, Bin; Yin, Ying; Lin, Yong; Xu, Yang; Zheng, Xin; Lu, Mengji; Yang, Dongliang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897536/,57
1411,"Autophagy in Plasmodium, a multifunctional pathway?",2013-08-20,"Autophagy is a catabolic process that normally utilizes the lysosome. The far-reaching implications of this system in disease are being increasingly understood. Studying autophagy is complicated by its role in cell survival and programmed cell death and the involvement of the canonical marker of autophagy, Atg8/LC3, in numerous non-autophagic roles. The malaria parasite, Plasmodium, has conserved certain aspects of the autophagic machinery but for what purpose has long remained a mystery. Major advances have recently been gained and suggest a role for Atg8 in apicoplast maintenance, degradation of heme inside the food vacuole, and possibly trafficking of proteins or organelles outside the parasite membrane. Autophagy may also participate in programmed cell death under drug treatment or as a selective tool to limit parasite load. We review the current findings and discuss discrepancies in the field of autophagy in the Plasmodium parasite.","Hain, Adelaide U.P.; Bosch, Jürgen",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962217/,57
1426,A new unconventional HLA-A2-restricted epitope from HBV core protein elicits antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes,2014-03-22,"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a key role in the control of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and viral clearance. However, most of identified CTL epitopes are derived from HBV of genotypes A and D, and few have been defined in virus of genotypes B and C which are more prevalent in Asia. As HBV core protein (HBc) is the most conservative and immunogenic component, in this study we used an overlapping 9-mer peptide pool covering HBc to screen and identify specific CTL epitopes. An unconventional HLA-A2-restricted epitope HBc141–149 was discovered and structurally characterized by crystallization analysis. The immunogenicity and anti-HBV activity were further determined in HBV and HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Finally, we show that mutations in HBc141–149 epitope are associated with viral parameters and disease progression in HBV infected patients. Our data therefore provide insights into the structure characteristics of this unconventional epitope binding to MHC-I molecules, as well as epitope specific CTL activity that orchestrate T cell response and immune evasion in HBV infected patients.","Sun, Lu; Zhang, Yu; Zhao, Bao; Deng, Mengmeng; Liu, Jun; Li, Xin; Hou, Junwei; Gui, Mingming; Zhang, Shuijun; Li, Xiaodong; Gao, George F.; Meng, Songdong",Protein Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3978166/,57

1581,Autoreactivity to Glucose Regulated Protein 78 Links Emphysema and Osteoporosis in Smokers,2014-09-12,"RATIONALE: Emphysema and osteoporosis are epidemiologically associated diseases of cigarette smokers. The causal mechanism(s) linking these illnesses is unknown. We hypothesized autoimmune responses may be involved in both disorders. OBJECTIVES: To discover an antigen-specific autoimmune response associated with both emphysema and osteoporosis among smokers. METHODS: Replicate nonbiased discovery assays indicated that autoimmunity to glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and cell surface signaling receptor, is present in many smokers. Subject assessments included spirometry, chest CT scans, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and immunoblots for anti-GRP78 IgG. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were isolated from patient plasma by affinity chromatography, leukocyte functions assessed by flow cytometry, and soluble metabolites and mediators measured by immunoassays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Circulating anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies were detected in plasma specimens from 86 (32%) of the 265 smoking subjects. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were singularly prevalent among subjects with radiographic emphysema (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7–5.7, p = 0.003). Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were also associated with osteoporosis (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7–13.3, p = 0.002), and increased circulating bone metabolites (p = 0.006). Among emphysematous subjects, GRP78 protein was an autoantigen of CD4 T-cells, stimulating lymphocyte proliferation (p = 0.0002) and IFN-gamma production (p = 0.03). Patient-derived anti-GRP78 autoantibodies had avidities for osteoclasts and macrophages, and increased macrophage NFkB phosphorylation (p = 0.005) and productions of IL-8, CCL-2, and MMP9 (p = 0.005, 0.007, 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral and cellular GRP78 autoimmune responses in smokers have numerous biologically-relevant pro-inflammatory and other deleterious actions, and are associated with emphysema and osteoporosis. These findings may have relevance for the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases, and development of biomarker immunoassays and/or novel treatments for these disorders.","Bon, Jessica; Kahloon, Rehan; Zhang, Yingze; Xue, Jianmin; Fuhrman, Carl R.; Tan, Jiangning; Burger, Mathew; Kass, Daniel J.; Csizmadia, Eva; Otterbein, Leo; Chandra, Divay; Bhargava, Arpit; Pilewski, Joseph M.; Roodman, G.

To facilitate biological, biochemical and molecular research on the medicinal chemicals in I. indigotica, here we report the first I. indigotica transcriptome generated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RESULTS: RNA-seq library was created using RNA extracted from a mixed sample including leaf and root. A total of 33,238 unigenes were assembled from more than 28 million of high quality short reads. The quality of the assembly was experimentally examined by cDNA sequencing of seven randomly selected unigenes. Based on blast search 28,184 unigenes had a hit in at least one of the protein and nucleotide databases used in this study, and 8 unigenes were found to be associated with biosynthesis of indole and its derivatives. According to Gene Ontology classification, 22,365 unigenes were categorized into 48 functional groups. Furthermore, Clusters of Orthologous Group and Swiss-Port annotation were assigned for 7,707 and 18,679 unigenes, respectively. Analysis of repeat motifs identified 6,400 simple sequence repeat markers in 4,509 unigenes. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a comprehensive sequence resource for molecular study of I. indigotica. Our results will facilitate studies on the functions of genes involved in the indole alkaloid biosynthesis pathway and on metabolism of nitrogen and indole alkaloids in I. indigotica and its related species.","Tang, Xiaoqing; Xiao, Yunhua; Lv, Tingting; Wang, Fangquan; Zhu, QianHao; Zheng, Tianqing; Yang, Jie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4178013/,57
1646,Frequency and Fitness Consequences of Bacteriophage Φ6 Host Range Mutations,2014-11-19,"Viruses readily mutate and gain the ability to infect novel hosts, but few data are available regarding the number of possible host range-expanding mutations allowing infection of any given novel host, and the fitness consequences of these mutations on original and novel hosts. To gain insight into the process of host range expansion, we isolated and sequenced 69 independent mutants of the dsRNA bacteriophage Φ6 able to infect the novel host, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes. In total, we found at least 17 unique suites of mutations among these 69 mutants. We assayed fitness for 13 of 17 mutant genotypes on P. pseudoalcaligenes and the standard laboratory host, P. phaseolicola. Mutants exhibited significantly lower fitnesses on P. pseudoalcaligenes compared to P. phaseolicola. Furthermore, 12 of the 13 assayed mutants showed reduced fitness on P. phaseolicola compared to wildtype Φ6, confirming the prevalence of antagonistic pleiotropy during host range expansion. Further experiments revealed that the mechanistic basis of these fitness differences was likely variation in host attachment ability. In addition, using computational protein modeling, we show that host-range expanding mutations occurred in hotspots on the surface of the phage's host attachment protein opposite a putative hydrophobic anchoring domain.","Ford, Brian E.; Sun, Bruce; Carpino, James; Chapler, Elizabeth S.; Ching, Jane; Choi, Yoon; Jhun, Kevin; Kim, Jung D.; Lallos, Gregory G.; Morgenstern, Rachelle; Singh, Shalini; Theja, Sai; Dennehy, John J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4237377/,57
1719,Evolution of Genome Size and Complexity in the Rhabdoviridae,2015-02-13,"RNA viruses exhibit substantial structural, ecological and genomic diversity. However, genome size in RNA viruses is likely limited by a high mutation rate, resulting in the evolution of various mechanisms to increase complexity while minimising genome expansion. Here we conduct a large-scale analysis of the genome sequences of 99 animal rhabdoviruses, including 45 genomes which we determined de novo, to identify patterns of genome expansion and the evolution of genome complexity. All but seven of the rhabdoviruses clustered into 17 well-supported monophyletic groups, of which eight corresponded to established genera, seven were assigned as new genera, and two were taxonomically ambiguous. We show that the acquisition and loss of new genes appears to have been a central theme of rhabdovirus evolution, and has been associated with the appearance of alternative, overlapping and consecutive ORFs within the major structural protein genes, and the insertion and loss of additional ORFs in each gene junction in a clade-specific manner. Changes in the lengths of gene junctions accounted for as much as 48.5% of the variation in genome size from the smallest to the largest genome, and the frequency with which new ORFs were observed increased in the 3’ to 5’ direction along the genome. We also identify several new families of accessory genes encoded in these regions, and show that non-canonical expression strategies involving TURBS-like termination-reinitiation, ribosomal frame-shifts and leaky ribosomal scanning appear to be common. We conclude that rhabdoviruses have an unusual capacity for genomic plasticity that may be linked to their discontinuous transcription strategy from the negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, and propose a model that accounts for the regular occurrence of genome expansion and contraction throughout the evolution of the Rhabdoviridae.","Walker, Peter J.; Firth, Cadhla; Widen, Steven G.; Blasdell, Kim R.; Guzman, Hilda; Wood, Thomas G.; Paradkar, Prasad N.; Holmes, Edward C.; Tesh, Robert B.; Vasilakis, Nikos",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334499/,57
1728,CEACAM1 induces B-cell survival and is essential for protective antiviral antibody production,2015-02-18,"B cells are essential for antiviral immune defence because they produce neutralizing antibodies, present antigen and maintain the lymphoid architecture. Here we show that intrinsic signalling of CEACAM1 is essential for generating efficient B-cell responses. Although CEACAM1 exerts limited influence on the proliferation of B cells, expression of CEACAM1 induces survival of proliferating B cells via the BTK/Syk/NF-κB-axis. The absence of this signalling cascade in naive Ceacam1(−/−) mice limits the survival of B cells. During systemic infection with cytopathic vesicular stomatitis virus, Ceacam1(−/−) mice can barely induce neutralizing antibody responses and die early after infection. We find, therefore, that CEACAM1 is a crucial regulator of B-cell survival, influencing B-cell numbers and protective antiviral antibody responses.","Khairnar, Vishal; Duhan, Vikas; Maney, Sathish Kumar; Honke, Nadine; Shaabani, Namir; Pandyra, Aleksandra A.; Seifert, Marc; Pozdeev, Vitaly; Xu, Haifeng C.; Sharma, Piyush; Baldin, Fabian; Marquardsen, Florian; Merches, Katja; Lang, Elisabeth; Kirschning, Carsten; Westendorf, Astrid M.; Häussinger, Dieter; Lang, Florian; Dittmer, Ulf; Küppers, Ralf; Recher, Mike; Hardt, Cornelia; Scheffrahn, Inka; Beauchemin, Nicole; Göthert, Joachim R.; Singer, Bernhard B.; Lang, Philipp A.; Lang, Karl S.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346637/,57
1764,Transcriptional regulation of secretory capacity by bZip transcription factors,2014-11-17,"Cells of specialized secretory organs expand their secretory pathways to accommodate the increased protein load necessary for their function. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus and the secretory vesicles, expand not only the membrane components but also the protein machinery required for increased protein production and transport. Increased protein load causes an ER stress response akin to the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Recent work has implicated several bZip transcription factors in the regulation of protein components of the early secretory pathway necessary to alleviate this stress. Here, we highlight eight bZip transcription factors in regulating secretory pathway component genes. These include components of the three canonical branches of the UPR-ATF4, XBP1, and ATF6, as well as the five members of the Creb3 family of transcription factors.We review findings from both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems suggesting that all of these proteins increase secretory capacity in response to increased protein load. Finally, we propose that the Creb3 family of factors may have a dual role in secretory cell differentiation by also regulating the pathways necessary for cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation.

The disturbed β(1)-AR function may be based on an elevated sympathetic tone observed in patients with heart failure. Prolonged adrenergic stimulation may induce metabolic and electrophysiological disturbances in the myocardium, resulting in tachyarrhythmia that leads to the development of heart failure in human and sudden death. Hence, β(1)-AR is considered as a promising drug target but attempts to develop effective and specific drug against this tempting pharmaceutical target is slowed down due to the lack of 3D structure of Homo sapiens β(1)-AR (hsβADR1). This study encompasses elucidation of 3D structural and physicochemical properties of hsβADR1 via threading-based homology modeling. Furthermore, the docking performance of several docking programs including Surflex-Dock, FRED, and GOLD were validated by re-docking and cross-docking experiments. GOLD and Surflex-Dock performed best in re-docking and cross docking experiments, respectively. Consequently, Surflex-Dock was used to predict the binding modes of four hsβADR1 agonists. This study provides clear understanding of hsβADR1 structure and its binding mechanism, thus help in providing the remedial solutions of cardiovascular, effective treatment of asthma and other diseases caused by malfunctioning of the target protein.","Ul-Haq, Zaheer; Saeed, Maria; Halim, Sobia Ahsan; Khan, Waqasuddin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4393300/,57

Although eukaryotic circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses were originally thought to only infect plants and vertebrates, recent studies have identified these viruses in a number of invertebrates. To further explore CRESS-DNA viruses in the marine environment, this study surveyed CRESS-DNA viruses in various marine invertebrate species. A total of 27 novel CRESS-DNA genomes, with Reps that share less than 60.1% identity with previously reported viruses, were recovered from 21 invertebrate species, mainly crustaceans. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Rep revealed a novel clade of CRESS-DNA viruses that included approximately one third of the marine invertebrate associated viruses identified here and whose members may represent a novel family. Investigation of putative capsid proteins (Cap) encoded within the eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viral genomes from this study and those in GenBank demonstrated conserved patterns of predicted intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which can be used to complement similarity-based searches to identify divergent structural proteins within novel genomes. Overall, this study expands our knowledge of CRESS-DNA viruses associated with invertebrates and explores a new tool to evaluate divergent structural proteins encoded by these viruses.","Rosario, Karyna; Schenck, Ryan O.; Harbeitner, Rachel C.; Lawler, Stephanie N.; Breitbart, Mya",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4498126/,57
1913,Phenotypic and Genetic Characterization of Avian Influenza H5N2 Viruses with Intra- and Inter-Duck Variations in Taiwan,2015-08-11,"BACKGROUND: Human infections with avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have frequently raised global concerns of emerging, interspecies-transmissible viruses with pandemic potential. Waterfowl, the predominant reservoir of influenza viruses in nature, harbor precursors of different genetic lineages that have contributed to novel pandemic influenza viruses in the past. METHODS: Two duck influenza H5N2 viruses, DV518 and DV413, isolated through virological surveillance at a live-poultry market in Taiwan, showed phylogenetic relatedness but exhibited different replication capabilities in mammalian Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. This study characterizes the replication properties of the two duck H5N2 viruses and the determinants involved. RESULTS: The DV518 virus replicated more efficiently than DV413 in both MDCK and chicken DF1 cells. Interestingly, the infection of MDCK cells by DV518 formed heterogeneous plaques with great differences in size [large (L) and small (S)], and the two viral strains (p518-L and p518-S) obtained from plaque purification exhibited distinguishable replication kinetics in MDCK cells. Nonetheless, both plaque-purified DV518 strains still maintained their growth advantages over the plaque-purified p413 strain. Moreover, three amino acid substitutions in PA (P224S), PB2 (E72D), and M1 (A128T) were identified in intra-duck variations (p518-L vs p518-S), whereas other changes in HA (N170D), NA (I56T), and NP (Y289H) were present in inter-duck variations (DV518 vs DV413). Both p518-L and p518-S strains had the N170D substitution in HA, which might be related to their greater binding to MDCK cells. Additionally, polymerase activity assays on 293T cells demonstrated the role of vRNP in modulating the replication capability of the duck p518-L viruses in mammalian cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that intra-host phenotypic variation occurs even within an individual duck. In view of recent human infections by low pathogenic AIVs, this study suggests possible determinants involved in the stepwise selection of virus variants from the duck influenza virus population which may facilitate inter-species transmission.","Li, Yao-Tsun; Ko, Hui-Ying; Lee, Chang-Chun David; Lai, Ching-Yu; Kao, Chuan-Liang; Yang, Chinglai; Wang, Won-Bo; King, Chwan-Chuen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4532476/,57

The bicolored white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon) has recently been identified as reservoir of the neurotropic Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six out of eleven wild living bicoloured white-toothed shrews were trapped and revealed to be naturally infected with BoDV-1. All shrews were monitored in captivity in a long-term study over a time period up to 600 days that differed between the individual shrews. Interestingly, all six animals showed an asymptomatic course of infection despite virus shedding via various routes indicating a highly adapted host-pathogen interaction. Infectious virus and viral RNA were demonstrated in saliva, urine, skin swabs, lacrimal fluid and faeces, both during the first 8 weeks of the investigation period and for long time shedding after more than 250 days in captivity. CONCLUSIONS: The various ways of shedding ensure successful virus maintenance in the reservoir population but also transmission to accidental hosts such as horses and sheep. Naturally BoDV-1-infected living shrews serve as excellent tool to unravel host and pathogen factors responsible for persistent viral co-existence in reservoir species while maintaining their physiological integrity despite high viral load in many organ systems.","Nobach, Daniel; Bourg, Manon; Herzog, Sibylle; Lange-Herbst, Hildburg; Encarnação, Jorge A.; Eickmann, Markus; Herden, Christiane",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552160/,57

During infection with DNA viruses STING is activated downstream of cGAMP synthase (cGAS) to induce type I interferon. Here we identify a STING-dependent, cGAS-independent pathway important for full interferon production and antiviral control of enveloped RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Further, IAV interacts with STING through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP). Interestingly, FP antagonizes interferon production induced by membrane fusion or IAV but not by cGAMP or DNA. Similar to the enveloped RNA viruses, membrane fusion stimulates interferon production in a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent manner. Abolishment of this pathway led to reduced interferon production and impaired control of enveloped RNA viruses. Thus, enveloped RNA viruses stimulate a cGAS-independent STING pathway, which is targeted by IAV.","Holm, Christian K.; Rahbek, Stine H.; Gad, Hans Henrik; Bak, Rasmus O.; Jakobsen, Martin R.; Jiang, Zhaozaho; Hansen, Anne Louise; Jensen, Simon K.; Sun, Chenglong; Thomsen, Martin K.; Laustsen, Anders; Nielsen, Camilla G.; Severinsen, Kasper; Xiong, Yingluo; Burdette, Dara L.; Hornung, Veit; Lebbink, Robert Jan; Duch, Mogens; Fitzgerald, Katherine A.; Bahrami, Shervin; Mikkelsen, Jakob Giehm; Hartmann, Rune; Paludan, Søren R.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4762884/,57

Until now, most of the strategies used to prevent or to cure these infections have been unsuccessful because these viruses have developed numerous immune evasion mechanisms. Therefore, a better understanding of their complex lifecycle is needed.

Mass spectrometry has recently emerged as a central method and has permitted fundamental discoveries in virology. Here, we review mass spectrometry-based approaches that have recently allowed a better understanding of the composition of the herpesvirus virion. In particular, we describe strategies commonly used for proper sample preparation and fractionation to allow protein localization inside the particle but also to avoid contamination by nonstructural proteins. A collection of other important data regarding post-translational modifications or the relative abundance of structural proteins is also described. This review also discusses the poorly studied importance of host proteins in herpesvirus structural proteins and the necessity to develop a quantitative workflow to better understand the dynamics of the structural proteome.

In addition to the primary role of the capsid protein (CP) in encapsidating the RNA progeny, experimental evidence on positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses suggests that the CP also regulates RNA synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that replication of Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) is controlled by the cooperative interaction between STMV CP and the helper virus (HV) Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replicase. We identified that the STMV CP-HV replicase interaction requires a positively charged residue at the third position (3R) in the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa) motif. Far-Northwestern blotting showed that STMV CP promotes binding between HV-replicase and STMV RNA. An STMV CP variant having an arginine to alanine substitution at position 3 in the N-terminal 13aa motif abolished replicase-CP binding. The N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP bearing alanine substitutions for positively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 are defective in packaging full-length STMV, but can package a truncated STMV RNA lacking the 3′ terminal 150 nt region.

This study identified that NS5 (VPg), is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest in the absence of viral replication or other viral proteins in an analogous manner to MNV-1 infection. NS5 expression induced an accumulation of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase in an asynchronous population by inhibiting progression at the G(1)/S restriction point. Furthermore, NS5 expression resulted in a down-regulation of cyclin A expression in asynchronous cells and inhibited cyclin A expression in cells progressing from G(1) to S phase. The activity of NS5 on the host cell cycle occurs through an uncharacterized function. Amino acid substitutions of NS5(Y26A) and NS5(F123A) that inhibit the ability for NS5 to attach to RNA and recruit host eukaryotic translation initiation factors, respectively, retained the ability to induce an accumulation of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase as identified for wild-type NS5.

Using an unbiased siRNA screen approach, we explored the extent of these unconventional functions of ATG proteins. We determined the effects of the depletion of each ATG proteome component on the replication of six different viruses. Our screen reveals that up to 36% of the ATG proteins significantly alter the replication of at least one virus in an unconventional fashion. Detailed analysis of two candidates revealed an undocumented role for ATG13 and FIP200 in picornavirus replication that is independent of their function in autophagy as part of the ULK complex.

Treatment with IFN-α increases expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and decreases viral RNA and protein levels in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells. These responses are only partially attenuated by knockout of STAT1 but are abolished by knockout of STAT2. In contrast, the inhibition of HCV replication by IFN-λ is abolished by knockout of STAT1 or STAT2. Microarray analysis reveals that IFN-α but not IFN-λ can induce expression of the majority of ISGs in STAT1 knockout cells. These findings suggest that IFN-α can inhibit HCV replication through a STAT2-dependent but STAT1-independent pathway, whereas IFN-λ induces ISG expression and inhibits HCV replication exclusively through a STAT1- and STAT2-dependent pathway.","Yamauchi, Shota; Takeuchi, Kenji; Chihara, Kazuyasu; Honjoh, Chisato; Kato, Yuji; Yoshiki, Hatsumi; Hotta, Hak; Sada, Kiyonao",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5144079/,57
2621,An in vivo system for directed experimental evolution of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus,2017-03-13,"The calicivirus Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is widely used in Australia as a biocontrol agent to manage wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. However, widespread herd immunity limits the effectiveness of the currently used strain, CAPM V-351. To overcome this, we developed an experimental platform for the selection and characterisation of novel RHDV strains. As RHDV does not replicate in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a highly virulent RHDV field isolate in immunologically naïve laboratory rabbits that were passively immunised 18–24 hours post-challenge with a neutralising monoclonal antibody. After seven passages, two amino acid substitutions in the P2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within the virus population. Furthermore, a synonymous substitution within the coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained in all subsequent passages. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that RHDV evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select for virus variants with altered phenotypes, in this case partial immune escape.","Hall, Robyn N.; Capucci, Lorenzo; Matthaei, Markus; Esposito, Simona; Kerr, Peter J.; Frese, Michael; Strive, Tanja",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5348035/,57
2803,TRAF6 is a novel NS3-interacting protein that inhibits classical swine fever virus replication,2017-07-27,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is a multifunctional non-structural protein that plays a major role in viral replication. However, how exactly NS3 exerts these functions remains unknown. Here, we identified tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) as a novel NS3-interacting protein via yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Furthermore, we observed that TRAF6 overexpression significantly inhibited CSFV replication, and TRAF6 knockdown promoted CSFV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages. Additionally, TRAF6 was degraded during CSFV infection or NS3 expression exclusively, indicating that CSFV and TRAF6 were mutually antagonistic and that TRAF6 degradation might contribute to persistent CSFV replication. Moreover, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity and interferon (IFN)-β and interleukin (IL)-6 expression were increased in TRAF6-overexpressing cells, whereas TRAF6-knockdown cells exhibited decreased NF-κB activity and IFN-β and IL-6 levels. Notably, TRAF6 overexpression did not reduce CSFV replication following inhibition of NF-κB activation by p65 knockdown. Our findings revealed that TRAF6 inhibits CSFV replication via activation of NF-κB-signalling pathways along with increases in the expression of its targets IFN-β and IL-6. This work addresses a novel aspect concerning the regulation of innate antiviral immune response during CSFV infection.","Lv, Huifang; Dong, Wang; Cao, Zhi; Li, Xiaomeng; Wang, Jie; Qian, Gui; Lv, Qizhuang; Wang, Chengbao; Guo, Kangkang; Zhang, Yanming",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5532216/,57

Optimized nanoshells achieved direct laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry in 0.5 μL of bio-fluids. We applied these nanoshells for disease diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation.

2854,Analysis of VSV pseudotype virus infection mediated by rubella virus envelope proteins,2017-09-14,"Rubella virus (RV) generally causes a systemic infection in humans. Viral cell tropism is a key determinant of viral pathogenesis, but the tropism of RV is currently poorly understood. We analyzed various human cell lines and determined that RV only establishes an infection efficiently in particular non-immune cell lines. To establish an infection the host cells must be susceptible and permissible. To assess the susceptibility of individual cell lines, we generated a pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus bearing RV envelope proteins (VSV-RV/CE2E1). VSV-RV/CE2E1 entered cells in an RV envelope protein-dependent manner, and thus the infection was neutralized completely by an RV-specific antibody. The infection was Ca(2+)-dependent and inhibited by endosomal acidification inhibitors, further confirming the dependency on RV envelope proteins for the VSV-RV/CE2E1 infection. Human non-immune cell lines were mostly susceptible to VSV-RV/CE2E1, while immune cell lines were much less susceptible than non-immune cell lines. However, susceptibility of immune cells to VSV-RV/CE2E1 was increased upon stimulation of these cells. Our data therefore suggest that immune cells are generally less susceptible to RV infection than non-immune cells, but the susceptibility of immune cells is enhanced upon stimulation.","Sakata, Masafumi; Tani, Hideki; Anraku, Masaki; Kataoka, Michiyo; Nagata, Noriyo; Seki, Fumio; Tahara, Maino; Otsuki, Noriyuki; Okamoto, Kiyoko; Takeda, Makoto; Mori, Yoshio",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5599607/,57
2935,Spatiotemporal dynamics of HSV genome nuclear entry and compaction state transitions using bioorthogonal chemistry and super-resolution microscopy,2017-11-09,"We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of HSV genome transport during the initiation of infection using viruses containing bioorthogonal traceable precursors incorporated into their genomes (HSV(EdC)). In vitro assays revealed a structural alteration in the capsid induced upon HSV(EdC) binding to solid supports that allowed coupling to external capture agents and demonstrated that the vast majority of individual virions contained bioorthogonally-tagged genomes. Using HSV(EdC) in vivo we reveal novel aspects of the kinetics, localisation, mechanistic entry requirements and morphological transitions of infecting genomes. Uncoating and nuclear import was observed within 30 min, with genomes in a defined compaction state (ca. 3-fold volume increase from capsids). Free cytosolic uncoated genomes were infrequent (7–10% of the total uncoated genomes), likely a consequence of subpopulations of cells receiving high particle numbers. Uncoated nuclear genomes underwent temporal transitions in condensation state and while ICP4 efficiently associated with condensed foci of initial infecting genomes, this relationship switched away from residual longer lived condensed foci to increasingly decondensed genomes as infection progressed. Inhibition of transcription had no effect on nuclear entry but in the absence of transcription, genomes persisted as tightly condensed foci. Ongoing transcription, in the absence of protein synthesis, revealed a distinct spatial clustering of genomes, which we have termed genome congregation, not seen with non-transcribing genomes. Genomes expanded to more decondensed forms in the absence of DNA replication indicating additional transitional steps. During full progression of infection, genomes decondensed further, with a diffuse low intensity signal dissipated within replication compartments, but frequently with tight foci remaining peripherally, representing unreplicated genomes or condensed parental strands of replicated DNA. Uncoating and nuclear entry was independent of proteasome function and resistant to inhibitors of nuclear export. Together with additional data our results reveal new insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of HSV genome uncoating, transport and organisation.","Sekine, Eiki; Schmidt, Nora; Gaboriau, David; O’Hare, Peter",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5697887/,57
3000,Know Your Enemy: Successful Bioinformatic Approaches to Predict Functional RNA Structures in Viral RNAs,2018-01-04,"Structured RNA elements may control virus replication, transcription and translation, and their distinct features are being exploited by novel antiviral strategies. Viral RNA elements continue to be discovered using combinations of experimental and computational analyses. However, the wealth of sequence data, notably from deep viral RNA sequencing, viromes, and metagenomes, necessitates computational approaches being used as an essential discovery tool. In this review, we describe practical approaches being used to discover functional RNA elements in viral genomes. In addition to success stories in new and emerging viruses, these approaches have revealed some surprising new features of well-studied viruses e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza, and dengue viruses. Some notable discoveries were facilitated by new comparative analyses of diverse viral genome alignments. Importantly, comparative approaches for finding RNA elements embedded in coding and non-coding regions differ. With the exponential growth of computer power we have progressed from stem-loop prediction on single sequences to cutting edge 3D prediction, and from command line to user friendly web interfaces. Despite these advances, many powerful, user friendly prediction tools and resources are underutilized by the virology community.","Lim, Chun Shen; Brown, Chris M.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758548/,57

In our previous study, a genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei oral vaccine (pPG-COE-DCpep/L393) expressing a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting peptide fused with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) COE antigen was developed. This vaccine induced significant levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in mice, indicating a potential strategy against PEDV infection. In this study, pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 was used for oral vaccination of newborn piglets against PEDV. We then assessed the immune responses and protection efficacy of pPG-COE-DCpep/L393. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine elicits a specific systemic and mucosal immune response. The T-helper cells mediated by pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and PEDV infection display a Th1 phenotype. The histopathological results showed that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 promotes lymphocyte proliferation and effectively protects piglets against PEDV infection. The transforming growth factor-β level indicated that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine plays a role in anti-inflammatory responses in mesenteric lymph nodes during PEDV infection. These results show that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 is a potential vaccine against PEDV infection.","Hou, Xingyu; Jiang, Xinpeng; Jiang, Yanping; Tang, Lijie; Xu, Yigang; Qiao, Xinyuan; Liu, Min; Cui, Wen; Ma, Guangpeng; Li, Yijing",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5869499/,57
3117,Rapid detection of potyviruses from crude plant extracts,2018-04-01,"Potyviruses (genus Potyvirus; family Potyviridae) are widely distributed and represent one of the most economically important genera of plant viruses. Therefore, their accurate detection is a key factor in developing efficient control strategies. However, this can sometimes be problematic particularly in plant species containing high amounts of polysaccharides and polyphenols such as yam (Dioscorea spp.). Here, we report the development of a reliable, rapid and cost-effective detection method for the two most important potyviruses infecting yam based on reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). The developed method, named ‘Direct RT-RPA’, detects each target virus directly from plant leaf extracts prepared with a simple and inexpensive extraction method avoiding laborious extraction of high-quality RNA. Direct RT-RPA enables the detection of virus-positive samples in under 30 min at a single low operation temperature (37 °C) without the need for any expensive instrumentation. The Direct RT-RPA tests constitute robust, accurate, sensitive and quick methods for detection of potyviruses from recalcitrant plant species. The minimal sample preparation requirements and the possibility of storing RPA reagents without cold chain storage, allow Direct RT-RPA to be adopted in minimally equipped laboratories and with potential use in plant clinic laboratories and seed certification facilities worldwide.","Silva, Gonçalo; Oyekanmi, Joshua; Nkere, Chukwuemeka K.; Bömer, Moritz; Kumar, P.

3278,A speed–fidelity trade-off determines the mutation rate and virulence of an RNA virus,2018-06-28,"Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D(G64S), has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3D(G64S) populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D(G64S) under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D(G64S) exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D(G64S) growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.","Fitzsimmons, William J.; Woods, Robert J.; McCrone, John T.; Woodman, Andrew; Arnold, Jamie J.; Yennawar, Madhumita; Evans, Richard; Cameron, Craig E.; Lauring, Adam S.",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6040757/,57

By analyzing the whole proteome of 2994 proteins, the WNV envelope glycoprotein was selected as a therapeutic target based on its highest antigenicity. After proper assessment “KSFLVHREW” and “ITPSAPSYT” were found to be the most potential T and B-cell epitopes, respectively. Besides, we have designed and validated four novel drugs from a known WNV inhibitor, AP30451 by adopting computational approaches.

Viral inclusion formation is essential for viral infection, but how these organelles form is not well understood. We investigated the biogenesis of reovirus inclusions. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes are in contact with nascent inclusions, which form by collections of membranous tubules and vesicles as revealed by electron tomography. ER markers and newly synthesized viral RNA are detected in inclusion internal membranes. Live-cell imaging showed that early in infection, the ER is transformed into thin cisternae that fragment into small tubules and vesicles. We discovered that ER tubulation and vesiculation are mediated by the reovirus σNS and μNS proteins, respectively. Our results enhance an understanding of how viruses remodel cellular compartments to build functional replication organelles.","Tenorio, Raquel; Fernández de Castro, Isabel; Knowlton, Jonathan J.; Zamora, Paula F.; Lee, Christopher H.; Mainou, Bernardo A.; Dermody, Terence S.; Risco, Cristina",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6083906/,57

The discovery of new antivirals is a good approach to control new outbreaks that cause such death. In this study, we tested the antiviral activity against Measles virus (MeV) of Polyphenol-rich extracts (PPs) coming from five seaweeds collected and cultivated in Mexico. An MTT assay was performed to determine cytotoxicity effect, and antiviral activity was measured by syncytia reduction assay and confirmed by qPCR. PPs from Ecklonia arborea (formerly Eisenia arborea, Phaeophyceae) and Solieria filiformis (Rhodophyta) showed the highest Selectivity Index (SI), >3750 and >576.9 respectively. Both PPs extracts were selected to the subsequent experiments owing to their high efficacy and low cytotoxicity compared with ribavirin (SI of 11.57). The combinational effect of PPs with sulphated polysaccharides (SPs) and ribavirin were calculated by using Compusyn software. Synergistic activity was observed by combining both PPs with low concentrations of Solieria filiformis SPs (0.01 µg/mL). The antiviral activity of the best combinations was confirmed by qPCR. Virucidal assay, time of addition, and viral penetration evaluations suggested that PPs act mainly by inactivating the viral particle. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the virucidal effect of Polyphenol-rich extracts of seaweeds.","Morán-Santibañez, Karla; Peña-Hernández, Mario A.; Cruz-Suárez, Lucia Elizabeth; Ricque-Marie, Denis; Skouta, Rachid; Vasquez, Abimael H.; Rodríguez-Padilla, Cristina; Trejo-Avila, Laura M.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6164608/,57

3437,Overlapping genes and the proteins they encode differ significantly in their sequence composition from non-overlapping genes,2018-10-19,"Overlapping genes represent a fascinating evolutionary puzzle, since they encode two functionally unrelated proteins from the same DNA sequence. They originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which point mutations in an existing frame allow the expression (the ""birth"") of a completely new protein from a second frame. In viruses, in which overlapping genes are abundant, these new proteins often play a critical role in infection, yet they are frequently overlooked during genome annotation. This results in erroneous interpretation of mutational studies and in a significant waste of resources. Therefore, overlapping genes need to be correctly detected, especially since they are now thought to be abundant also in eukaryotes. Developing better detection methods and conducting systematic evolutionary studies require a large, reliable benchmark dataset of known cases. We thus assembled a high-quality dataset of 80 viral overlapping genes whose expression is experimentally proven. Many of them were not present in databases. We found that overall, overlapping genes differ significantly from non-overlapping genes in their nucleotide and amino acid composition. In particular, the proteins they encode are enriched in high-degeneracy amino acids and depleted in low-degeneracy ones, which may alleviate the evolutionary constraints acting on overlapping genes. Principal component analysis revealed that the vast majority of overlapping genes follow a similar composition bias, despite their heterogeneity in length and function. Six proven mammalian overlapping genes also followed this bias. We propose that this apparently near-universal composition bias may either favour the birth of overlapping genes, or/and result from selection pressure acting on them.","Pavesi, Angelo; Vianelli, Alberto; Chirico, Nicola; Bao, Yiming; Blinkova, Olga; Belshaw, Robert; Firth, Andrew; Karlin, David",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195259/,57
3720,Modulating the 3’ end-DNA and the fermentation process for enhanced production and biological activity of porcine interferon-gamma,2019-03-26,"Porcine gamma interferon is a cytokine produced by activated T cells and NK cells with broad-spectrum antiviral activity and immunomodulatory function. However, pIFN-γ is a secretory protein that has a short half-life in organisms and is easily inactivated, making it difficult to apply widely in clinics. Therefore, we tried to optimize the expression of pIFN-γ in Pichia pastoris to obtain a large amount of highly active, easily purified pIFN-γ protein in vitro. Through C-terminal sequence analysis, we found a signal sequence (EKREAEAE) that was easily enzymolysed by a signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-γ protein. In this study, we optimized the pIFN-γ gene recombination sequence and mutated the 3' end of the pIFN-γ gene, resulting in a higher expression level and stronger biological activity, as well as a significant upregulation in the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes Mx1 and OAS1 in IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells. Our data also showed that the fermentation process could significantly improve productivity. A recombinant Pichia pastoris strain with the optimized pIFN-γ gene could obtain a high yield of pIFN-γ protein, up to 9536 mg/L, after staged incubation for 0–24 h at 28°C, pH 6.0, and 50% dissolved oxygen (DO), followed by incubation for 24–72 h at 25°C, pH 6.0 and 30% DO. These data demonstrated, for the first time, that the expression level of pIFN-γ in Pichia pastoris was improved significantly by gene optimization with 3' end mutation and a fermentation process that maintained good biological activity, which is beneficial to the application of pIFN-γ in animal husbandry.","Cai, Haiming; Deng, Jinbo; Li, Jiaoqing; Ma, Miaopeng; Huang, Chaoyuan; Zhao, Peijing; Ming, Feiping; Liang, Qianyi; Jia, Junhao; Zhang, Shuxia; Zeng, Min; Zhang, Linghua",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6435167/,57
3780,Enhanced Replication of Mouse Adenovirus Type 1 following Virus-Induced Degradation of Protein Kinase R (PKR),2019-04-23,"Protein kinase R (PKR) plays a major role in activating host immunity during infection by sensing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced by viruses. Once activated by dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates the translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), halting cellular translation. Many viruses have methods of inhibiting PKR activation or its downstream effects, circumventing protein synthesis shutdown. These include sequestering dsRNA or producing proteins that bind to and inhibit PKR activation. Here we describe our finding that in multiple cell types, PKR was depleted during mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) infection. MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at the transcriptional or translational level, because total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection. However, inhibiting the proteasome reduced the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, whereas inhibiting the lysosome had no effect. This suggests that proteasomal degradation alone is responsible for PKR degradation during MAV-1 infection. Time course experiments indicated that the degradation occurs early after infection. Infecting cells with UV-inactivated virus prevented PKR degradation, whereas inhibiting viral DNA replication did not. Together, these results suggest that an early viral gene is responsible. Degradation of PKR is a rare mechanism to oppose PKR activity, and it has been described in only six RNA viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it.","Goodman, Danielle E.; Pretto, Carla D.; Krepostman, Tomas A.; Carnahan, Kelly E.; Spindler, Katherine R.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6479006/,57

Despite the widespread use of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, the emergence of antigenic variants and the influence of maternal antibodies have raised some concerns regarding the efficacy of commercial vaccines. While no specific antiviral therapy for CPV infection exists, the only treatment option for the infection is supportive therapy based on symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent medical need to develop antiviral therapeutic options to reduce the burden of CPV-related disease. In this study, a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based high-throughput screening assay was used to screen CPV inhibitors from a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library. After two rounds of screening, seven out of 1430 screened drugs were found to have >50% CPE inhibition. Three drugs—Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel—with higher anti-CPV effects were further evaluated in F81 cells by absolute PCR quantification and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The inhibitory effects of all three drugs were dose-dependent. Time of addition assay indicated that the drugs inhibited the early processes of the CPV replication cycle, and the inhibition effects were relatively high within 2 h postinfection. Western blot assay also showed that the three drugs had broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subspecies of three CPV variants. In addition, antiapoptotic effects were observed within 12 h in Nitazoxanide-treated F81 cells regardless of CPV infection, while Closantel Sodium- or Closantel-treated cells had no pro- or antiapoptotic effects. In conclusion, Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel can effectively inhibit different subspecies of CPV. Since the safety profiles of FDA-approved drugs have already been extensively studied, these three drugs can potentially become specific and effective anti-CPV drugs.","Zhou, Hongzhuan; Su, Xia; Lin, Lulu; Zhang, Jin; Qi, Qi; Guo, Fangfang; Xu, Fuzhou; Yang, Bing",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724046/,57

However, there is much less information available on the polymorphism of MHC class I genes in cynomolgus macaques, than is currently available for humans. In this study, we have identified 40 Mafa-A and 60 Mafa-B exons 2 and 3 sequences from 30 unrelated cynomolgus macaques of Vietnamese origin. Among these alleles, 28 are novel. As for the remaining 72 known alleles, 15 alleles are shared with other cynomolgus macaque populations and 32 are identical to alleles previously reported in other macaque species. A potential recombination event was observed between Mafa-A1*091:02 and Mafa-A1*057:01.

For larvicidal assay, the acetone extract of both plants showed maximum effects, with the least LC(50) and LC(90) values (P. tomentosa (5.968 and 7.493 μg/ml) and T. asiatica (1.288 and 1.992 μg/ml)) and the same extract of both plants exhibited better pupicidal potency. The adulticidal activity of both plants (0–60 min interval periods) recorded best results in acetone extracts and the LC(50) and LC(90) values were recorded as P. tomentosa (32.105 and 41.001 μg/ml) and T. asiatica (09.012 and 11.854 μg/ml). Among the two plants P. tomentosa acetone leaf extract have good antiviral property against Dengue viral cell line. In addition, the phytochemical nature of the plant reveals the presence of saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids in all the tested extracts of both plants.

4189,Identification of Novel Natural Products as Effective and Broad-Spectrum Anti-Zika Virus Inhibitors,2019-11-02,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy leads to severe congenital Zika syndrome, which includes microcephaly and other neurological malformations. No therapeutic agents have, so far, been approved for the treatment of ZIKV infection in humans; as such, there is a need for a continuous effort to develop effective and safe antiviral drugs to treat ZIKV-caused diseases. After screening a natural product library, we have herein identified four natural products with anti-ZIKV activity in Vero E6 cells, including gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine. Except for curcumin, the other three natural products have not been reported before to have anti-ZIKV activity. Among them, gossypol exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against almost all 10 ZIKV strains tested, including six recent epidemic human strains. The mechanistic study indicated that gossypol could neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV. In contrast, the other natural products inhibited ZIKV infection by targeting the host cell or cell-associated entry and replication stages of ZIKV. A combination of gossypol with any of the three natural products identified in this study, as well as with bortezomib, a previously reported anti-ZIKV compound, exhibited significant combinatorial inhibitory effects against three ZIKV human strains tested. Importantly, gossypol also demonstrated marked potency against all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) human strains in vitro. Taken together, this study indicates the potential for further development of these natural products, particularly gossypol, as the lead compound or broad-spectrum inhibitors against ZIKV and other flaviviruses, such as DENV.","Gao, Yaning; Tai, Wanbo; Wang, Ning; Li, Xiang; Jiang, Shibo; Debnath, Asim K.; Du, Lanying; Chen, Shizhong",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893700/,57
4214,Recombinant Rotaviruses Rescued by Reverse Genetics Reveal the Role of NSP5 Hyperphosphorylation in the Assembly of Viral Factories,2019-12-12,"Rotavirus (RV) replicates in round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories, although how they assemble remains unknown. During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this posttranslational modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on virus replication remain obscure. Here, we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse-genetics system. A trans-complementing cell line stably producing NSP5 was used to generate and characterize several recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that an rRV lacking NSP5 was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to further interrogate the function of this posttranslational modification in the assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant strains exhibited impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines expressing either wild-type NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results indicate that NSP5 hyperphosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional viral factories in other RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE The rotavirus (RV) double-stranded RNA genome is replicated and packaged into virus progeny in cytoplasmic structures termed viroplasms. The nonstructural protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse-genetics (RG) system for rotaviruses. Here, we show a novel application of a recently developed RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein during RV replication. Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants, we shed light on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent viroplasms.","Papa, Guido; Venditti, Luca; Arnoldi, Francesca; Schraner, Elisabeth M.; Potgieter, Christiaan; Borodavka, Alexander; Eichwald, Catherine; Burrone, Oscar R.",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6912106/,57
4290,Sensing of HIV-1 by TLR8 activates human T cells and reverses latency,2020-01-09,"During HIV infection, cell-to-cell transmission results in endosomal uptake of the virus by target CD4+ T cells and potential exposure of the viral ssRNA genome to endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are instrumental in activating inflammatory responses in innate immune cells, but their function in adaptive immune cells is less well understood. Here we show that synthetic ligands of TLR8 boosted T cell receptor signaling, resulting in increased cytokine production and upregulation of surface activation markers. Adjuvant TLR8 stimulation, but not TLR7 or TLR9, further promoted T helper cell differentiation towards Th1 and Th17. In addition, we found that endosomal HIV induced cytokine secretion from CD4+ T cells in a TLR8-specific manner. TLR8 engagement also enhanced HIV-1 replication and potentiated the reversal of latency in patient-derived T cells. The adjuvant TLR8 activity in T cells can contribute to viral dissemination in the lymph node and low-grade inflammation in HIV patients. In addition, it can potentially be exploited for therapeutic targeting and vaccine development.","Meås, Hany Zekaria; Haug, Markus; Beckwith, Marianne Sandvold; Louet, Claire; Ryan, Liv; Hu, Zhenyi; Landskron, Johannes; Nordbø, Svein Arne; Taskén, Kjetil; Yin, Hang; Damås, Jan Kristian; Flo, Trude Helen",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952430/,57
4330,Recombinant Lactobacillus casei Expressing Capsid Protein VP60 can Serve as Vaccine Against Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus in Rabbits,2019-11-02,"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is the causative agent of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD). RHD, characterized by hemorrhaging, liver necrosis, and high morbidity and mortality in rabbits and hares, causes severe economic losses in the rabbit industry worldwide. Due to the lack of an efficient in-vitro propagation system for RHDV, the current vaccine is produced via chemical inactivation of crude RHDV preparation derived from the livers of infected rabbits. Inactivated vaccines are effective for controlling RHD, but the potential problems of biosafety and animal welfare have negative effects on the application of inactivated vaccines. In this study, an oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine was used as an antigen delivery system to express RHDV capsid protein VP60(VP1)-eGFP fusion protein. The expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed via western blotting and immunofluorescence (IFA). Our results indicate that oral administration of this probiotic vaccine can stimulate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and IgG-based humoral immune responses in rabbits. The immunized rabbits were completely protected against challenge with RHDV. Our findings indicate that the L. casei expression system is a new strategy for the development of a safe and efficient vaccine against RHDV.","Wang, Li; Xia, Tian; Guo, Tiantian; Ru, Yi; Jiang, Yanping; Cui, Wen; Zhou, Han; Qiao, Xinyuan; Tang, Lijie; Xu, Yigang; Li, Yijing",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6963290/,57

Despite active research, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. We have previously reported the development of various adenoviral vectored vaccine candidates (ChAdOx1 ZIKV) with the ability to stimulate effective immunity in mice and provide protection upon a ZIKV challenge model, using a non-adjuvanted single vaccination approach. In this study, we constructed various modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viruses to express the ZIKV Envelope (E) with modifications on the precursor membrane (prM) or on the C-terminus envelope transmembrane domain (TM), similar to our ChAdOx1 vaccine candidates. MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidates were evaluated as a non-adjuvanted single vaccination regimen against a ZIKV Brazilian isolate, using viraemia as the correlate of protection. Here, we report the induction of a modest level of anti-ZIKV E antibodies by all MVA vectored vaccines and sub-optimal efficacy in a ZIKV challenge model. Our results indicate the requirement of additional strategies when using MVA-ZIKV vaccines to afford sterile protection upon a non-adjuvanted and single vaccination regime.","López-Camacho, César; Kim, Young Chan; Abbink, Peter; Larocca, Rafael A.; Huiskonen, Juha T.; Barouch, Dan H.; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6963679/,57

The study cohort comprised 1,184 adults (aged ≥ 16 years) who were admitted to an ICU with severe sepsis and diagnosed according to the Sepsis-2 criteria. Of 1,167 patients included in the analysis, 636 (54.5%) had bacteremia. Those with bacteremia had significantly higher rates of septic shock (66.4% vs. 58.9%, p = 0.01) and higher sepsis severity scores, including the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). No significant difference in in-hospital mortality was seen between patients with and without bacteremia (25.6% vs. 21.0%, p = 0.08).

4673,Letea Virus: Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetic Analysis of a Novel Reassortant Orbivirus Discovered in Grass Snakes (Natrix natrix),2020-02-21,"Rabies virus (RABV) is the only lyssavirus known to be present within the Caribbean. The island of Trinidad, is richly diverse in chiropteran fauna and endemic for bat-transmitted rabies with low RABV isolation rates observed in this population. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) in light of spatio-temporal and bat demographic factors to infer the extent of natural exposure to RABV in the Trinidadian bat population. RVNA titers were determined by the RABV micro-neutralization test on 383 bat samples representing 21 species, comprising 30.9% of local bat diversity, from 31 locations across the island over 5 years. RVNA was positively detected in 33 samples (8.6%) representing 6 bat species (mainly frugivorous) with titers ranging from 0.1 to 19 IU/mL (mean 1.66 IU/mL). The analyses based on a multivariable binomial generalised linear mixed-effects model showed that bat age and year of capture were significant predictors of seropositivity. Thus, juvenile bats were more likely to be seropositive when compared to adults (estimate 1.13; p = 0.04) which may suggest early exposure to the RABV with possible implications for viral amplification in this population. Temporal variation in rabies seropositivity, 2012–2014 versus 2015–2017 (estimate 1.07; p = 0.03) may have been related to the prevailing rabies epizootic situation. Regarding other factors investigated, RVNA was found in bats from both rural and non-rural areas, as well as in both hematophagous and non-hematophagous bat species. The most common seropositive species, Artibeus jamaicensis planirostris is ubiquitous throughout the island which may potentially facilitate human exposure. The findings of this study should be factored into public health assessments on the potential for rabies transmission by non-hematophagous bats in Trinidad.","Seetahal, Janine F.

However, the success of this strategy requires the prompt onset of therapy within 48 hours of the appearance of clinical symptoms. This requirement may be captured by a compartmental model that monitors the density of infected individuals in terms of the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. We show that such a model can be expressed by a system of delay differential equations with both discrete and distributed delays. The model is analyzed to derive the criterion for disease control based on two critical factors: (i) the profile of treatment rate; and (ii) the level of treatment as a function of time lag in commencing therapy. Numerical results are also obtained to illustrate the feasible region of disease control. Our findings show that due to uncertainty in the attack rate of a pandemic strain, initiating therapy immediately upon diagnosis can significantly increase the likelihood of disease control and substantially reduce the required community-level of treatment. This suggests that reliable diagnostic methods for influenza cases should be rapidly implemented within an antiviral treatment strategy.","Alexander, Murray E.; Moghadas, Seyed M.; Röst, Gergely; Wu, Jianhong",Bull Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088798/,57

PCR detection of viral VP2 gene demonstrated that CPV-2a proliferate with cell passage. An immunofluorescence assay revealed that CPV-2a particles were mainly located in the cell nuclei of MDCK cell. Then transcriptome microarray revealed that gene expression pattern of MDCK with CPV-2a persistent infection is distinct compared with normal cells. Gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis demonstrated that CPV-2a infection induces a series of membrane-associated genes expression, including many MHC protein or MHC-related complexes.

For whole bacteria the IL-8 response to E. coli that agglutinate red blood cells (548 ± 428 pg IL-8/mL, n = 16), a function that correlates with epithelial invasion, was greater than for nonhemagglutinators (281 ± 253 pg/mL, n = 17; P < 0.0001). This was particularly marked among E. coli that, although flagellate, could not release IL-8 from TLR5-transfected HEK293 cells. IL-8 release was mediated by extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibited by mesalamine, but not hydrocortisone, at therapeutic concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Mucosa-associated E. coli shed flagellin that elicits epithelial IL-8 release but this may only become relevant when the mucosal barrier is weakened to expose basolateral TLR5. Adherent and invasive IBD and colon cancer E. coli isolates also elicit a flagellin-independent IL-8 response that may be relevant when the mucosal barrier is intact. The IL-8 release is MAPK-dependent and inhibited by mesalamine.","Subramanian, Sreedhar; Rhodes, Jonathan M.; Hart, Anthony C.; Tam, Ben; Roberts, Carol L.; Smith, Shirley L.; Corkill, John E.; Winstanley, Craig; Virji, Mumtaz; Campbell, Barry J.",Inflamm Bowel Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108638/,57
7357,Review of computational methods for virus–host protein interaction prediction: a case study on novel Ebola–human interactions,2017-09-26,"Two Aboriginal communities situated in the tropical north-west of the Australian continent have been investigated in regard to trace metal status (zinc, copper, and iron) and other laboratory and epidemiological information. A total of 364 persons, ranging in age from 5 to 77 years were studied. The incidence of hypozincemia (serum or plasma zinc concentration <0.71 µg/ml) of the two communities when combined was 24.4%, while hypercupremia (defined as serum or plasma copper levels greater than 1.38 µg/ml) was 47.9%. Depressed serum iron levels were demonstrated in more than 50% of the Aborigines studied. Hypozincemia was most prevalent (incidence 31 to 67%) in children at the time of the important pre- and postadolescent growth period (10 to 15 years) and in women beyond 60 years of age (incidence 33 to 64%). Serum total protein and vitamin B(12) levels tended to be increased. Mild anemia was seen in approximately one in five persons aged less than 20 years. Intestinal parasites and pathogenic enterobacteria were frequently isolated in fecal specimens. In one community, half of the persons examined had positive isolates of enteric pathogens. Intestinal parasites predominated and were more frequently isolated from persons aged less than 20 years. Ancylostoma duodenale accounted for 32% of the pathogens isolated. Evidence is presented that suggests that both communities are exposed to numerous bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections. The diet consumed in these communities is predominately white flour and refined sugar. Geophagia is practiced in this area of Australia. It is emphasised that all the etiological prerequisites and many of the laboratory findings ascribed to the zinc deficiency syndrome appear to be operating in the two Aboriginal communities studied.","Holt, A B; Spargo, R M; Iveson, J B; Faulkner, G S; Cheek, D B",Am J Clin Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109813/,57
7429,The Transmembrane Region of Microsomal Cytochrome P450 Identified as the Endoplasmic Reticulum Retention Signal(1),1994-07-11,"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) appear in the nasal mucosa during rhinovirus colds before the onset of symptoms. This study describes a chemoattractant for PMNLs that is elaborated by human embryonic lung fibroblast cells infected with rhinovirus. Chemotaxis assays were done in a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber with normal adult PMNLs. Medium supernatants from rhinovirus-infected cellculture attracted 87 ± 6 (mean ± SE) PMNLs/10 high-power fields (×450) compared with 38 ± 6 PMNLs/10 highpower fields attracted by medium from uninfected cell cultures (P < .0001). Elaboration of the chemoattractant was not a result of cell destruction and did not require the presence of infectious virus. This chemoattractant produced by human fibroblast cells may contribute to the influx of PMNLs into the nasal mucosa during rhinovirus infection. The PMNLs may, in turn, have a role in producing symptoms of the common cold.","Turner, Ronald B.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110071/,57

7765,Characterization of measles virus-induced cellular autoimmune reactions against myelin basic protein in Lewis rats,2002-11-11,"It has been previously demonstrated that the generation of measles virus (MV)-specific cytotoxicity (CTL) is reduced in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). By contrast, CTL specific for influenza virus (FLU) and mumps virus is normal. It is uncertain if reduced CTL is limited to MV in MS patients, or if reduced CTL may be found to other viruses as well. Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV. Such a reduction may reflect discrete impairments in immune function to separate viruses, possibly those that are associated with viral persistence, or may reflect a more generalized defect in HLA class II-restricted CTL.","de Silva, Shari M.; McFarland, Henry F.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119527/,57

Messenger RNA was extracted from feline peritoneal macrophage cultures and used to synthesize cDNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were cloned into the plasmid vector pCRII and sequenced, showing 99.3% homology with a published fTNF-α gene sequence. Subcloning into the vector pGEX-2T and subsequent expression resulted in a 43 kDa fusion protein of fTNF-α and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein yielded a 17 kDa protein. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal anti-human TNF-α antibody in Western blotting, but not with a polyclonal anti-murine TNF-α serum. Recombinant fTNF-α (rfTNF-α) and rfTNF-α-GST had a CD(50) of 15 ng ml(−1) and 230 ng ml(−1), respectively, in the L929 cytotoxicity assay. Cats given rfTNF-α-GST intravenously manifested the typical biological effects of TNF-α, including fever, depression, and piloerection. The rfTNF-α-GST upregulated IL-2 receptor and MHC-II antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro, but had no effect on TNF-α receptor and MHC-I antigen expression.","Rimstad, Espen; Reubel, Gerhard H.; Dean, Gregg A.; Higgins, Joanne; Pedersen, Niels C.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119607/,57
7809,Natural killer cell activity of chicken intraepithelial leukocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells,2002-11-13,"Gnotobiotic calves given intramuscular injections of dexamethasone (DM, 0.5 mg kg(−1) day(−1)) showed marked changes in haematological parameters including a neutrophilia and a lymphopaenia. Not only was there a reduction in the numbers of circulating mononuclear cells, but there was also a significant (P<0.01) decrease in the in vitro responsiveness of the remaining circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes to the mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and poke-weed mitogen (PWM). Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form of T cell receptor, are CD2(−), CD5(+), CD8(−), CD4(−) and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves. In vitro studies in gnotobiotic and conventional calves confirmed that DM was highly inhibitory for PHA responses but, in contrast to the in vivo findings, showed little effect of DM on ConA responses. Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively. These observations would suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in glucocorticosteroid suppression of the responses to these two mitogens.","Oldham, G.; Howard, C.J.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119793/,57
7818,The expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens in the brain differs markedly in acute and persistent infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV),2002-11-13,"West Nile virus (WNV) infection of astrocytes can up-regulate their expression of both class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens as determined by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies specific for class I and class II MHC antigens. The up-regulation of class I MHC antigen expression could be partly caused by interferon secreted after WNV infection because the synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I : C) has similar effects. In contrast the up-regulation of class II MHC antigen expression was not induced by poly I : C. The increased MHC antigen expression by WNV infection had significant effects on T cell recognition. Thus, WNV and influenza virus A/WSN double-infected astrocytes but not astrocytes infected by A/WSN alone were lysed by influenza virus-immune cytotoxic T cells. Similarly, WNV-infected astrocytes were better stimulators than normal astrocytes for a class II MHC-reactive T cell line, both in terms of T cell proliferation and interleukin release.","Liu, Yang; King, Nicholas; Kesson, Alison; Blanden, Robert V.; Müllbacher, Arno",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119853/,57

MBP-reactive encephalitogenic T cell lines were cytotoxic to (51)Cr-labeled oligodendrocyte target cells derived from Lewis rat fetal brain-dissociated culture, when incubated for 6 h in the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and MBP (percent51Cr release = 65±3% vs. spontaneous release = 22±3% vs. normal lymph node cells + APC and MBP = 20 ± 3%). This reaction is time dependent, likely MHC restricted, and is not just a nonspecific toxic effect against any Lewis target cells since neither fibroblasts nor astrocytes were affected. Other (tetanus toxoid-reactive) lymphoblasts stimulated by specific antigen were not cytotoxic to the oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that oligodendrocytes might be target cells for MBP-reactive lymphocytes in EAE if antigen presentation is appropriate.","Kawai, Kuniyuki; Zweiman, Burton",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119855/,57

T cells that express CD4 or CD8 and a large number of CD4(+), F4/80(+) macrophages are present in perivascular infiltrates close to and in contact with HSV-infected cells in areas of massive myelin loss.

7922,Mapping Protein–Protein Interactions with Phage-Displayed Combinatorial Peptide Libraries and Alanine Scanning,2014-10-20,"This chapter focuses on the use of antioxidant liposomes in the general area of free radical biology and medicine. The term antioxidant liposome is relatively new and refers to liposomes containing lipid-soluble chemical antioxidants, water-soluble chemical antioxidants, enzymatic antioxidants, or combinations of these various antioxidants. The role of antioxidants in health and disease has been extensively discussed, and many excellent reviews and books are available (1–3). Antioxidant liposomes hold great promise in the treatment of many diseases in which oxidative stress plays a prominent role. Oxidative stress is a physiological condition in which the production of damaging free radicals exceeds the in vivo capacity of antioxidant protection mechanisms to prevent pathophysiology. Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons, often highly reactive and damaging to biological systems. The biological membranes of subcellular organelles are a major site of free radical damage but proteins and DNA are also significant targets. Moreover, free radicals can alter cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. Oxygen radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) arise from the single electron reductions of oxygen.","Stone, William L.; Mukherjee, Shyamali; Smith, Milton; Das, Salil K.",Liposome Methods and Protocols,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122272/,57

Vaccinia-mediated expression can be used for assessing cellular localization, posttranslational modifications, oligomerization, and transport and turnover rates. The system provides a rapid method for screening mutant proteins for expression and targeting. It is an excellent way of quickly deciding which mutant proteins might be worth further studying using stable expression systems. Expression of foreign genes using Vaccinia virus is based on recombinant viruses constructed by insertion of complementary DNA (cDNA) into the nonessential thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Both direct and indirect methods of expression are possible. The foreign gene can be inserted into the vaccinia genome by homologous recombination using a plasmid with flanking regions of vaccinia DNA. The recombinant virus is selected, expanded, and used to infect cells, which then express high levels of the foreign protein. Recombinant vaccinia viruses are generated by subcloning the foreign gene into a plasmid transfer vector so it is flanked by DNA from the vaccinia (TK) gene, which is nonessential for growth of the virus in tissue culture. This plasmid is then transfected into vaccinia-infected cells. Homologous recombination of the plasmid and the vaccinia genome generates a recombinant virus with an inactive TK gene.","Weisz, Ora A.; Machamer, Carolyn E.",Methods Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130382/,57

8665,Characterization of aminopeptidase N from Torpedo marmorata kidney,2004-11-12,"This chapter reviews current information about the structure and function of virus glycoproteins. There are few virus glycoproteins that provide prototypes for illustrating important relationships between the functions and glycoprotein structure. The discussion presented in the chapter concentrates on those viral glycoproteins that (1) span the lipid bilayer once, (2) are oriented such that the carboxy terminus comprises the cytoplasmic domain, and (3) contain asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. There are also viral glycoproteins with extensive O-linked glycosylation, some of which are also presented in the discussion. The chapter also focuses on the studies involving directed mutagenesis and construction of chimeric proteins. The effects of altering specific amino acid sequences, of swapping domains, and of adding a new domain to a protein serve to define the functions of a domain and to show that a domain can be independently associated with a specific function. The experiments described have been carried out by inserting the genes of particular viral glycoproteins—such as cDNAs—into expression vectors and transcribing the cDNAs from the promoter provided by the expression vector. This approach established that localization and functions such as the fusogenic activity are properties of the viral glycoprotein per se and do not require other viral-coded components.","Schlesinger, Milton J.; Schlesinger, Sondra",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131334/,57

8782,The Role of the 5′ Untranslated Region of Eukaryotic Messenger RNAs in Translation and Its Investigation Using Antisense Technologies,2008-04-16,"This chapter discusses the role of viruses in nature. Viral transduction of structural and regulatory genes provides a means for information to leave the body of an organism other than through the germ cells. Natural selection acts upon the cell–virus nucleic acid coupling and the rate and direction of the evolution of any species depends upon the number of associated viruses and the extent to and speed with which they allow information to be cycled through the total gene pool of that population. There are three mechanisms by which gene material can be transferred from cell to cell: (1) transformation, (2) transduction, and (3) sexual conjugation. Transformation is the most random and inefficient process; it requires the laws of diffusion and the existing chemistry of the cell membrane, modified in contemporary cells by the development of transport systems, which facilitate membrane penetration. Transduction requires the development of genes for capsomere proteins to encapsidate nucleic acid and a sophistication of the process of membrane evagination to package nucleic acid into free particles, These are relatively modest genetic adaptations. However, true sexual union as it occurs in modern eukaryotes, requires such a high degree of cytological organization that it is inconceivable that it could have operated efficiently during the first billion or so years of cell evolution.","Reanney, D.C.",Int Rev Cytol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133209/,57

Immunoblot analysis of fetal extracts demonstrated that the CVB3 receptor proteins were first expressed at day 14 of the fetal stage, and that maximal expression of the cellular receptor occurred at near term or newborn stage. Results also suggested that newborn mouse brain tissue expressed much larger quantities of viral receptor proteins, compared to other tissues. In vitro studies showed that both mouse neurons and astrocytes could be infected by two CVB3 strains, pantropic CVB3 Nancy strain (CVB3N) and myocardiotropic CVB3 Woodruff strain (CVB3W). CVB3N, however, replicated and grew to high titer in primary astrocyte cultures and in primary neuron cultures, whereas, primary astrocyte cultures were relatively resistant to CVB3W. Virus binding assays revealed that CVB3N bound faster and in greater amounts to mouse brain cells than CVBW. These two virus strains, however, were found to share the same receptor specificity by virus competition assays. The number of virus binding sites for CVB3 on newborn mouse brain cells was approximately 1.8 × 10(4) per cell. The data suggested that preferential expression of the cellular receptors on newborn mouse brain cells may be related to their high susceptibilities to CVB3 infection.","Xu, Ruliang; Crowell, Richard L.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133877/,57

The findings of these experiments confirm and extend our previous reports on the survival of other animal and human aerosolized rotaviruses and emphasize the fact that air may be one of the vehicles for their dissemination and could explain why it is difficult to control nosocomial outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis and to keep animal colonies rotavirus-free.","Ijaz, M.K.; Sattar, S.A.; Alkarmi, T.; Dar, F.K.; Bhatti, A.R.; Elhag, K.M.",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134059/,57

8949,Induction of class I and class II transplantation antigens in rat brain during fatal and non-fatal measles virus infection,2002-11-13,"Many plants contain polyhydroxyalkaloids which are potent inhibitors of glucosidases, enzymes involved in oligosaccharide trimming. These are important in determining the final configuration of specific glycoproteins. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) encodes a number of glycoproteins, some of which ultimately reside in the outer envelope of the mature virion and are important for virus infectivity. Treatment with three polyhydroxyalkaloids, castanospermine (CAST), deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and 2R,5R-dihydroxymethyl-3R, 4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) blocked the growth of infectious virus, as determined by yield reduction and plaque reduction assays. However, in the presence of CAST, CMV infected cells continued to shed virions into the extracellular medium, as determined by electron microscopy. Envelope glycoproteins of virions produced after treatment with CAST (2.5 mM) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (F5) specific for the gcI family of glycoproteins. Analysis by PAGE-SDS showed an absence of gcI complex 2 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp130) with a proportional increase in gcI complex 1 (gp52 disulphide-linked to gp95). The results indicated that gp130 alone, or linked to gp52, was important for CMV infectivity. As well as being potential targets for antiviral agents against CMV, inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming reactions may define components of the virion surface important for infectivity.","Taylor, D.L.; Fellows, L.E.; Farrar, G.H.; Nash, R.J.; Taylor-Robinson, D.; Mobberley, M.A.; Ryder, T.A.; Jeffries, D.J.; Tyms, A.S.",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134106/,57
9170,Small interfering RNAs on top,2004-04-24,"A CTL antigenic site located between residues 273 and 291 of the E1 envelope protein of RV was identified by (51)Cr-release assays employing SPs. Two E1-specific CTL clones were examined for immune recognition of RV wild-type and attenuated vaccine strains and recombinant E1 protein. The exact sequence (273–284) recognized by both clones was delineated by using truncated and overlapping SPs covering these residues. The defined T-cell site overlapped almost completely with a virus neutralizing antibody-binding site previously identified with mouse monoclonal and human antibodies. A series of single aa-substituted SP analogues of E1(273–284) was used to define residues critical for T-cell recognition. Using EBV-Bl displaying different HLA-DR haplotypes and -DR4 subtypes as targets to determine MHC class II restriction elements, immune recognition by both T-cell clones was shown to be associated with HLA-DR4. Three HLA-DR4 subtypes (DR4Dw 13A, DR4Dw13B, and DR4KT2) sharing a common residue, glutamic acid at position 74 in their β 1 chains, were able to present SP E1(273–284) to the T-cell clones.","Ou, Dawei; Mitchell, Leslie Ann; Ho, Margaret; Décarie, Diane; Tingle, Aubrey J.; Nepom, Gerald T.; Lacroix, Martial; Zrein, Maan",Hum Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135096/,57
9518,Genetic responses of inbred chicken lines illustrate importance of eIF2 family and immune-related genes in resistance to Newcastle disease virus,2020-04-09,"The transplantation of hematopoietic and lymphopoetic stem and progenitor cells has become a standard procedure for the treatment of many malignant diseases. Autologous stem cells are derived from the patient himself, allogeneic cells from an HLA-identical or HLA-compatible family or unrelated donor. Hematopoetic stem cells can be obtained from bone marrow, blood and fetal cord blood. After 3 to 5 days treatment, the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilizes stem- and progenitor cells from the marrow into the blood. This method is now standard in autologous transplantation and is increasingly preferred in allogeneic transplantation. The time to hematopoietic recovery is shorter with blood stem cells than with bone marrow cells. With myeloablative high dose therapy followed by stem cell transplantation, long term disease free survival is possible in many cases and great proportions of patients can be cured (see part II). Improvements of supportive care have reduced toxicity of treatment substantially, however severe complications still occur at oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, skin, kidney, urinary tract and nervous system. After allogeneic transplantation immunocompetent donor cells can react with the recipients tissue. In HLA-identical donor and recipients differences in the minor histocompatibility antigens account for this graft-versus-host-reaction (GvH), which is mainly mediated by transplanted T-cells. The GvH-reaction can affect skin, liver, gut and other organs and cause clinically relevant GvH-disease (GvHD). The GvHD is more severe in HLA-mis-matched or unrelated transplantations. Immunodeficiency and organ dysfunction due to GvHD may predispose to life threatening infections and impair the outcome of transplantion. Unrelated cord blood stem cells may have a minor risk of inducing acute GvHD, as stem and T-cells are immature. After allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the relapse rate of leukemia or lymphoma is significantly reduced by immunoreactive cells: graft-versus-tumor (GvT) or graftversus-leukemia effect (GvL).","Link, Hartmut; Kolb, Hans-Jochem; Ebell, Wolfram; Hossfeld, Dieter Kurt; Zander, Axel; Niethammer, Dietrich; Wandt, Hannes; Grosse-Wilde, Hans; Schaefer, Ulrich W.",Med Klin (Munich),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146030/,57
9553,Chapter 6 Protein Sorting in the Secretory Pathway,2008-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Cystic echinococcosis, caused by the cestode Echinococcus granulosus, is a neglected tropical disease with remarkable morbidity in humans and a problem of worldwide economic importance in livestock industry. Understanding the molecular basis of the parasite growth and development is essential for the disease diagnosis, management and control. The tetraspanin (TSP) family of proteins are transmembrane proteins with a role in many physiological processes of eukaryotic organisms. TSPs present in the tegumental surface of platyhelminths play pivotal roles in host-parasite interaction. However, little is known about the role of TSPs in growth and development in the Platyhelminthes. To understand the role of TSP1 in the growth and development of E. granulosus we investigated the effect of EgTSP1-specific long dsRNA in different in vitro stages of the parasite. METHODS: Different stages of E. granulosus, protoscoleces and strobilated worms, were cultivated In vitro in di-phasic media. Using long dsRNA and two delivery methods, i.e. electroporation and electro-soaking, EgTSP1 silencing was performed with an EgTSP1-specific dsRNA. The TSP1 expression profile was assessed as well as the biological and ultrastructural properties of the parasites. RESULTS: After three days of dsRNA treatment, EgTSP1 expression was significantly reduced in both stages of E. granulosus as compared to irrelevant/unrelated dsRNA and untreated controls. Silencing expression of EgTSP1 in different stages of E. granulosus resulted in reduced viability and body contractions, inhibition of protoscoleces evagination and distinctive tegumental changes. Ultrastructural morphology of the strobilated worms treated with EgTSP1-specific dsRNA was indicative of the microtriches impairments and vacuolated tegument compared to the control helminths. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study suggest that EgTSP1 plays important structural roles in tegument configuration in E. granulosus. EgTSP1 is proved to be a potential target for the development of vaccines and RNAi-based drugs.

9807,Systems biology of pathogen‐host interaction: Networks of protein‐protein interaction within pathogens and pathogen‐human interactions in the post‐genomic era,2012-11-29,"ABSTRACT: I describe the fruit characteristics of species closely associated with black lemur seed dispersal (i.e., species that are often dispersed by die black lemur and only dispersed by the black lemur in die Lokobe Forest). A black lemur group was habituated and observed during the day and night for all months of die year (total 1272 h). When fruits were eaten, die plant species was identified, die maturity of the fruit and treatment of the seeds noted, and the fruit described in terms of ripe fruit color, husk thickness, fruit length, and seed length and width. Black lemur feces were searched for seeds; these were identified and signs of damage noted. Other potential dispersers feeding on the fruits of species eaten by the black lemur were also noted. The black lemurs were seen eating die fruits of 70 species. Of these, 51 species were defined as closely associated with black lemur dispersal and 16 species had seeds that were either often preyed upon or wasted by the black lemur, or were seen being eaten by other potential seed dispersers. Fruits of species in the former group were often dull colored (94% of species); rarely less than 1 cm long (6%); rarely had seeds less than 0.1 cm long or less than 0.1 cm wide (2 and 4%, respectively); never had seeds more than 4 cm long or greater than 2 cm wide; and quite often had either thick husks (49%) or thin husks (51%). In contrast, the fruits of the latter group were often brightly colored (75% of species) and nearly always had a thin husk (94%). Also, this latter group included more small and very large fruits and seeds than the former group. Fruit characteristics significantly associated with the former group were: dull color, thick husk, fruit length greater than 2 cm, seed length 1–4 cm, and seed width 1–2 cm. The extent to which these traits are the result of coevolution between plants and the guild of lemur dispersers that includes the black lemur is not clear, but a coevolved lemur–fruit syndrome remains a possibility. RESUMES: Cette étude porte sur la description des caracteristiques des fruits appartenant aux espèces dont la dissemination des graines est étroitement liée au Eulemur macaco. Ces espèces sont definies comme étant souvent disséminees par E. macaco et uniquement disséminées par E. macaco dans la for○t de Lokobe. Dans le but d'identifier ces espéces, un groupe de E. macaco a été habituéà la présence humaine et observé jour et nuit pendant tous les mois de 1'année (en total 1272 h).

9820,Budding of enveloped viruses from the plasma membrane,2005-02-05,"Background The development of antibiotic resistance by microorganisms is an increasing problem in medicine. In chronic wounds, bacterial colonization is associated with impaired healing. Cold atmospheric plasma is an innovative promising tool to deal with these problems. Objectives The 5‐min argon plasma treatment has already demonstrated efficacy in reducing bacterial numbers in chronic infected wounds in vivo. In this study we investigated a 2‐min plasma treatment with the same device and the next‐generation device, to assess safety and reduction in bacterial load, regardless of the kind of bacteria and their resistance level in chronic wounds. Methods Twenty‐four patients with chronic infected wounds were treated in a prospective randomized controlled phase II study with 2 min of cold atmospheric argon plasma every day: 14 with MicroPlaSter alpha device, 10 with MicroPlaSter beta device (next‐generation device) in addition to standard wound care. The patient acted as his/her own control. Bacterial species were detected by standard bacterial swabs and bacterial load by semiquantitative count on nitrocellulose filters. The plasma settings were the same as in the previous phase II study in which wounds were exposed for 5 min to argon plasma. Results Analysis of 70 treatments in 14 patients with the MicroPlaSter alpha device revealed a significant (40%, P < 0·016) reduction in bacterial load in plasma‐treated wounds, regardless of the species of bacteria. Analysis of 137 treatments in 10 patients with the MicroPlaSter beta device showed a highly significant reduction (23·5%, P < 0·008) in bacterial load. No side‐effects occurred and the treatment was well tolerated. Conclusions A 2‐min treatment with either of two cold atmospheric argon plasma devices is a safe, painless and effective technique to decrease the bacterial load in chronic wounds.","Isbary, G.; Heinlin, J.; Shimizu, T.; Zimmermann, J.L.; Morfill, G.; Schmidt, H.‐U.; Monetti, R.; Steffes, B.; Bunk, W.; Li, Y.; Klaempfl, T.; Karrer, S.; Landthaler, M.; Stolz, W.",Br J Dermatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161860/,57
9829,Different applications of virus‐like particles in biology and medicine: Vaccination and delivery systems,2015-12-22,"I propose a T‐cell receptor (TcR)‐based mechanism by which immunity mediates both “genetic self” and “microbial self” thereby, connecting microbiome disease with autoimmunity. The hypothesis is based on simple principles. First, TcR are selected to avoid strong cross‐reactivity with “self,” resulting in selection for a TcR repertoire mimicking “genetic self.” Second, evolution has selected for a “microbial self” that mimics “genetic self” so as to share tolerance. In consequence, our TcR repertoire also mimics microbiome antigenicity, providing a novel mechanism for modulating tolerance to it. Also, the microbiome mimics the TcR repertoire, acting as a secondary immune system. I call this TcR‐microbiome mimicry “holoimmunity” to denote immune tolerance to the “holobiont self.” Logically, microbiome‐host mimicry means that autoimmunity directed at host antigens will also attack components of the microbiome, and conversely, an immunological attack on the microbiome may cross‐react with host antigens producing “holoautoimmunity.”","Root‐Bernstein, Robert",Bioessays,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161894/,57

Based on the 22‐residue, active Lys fragment of the mung bean trypsin inhibitor, a series of furin inhibitors were designed and synthesized, and their inhibitory activity towards furin and kexin was evaluated using enzyme kinetic analysis. The most potent inhibitor, containing 16 amino acid residues with a K (i) value of 2.45 × 10(−9) m for furin and of 5.60 × 10(−7) m for kexin, was designed with three incremental approaches. First, two nonessential Cys residues in the Lys fragment were deleted via a Cys‐to‐Ser mutation to minimize peptide misfolding. Second, residues in the reactive site of the inhibitor were replaced by the consensus substrate recognition sequence of furin, namely, Arg at P(1), Lys at P(2), Arg at P(4) and Arg at P(6). In addition, the P(7) residue Asp was substituted with Ala to avoid possible electrostatic interference with furin inhibition. Finally, the extra N‐terminal and C‐terminal residues beyond the doubly conjugated disulfide loops were further truncated. However, all resultant synthetic peptides were found to be temporary inhibitors of furin and kexin during a prolonged incubation, with the scissile peptide bond between P(1) and P(1)′ being cleaved to different extents by the enzymes. To enhance proteolytic resistance, the P(1)′ residue Ser was mutated to d‐Ser or N‐methyl‐Ser. The N‐methyl‐Ser mutant gave rise to a K (i) value of 4.70 × 10(−8) m for furin, and retained over 80% inhibitory activity even after a 3 h incubation with the enzyme. By contrast, the d‐Ser mutant was resistant to cleavage, although its inhibitory activity against furin drastically decreased. Our findings identify a useful template for the design of potent, specific and stable peptide inhibitors of furin, shedding light on the molecular determinants that dictate the inhibition of furin and kexin.","Tao, Hu; Zhang, Zhen; Shi, Jiahao; Shao, Xiao‐xia; Cui, Dafu; Chi, Cheng‐wu",FEBS J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164071/,57

We also found RNA‐silencing is induced on introduction of catalytically active as well as inactive ribozymes. Using RNA‐silencing suppressors (RSS), we demonstrate that the endonucleolytic activity of ribozymes is a true phenomenon, even while a mutated version may demonstrate a similar down‐regulation of the target RNA.

Even today new indications evolve due to the complex mode of action of these compounds. Due to the fear of side effects, especially irreversible retinopathy, their use is often limited. These side‐effects, however, are a consequence of excessive daily dosages. An effective, safe therapy needs correct dosing, i. e. adherence to maximal daily dosages of 3.5(–4) mg chloroquine or 6(–6.5) mg hydroxychloroquine per kilogram ideal body weight. If the actual body weight is lower than the ideal body weight, this actual weight is used for the calculation of the dosage. Observing these limits allows a rather safe therapy of the diseases like lupus erythematosus, REM syndrome, porphyria cutanea tarda (2 × 125 mg chloroquine/week), cutaneous sarcoidosis and dermatomyositis. If standard therapies fail, then antimalarials can be tried to treat Sjögren syndrome, granu‐loma annulare or erosive lichen planus. If therapy fails, either can be combined with quinacrine to increase their effectiveness. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are indispensable and well‐tolerated essential drugs in dermatology and especially suited as part of a combination scheme, for example with corticosteroids, as they act synergistically and reduce side‐effects.","Ochsendorf, Falk R.",J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164377/,57

Access is limited by a range of factors including inability to pay, a lack of infrastructure, and corruption in some countries. Surrounding and exacerbating these structural and technological problems is the layer of legal rights created by patents and their licensing that complicate and render more expensive the preparation and delivery of needed medicines, particularly those that need to be adapted to the social, health and cultural environment of developing countries. This article provides a survey of innovative strategies that aim at maximizing the potential of patents to facilitate the development and delivery of medicines against diseases, the burden of which falls principally on developing country populations. To understand the context in which these strategies are being proposed and implemented, the article reviews the battles over access to medicines beginning in the late 1980s. It then surveys some of the principal suggestions put forward to better direct innovation systems in addressing the critical health needs of the world’s majority including advance market commitments, patent buy‐outs, prize funds, public–private partnerships and patent pools.","Richard Gold, E.; Morin, Jean‐Frédéric",Glob Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165701/,57

Specifically, through approaching Fukushima as a cosmopolitical event we gain insight into the complex processes of normalizing social relations. Moreover, the Fukushima event and its effects demand to extend the history of the sociological imagination to the social and political relevance of the non‐human.

This implies the existence of very efficient defense mechanisms that are capable of eliminating the vast majority of microorganisms before they colonize and multiply to sufficient levels, resulting in clinical diseases. In order to overcome this continuous barrage of microorganisms, there is a complex array of defense mechanisms present in the upper and lower respiratory tract capable of eradicating these organisms. However, in individuals suffering from a variety of diseases, including virus infections, colonization occurs rapidly with subsequent development of pneumonia. Thus, it is estimated that 90% of bacterial pneumonias develop after a viral infection. Furthermore, individuals suffering from a viral pneumonia have a 40% chance of developing bacterial pneumonia. The reasons for the increased colonization of the lung by bacteria following virus infections are related to the surface properties of epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, the physiological environment of the respiratory tract, and the alteration of the specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms of the lung that occurs as a result of virus infection.","Babiuk, Lorne A.; Lawman, M.J.P.; Ohmann, H.

We then analyzed the sera of 71 children (age range, 14 months to 9 years) with pulmonary infiltrates for the presence of four classes of antibody to EBV. Antibody responses consistent with current or recent EB virus infection were found in 15. Two children had IgM antibodies to the EBV viral antigen at titers ≥1:160, indicating current infection, and all 15 patients had antibody to components of the early antigen complex, suggesting recent infection. A fourfold rise or drop in one or more EBV-specific antibody classes was noted in eight patients within 30 days following onset of clinical illness. Few patients had clinical features suggesting infectious mononucleosis. Eight of the 15 with serologic evidence of current or recent EBV infection also had clinical or serologic evidence of infection with another pathogen-bacterial, viral, or mycoplasmal. Thus, in childhood pneumonia, EBV may be a primary, co-primary, or secondary pathogen; it may be reactivated in the course of infection with another agent, or possibly, by suppressing immune function, it may precipitate infection with some other organism.","Andiman, Warren A.; McCarthy, Paul; Markowitz, Richard I.; Cormier, David; Horstmann, Dorothy M.",J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172620/,57

It was hypothesized that, for a correlation between SLA and RGR, SLA needs to be associated with specific nitrogen absorption rate of roots (SAR), which counteracts the negative effect of SLA on LNC(a). • . Five trees and six herbs were grown under optimal conditions and relationships between SAR and RGR components were analyzed using a model based on balanced growth hypothesis. • . SLA varied 1.9‐fold between species. Simulations predicted that, if SAR is not associated with SLA, this variation in SLA would cause a 47% decrease in LNC(a) along the SLA gradient, leading to a marginal net positive effect on RGR. In reality, SAR was positively related to SLA, showing a 3.9‐fold variation, which largely compensated for the negative effect of SLA on LNC(a). Consequently, LNC(a )values were almost constant across species and a positive SLA–RGR relationship was achieved. • . These results highlight the importance of leaf–root interactions in understanding interspecific differences in RGR.","Osone, Yoko; Ishida, Atsushi; Tateno, Masaki",New Phytol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192335/,57

11010,Proteomic analysis revealed T cell hyporesponsiveness induced by Haemonchus contortus excretory and secretory proteins,2020-05-13,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Chlamydia psittaci, an obligate, intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium and economically relevant pathogen in poultry and pet bird, could cause psittacosis/ornithosis, and is also a human pathogen causing atypical pneumonia after zoonotic transmission. H9N2 influenza virus, a low pathogenic avian influenza viruses’ subtype, has become endemic in different types of domestic poultry in lots of countries, resulting in great economic loss due to reduced egg production or high mortality associated with coinfection with other pathogens. These two pathogens are easily mixed with other pathogens to aggravate the disease, and often cause mixed infection in clinics. Co-infection of C. psittaci with H9N2 commonly induces severe pneumonia and high mortality in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. According to previous studies, we postulated that C. psittaci infection may beneficial for the replication of H9N2 in HD11. Consequently, in this study, we clarify the pathogenic mechanism of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in the chicken macrophage cell line HD11, which is the first study of the coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 in vitro. ABSTRACT: In a pilot study, simultaneous infection with Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) and H9N2 virus induced 20% mortality and severe avian airsacculitis, shedding light on animal models of poultry respiratory diseases. However, the pathogenesis is still unclear. In the current study, we hypothesized that C. psittaci infection execrates macrophage function and facilitates H9N2 infection. To explore the potential mechanism, we studied the effect of C. psittaci and H9N2 on the functions of HD11 cells in vitro by simultaneous infection of C. psittaci and H9N2. At the same time, we used infection with C. psittaci or H9N2 alone as the control groups. The results showed that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly aggravate the mortality of HD11 cells compared to C. psittaci or H9N2 infection alone. In addition, coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 did not induce high C. psittaci loads compared to C. psittaci infection alone at 12- and 24-hours post-inoculation (hpi), but coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could increase the loads of H9N2 compared to H9N2 alone in HD11 cells at 12 hpi. More importantly, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels, enzyme activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and phagocytosis were reduced significantly in the group with C. psittaci and H9N2 coinfection compared to those of H9N2 or C. psittaci alone at 24 hpi. Finally, C. psittaci infection induced robust expressions of type Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, while interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) displayed a significant decrease compared to H9N2 infection alone at 24 hpi. All the above data indicate that C. psittaci infection can facilitate H9N2 invasion and to aggravate severe avian airsacculitis by impairing macrophage functions.","Chu, Jun; Guo, Yongxia; Xu, Guanlong; Zhang, Qiang; Zuo, Zonghui; Li, Qiang; Wang, Yihui; He, Cheng",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222846/,57
11102,A Rotavirus Virus-Like Particle Confined Palladium Nanoreactor and Its Immobilization on Graphene Oxide for Catalysis,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) regulates the differentiation of Th1, Th2, Th17 cells and Treg cells, which play a critical role in airway inflammation of asthma. Here we investigated the role of ACC in the pathogenesis of asthma. METHODS: Chicken Ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged mice were divided into three groups, PBS group, DMSO (solvent of TOFA) group and ACC inhibitor 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid (TOFA) + DMSO group. Airway inflammation was assessed with histology, percentages of CD4(+)T cell subsets in lung and spleen was assessed with flow cytometry, and airway responsiveness was assessed with FinePointe RC system. The expression of characteristic transcription factors of CD4(+)T cell subsets was evaluated with real-time PCR. Cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum was determined with ELISA. RESULTS: In asthma mice, the expression of ACC increased, while the expression of phosphorylated ACC (pACC) decreased. TOFA had no significant effect on pACC expression. TOFA reduced serum IgE, airway inflammatory cells infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia, but dramatically increased airway responsiveness. TOFA significantly reduced the percentages of Th1, Th2, Th17 cells in lung and spleen, the expression of GATA3 and RORγt in lung, and IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17A levels in BALF and serum. TOFA had no significant effect on the percentage of Treg cells, IL-10 level and the expression of T-bet and Foxp3. CONCLUSION: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor TOFA might have a distinct effect on asthmatic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness.","Zhu, Fang-fang; Wang, Yi-min; He, Guang-zhen; Chen, Yi-fei; Gao, Ya-dong",Pharmacol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223088/,57

METHODS: This retrospective, single-center cohort study included 562 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a tertiary hospital from January 2015 to December 2016. We assessed VS occurrence and its relationship with HD duration and other risk factors. To assess the effect of the HD duration on VS occurrence, we constructed ordinal variables: HD = 0 (non-HD), 0 < HD ≤ 5 (HD ≤ 5 years), 5 < HD ≤ 10, and 10 < HD. RESULTS: The overall mean (± standard deviation) age of patients was (73 ± 11) years, and there were 60.9% men. Forty-one patients (7.3%) were HD dependent. Cardiac surgeries included all coronary artery bypass graft procedures, all valvular procedures, and aortic surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Sixty-six patients (10%) developed VS. Most preoperative patient characteristics were comparable between the VS and no-VS groups; a chronic HD status and a total CPB time of > 180 min were significantly more common in the VS group (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Longer term HD significantly correlated with VS incidence (P < 0.0001). Ordinal variables for the HD duration and age and known risk factors for VS (preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, low left-ventricular ejection fraction, and CPB time > 180 min) were subjected to multivariate regression analysis. Long-term HD was identified as an independent predictor of VS (odds ratio, 2.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.66–3.18). CONCLUSIONS: Longer term HD may be associated with a higher VS incidence after cardiac surgery. VS should be given attention after cardiac surgery in chronic HD-dependent patients.","Suga, Masafumi; Kawakami, Daisuke; Ueta, Hiroshi; Shimozono, Takahiro; Ito, Jiro; Seo, Ryutaro; Nakamori, Yuki; Korenaga, Akira; Morimoto, Takeshi; Mima, Hiroyuki",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223237/,57

METHODS: A panel discussion with small group breakouts on stress in clinical medicine, learning challenges, competition with colleagues, handling stressful events, and recognizing burnout symptoms was conducted with medical students entering clerkships. A longitudinal survey design was utilized to measure pre-, post-, and long-term (3-month) changes in knowledge (impact of stress on personal health, learning, and patient care), confidence, perceived skills, and attitude (towards utilizing adaptive coping strategies) among participating students (N = 135). Paired t test and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the differences between survey responses on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Survey response rates were pre-90.4%, post-77%, and long-term post-71.1%. Compared to pre-workshop, students reported significant improvement in all four domains immediately post-workshop: knowledge (4.4 vs. 4.7, p < 0.05), confidence (3.6 vs. 3.9, p < 0.05), perceived skills (3.3 vs. 3.7, p < 0.05), and attitude (2.6 vs. 2.8, p < 0.05).

11794,Transcriptome Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles of Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus-Infected Whiteflies over Different Viral Acquisition Access Periods,2020-05-11,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common and contagious virus that results in acute respiratory tract infections in infants. In many cases, the symptoms of RSV remain mild, however, a subset of individuals develop severe RSV-associated bronchiolitis. As such, RSV is the chief cause of infant hospitalization within the United States. Typically, the immune response to RSV is a type 1 response that involves both the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, type 2 cytokines may also be produced as a result of infection of RSV and there is increasing evidence that children who develop severe RSV-associated bronchiolitis are at a greater risk of developing asthma later in life. This review summarizes the contribution of a newly described cell type, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), and epithelial-derived alarmin proteins that activate ILC2, including IL-33, IL-25, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). ILC2 activation leads to the production of type 2 cytokines and the induction of a type 2 response during RSV infection. Intervening in this innate type 2 inflammatory pathway may have therapeutic implications for severe RSV-induced disease.","Norlander, Allison E.; Peebles, R.

12066,Identification and characterization of adipose surface epitopes,2020-07-17,"Traditionally, the skin is considered as a protective barrier which acts as a highly impermeable region of the human body. But in recent times, it is recognized as a specialized organ that aids in the delivery of a wide range of drug molecules into the skin (intradermal drug delivery) and across the skin into systemic circulation (transdermal drug delivery, TDD). The bioavailability of a drug administered transdermally can be improved by several penetration enhancement techniques, which are broadly classified into chemical and physical techniques. Application of mentioned techniques together with efforts of various scientific and innovative companies had made TDD a multibillion dollar market and an average of 2.6 new transdermal drugs are being approved each year. Out of various techniques, the thermal ablation techniques involving chemicals, heating elements, lasers, and radiofrequency (RF) are proved to be more effective in terms of delivering the drug across the skin by disrupting the stratum corneum (SC). The reason behind it is that the thermal ablation technique resulted in improved bioavailability, quick treatment and fast recovery of the SC, and more importantly it does not cause any damage to underlying dermis layer. This review article mainly discussed about various thermal ablation techniques with commercial products and patents in each classes, and their safety aspects. This review also briefly presented anatomy of the skin, penetration pathways across the skin, and different generations of TDD.

Subsequent periodical CT scans termed “sequential scans” were obtained for three cadavers. The first scan was performed immediately after the body was transferred from the emergency room to the institute of legal medicine. Sequential scans were obtained and evaluated for 24 h at maximum. The time of death had been determined in the emergency room. The sequential scans enabled us to observe periodical post-mortem changes in CT images. The series of continuous LCV images obtained up to 24 h (two cases)/16 h (1 case) after death was evaluated. The average Hounsfield units (HU) within the LCVs progressively increased, and LCV volume progressively decreased over time. The HU in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased at an individual rate proportional to the post-mortem interval (PMI). Thus, an early longitudinal radiodensity change in the CSF could be potential indicator of post-mortem interval (PMI). Sequential imaging scans reveal post-mortem changes in the CSF space which may reflect post-mortem brain alterations. Further studies are needed to evaluate the proposed CSF change markers in correlation with other validated PMI indicators.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Virtual Health Library from inception through March 2019. We considered any study evaluating pharmaceutical interventions for pain management during the withholding or withdrawing of life support in adult critically ill patients at the end-of-life. Two independent investigators performed the screening and data extraction. We pooled data on utilization rate of analgesic and sedative drugs and summarized the dosing between the moment prior to withholding or withdrawal of life support and the moment before death. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in the United States (38%), Canada (31%), and the Netherlands (31%). Eleven studies were single-cohort and twelve had a Newcastle–Ottawa Scale score of less than 7. The mean age of the patients ranged from 59 to 71 years, 59–100% were mechanically ventilated, and 47–100% of the patients underwent life support withdrawal. The most commonly used opioid and sedative were morphine [utilization rate 60% (95% CI 48–71%)] and midazolam [utilization rate 28% (95% CI 23–32%)], respectively. Doses increased during the end-of-life process (pooled mean increase in the dose of morphine: 2.6 mg/h, 95% CI 1.2–4). CONCLUSIONS: Pain control is centered on opioids and adjunctive benzodiazepines, with dosages exceeding those recommended by guidelines. Despite consistency among guidelines, there is significant heterogeneity among practices in end-of-life care.

Despite this renaissance, a subset of cancer patients remain unresponsive to ICBs due to widespread immuno-resistance. To “break” cancer cell-driven immuno-resistance, researchers have long floated the idea of therapeutically facilitating the immunogenicity of cancer cells by disrupting tumor-associated immuno-tolerance via conventional anticancer therapies. It is well appreciated that anticancer therapies causing immunogenic or inflammatory cell death are best positioned to productively activate anticancer immunity. A large proportion of studies have emphasized the importance of immunogenic apoptosis (i.e., immunogenic cell death or ICD); yet, it has also emerged that necroptosis, a programmed necrotic cell death pathway, can also be immunogenic. Emergence of a proficient immune profile for necroptosis has important implications for cancer because resistance to apoptosis is one of the major hallmarks of tumors. Putative immunogenic or inflammatory characteristics driven by necroptosis can be of great impact in immuno-oncology. However, as is typical for a highly complex and multi-factorial disease like cancer, a clear cause versus consensus relationship on the immunobiology of necroptosis in cancer cells has been tough to establish.

13069,Sea change in coastal science,2020-09-15,"This research aims to create a hierarchical framework for the development of a platform business model based on big data. However, this hierarchical framework must consider unnecessary attributes and the interrelationships between the aspects and the criteria. Hence, fuzzy set theory is used for screening out the unnecessary attributes, a decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is proposed to manage the complex interrelationships among the aspects and attributes, and interpretive structural modeling (ISM) is used to divide the hierarchy and finally construct a hierarchical framework. The results reveal that (1) value proposition and community building in value production are fundamental links; (2) information technology and information management in value production are technical supports; (3) customer development in value marketing is the power source; and (4) value acquisition is the last link, which is established on the basis of and influenced by value marketing and value network. This hierarchical framework aims to guide the platform toward the application of big data. This study also proposes engagement of stakeholders for promoting value creation and establishing a sound business model from multiple levels and links.","Du, Xiaomin; Gao, Yang; Chang, Linlin; Lang, Xiangxiang; Xue, Xingqun; Bi, Datian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7514008/,57

Closely related laboratory strains of T3D, originating from the same ancestral T3D isolate, were recently found to exhibit significantly different oncolytic properties. Specifically, the T3D(PL) strain had faster replication kinetics in a panel of cancer cells and improved tumor regression in an in vivo melanoma model, relative to T3D(TD). In this study, we discover that T3D(PL) and T3D(TD) also differentially activate host signalling pathways and downstream gene transcription. At equivalent infectious dose, T3D(TD) induces higher IRF3 phosphorylation and expression of type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) than T3D(PL). Using mono-reassortants with intermediate replication kinetics and pharmacological inhibitors of reovirus replication, IFN responses were found to inversely correlate with kinetics of virus replication. In other words, slow-replicating T3D strains induce more IFN signalling than fast-replicating T3D strains. Paradoxically, during co-infections by T3D(PL) and T3D(TD), there was still high IRF3 phosphorylation indicating a phenodominant effect by the slow-replicating T3D(TD). Using silencing and knock-out of RIG-I to impede IFN, we found that IFN induction does not affect the first round of reovirus replication but does prevent cell-cell spread in a paracrine fashion. Accordingly, during co-infections, T3D(PL) continues to replicate robustly despite activation of IFN by T3D(TD). Using gene expression analysis, we discovered that reovirus can also induce a subset of genes in a RIG-I and IFN-independent manner; these genes were induced more by T3D(PL) than T3D(TD). Polymorphisms in reovirus σ3 viral protein were found to control activation of RIG-I/ IFN-independent genes. Altogether, the study reveals that single amino acid polymorphisms in reovirus genomes can have large impact on host gene expression, by both changing replication kinetics and by modifying viral protein activity, such that two closely related T3D strains can induce opposite cytokine landscapes.","Mohamed, Adil; Konda, Prathyusha; Eaton, Heather E.; Gujar, Shashi; Smiley, James R.; Shmulevitz, Maya",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7529228/,57
13144,Combining evolutionary information extracted from frequency profiles with sequence-based kernels for protein remote homology detection,2014-02-15,"Background. Variant influenza virus infections are rare but may have pandemic potential if person-to-person transmission is efficient. We describe the epidemiology of a multistate outbreak of an influenza A(H3N2) variant virus (H3N2v) first identified in 2011. Methods. We identified laboratory-confirmed cases of H3N2v and used a standard case report form to characterize illness and exposures. We considered illness to result from person-to-person H3N2v transmission if swine contact was not identified within 4 days prior to illness onset. Results. From 9 July to 7 September 2012, we identified 306 cases of H3N2v in 10 states. The median age of all patients was 7 years. Commonly reported signs and symptoms included fever (98%), cough (85%), and fatigue (83%). Sixteen patients (5.2%) were hospitalized, and 1 fatal case was identified. The majority of those infected reported agricultural fair attendance (93%) and/or contact with swine (95%) prior to illness. We identified 15 cases of possible person-to-person transmission of H3N2v. Viruses recovered from patients were 93%–100% identical and similar to viruses recovered from previous cases of H3N2v. All H3N2v viruses examined were susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir and resistant to adamantane antiviral medications. Conclusions. In a large outbreak of variant influenza, the majority of infected persons reported exposures, suggesting that swine contact at an agricultural fair was a risk for H3N2v infection. We identified limited person-to-person H3N2v virus transmission, but found no evidence of efficient or sustained person-to-person transmission. Fair managers and attendees should be aware of the risk of swine-to-human transmission of influenza viruses in these settings.","Jhung, Michael A.; Epperson, Scott; Biggerstaff, Matthew; Allen, Donna; Balish, Amanda; Barnes, Nathelia; Beaudoin, Amanda; Berman, LaShondra; Bidol, Sally; Blanton, Lenee; Blythe, David; Brammer, Lynnette; D'Mello, Tiffany; Danila, Richard; Davis, William; de Fijter, Sietske; DiOrio, Mary; Durand, Lizette O.; Emery, Shannon; Fowler, Brian; Garten, Rebecca; Grant, Yoran; Greenbaum, Adena; Gubareva, Larisa; Havers, Fiona; Haupt, Thomas; House, Jennifer; Ibrahim, Sherif; Jiang, Victoria; Jain, Seema; Jernigan, Daniel; Kazmierczak, James; Klimov, Alexander; Lindstrom, Stephen; Longenberger, Allison; Lucas, Paul; Lynfield, Ruth; McMorrow, Meredith; Moll, Maria; Morin, Craig; Ostroff, Stephen; Page, Shannon L.; Park, Sarah Y.; Peters, Susan; Quinn, Celia; Reed, Carrie; Richards, Shawn; Scheftel, Joni; Simwale, Owen; Shu, Bo; Soyemi, Kenneth; Stauffer, Jill; Steffens, Craig; Su, Su; Torso, Lauren; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Vetter, Sara; Villanueva, Julie; Wong, Karen K.; Shaw, Michael; Bresee, Joseph S.; Cox, Nancy; Finelli, Lyn",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733625/,57
13267,N-glycosylation in the Pre-Membrane Protein Is Essential for the Zika Virus Life Cycle,2020-08-23,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) impacts the health and welfare of shelter cats. Mitigation strategies include stress reduction and population-level approaches; effective treatment plans focus on reducing the clinical signs in cats affected by URTD. This study evaluated the use of famciclovir, an antiviral therapy, in reducing clinical signs in shelter cats with URTD when administered at a target dose range of 40–90 mg/kg twice daily for up to 21 days. Cats were randomized into either a famciclovir treatment group (n = 11) or placebo group (n = 11). Testing for viral pathogen identification was performed at enrollment in the study, and clinical scoring was completed daily to evaluate the severity of signs. With each day of treatment, cats in both groups were less likely to experience worsening clinical scores; however, cats in the famciclovir treatment group had a significantly lower risk of worsening clinical signs with each day compared to the placebo group. Feline herpesvirus, a common pathogen causing URTD, was identified in 11/21 cats. The results of this small study justify the need for further research to determine the utility of famciclovir as part of treatment protocols for improving clinical signs and overall impacts of URTD in shelter cats. ABSTRACT: Upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) is a clinically relevant infectious disease in shelter cats, with individual and population-level welfare implications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of famciclovir in reducing clinical signs of URTD in shelter cats during a therapeutic period of up to 21 days. Cats at two Northeastern United States animal shelters with URTD clinical signs were enrolled in a pragmatic, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Cats received either famciclovir (n = 11, target dose range 40–90 mg/kg) or placebo (n = 11), administered orally twice daily for up to 21 days with once-daily clinical scoring. At enrollment, conjunctival and oropharyngeal samples were collected for respiratory pathogen identification by RT-PCR. Zero-inflated Poisson regression was used to evaluate the treatment group effects and changes in clinical scoring over time. With each day of treatment, cats in both groups were less likely to experience worsening clinical scores; however, the risk of worsening scores with each day of treatment was significantly less in the famciclovir group compared to placebo (p = 0.006). Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) DNA was detected in 11/21 cats. The findings justify further pragmatic studies to determine whether famciclovir treatment can contribute to a clinically relevant reduction in URTD morbidity in shelter cats.","Reinhard, Chelsea L.; McCobb, Emily; Stefanovski, Darko; Sharp, Claire R.",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552613/,57

We isolate and characterize a panel of plasmablast-derived monoclonal antibodies from an infected child whose antibody response focuses on the plateau epitope near the icosahedral 3-fold axes. Eight of a total of 19 antibodies target this epitope and three of these potently neutralize the virus. Representative neutralizing antibodies 38-1-10A and 38-3-11A both confer effective protection against lethal EV71 challenge in hSCARB2-transgenic mice. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of the EV71 virion in complex with Fab fragments of these potent and protective antibodies reveal the details of a conserved epitope formed by residues in the BC and HI loops of VP2 and the BC and HI loops of VP3 spanning the region around the 3-fold axis. Remarkably, the two antibodies interact with the epitope in quite distinct ways. These plateau-binding antibodies provide templates for promising candidate therapeutics.","Huang, Kuan-Ying A.; Zhou, Daming; Fry, Elizabeth E.; Kotecha, Abhay; Huang, Peng-Nien; Yang, Shu-Li; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Huang, Yhu-Chering; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Ren, Jingshan; Stuart, David I.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7567869/,57
13857,Correction: Toosendanin demonstrates promising antitumor efficacy in osteosarcoma by targeting STAT3,2019-02-15,"PURPOSE: Soluble cytokine receptors are potential biomarkers for immune activation and have a promising potential as immunotherapeutic agents. We investigated the levels of soluble cytokine receptors in aqueous humour (AH) samples from patients with specific autoimmune uveitic entities. METHODS: Patients with active uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease (BD) (n = 13), sarcoidosis (n = 8), HLA-B27-related inflammation (n = 12), Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) disease (n = 12) and control subjects (n = 9) were included. AH samples were analyzed with the use of multiplex assays for the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and the soluble cytokine receptors sCD30, sCD163, sgp130, sIL-6 receptor-α (sIL-6R), sTNFRI and sTNFRII. RESULTS: TNF-α and soluble cytokine receptor AH levels were significantly higher in uveitis patients (n = 45) compared with controls (n = 9). When nongranulomatous uveitis (BD and HLA-B27-associated uveitis) was compared with granulomatous uveitis (sarcoidosis and VKH disease), the levels of sCD30 and sTNFRI/TNF-α and sTNFRII/TNF-α ratios were significantly enhanced in granulomatous uveitis. Finally, when comparing the profile in the specific uveitis entities, sCD30 levels were highest in patients with VKH disease. sgp130, sCD163, sIL-6R, sTNFRI and sTNFRII did not differ significantly between the four different clinical uveitic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Soluble cytokine receptors are significantly upregulated in autoimmune uveitis. CD30(+) T cells might contribute to the inflammatory process in granulomatous uveitis, particularly in VKH disease. Granulomatous uveitis is also characterized by significantly higher sTNFRs/TNF-α ratios than nongranulomatous uveitis.","Abu El-Asrar, Ahmed M.; Berghmans, Nele; Al-Obeidan, Saleh A.; Gikandi, Priscilla W.; Opdenakker, Ghislain; Van Damme, Jo; Struyf, Sofie",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608430/,57

Risk assessment scoring tools, which quantify risks associated with unique factors characterizing an individual, could act as a surrogate measure of TBI risk and guide effective and efficient TPT delivery. We assessed important risk factors of childhood TBI and created risk assessment tools through secondary analysis of data from a large, community-based childhood TB prevalence study in the island province of Bohol in the Philippines, a low–HIV- and high–TB-burden, post-disaster setting. We identified four factors that were statistically associated with acquiring TBI—being 5 years or older, having a known TB contact, having a known TB contact who was either the mother or another primary caregiver, and living in a high–TB-burden municipality. We created 2-item, 4-item, and 9-item scores intended to identify child TBI in this low-resource, low–HIV-, and high–TB-burden setting. In addition to the design, evaluation, and impact analysis of these generalizable and valuable risk assessment tools, our study findings emphasize the necessity of targeting both household and community-associated transmissions of childhood TBI to achieve the global goal to end TB.","Gatchalian, Salvacion R.; Agathis, Nickolas T.; Castillo-Carandang, Nina T.; Gunter, Sarah M.; Murray, Kristy O.; Mandalakas, Anna M.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7646812/,57
14159,Methamphetamine induces cardiomyopathy by Sigmar1 inhibition-dependent impairment of mitochondrial dynamics and function,2020-11-17,"BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). However, the characteristics of frail patients with suspected infection remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of frail patients with suspected infection in ICUs. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter cohort study, including 22 ICUs in Japan. Adult patients (aged ≥16 years) with newly suspected infection from December 2017 to May 2018 were included. We compared baseline patient characteristics and outcomes among three frailty groups based on the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score: fit (score, 1–3), vulnerable (score, 4), and frail (score, 5–9). We conducted subgroup analysis of patients with sepsis defined as per Sepsis-3 criteria. We also produced Kaplan–Meier survival curves for 90-day survival. RESULTS: We enrolled 650 patients with suspected infection, including 599 (92.2%) patients with sepsis. Patients with a median CFS score of 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 3–5) were included: 337 (51.8%) were fit, 109 (16.8%) were vulnerable, and 204 (31.4%) were frail. The median patient age was 72 years (IQR 60–81). The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores for fit, vulnerable, and frail patients were 7 (IQR 4–10), 8 (IQR 5–11), and 7 (IQR 5–10), respectively (p = 0.59). The median body temperatures of fit, vulnerable, and frail patients were 37.5 °C (IQR 36.5 °C–38.5 °C), 37.5 °C (IQR 36.4 °C–38.6 °C), and 37.0 °C (IQR 36.3 °C–38.1 °C), respectively (p < 0.01). The median C-reactive protein levels of fit, vulnerable, and frail patients were 13.6 (IQR 4.6–24.5), 12.1 (IQR 3.9–24.9), 10.5 (IQR 3.0–21.0) mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.01). In-hospital mortality did not statistically differ among the patients according to frailty (p = 0.19). Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed little difference in the mortality rate during short-term follow-up. However, more vulnerable and frail patients died after 30-day than fit patients; this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). Compared with the fit and vulnerable groups, the rate of home discharge was lower in the frail group. CONCLUSION: Frail and vulnerable patients with suspected infection tend to have poor disease outcomes. However, they did not show a statistically significant increase in the 90-day mortality risk.","Komori, Akira; Abe, Toshikazu; Yamakawa, Kazuma; Ogura, Hiroshi; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Saitoh, Daizoh; Fujishima, Seitaro; Otomo, Yasuhiro; Kotani, Joji; Sakamoto, Yuichiro; Sasaki, Junichi; Shiino, Yasukazu; Takeyama, Naoshi; Tarui, Takehiko; Tsuruta, Ryosuke; Nakada, Taka-aki; Hifumi, Toru; Iriyama, Hiroki; Naito, Toshio; Gando, Satoshi",BMC Geriatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677099/,57

Commonly used variations with multiple exponentially distributed variables are more flexible, yet do not allow for arbitrary distributions. We present a new formulation, focussing on the SEIR concept that allows to include general distributions of incubation and removal times. We compare the solution to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases. Furthermore a family of asymptotic solutions of the equations is found in terms of a logistic curve, which after a non-universal time shift, fits extremely well all the microdynamical simulations. The formulation allows for a simple numerical approach; software in Julia and Python is provided.","Hernández, Pilar; Pena, Carlos; Ramos, Alberto; Gómez-Cadenas, Juan José",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857597/,57

As a result, recombinant Env glycoproteins generally elicit inadequate antibody levels that neutralize clinically relevant, neutralization-resistant (Tier-2) HIV-1 strains. Multivalent antigen presentation on nanoparticles is an established strategy to increase vaccine-driven immune responses. However, due to nanoparticle instability in vivo, the display of non-native Env structures, and the inaccessibility of many neutralizing antibody (NAb) epitopes, the effects of nanoparticle display are generally modest for Env trimers. Here, we generate two-component self-assembling protein nanoparticles presenting twenty SOSIP trimers of the clade C Tier-2 genotype 16055. We show in a rabbit immunization study that these nanoparticles induce 60-fold higher autologous Tier-2 NAb titers than the corresponding SOSIP trimers. Epitope mapping studies reveal that the presentation of 16055 SOSIP trimers on these nanoparticle focuses antibody responses to an immunodominant apical epitope. Thus, these nanoparticles are a promising platform to improve the immunogenicity of Env trimers with apex-proximate NAb epitopes.","Brouwer, Philip J.

METHODS: This review is based on articles retrieved by a systematic search in the PubMed and Web of Science database for publications up to November 2020 dealing with unstable fractures of the mid-thoracic spine. RESULTS: Altogether, 1109 articles were retrieved from the literature search. A total of 1095 articles were excluded. Thus, 16 remaining original articles were included in this systematic review depicting the topics timing of surgery in polytraumatized patients, outcome neurologic deficits, and impact of concomitant injuries. The overall level of evidence of the vast majority of studies is low. CONCLUSION: The evidence of the available literature is low. The cited studies reveal that thoracic spinal fractures are associated with a high number of neurological deficits and concomitant injuries, particularly of the thoracic cage and the lung.

The country is also home to a large population of undernourished people. This indicates potential for mainstreaming the nutrition dimension in the farming system to impact on nutrition outcomes. A Farming System for Nutrition (FSN) study was conducted in two agro-ecologically different locations from 2013–2018, to explore the feasibility of nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions. The baseline survey in 2013–2014 revealed that the population in the study area was largely undernourished and that household diets were cereal-dominated. The FSN model was designed in consultation with community members, to increase availability of nutrient-dense cereals and pulses, by enhancing production and crop diversification at the farm level, promoting cultivation of nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables in nutrition gardens and supporting interventions to promote access to animal foods. Nutrition awareness initiatives were undertaken to build capacity at the local level and translate production diversity to consumption diversity. An endline survey was conducted in 2017 (July-October), following three years of intervention. Crop, vegetable and animal food production and food consumption was compared with the baseline data. There was evidence of higher production and consumption of nutrient rich foods, improved household dietary diversity; and understanding and acceptance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The number of items consumed under each food group, frequency of consumption of food and average per capita intake of nutrient-rich foods were found to have improved. The results provide evidence regarding feasibility of location-specific FSN models to promote sustainable and healthy diets, using locally available plant and animal food resources, to address nutrition deficiencies in farm families.","Pradhan, Aliza; S., Raju; D.

METHODS: Patients had previously completed the 12-week phase 2b (RAJ1), or 52-week phase 3 (RAJ3 and RAJ4) peficitinib studies in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and received oral peficitinib 50 or 100 mg/day. Dose increase to 150 mg/day or reduction to 50 mg/day was permitted. Efficacy endpoints included American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20/50/70 response rates, 28-joint Disease Activity Score with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), and ACR components. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and incidence rates (IRs) of adverse events of special interest per 100 patient-years (PY). RESULTS: Overall, 843 patients received peficitinib for a mean 32.0 months (maximum 85.2 months), and most (64.4%) received peficitinib 100 mg/day as a maximum dose. Respective ACR20/50/70 response rates were maintained from baseline (week 0 of LTE; 71.6, 52.1, and 34.7%) to end of treatment (78.7, 63.3, and 44.1%); continuous improvements in ACR components and DAS28-CRP were observed from the baselines of preceding studies and throughout the LTE. Overall, 796/843 (94.4%) patients experienced TEAEs; most were severity grade 1/2. Most common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (47.0%) and herpes zoster (17.3%). Drug-related TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 140 (16.6%) patients, and IRs (95% confidence interval) per 100 PY of serious infections, herpes zoster-related disease, and malignancies were 2.7 (2.1, 3.4), 7.3 (6.2, 8.6), and 1.2 (0.9, 1.8), respectively. Two deaths occurred during the study; one each from diffuse large B cell lymphoma and pneumonia, which were, respectively considered probably and possibly related to study drug.

16589,Design and synthesis of small molecular 2-aminobenzoxazoles as potential antifungal agents against phytopathogenic fungi,2021-04-03,"We utilized the multicenter Pediatric Acute Care Cardiology Collaborative (PAC(3)) 2017 and 2019 surveys to describe practice variation in therapy availability and changes over a 2-year period. A high acuity therapies (ATs) score was derived (1 point per positive response) from 44 survey questions and scores were compared to center surgical volume. Of 31 centers that completed the 2017 survey, 26 also completed the 2019 survey. Scores ranged from 11 to 34 in 2017 and 11 to 35 in 2019. AT scores in 2019 were not statistically different from 2017 scores (29/44, IQR 27–32.5 vs. 29.5/44, IQR 27–31, p = 0.9). In 2019, more centers reported initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in Acute Care Cardiology Unit (ACCU) (19/26 vs. 4/26, p < 0.001) and permitting continuous CPAP/BiPAP (22/26 vs. 14/26, p = 0.034) compared to 2017. Scores in both survey years were significantly higher in the highest surgical volume group compared to the lowest, 33 ± 1.5 versus 25 ± 8.5, p = 0.046 and 32 ± 1.7 versus 23 ± 5.5, p = 0.009, respectively. Variation in therapy within the ACCUs participating in PAC(3) presents an opportunity for shared learning across the collaborative. Experience with PAC(3) was associated with increasing available respiratory therapies from 2017 to 2019. Whether AT scores impact the quality and outcomes of pediatric acute cardiac care will be the subject of further investigation using a comprehensive registry launched in early 2019.","Harahsheh, Ashraf S.; Kipps, Alaina K.; Hart, Stephen A.; Cassidy, Steven C.; Clabby, Martha L.; Hlavacek, Anthony M.; Hoerst, Amanda K.; Graupe, Margaret A.; Madsen, Nicolas L.; Bakar, Adnan M.; Del Grippo, Erica L.; Patel, Sonali S.; Bost, James E.; Tanel, Ronn E.",Pediatr Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8019478/,57
16834,Cryo-EM structure of the yeast TREX complex and coordination with the SR-like protein Gbp2,2021-03-31,"Microbial and plant cell walls have been selected by the plant immune system as a source of microbe‐ and plant damage‐associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/DAMPs) that are perceived by extracellular ectodomains (ECDs) of plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) triggering immune responses. From the vast number of ligands that PRRs can bind, those composed of carbohydrate moieties are poorly studied, and only a handful of PRR/glycan pairs have been determined. Here we present a computational screening method, based on the first step of molecular dynamics simulation, that is able to predict putative ECD‐PRR/glycan interactions. This method has been developed and optimized with Arabidopsis LysM‐PRR members CERK1 and LYK4, which are involved in the perception of fungal MAMPs, chitohexaose (1,4‐β‐d‐(GlcNAc)(6)) and laminarihexaose (1,3‐β‐d‐(Glc)(6)). Our in silico results predicted CERK1 interactions with 1,4‐β‐d‐(GlcNAc)(6) whilst discarding its direct binding by LYK4. In contrast, no direct interaction between CERK1/laminarihexaose was predicted by the model despite CERK1 being required for laminarihexaose immune activation, suggesting that CERK1 may act as a co‐receptor for its recognition. These in silico results were validated by isothermal titration calorimetry binding assays between these MAMPs and recombinant ECDs‐LysM‐PRRs. The robustness of the developed computational screening method was further validated by predicting that CERK1 does not bind the DAMP 1,4‐β‐d‐(Glc)(6) (cellohexaose), and then probing that immune responses triggered by this DAMP were not impaired in the Arabidopsis cerk1 mutant. The computational predictive glycan/PRR binding method developed here might accelerate the discovery of protein–glycan interactions and provide information on immune responses activated by glycoligands.","del Hierro, Irene; Mélida, Hugo; Broyart, Caroline; Santiago, Julia; Molina, Antonio",Plant J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8048873/,57
16952,Acetylation-mediated remodeling of the nucleolus regulates cellular acetyl-CoA responses,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of accurate information on the prevalence and causes of musculoskeletal impairment (MSI) in low income countries. The WHO prevalence estimate does not help plan services for specific national income levels or countries. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence, impact, causes and factors associated with musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi. We wished to undertake a national cluster randomized survey of musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi, one of the UN Least Developed Countries (LDC), that involved a reliable sampling methodology with a case definition and diagnostic criteria that could clearly be related to the classification system used in the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) METHODS: A sample size of 1,481 households was calculated using data from the latest national census and an expected prevalence based on similar surveys conducted in Rwanda and Cameroon. We randomly selected clusters across the whole country through probability proportional to size sampling with an urban/rural and demographic split that matched the distribution of the population. In the field, randomization of households in a cluster was based on a ground bottle spin. All household members present were screened, and all MSI cases identified were examined in more detail by medical students under supervision, using a standardized interview and examination protocol. Data collection was carried out from 1st July to 30th August 2016. Extrapolation was done based on study size compared to the population of Malawi. MSI severity was classified using the parameters for the percentage of function outlined in the WHO International Classification of Functioning (ICF). A loss of function of 5–24% was mild, 25–49% was moderate and 50–90% was severe. The Malawian version of the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire was used, and EQ-5D index scores were calculated using population values from Zimbabwe, as a population value set for Malawi is not currently available. Chi-square test was used to test categorical variables. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated with a linear regression model adjusted for age, gender, location and education. RESULTS: A total of 8,801 individuals were enumerated in 1,481 households. Of the 8,548 participants that were screened and examined (response rate of 97.1%), 810 cases of MSI were diagnosed of which 18% (108) had mild, 54% (329) had moderate and 28% (167) had severe MSI as classified by ICF. There was an overall prevalence of MSI of 9.5% (CI 8.9–10.1). The prevalence of MSI increased with age, and was similar in men (9.3%) and women (9.6%). People without formal education were more likely to have MSI [13.3% (CI 11.8–14.8)] compared to those with formal education levels [8.9% (CI 8.1–9.7), p<0.001] for primary school and [5.9% (4.6–7.2), p<0.001] for secondary school. Overall, 33.2% of MSIs were due to congenital causes, 25.6% were neurological in origin, 19.2% due to acquired non-traumatic non-infective causes, 16.8% due to trauma and 5.2% due to infection. Extrapolation of these findings indicated that there are approximately one million cases of MSI in Malawi that need further treatment. MSI had a profound impact on quality of life. Analysis of disaggregated quality of life measures using EQ-5D showed clear correlation with the ICF class. A large proportion of patients with moderate and severe MSI were confined to bed, unable to wash or undress or unable to perform usual daily activities. CONCLUSION: This study has uncovered a high prevalence of MSI in Malawi and its profound impact on a large proportion of the population. These findings suggest that MSI places a considerable strain on social and financial structures in this low-income country. The Quality of Life of those with severe MSI is considerably affected. The huge burden of musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi is mostly unattended, revealing an urgent need to scale up surgical and rehabilitation services in the country.","Ngoie, Leonard Banza; Dybvik, Eva; Hallan, Geir; Gjertsen, Jan-Erik; Mkandawire, Nyengo; Varela, Carlos; Young, Sven",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787380/,57

Limited attention has been paid to the vulnerabilities of nursing students to ProQOL and the associated mechanisms. PURPOSE: Determine what factors are predictive of ProQOL in a population of undergraduate nursing and psychiatric nursing students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted comprised demographic questions and four validated measures: the Professional Quality of Life Scale (version 5), Core Self-Evaluations Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Life Events Checklist (version 5). RESULTS: Students in long-term care-palliative care rotations reported significantly higher levels of BO in comparison to other care areas. Regression analysis revealed students with low self-efficacy and high perceived stress were predictive of BO. Students with increased exposures to prior traumatizing life events were predictive of STS. Students with high levels of self-efficacy and less intent-to-leave were predictive of having CS. CONCLUSION: Findings assist educators, clinicians, and policy makers in understanding at-risk clinical settings and predictors of ProQOL in pre-licensure students. Curricular recommendations that include mindfulness, coping and crisis peer-debriefing, and emotional intelligence are discussed.","Chachula, Kathryn M.",SAGE Open Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047937/,57

Stroke cases involve hemiplegia, which causes difficulties in performing activities of daily living. Existing rehabilitation treatments are based on the subjective evaluation of the therapist as the need for non-contact care arises; it is necessary to develop a system that can self-rehabilitate and offer objective analysis. Therefore, we developed rehabilitation tools that enable self-rehabilitation exercises in a virtual space based on haptics. Thirty adults without neurological damage were trained five times in a virtual environment, and the time, number of collisions, and coordinates were digitized and stored in real time. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the time and distance similarity changes revealed that as the number of rounds increased, no changes or increases occurred (p ≥ 0.05), and the collisions and paths were stable as the training progressed (p < 0.05). ANOVA showed a high correlation (0.90) with a decrease in the number of crashes and time required. It was meaningful to users when performing rehabilitation training more than four times and significantly impacted the analysis. This study analyzed the upper limb and cognitive rehabilitation of able-boded people in three-dimensional space in a virtual environment; the performance difficulty could be controlled through variations in rehabilitation models.","Kim, Eun Bin; Kim, Songee; Lee, Onseok",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8071461/,57

However, few studies have explored their underlying mechanisms, especially among the elderly population in East Asia, where people have food culture and lifestyles distinct from those living in Western countries. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the relationships among sleep quality, diet quality, physical activity, and physical and mental health in a Chinese elderly sample. Sleep quality, diet quality, physical activity, physical health, and mental health were investigated among 313 Chinese elderly (aged 51–92 years, M = 67.90, SD = 7.94). Mediation analysis was used to examine the empirical model based on previous theories and literature. Close positive relationships were observed between all factors investigated (r = 0.22~0.73, p < 0.001). The relationships between sleep quality and physical and mental health were partially mediated by diet quality and physical activity. In clinical interventions, sleep quality, diet quality, and physical activity can be targeted to improve physical and mental health among the older adult populations.","Zhao, Yiqing; Song, Jianwen; Brytek-Matera, Anna; Zhang, Hengyue; He, Jinbo",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073680/,57

17163,The effect of cell isolation methods on the human transcriptome profiling and microbial transcripts of peripheral blood,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: In urban environments, environmental air pollution poses significant risks to respiratory health. Moreover, the seasonal spatial variability of the air pollutant ozone, and respiratory illness within Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) is not well understood. We examine the relationships between spatial patterns of long-term ozone exposure and respiratory illness to better understand impacts on health outcomes. We propose that this study will establish an enhanced understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of ozone concentrations and respiratory emergency room visits (ERV) incidence. METHODS: Air pollution data (ozone) and ERV incidence data from DFW was used to evaluate the relationships between exposures and outcomes using three steps: (1) develop a geostatistical model to produce quarterly maps of ozone exposure for the DFW area; (2) use spatial analysis techniques to identify clusters of zip codes with high or low values of ozone exposure and respiratory ERV incidence; and (3) use concentration-response curves to evaluate the relationships between respiratory ERV incidence and ozone exposure. RESULTS: Respiratory ERV incidence was highest in quarters 1 and 4, while ozone exposure was highest in quarters 2 and 3. Extensive statistically significant spatial clusters of ozone regions were identified. Although the maps revealed that there was no regional association between the spatial patterns of high respiratory ERV incidence and ozone exposure, the concentration-response analysis suggests that lower levels of ozone exposure may still contribute to adverse respiratory outcomes.","Northeim, Kari; Marks, Constant; Tiwari, Chetan",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8051349/,57

Fibroblasts and their matrix contribute to cancer, so we studied how UVR modifies dermal fibroblast function, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and melanoma invasion. We confirmed UVR-damaged fibroblasts persistently upregulate collagen-cleaving matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP1) expression, reducing local collagen (COL1A1), and COL1A1 degradation by MMP1 decreased melanoma invasion. Conversely, inhibiting ECM degradation and MMP1 expression restored melanoma invasion. Primary cutaneous melanomas of aged humans show more cancer cells invade as single cells at the invasive front of melanomas expressing and depositing more collagen, and collagen and single melanoma cell invasion are robust predictors of poor melanoma-specific survival. Thus, primary melanomas arising over collagen-degraded skin are less invasive, and reduced invasion improves survival. However, melanoma-associated fibroblasts can restore invasion by increasing collagen synthesis. Finally, high COL1A1 gene expression is a biomarker of poor outcome across a range of primary cancers.","Budden, Timothy; Gaudy-Marqueste, Caroline; Porter, Andrew; Kay, Emily; Gurung, Shilpa; Earnshaw, Charles H.; Roeck, Katharina; Craig, Sarah; Traves, Víctor; Krutmann, Jean; Muller, Patricia; Motta, Luisa; Zanivan, Sara; Malliri, Angeliki; Furney, Simon J.; Nagore, Eduardo; Virós, Amaya",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115293/,57

Identifying and prioritizing high-risk subgroups of PLWD and tuberculosis for tuberculosis programs to target has been rarely performed. We investigated risk factors for poor tuberculosis treatment outcomes among PLWD and developed a predictive risk score for tuberculosis control prioritization. Among PLWD diagnosed with tuberculosis, demographic, clinical, and tuberculosis treatment outcome data were collected. Poor treatment outcomes included treatment failure, death, default, and transfer. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to analyze risk factors of poor treatment outcomes. Risk scores were derived based on regression coefficients to classify participants at low-, intermediate-, and high-risk of poor treatment outcomes. Among 335 PLWD newly diagnosed with tuberculosis, 109 were cured and 172 completed treatment. Multivariable logistic regression found that risk factors of poor treatment outcomes included bacteriologically-positivity, low body mass index, no physical activity, and pulmonary cavitation. Rates of poor treatment outcomes in low- (0–2), intermediate- (3–4), and high-risk (5–8) groups were 4.2%, 10.5%, and 55.4% (P(trend) < 0.0001), respectively. The risk score accurately discriminated poor and successful treatment outcomes (C-statistic, 0.85, 95% CI 0.78–0.91). We derived a simple predictive risk score that accurately distinguished those at high- and low-risk of treatment failure. This score provides a potentially useful tool for tuberculosis control programs in settings with a double burden of both tuberculosis and diabetes.","You, Nannan; Pan, Hongqiu; Zeng, Yi; Lu, Peng; Zhu, Limei; Lu, Wei; Liu, Qiao; Martinez, Leonardo",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8160203/,57

18140,Architecture of the Sema3A/PlexinA4/Neuropilin tripartite complex,2021-05-26,"OBJECTIVES: Chronic pain affects 50 million Americans and is often treated with non-pharmacologic approaches like physical therapy. Developing a no-show prediction model for individuals seeking physical therapy care for musculoskeletal conditions has several benefits including enhancement of workforce efficiency without growing the existing provider pool, delivering guideline adherent care, and identifying those that may benefit from telehealth. The objective of this paper was to quantify the national prevalence of no-shows for patients seeking physical therapy care and to identify individual and organizational factors predicting whether a patient will be a no-show when seeking physical therapy care. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Commercial provider of physical therapy within the United States with 828 clinics across 26 states. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent and adult patients (age cutoffs: 14–117 years) seeking non-pharmacological treatment for musculoskeletal conditions from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017 (n = 542,685). Exclusion criteria were a primary complaint not considered an MSK condition or improbable values for height, weight, or body mass index values. The study included 444,995 individuals. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of no-shows for musculoskeletal conditions and predictors of patient no-show. RESULTS: In our population, 73% missed at least 1 appointment for a given physical therapy care episode. Our model had moderate discrimination for no-shows (c-statistic:0.72, all appointments; 0.73, first 7 appointments) and was well calibrated, with predicted and observed no-shows in good agreement. Variables predicting higher no-show rates included insurance type; smoking-status; higher BMI; and more prior cancellations, time between visit and scheduling date, and between current and previous visit. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of no-shows when seeking care for musculoskeletal conditions from physical therapists highlights an inefficiency that, unaddressed, could limit delivery of guideline-adherent care that advocates for earlier use of non-pharmacological treatments for musculoskeletal conditions and result in missed opportunities for using telehealth to deliver physical therapy.","Bhavsar, Nrupen A.; Doerfler, Shannon M.; Giczewska, Anna; Alhanti, Brooke; Lutz, Adam; Thigpen, Charles A.; George, Steven Z.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8162651/,57

To overcome these challenges, operational and outcome-oriented tools that enable animal health and human health services to work specifically on their collaboration are required. While international capacity and assessment frameworks such as the IHR-MEF (International Health Regulations—Monitoring and Evaluation Framework) and the OIE PVS (Performance of Veterinary Services) Pathway exist, a tool and process that could assess and strengthen the interactions between human and animal health sectors was needed. Through a series of six phased pilots, the IHR-PVS National Bridging Workshop (NBW) method was developed and refined. The NBW process gathers human and animal health stakeholders and follows seven sessions, scheduled across three days. The outputs from each session build towards the next one, following a structured process that goes from gap identification to joint planning of corrective measures. The NBW process allows human and animal health sector representatives to jointly identify actions that support collaboration while advancing evaluation goals identified through the IHR-MEF and the OIE PVS Pathway. By integrating sector-specific and collaborative goals, the NBWs help countries in creating a realistic, concrete and practical joint road map for enhanced compliance to international standards as well as strengthened preparedness and response for health security at the human-animal interface.","Belot, Guillaume; Caya, François; Errecaborde, Kaylee Myhre; Traore, Tieble; Lafia, Brice; Skrypnyk, Artem; Montabord, Djhane; Carron, Maud; Corning, Susan; Sreedharan, Rajesh; Isla, Nicolas; Schmidt, Tanja; Gongal, Gyanendra; Samhouri, Dalia; Perez-Gutierrez, Enrique; Riviere-Cinnamond, Ana; Xing, Jun; Chungong, Stella; de la Rocque, Stephane",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8168895/,57

RESULTS: Among 467 infants admitted, 62% received intensive medical treatment; 27% received surgical treatment. The most common surgery was a gastrostomy tube. Survival in infants who received surgeries was 51%; intensive medical treatment was 30%, and non-intensive treatment was 72%. Infants receiving surgeries spent more time in the NICU and were more likely to receive oxygen and feeding support at discharge.

Although antibodies have been more widely used as targeting molecules, aptamer have unique advantages for CD123 targeting therapy. In this study, we constructed an aptamer hydrogel termed as SSFH which could be precisely cut by Cas9/sgRNA for programmed SS30 release. To construct hydrogel, rolling-circle amplification (RCA) was used to generate hydrogel containing CD123 aptamer SS30 and sgRNA-targeting sequence. After incubation with Cas9/sgRNA, SSFH could lose its gel property and liberated the SS30 aptamer sequence, and released SS30 has been confirmed by gel electrophoresis. In addition, SS30 released from SSFH could inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, SSFH could prolong survival rate and inhibit tumor growth via JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway in vivo. Additionally, molecular imaging revealed SSFH co-injected with Cas9/sgRNA remained at the injection site longer than free aptamer. Furthermore, once the levels of cytokines were increasing, the complementary sequences of aptamers injection could neutralize SS30 and relieve side effect immediately. This study suggested that CD123 aptamer hydrogel SSFH and Cas9/sgRNA system has strong potential for CD123-positive AML anticancer therapy.","Wu, Haibin; Zhang, Liyu; Zhu, Zeen; Ding, Chenxi; Chen, Shengquan; Liu, Ruiping; Fan, Huafeng; Chen, Yang; Li, Hui",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205012/,57

Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and stimulated with high glucose to verify the role of OSTN in vitro. OSTN expression was reduced by protein kinase B/forkhead box O1 dephosphorylation in diabetic hearts, while its overexpression significantly attenuated cardiac injury and dysfunction in mice with STZ treatment. Besides, OSTN incubation prevented, whereas OSTN silence aggravated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and injury upon hyperglycemic stimulation in vitro. Mechanistically, OSTN treatment restored protein kinase G (PKG)-dependent proteasomal function, and PKG or proteasome inhibition abrogated the protective effects of OSTN in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, OSTN replenishment was sufficient to prevent the progression of pre-established DCM and had synergistic cardioprotection with sildenafil. OSTN protects against DCM via restoring PKG-dependent proteasomal activity and it is a promising therapeutic target to treat DCM.","Zhang, Xin; Hu, Can; Yuan, Xiao-Pin; Yuan, Yu-Pei; Song, Peng; Kong, Chun-Yan; Teng, Teng; Hu, Min; Xu, Si-Chi; Ma, Zhen-Guo; Tang, Qi-Zhu",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209005/,57

OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to: i) evaluate whether a diet that meets a carbohydrate ratio (simple, modified or dual ratio) is associated with higher nutrient intakes and diet quality, and ii) model the impact of substituting carbohydrate foods that meet the proposed ratios in place of foods that do not, on nutrient intakes. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the 2011–12 Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: National data from participants aged 2 years and older (n = 12,153). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ratios were defined as (i) simple ratio, 10:1 (10g carbohydrate:≥1g dietary fiber); (ii) modified ratio, 10:1:2 (10g carbohydrate:≥1g dietary fiber:≤2g free sugars); and (iii) dual ratio, 10:1 & 1:2 (10g carbohydrate:≥1g dietary fiber & ≤2g free sugars per 1g dietary fiber). Ratios were compared to nutrient intakes obtained via automated multiple-pass 24-hour dietary recall and diet quality calculated using the Australian Healthy Eating Index. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Substitution dietary modelling was performed. Data were analyzed using paired and independent sample t-tests. RESULTS: Ratio adherence was highest for simple (50.2% adults; 28.6% children), followed by dual (40.6% adults; 21.7% children), then modified (32.7% adults; 18.6% children) ratios. Participants who met any ratio reported higher nutrient intake and diet quality compared to those who failed to meet the respective ratio (P < .001 for all), with the greatest nutrient intakes found for those who met modified or dual ratios. Dietary modelling improved nutrient intakes for all ratios, with the greatest improvement found for the dual ratio. CONCLUSIONS: All carbohydrate ratios were associated with higher diet quality, with a free sugars constraint in the dual ratio providing the greatest improvements.","Blumfield, Michelle; McConnell, Andrew; Cassettari, Tim; Petocz, Peter; Warner, Molly; Campos, Vanessa; Lê, Kim-Anne; Minehira, Kaori; Marshall, Skye; Fayet-Moore, Flavia",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8270120/,57

A predictive model of QoL after adjuvant chemotherapy can support decision making or the communication of information about the range of treatment options available. Patients with localized breast cancer (n = 219) were prospectively recruited at 17 centers. Participants completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The primary aim was to predict health status upon completion of adjuvant chemotherapy adjusted for multiple covariates. We developed a Bayesian model with six covariates (chemotherapy regimen, TNM stage, axillary lymph node dissection, perceived risk of recurrence, age, type of surgery, and baseline EORTC scores). This model allows both prediction and causal inference. The patients with mastectomy reported a discrete decline on all QoL scores. The effect of surgery depended on the interaction with age. Women with ages on either end of the range displayed worse scores, especially with mastectomy. The perceived risk of recurrence had a striking effect on health status. In conclusion, we have developed a predictive model of health status in patients with early breast cancer based on the individual’s profile.","Carmona-Bayonas, Alberto; Calderón, Caterina; Hernández, Raquel; Fernández Montes, Ana; Castelo, Beatriz; Ciria-Suarez, Laura; Antoñanzas, Mónica; Rogado, Jacobo; Pacheco-Barcia, Vilma; Asensio Martínez, Elena; Ivars, Alejandra; Ayala de la Peña, Francisco; Jimenez-Fonseca, Paula",NPJ Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277774/,57
19316,V-pipe: a computational pipeline for assessing viral genetic diversity from high-throughput data,2021-01-20,"Sepsis is one of the most common comorbidities observed in diabetic patients, associated with a deficient innate immune response. Recently, we have shown that glucagon possesses anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated if hyperglucagonemia triggered by diabetes might reduce the migration of neutrophils, increasing sepsis susceptibility. 21 days after diabetes induction by intravenous injection of alloxan, we induced moderate sepsis in Swiss-Webster mice through cecum ligation and puncture (CLP). The glucagon receptor (GcgR) antagonist des-his1-[Glu9]-glucagon amide was injected intraperitoneally 24h and 1h before CLP. We also tested the effect of glucagon on CXCL1/KC-induced neutrophil migration to the peritoneal cavity in mice. Neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro was tested using transwell plates, and the expression of total PKA and phospho-PKA was evaluated by western blot. GcgR antagonist restored neutrophil migration, reduced CFU numbers in the peritoneal cavity and improved survival rate of diabetic mice after CLP procedure, however, the treatment did no alter hyperglycemia, CXCL1/KC plasma levels and blood neutrophilia. In addition, glucagon inhibited CXCL1/KC-induced neutrophil migration to the peritoneal cavity of non-diabetic mice. Glucagon also decreased the chemotaxis of neutrophils triggered by CXCL1/KC, PAF, or fMLP in vitro. The inhibitory action of glucagon occurred in parallel with the reduction of CXCL1/KC-induced actin polymerization in neutrophils in vitro, but not CD11a and CD11b translocation to cell surface. The suppressor effect of glucagon on CXCL1/KC-induced neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro was reversed by pre-treatment with GcgR antagonist and adenylyl cyclase or PKA inhibitors. Glucagon also increased PKA phosphorylation directly in neutrophils in vitro. Furthermore, glucagon impaired zymosan-A-induced ROS production by neutrophils in vitro. Human neutrophil chemotaxis and adherence to endothelial cells in vitro were inhibited by glucagon treatment. According to our results, this inhibition was independent of CD11a and CD11b translocation to neutrophil surface or neutrophil release of CXCL8/IL-8. Altogether, our results suggest that glucagon may be involved in the reduction of neutrophil migration and increased susceptibility to sepsis in diabetic mice. This work collaborates with better understanding of the increased susceptibility and worsening of sepsis in diabetics, which can contribute to the development of new effective therapeutic strategies for diabetic septic patients.","Insuela, Daniella Bianchi Reis; Ferrero, Maximiliano Ruben; Gonçalves-de-Albuquerque, Cassiano Felippe; Chaves, Amanda da Silva; da Silva, Adriano Yagho Oliveira; Castro-Faria-Neto, Hugo Caire; Simões, Rafael Loureiro; Barja-Fidalgo, Thereza Christina; Silva, Patricia Machado Rodrigues e; Martins, Marco Aurélio; Silva, Adriana Ribeiro; Carvalho, Vinicius Frias",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8290340/,57
19508,Molecular fossils illuminate the evolution of retroviruses following a macroevolutionary transition from land to water,2021-07-12,"Dermatological problems are the most widely spread skin diseases amongst human beings. They can be infectious, chronic, and sometimes may also lead to serious health problems such as skin cancer. Generally, rural area clinics lack trained dermatologists and mostly rely on the analysis of remotely accessible experts through mobile-based networks for sharing the images and other related information. Under such circumstances, poor image quality introduced due to the capturing device results in misleading diagnosis. Here, a genetic-algorithm- (GA-) based approach used as an image enhancement technique has been explored to improve the low quality of the dermatological images received from the rural clinic. The diagnosis is performed on the enhanced images using convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for the identification of the diseases. The scope of this paper is limited to only motion blurred images, which is the most prevalent problem in capturing of the images, specifically when any of the two (device or the object) may move unpredictably. Seven types of skin diseases, namely, melanoma, melanocytic nevus, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, benign keratosis, vascular lesion, and squamous cell carcinoma, have been investigated using ResNet-152 giving an overall accuracy of 87.40% for the blurred images. Use of GA-enhanced images increased the accuracy to 95.85%. The results were further analyzed using a confusion matrix and t-test-based statistical investigations. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it reduces the analysis time and errors due to manual diagnosis. Furthermore, speedy and reliable diagnosis at the earliest stage reduces the risk of developing more severe skin problems.","Chaahat,; Kumar Gondhi, Naveen; Kumar Lehana, Parveen",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8302402/,57
19869,National parochialism is ubiquitous across 42 nations around the world,2021-07-22,"BACKGROUND: Internet support groups enable users to provide peer support by exchanging knowledge about and experiences in coping with their illness. Several studies exploring the benefits of internet support groups for depression have found positive effects on recovery-oriented values, including empowerment. However, to date, little attention has been paid to user narratives. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to capture the user perspective on an online peer support community for depression with a focus on the modes of user engagement and the benefits users derive from participation in the forum. METHODS: In this qualitative study, we conducted 15 semistructured interviews with users of Depression Connect, a newly developed online peer support community for individuals with depression. Combining a concept-driven and a data-driven approach, we aimed to gain insight into what users value in our Depression Connect platform and whether and how the platform promotes empowerment. We performed a thematic analysis to explore the merits and demerits reported by users by using theoretical concepts widely used in internet support group research. In the subsequent data-driven analysis, we sought to understand the relationship between different styles of user engagement and the participants’ experiences with the use of Depression Connect. Data analysis consisted of open, axial, and selective coding. To include as diverse perspectives as possible, we opted for purposive sampling. To verify and validate the (interim) results, we included negative cases and performed member checks. RESULTS: We found participation in Depression Connect contributes to a sense of belonging, emotional growth, self-efficacy, and empowerment. “Getting too caught up” was the most frequently reported negative aspect of using Depression Connect. The deployment and development of three participation styles (ie, reading, posting, and responding) affected the perceived benefits of Depression Connect use differentially, where the latter style was central to enhancing empowerment. “Being of value to others” boosted the users’ belief in their personal strength. Finally, Depression Connect was predominantly used to supplement offline support and care for depression, and it mainly served as a safe environment where members could freely reflect on their coping mechanisms for depression and exchange and practice coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed new light on user engagement processes on which internet support groups rely. The online community primarily served as a virtual meeting place to practice (social) skills for deployment in the offline world. It also allowed the members to learn from each other’s knowledge and experiences and explore newly gained insights and coping skills.","Smit, Dorien; Vrijsen, Janna N; Groeneweg, Bart; Vellinga-Dings, Amber; Peelen, Janneke; Spijker, Jan",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314160/,57

In the current study, we examined to what extent physical activity contributes to the decline in mitochondrial function and muscle health during aging and compared mitochondrial function in young and older adults, with similar habitual physical activity levels. We also studied exercise-trained older adults and physically impaired older adults. Aging was associated with a decline in mitochondrial capacity, exercise capacity and efficiency, gait stability, muscle function, and insulin sensitivity, even when maintaining an adequate daily physical activity level. Our data also suggest that a further increase in physical activity level, achieved through regular exercise training, can largely negate the effects of aging. Finally, mitochondrial capacity correlated with exercise efficiency and insulin sensitivity. Together, our data support a link between mitochondrial function and age-associated deterioration of skeletal muscle.","Grevendonk, L.; Connell, N. J.; McCrum, C.; Fealy, C. E.; Bilet, L.; Bruls, Y.

The cost effectiveness of incorporating this simplified approach into HCV screening in Iraq remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the cost effectiveness of different HCV testing and diagnostic approaches, and screening strategies in Iraq from a health service perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using a hybrid model comprising a screening decision tree linked to a lifetime Markov model to estimate outcomes in HCV-infected people. Cost and utility estimates were sourced from the published literature and expert guidance provided by clinicians and policy makers in Iraq. Cost estimates were reported in 2019 USD or 2019 Iraqi Dinar and both costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: Strategies using a simplified approach were found to be cost saving in addition to improving patient outcomes when compared with a standard testing and diagnostic approach. When considering risk-based screening, a simplified approach was associated with a total cost saving of Iraqi Dinar 4375 billion (USD 3.7 billion) and per patient life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gains of 0.30 and 0.55, compared with a standard approach. Benefits and cost savings were driven by a 32.2% and 23.6% reduction in the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Estimated benefits and cost savings increased under total population screening. All screening and testing and diagnostic approaches were cost effective compared with a no screening scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the detection of HCV combined with a simplified one-stop testing and diagnostic approach represents an opportunity to reduce the burden of HCV in Iraq and may play a significant role in meeting World Health Organisation HCV elimination targets.

Verifying the proteins that are targeted by compounds of natural herbs will be helpful to select natural herb-based drug candidates. Methods: Initially, data related to compounds, target proteins, and interactions between them were collected from open access databases. Compounds are represented by molecular fingerprints, whereas amino acid sequences are represented by numerical protein descriptors. Then, prediction models that predict the interactions between compounds and target proteins were constructed using support vector machine and random forest. Results: A random forest model constructed based on MACCS fingerprint and amino acid composition obtained the highest accuracy. We used the best model to predict target proteins for 94 important Jamu compounds and assessed the results by supporting evidence from published literature and other sources. There are 27 compounds that can be validated by professional doctors, and those compounds belong to seven efficacy groups. Conclusion: By comparing the efficacy of predicted compounds and the relations of the targeted proteins with diseases, we found that some compounds might be considered as drug candidates.","Wijaya, Sony Hartono; Afendi, Farit Mochamad; Batubara, Irmanida; Huang, Ming; Ono, Naoaki; Kanaya, Shigehiko; Altaf-Ul-Amin, Md.",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8398944/,57

20575,Listeria exploits IFITM3 to suppress antibacterial activity in phagocytes,2021-08-17,"Recent publications have argued that there are potentially serious consequences for researchers in recognising distinct genera in the terminal fusarioid clade of the family Nectriaceae. Thus, an alternate hypothesis, namely a very broad concept of the genus Fusarium was proposed. In doing so, however, a significant body of data that supports distinct genera in Nectriaceae based on morphology, biology, and phylogeny is disregarded. A DNA phylogeny based on 19 orthologous protein-coding genes was presented to support a very broad concept of Fusarium at the F1 node in Nectriaceae. Here, we demonstrate that re-analyses of this dataset show that all 19 genes support the F3 node that represents Fusarium sensu stricto as defined by F. sambucinum (sexual morph synonym Gibberella pulicaris). The backbone of the phylogeny is resolved by the concatenated alignment, but only six of the 19 genes fully support the F1 node, representing the broad circumscription of Fusarium. Furthermore, a re-analysis of the concatenated dataset revealed alternate topologies in different phylogenetic algorithms, highlighting the deep divergence and unresolved placement of various Nectriaceae lineages proposed as members of Fusarium. Species of Fusarium s. str. are characterised by Gibberella sexual morphs, asexual morphs with thin- or thick-walled macroconidia that have variously shaped apical and basal cells, and trichothecene mycotoxin production, which separates them from other fusarioid genera. Here we show that the Wollenweber concept of Fusarium presently accounts for 20 segregate genera with clear-cut synapomorphic traits, and that fusarioid macroconidia represent a character that has been gained or lost multiple times throughout Nectriaceae. Thus, the very broad circumscription of Fusarium is blurry and without apparent synapomorphies, and does not include all genera with fusarium-like macroconidia, which are spread throughout Nectriaceae (e.g., Cosmosporella, Macroconia, Microcera). In this study four new genera are introduced, along with 18 new species and 16 new combinations. These names convey information about relationships, morphology, and ecological preference that would otherwise be lost in a broader definition of Fusarium. To assist users to correctly identify fusarioid genera and species, we introduce a new online identification database, Fusarioid-ID, accessible at www.fusarium.org. The database comprises partial sequences from multiple genes commonly used to identify fusarioid taxa (act1, CaM, his3, rpb1, rpb2, tef1, tub2, ITS, and LSU). In this paper, we also present a nomenclator of names that have been introduced in Fusarium up to January 2021 as well as their current status, types, and diagnostic DNA barcode data. In this study, researchers from 46 countries, representing taxonomists, plant pathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory agencies, and students, strongly support the application and use of a more precisely delimited Fusarium (= Gibberella) concept to accommodate taxa from the robust monophyletic node F3 on the basis of a well-defined and unique combination of morphological and biochemical features. This F3 node includes, among others, species of the F. fujikuroi, F. incarnatum-equiseti, F. oxysporum, and F. sambucinum species complexes, but not species of Bisifusarium [F. dimerum species complex (SC)], Cyanonectria (F. buxicola SC), Geejayessia (F. staphyleae SC), Neocosmospora (F. solani SC) or Rectifusarium (F. ventricosum SC).

Team-based care improves SBP control but its effect on the consistency of SBP control over time is unknown. This post hoc analysis used data from a cluster-randomized trial of a physician/pharmacist collaborative model that randomized medical offices to either a 9- or 24-month pharmacist intervention or control group. TTR for SBP was calculated using linear interpolation and an SBP range of 110 to 130 mm Hg. TTR is reported as median values and group comparisons assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Of the 625 participants enrolled, 524 had 9-month and 366 had 24-month SBP data. Participants were a median 59 years old, 59% female, and 52% minority. After 24 months, the median TTR for SBP was 31.9% and 29.8% for the 9- and 24-month intervention groups, respectively, compared with 19% in the control group (P=0.0068). This observation persisted in the subgroup of participants with diabetes or chronic kidney disease and minorities. A longer TTR was not associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events. Time to first observed SBP in the target range was shorter in the intervention group compared with control (270 versus 365 days; P=0.0047).

However, as communication skills training (CST) programs are not seen as a priority to many clinical departments, there is a discernible absence of a standardised, recommended framework for these programs to be built upon. This systematic scoping review (SSR) aims to gather prevailing data on existing CSTs to identify key factors in teaching and assessing communication skills in the postgraduate medical setting. METHODS: Independent searches across seven bibliographic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, ERIC, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar) were carried out. Krishna’s Systematic Evidence-Based Approach (SEBA) was used to guide concurrent thematic and content analysis of the data. The themes and categories identified were compared and combined where possible in keeping with this approach and then compared with the tabulated summaries of the included articles. RESULTS: Twenty-five thousand eight hundred ninety-four abstracts were identified, and 151 articles were included and analysed. The Split Approach revealed similar categories and themes: curriculum design, teaching methods, curriculum content, assessment methods, integration into curriculum, and facilitators and barriers to CST. Amidst a wide variety of curricula designs, efforts to develop the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes set out by the ACGME current teaching and assessment methods in CST maybe categorised into didactic and interactive methods and assessed along Kirkpatrick’s Four Levels of Learning Evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: A major flaw in existing CSTs is a lack of curriculum structure, focus and standardisation. Based upon the findings and current design principles identified in this SSR in SEBA, we forward a stepwise approach to designing CST programs. These involve 1) defining goals and learning objectives, 2) identifying target population and ideal characteristics, 3) determining curriculum structure, 4) ensuring adequate resources and mitigating barriers, 5) determining curriculum content, and 6) assessing learners and adopting quality improvement processes.

21016,Insights into Conformational Dynamics and Allostery in DNMT1-H3Ub/USP7 Interactions,2021-08-25,"BACKGROUND: Poor treatment adherence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma is a global public health concern with severe consequences in terms of patient health and societal costs. A potentially promising tool for addressing poor compliance is eHealth. OBJECTIVE: This review investigates the effects of eHealth interventions on medication adherence in patients with COPD or asthma. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases of Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase for studies with publication dates between January 1, 2000, and October 29, 2020. We selected randomized controlled trials targeting adult patients with COPD or asthma, which evaluated the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention on medication adherence. The risk of bias in the included studies was examined using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. The results were narratively reviewed. RESULTS: In total, six studies focusing on COPD and seven focusing on asthma were analyzed. Interventions were mostly internet-based or telephone-based, and could entail telemonitoring of symptoms and medication adherence, education, counseling, consultations, and self-support modules. Control groups mostly comprised usual care conditions, whereas a small number of studies used a face-to-face intervention or waiting list as the control condition. For COPD, the majority of eHealth interventions were investigated as an add-on to usual care (5/6 studies), whereas for asthma the majority of interventions were investigated as a standalone intervention (5/7 studies). Regarding eHealth interventions targeting medication adherence for COPD, two studies reported nonsignificant effects, one study found a significant effect in comparison to usual care, and three reported mixed results. Of the seven studies that investigated eHealth interventions targeting medication adherence in asthma, three studies found significant effects, two reported nonsignificant effects, and two reported mixed effects. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed results on the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in improving treatment adherence for asthma and COPD are presumably related to the type, context, and intensity of the interventions, as well as to differences in the operationalization and measurement of adherence outcomes. Much remains to be learned about the potential of eHealth to optimize treatment adherence in COPD and asthma.","Schulte, Mieke H J; Aardoom, Jiska J; Loheide-Niesmann, Lisa; Verstraete, Leonie L L; Ossebaard, Hans C; Riper, Heleen",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8403699/,57
21249,Moisture modulates soil reservoirs of active DNA and RNA viruses,2021-08-26,"BACKGROUND: Virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality make use of a variety of different software and hardware, but they share three main characteristics: immersion, presence, and interaction. The umbrella term for technologies with these characteristics is extended reality. The ability of extended reality to create environments that are otherwise impossible in the real world has practical implications in the medical discipline. In ophthalmology, virtual reality simulators have become increasingly popular as tools for surgical education. Recent developments have also explored diagnostic and therapeutic uses in ophthalmology. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify and investigate the utility of extended reality in ophthalmic education, diagnostics, and therapeutics. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. Publications from January 1, 1956 to April 15, 2020 were included. Inclusion criteria were studies evaluating the use of extended reality in ophthalmic education, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Eligible studies were evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. Relevant studies were also evaluated using a validity framework. Findings and relevant data from the studies were extracted, evaluated, and compared to determine the utility of extended reality in ophthalmology. RESULTS: We identified 12,490 unique records in our literature search; 87 met final eligibility criteria, comprising studies that evaluated the use of extended reality in education (n=54), diagnostics (n=5), and therapeutics (n=28). Of these, 79 studies (91%) achieved evidence levels in the range 2b to 4, indicating poor quality. Only 2 (9%) out of 22 relevant studies addressed all 5 sources of validity evidence. In education, we found that ophthalmic surgical simulators demonstrated efficacy and validity in improving surgical performance and reducing complication rates. Ophthalmoscopy simulators demonstrated efficacy and validity evidence in improving ophthalmoscopy skills in the clinical setting. In diagnostics, studies demonstrated proof-of-concept in presenting ocular imaging data on extended reality platforms and validity in assessing the function of patients with ophthalmic diseases. In therapeutics, heads-up surgical systems had similar complication rates, procedural success rates, and outcomes in comparison with conventional ophthalmic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Extended reality has promising areas of application in ophthalmology, but additional high-quality comparative studies are needed to assess their roles among incumbent methods of ophthalmic education, diagnostics, and therapeutics.","Ong, Chee Wui; Tan, Marcus Chun Jin; Lam, Michael; Koh, Victor Teck Chang",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8414293/,57
21431,Molecular characterization and immune protection of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene in Echinococcus granulosus,2021-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Balance and functional strength training can improve muscle strength and physical functioning outcomes and decrease the risk of falls in older adults. To maximize the benefits of strength training, adequate protein intake is also important. However, the number of older individuals that consume enough protein or routinely engage in strength training remains low at less than 5% and even lower for activities that challenge balance. Our primary aim was to assess the feasibility of implementing a model (MoveStrong) of service delivery to teach older adults about balance and functional strength training and methods to increase protein intake. METHODS: This study was a closed cohort stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. We recruited individuals ≥60 years considered pre-frail or frail with at least one chronic condition who were not currently engaging in regular strength training from Northern (rural) and Southern (urban) Ontario sites in Canada. The primary outcome was feasibility of implementation, defined by recruitment, retention, and adherence, and safety (defined by monitoring adverse events). We also reported participants’ and providers’ experience with MoveStrong, adaptations to the model based on participant’s and provider’s experience, and program fidelity. RESULTS: We recruited 44 participants to the study and the average adherence rate was 72% with a retention of 71%. The program had a high-fidelity score. One person experienced a fall-related injury during exercise, while two other participants reported pain during certain activities. Five individuals experienced injuries or health problems that were not related to the program. Suggestions for future trials include modifying some exercises, exploring volunteer assistance, increasing the diversity of participants enrolled, and considering a different study design. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot trial demonstrates the feasibility of recruitment and adherence for a larger multisite RCT of balance and functional strength training with attention to protein intake in pre-frail and frail older adults.","Rodrigues, Isabel B.; Wang, Ellen; Keller, Heather; Thabane, Lehana; Ashe, Maureen C.; Brien, Sheila; Cheung, Angela M.; Funnell, Larry; Jain, Ravi; Loong, Desmond; Isaranuwatchai, Wanrudee; Milligan, Jamie; Mourtzakis, Marina; Papaioannou, Alexandra; Straus, Sharon; Weston, Zachary J.; Giangregorio, Lora M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462677/,57

Since 1913, when its pathogenicity was first demonstrated, the number of infections caused by SM has increased. There is ample evidence that SM causes nosocomial infections in immunocompromised or critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs), but also in newborns admitted to neonatal ICUs (NICUs). In this study, we evaluated the possible genetic correlation by PFGE between clinical and environmental SM strains from NICU and ICU and compared the genetic profile of clinical strains with strains isolated from patients admitted to other wards of the same hospital. We found distinct clonally related groups of SM strains circulating among different wards of a large university hospital. In particular, the clonal relationship between clinical and environmental strains in NICU and ICU 1 was highlighted. The identification of clonal relationships between clinical and environmental strains in the wards allowed identification of the epidemic and rapid implementation of adequate measures to stop the spread of SM.","Caggiano, Giuseppina; Triggiano, Francesco; Diella, Giusy; Apollonio, Francesca; Lopuzzo, Marco; Mosca, Adriana; Stolfa, Stefania; Pazzani, Carlo; Oliva, Marta; Calia, Carla; Laforgia, Nicola; Dalfino, Lidia; Barbuti, Giovanna; Stefanizzi, Pasquale; Minicucci, Anna Maria; De Giglio, Osvalda; Montagna, Maria Teresa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472797/,57
21921,Identification of the factor XII contact activation site enables sensitive coagulation diagnostics,2021-09-22,"IMPORTANCE: Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are used as an alternative to nutritive sweeteners to quench desire for sweets while reducing caloric intake. However, studies have shown mixed results concerning the effects of NNSs on appetite, and the associations between sex and obesity with reward and appetitive responses to NNS compared with nutritive sugar are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine neural reactivity to different types of high-calorie food cues (ie, sweet and savory), metabolic responses, and eating behavior following consumption of sucralose (NNS) vs sucrose (nutritive sugar) among healthy young adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a randomized, within-participant, crossover trial including 3 separate visits, participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging task measuring blood oxygen level–dependent signal in response to visual cues. For each study visit, participants arrived at the Dornsife Cognitive Neuroimaging Center of University of Southern California at approximately 8:00 am after a 12-hour overnight fast. Blood was sampled at baseline and 10, 35, and 120 minutes after participants received a drink containing sucrose, sucralose, or water to measure plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide((7-36)), acyl-ghrelin, total peptide YY, and leptin. Participants were then presented with an ad libitum meal. Participants were right-handed, nonsmokers, weight-stable for at least 3 months before the study visits, nondieters, not taking medication, and with no history of eating disorders, illicit drug use, or medical diagnoses. Data analysis was performed from March 2020 to March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Participants ingested 300-mL drinks containing either sucrose (75 g), sucralose (individually sweetness matched), or water (as a control). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes of interest were the effects of body mass index (BMI) status and sex on blood oxygen level–dependent signal to high-calorie food cues, endocrine, and feeding responses following sucralose vs sucrose consumption. Secondary outcomes included neural, endocrine, and feeding responses following sucrose vs water and sucralose vs water (control) consumption, and cue-induced appetite ratings following sucralose vs sucrose (and vs water). RESULTS: A total of 76 participants were randomized, but 2 dropped out, leaving 74 adults (43 women [58%]; mean [SD] age, 23.40 [3.96] years; BMI range, 19.18-40.27) who completed the study. In this crossover design, 73 participants each received water (drink 1) and sucrose (drink 2), and 72 participants received water (drink 1), sucrose (drink 2), and sucralose (drink 3). Sucrose vs sucralose was associated with greater production of circulating glucose, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide–1 and suppression of acyl-ghrelin, but no differences were found for peptide YY or leptin. BMI status by drink interactions were observed in the medial frontal cortex (MFC; P for interaction < .001) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; P for interaction = .002). Individuals with obesity (MFC, β, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.83; P < .001; OFC, β, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.43; P = .002), but not those with overweight (MFC, β, 0.02; 95% CI, –0.19 to 0.23; P = .87; OFC, β, –0.06; 95% CI, –0.21 to 0.09; P = .41) or healthy weight (MFC, β, –0.13; 95% CI, –0.34 to 0.07; P = .21; OFC, β, –0.08; 95% CI, –0.23 to 0.06; P = .16), exhibited greater responsivity in the MFC and OFC to savory food cues after sucralose vs sucrose. Sex by drink interactions were observed in the MFC (P for interaction = .03) and OFC (P for interaction = .03) after consumption of sucralose vs sucrose. Female participants had greater MFC and OFC responses to food cues (MFC high-calorie vs low-calorie cues, β, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.37; P = .01; MFC sweet vs nonfood cues, β, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.42; P = .03; OFC food vs nonfood cues, β, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.22; P = .03; and OFC sweet vs nonfood cues, β, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.27; P = .01), but male participants’ responses did not differ (MFC high-calorie vs low-calorie cues, β, 0.01; 95% CI, –0.19 to 0.21; P = .90; MFC sweet vs nonfood cues, β, −0.04; 95% CI, –0.26 to 0.18; P = .69; OFC food vs nonfood cues, β, −0.08; 95% CI, –0.24 to 0.08; P = .32; OFC sweet vs nonfood cues, β, –0.11; 95% CI, –0.31 to 0.09; P = .31). A sex by drink interaction on total calories consumed during the buffet meal was observed (P for interaction = .03). Female participants consumed greater total calories (β, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.38 to 3.08; P = .01), whereas caloric intake did not differ in male participants (β, 0.68; 95% CI, –0.99 to 2.35; P = .42) after sucralose vs sucrose ingestion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that female individuals and those with obesity may be particularly sensitive to disparate neural responsivity elicited by sucralose compared with sucrose consumption.

22620,Contents to Volume 27(2005),2005,"A combination of high rates of mutation and replication, coupled with strong natural selection, ensures that RNA viruses experience rapid genotypic and phenotypic evolution. Such a ‘fast-forward’ evolution enables viruses to rapidly adapt to new host species, evade host immune responses, and to develop resistance to anti-viral drugs. Similarly, rapid evolution allows viruses to attain new levels of virulence, defined as the ability to cause severe disease in hosts. We hypothesize that distinct viral groups share genetic determinants that modulate virulence that have been acquired through convergent evolution. Thus, common patterns reflecting changing virulence-related specific viral groups could be detected. The main goals for this project are (1) to understand how genetic and phenotypic diversity can be generated among different viral groups by analyzing the variation patterns and determining the selective forces behind them (impact in viral fitness) and (2) to understand how fixed mutations can modulate virulence within different viral groups by performing comparison of strains with differing virulence within a longitudinal timescale. The subject of the study is key emerging and re-emerging virus families of medical importance. Such groups include: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses), Picornaviridae (Hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (Yellow fever, West Nile, Hepatitis C, Dengue, and Zika viruses), Togaviridae (Rubella and Chikungunya virus), Bornaviridae (Borna-disease virus), Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses), Paramyxoviridae (Measles, Nipah, and Hendra viruses), Rhabdoviridae (Lyssaviruses), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), Bunyaviridae (Hanta- and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses), and Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza A viruses). Viral genomes collected at different time points, different hosts (human and their most closely related animal reservoirs) and different locations will be compiled. Extensive molecular evolutionary analyses will be carried out to infer gene expansion/contraction within groups, rates of evolution, and changes in selection pressure, including the detection of positive selected genes and sites (adaptive evolution). Positively selected sites will be mapped onto the viral protein structures to reveal their impact on function, and hence the location of potential virulence determinants. Virulence changes among particular viral strains and types will be defined and measured according to definitions based on an increase in: (1) transmissibility, (2) host tropism, (3) immune evasion, (4) morbidity and mortality, (5) drug resistance, and by the incorporation of epidemiological data to determine whether high or low virulence strains within different hosts and localities are spreading most efficiently in nature.","Escalera-Zamudio, Marina; Gutiérrez, Bernardo; Thézé, Julien; Pybus, Oliver G",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735695/,57

Follow-up parent, physician, and bacteriologic evaluations were performed after 5 days of therapy without knowledge of active drug status. Groups were comparable for age, sex, race, number of patients withdrawn from study, days ill, fever >38.0 C, appearance of discharge, nasal crusting, and number of days until follow-up. 21% of patients grew H. influenzae type b and only 8% S. pyogenes on initial culture. Nasal crusting was significantly (p<0.01) associated with the growth of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae type b, suggesting a possible pathologic relationship. There were, however, no significant differences between active drug and placebo treatment groups for change in nasal discharge, complications, apparent drug benefit, or change in nasal flora with active antibiotic treatment. Significantly (p<0.05) more side effects were attributed to the D+ treatment groups. Routine culture and/or treatment of purulent nasopharyngitis cannot be recommended unless properly controlled studies demonstrate a significant drug benefit.","Todd, James; Todd, Nancy; Damato, James; Todd, Warren; Kempe, C Henry",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086600/,57

Pseudoknot is one type of RNA structures that cannot be modeled with Context Free Grammars (CFG) because it exhibits crossing dependencies. Pseudoknot structures have functional importance since they appear, for example, in viral genome RNAs and ribozyme active sites. Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) is one example of a grammatical model that is more expressive than CFG and has the capability of dealing with crossing dependencies. In this paper, we describe a new inference algorithm for TAG(RNA,) a sub-model of TAG. We also introduce an RNA structure identification framework, TAG(RNA)Inf, within which the TAG(RNA) inference algorithm constitutes the core of the training phase. We present the results of using the proposed framework for identifying RNA sequences with pseudoknot structures.

It is a tropical and subtropical fruit tree which is native to Fujian and Guangdong regions of China and is cultivated as an important commercial fruit crop in many parts of the world. It is famous for its fragrant and sugary flavour. After China, India is at the second position in the production of lychee in the world. The varieties with large pulp, small seeds and noteworthy flavour are of great interest among the consumers and farmers. Lychee fruit took tremendous attention of scientists as it contains ample amounts of anti-oxidants, vitamins and fibre. Moreover, the plant parts possess considerable anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-tumour and anti-oxidant properties. Propagation of lychee from seeds is difficult and not practicable because of longer juvenile period and non-viable, abortive and genetically diverse nature of the seedlings. However, the techniques such as cell, tissue and organ culture (micropropagation) can overcome the difficulties of lychee propagation. Very limited efforts have been made in its varietal improvement through hybridization and modern breeding techniques. In a nutshell, lychee is an important commercial fruit crop, and there is a need to develop technical research so as to sustain and enhance its yield, postharvest management, medicinal value and marketing. This chapter comprises of botanical description, cultivation, medicinal uses, micropropagation and trading of Litchi chinensis.","Koul, Bhupendra; Singh, Joginder",The Lychee Biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121025/,57

25358,"Shellfish-Associated Enteric Virus Illness: Virus Localization, Disease Outbreaks and Prevention",2016-08-26,"Participation enjoys a very special status in health promotion discourse. Conceptualised both as a process and a valued outcome, it is often viewed as a defining feature and a key principle of health promotion (Robertson & Minkler, 1994; Rootman, Goodstadt, Potvin & Springett, 2001). Taking advantage of an undisputable position as a cardinal value, the role of participation has rarely been critically examined in relation to health promotion practice and its contribution to public health. The questions regarding the role of participation and how, in practice, practitioners can facilitate and support its emergence, have not been given satisfactory answers. Answers to these crucial questions can only result from a theoretical understanding of what participation entails in terms of action in the social situations of health promotion interventions. Theorizing on the role of participation in health promotion and on the social processes at play when it occurs is a prerequisite to reframing participation as a professional practice rather than as an ideology (see Pelikan, Chapter 6), and to develop appropriate procedures that can foster the conditions for effective participation.","Potvin, Louise",Health and Modernity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121936/,57
25380,Characterization of Proprotein Convertases and Their Involvement in Virus Propagation,2018-02-16,"Acute dyspnea is a common presenting complaint in the emergency room, emergency medicine and intensive care. It may have a cardiovascular or a non-cardiovascular origin, the latter including pulmonary parenchymal diseases. Depending on the cause, it may be associated with fever, cough, hemoptysis, and/or chest pain, with a duration of symptoms that can range from hours to days. Prompt identification of the underlying cause of acute dyspnea is essential in guiding appropriate therapy and management, as patients may rapidly progress to acute respiratory failure. Evaluation with chest radiography is vital for initial assessment and may reveal diffuse parenchymal abnormalities, which may require further assessment with computed tomography (HRCT). Acute non-infectious parenchymal lung diseases are often overlooked and may be under-diagnosed. Their diagnosis requires the evaluation, along with the HRCT pattern, of the clinical and laboratory features and of the bronchoalveolar lavage. Biopsy may be necessary in more complex cases. Although the most frequent cause of diffuse non-infectious parenchymal lung involvement is acute hydrostatic pulmonary edema, there is a wide variety of diseases that may be encountered, including acute drug toxicity, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). In trauma patients, fat embolism syndrome (FES) must be taken into account. Acute respiratory failure is an eventuality that can occur during the course of chronic lung diseases (UIP for example), which may have been unknown until then.","Dalpiaz, G.; Piolanti, M.",Emergency Radiology of the Chest and Cardiovascular System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121959/,57

However the overlapping clinical presentations, complex medical and surgical comorbidities, and numerous medications often complicate diagnosis. Some dermatologic emergencies are primarily reactive and require immunosuppression such as pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) while others are a sign of systemic infection and require antimicrobials, such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Many primary inflammatory disorders, such as Steven–Johnson syndrome (SJS), can develop secondary infections and further complicate diagnosis and management.

25595,Coronavirus Genome Replication,2008-11-01,"Prior to the 1970s, principles involving the fate and transport of hazardous chemicals from either hazardous waste spills or landfills into ground water and/or surface water were not fully understood. In addition, national guidance on proper waste disposal techniques was not well developed. As a result, there were many instances where hazardous waste was not disposed of properly, such as the Love Canal environmental pollution incident. This incident led to the passage of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. This act gave the United States Environmental Protection Agency regulatory control of all stages of the hazardous waste management cycle. Presently, numerous federal agencies provide guidance on methods and approaches used to evaluate potential health effects and assess risks from contaminated source media, i.e., soil, air, and water. These agencies also establish standards of exposure or health benchmark values in the different media, which are not expected to produce environmental or human health impacts. The risk assessment methodology is used by various regulatory agencies using the following steps: i) hazard identification; ii) dose-response (quantitative) assessment; iii) exposure assessment; iv) risk characterization. The overall objectives of risk assessment are to balance risks and benefits; to set target levels; to set priorities for program activities at regulatory agencies, industrial or commercial facilities, or environmental and consumer organizations; and to estimate residual risks and extent of risk reduction. The chapter will provide information on the concepts used in estimating risk and hazard due to exposure to ground and surface waters contaminated from the recycling of hazardous waste and/or hazardous waste materials for each of the steps in the risk assessment process. Moreover, this chapter will provide examples of contaminated water exposure pathway calculations as well as provide information on current guidelines, databases, and resources such as current drinking water standards, health advisories, and ambient water quality criteria. Finally, specific examples of contaminants released from recycled hazardous waste materials and case studies evaluating the human health effects due to contamination of ground and surface waters from recycled hazardous waste materials will be provided and discussed.","Rodriguez-Proteau, Rosita; Grant, Roberta L.",Water Pollution,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122228/,57

The intensification of animal husbandry; centralisation of large groups of animals in industrial production units; globalization of trade in live animals and/or animal products, bedding and feeds; as well as increased tourism, are all considerable factors in the threat of devastating infectious diseases word-wide. The opening of borders between many countries such as in the European continent contributes greatly to the high-risk situation, where infectious agents may easily travel thousands of miles and then suddenly appear in areas where they are unexpected and probably even unknown. The sudden and unexpected appearance of any infectious disease in a new region, be it a country or a continent, may lead to a delayed or innaccurate diagnosis resulting in the uncontrolled spread of the disease agent to other susceptible populations of animals over large geographic areas. Recent major examples are incidences of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK, the extension of rinderpest into the Somali plains and Rift Valley fever (RVF) spread into the Arabian Peninsula. The latest major problem is the occurrence, re-occurrence and rapid spread of influenza virus.

This work focuses on one such application: disaster management in times of crises and calamities. The existing research on disaster damage analysis has primarily taken only unimodal information in the form of text or image into account. These unimodal systems, although useful, fail to model the relationship between the various modalities. Different modalities often present supporting facts about the task, and therefore, learning them together can enhance performance. We present MEMIS, a system that can be used in emergencies like disasters to identify and analyze the damage indicated by user-generated multimodal social media posts, thereby helping the disaster management groups in making informed decisions. Our leave-one-disaster-out experiments on a multimodal dataset suggest that not only does fusing information in different media forms improves performance, but that our system can also generalize well to new disaster categories. Further qualitative analysis reveals that the system is responsive and computationally efficient.","Agarwal, Mansi; Leekha, Maitree; Sawhney, Ramit; Ratn Shah, Rajiv; Kumar Yadav, Rajesh; Kumar Vishwakarma, Dinesh",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148216/,57

METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional study. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory syndrome in a tertiary care hospital from 2012 to 2013 were reviewed. RESULTS: HRV was the most common CRV observed (36%, 162/444) and was present in the majority of viral co‐detections (69%, 88/128), mainly in association with human enterovirus (45%). Most HRV‐infected patients were younger than 2 years (57%). Overall, patients infected with HRV had a lower frequency of severe acute respiratory infection than those infected with other CRVs (60% and 84%, respectively, p = 0.006), but had more comorbidities (40% and 27%, respectively; p = 0.043). However, in the adjusted analysis this association was not significant. The mortality rate within the HRV group was 3%. Detection of HRV was more prevalent during autumn and winter, with a moderately negative correlation between viral infection frequency and temperature (r = −0.636, p < 0.001) but no correlation with rainfall (r = −0.036, p = 0.866). CONCLUSION: HRV is usually detected in hospitalized children with respiratory infections and is often present in viral co‐detections. Comorbidities are closely associated with HRV infections. These infections show seasonal variation, with predominance during colder seasons.","Leotte, Jaqueline; Trombetta, Hygor; Faggion, Heloisa Z.; Almeida, Bernardo M.; Nogueira, Meri B.; Vidal, Luine R.; Raboni, Sonia M.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153728/,57
30134,Transport of Proteins into and across the Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane,2012-12-02,"The screening and testing of extracts against a variety of pharmacological targets in order to benefit from the immense natural chemical diversity is a concern in many laboratories worldwide. And several successes have been recorded in finding new actives in natural products, some of which have become new drugs or new sources of inspiration for drugs. But in view of the vast amount of research on the subject, it is surprising that not more drug candidates were found. In our view, it is fundamental to reflect upon the approaches of such drug discovery programs and the technical processes that are used, along with their inherent difficulties and biases. Based on an extensive survey of recent publications, we discuss the origin and the variety of natural chemical diversity as well as the strategies to having the potential to embrace this diversity. It seemed to us that some of the difficulties of the area could be related with the technical approaches that are used, so the present review begins with synthetizing some of the more used discovery strategies, exemplifying some key points, in order to address some of their limitations. It appears that one of the challenges of natural product-based drug discovery programs should be an easier access to renewable sources of plant-derived products. Maximizing the use of the data together with the exploration of chemical diversity while working on reasonable supply of natural product-based entities could be a way to answer this challenge. We suggested alternative ways to access and explore part of this chemical diversity with in vitro cultures. We also reinforced how important it was organizing and making available this worldwide knowledge in an “inventory” of natural products and their sources. And finally, we focused on strategies based on synthetic biology and syntheses that allow reaching industrial scale supply. Approaches based on the opportunities lying in untapped natural plant chemical diversity are also considered.","Lautié, Emmanuelle; Russo, Olivier; Ducrot, Pierre; Boutin, Jean A.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154113/,57

On one hand, malaria may cause malnutrition, while on the other, malnutrition itself may modulate susceptibility to the disease. We investigated the association between Plasmodium falciparum malaria and malnutrition in a cohort of children living on the coast of Kenya. The study involved longitudinal follow‐up for clinical malaria episodes and anthropometric measurements at four cross‐sectional surveys. We used Poisson regression analysis to investigate the association between malaria and nutritional status. Compared to baseline (children with a WAZ or HAZ score of ≥−2), the crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for malaria in children with low HAZ or WAZ scores (<−2) during the period prior to assessment were 1.17 (95% CI 0.91–1.50; 0 = 0.21) and 0.94 (0.71–1.25; 0.67), respectively, suggesting no association between malaria and the subsequent development of PEM. However, we found that age was acting as an effect modifier in the association between malaria and malnutrition. The IRR for malaria in children 0–2 years old who were subsequently characterized as wasted was 1.65 (1.10–2.20; P = 0.01), and a significant overall relationship between malaria and low‐HAZ was found on regression analysis when adjusting for the interaction with age (IRR 1.89; 1.01–3.53; P < 0.05). Although children living on the coast of Kenya continue to suffer clinical episodes of uncomplicated malaria throughout their first decade, the association between malaria and malnutrition appears to be limited to the first 2 years of life.","Nyakeriga, A.

The dominant and regionally ubiquitous weeds in the wheat field that was selected for the study were Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album, Melilotus albus, Phalaris minor and Rumex dentatus. Taller weeds, such as C. album and P. minor, constituted one group along with the crop, with a low photosynthetic rate, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen mass basis, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic nitrogen‐use efficiency and leaf area ratio, in comparison to shorter weeds, such as A. arvensis, M. albus and R. dentatus, which formed another group with a high photosynthetic rate, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen mass basis, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic nitrogen‐use efficiency and leaf area ratio. Interspecific variations in the photosynthetic rate were driven mainly by variability in the specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content. The taller weeds and the crop had a low specific leaf area later in the season, whereas the smaller weeds had a relatively high specific leaf area, which might be an adaptation to the shaded environment below the canopy. The result indicates that any weed management in the wheat fields of the Indo‐Gangetic Plains will need two different approaches because of the different strategies followed by the two weed groups that were identified in the present study.","Singh, Vartika; Gupta, Sweta; Singh, Hema; Raghubanshi, Akhilesh Singh",Weed Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169674/,57

Approximately 10% of patients hospitalized with CAP are admitted to the ICU [3]. In a multicenter study by Mongardon et al. in patients with severe pneumococcal CAP admitted to the ICU, the mortality rate was 29%, with high proportions of patients in septic shock and needing mechanical ventilation [4]. Severe CAP is a progressive disease and patients may die despite early and adequate antibiotic treatment. The host local and systemic inflammatory immune response in patients with severe CAP is exacerbated and disproportionate and this is probably the main cause for the high mortality in this specific population, as it contributes to impaired alveolar gas exchange, sepsis and end-organ dysfunction [5]. In this specific population of patients with severe CAP, adjuvant treatments, such as corticosteroids, may be beneficial.","Cillóniz, C.; San José, A.; Torres, A.",Annual Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine 2016,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176164/,57

Today’s telemedicine options relate not only to the area of diagnostics, but also to the monitoring of therapy courses and rehabilitation measures. Due to the current resource constraints, many orthopedic surgeons and trauma surgeons have been forced to set up video consultations, although standards for orthopedic video consultations have so far been insufficiently developed. In order to maximize the efficiency of virtual orthopedics, patients should be prepared for the virtual visit (checklist with specific instructions on camera positioning, body positioning, adjustment and clothing, testing of audiovisual skills). Classic diagnostic measures such as anamnesis, inspection and assessment of radiological findings are possible in the video consultation. One major disadvantage is, that there is no possibility for a functional examination (stability of the knee joint, shoulder tests). Although initial controlled scientific studies have shown that telemedical diagnostics are not inferior to conventional diagnostics, there are still no validated examination protocols and methods. Postoperative monitoring of rehabilitation measures can, for example, be made easier by the use of sensors. With modern sensors, inexpensive detection of joint mobility and joint position is now possible and is already used in the area of rehabilitation after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Here too, further research is certainly necessary to validate these methods. We believe that the current pandemic offers opportunities to further expand the possibilities of telemedicine for orthopedics and trauma surgery in order to continue to use it in the future (e.g. in the care of patients from abroad or in sparsely populated areas, care of professional athletes).","Backhaus, Luisa; Bierke, Sebastian; Karpinski, Katrin; Häner, Martin; Petersen, Wolf",Knie J.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7221338/,57

We identified that skill graphs have a high potential to be amenable to scalable verification approaches in the early software development process. In this work, we suggest combining skill graphs with hybrid programs. Hybrid programs constitute a program notation for hybrid systems enabling the verification of cyber-physical systems. We provide the first formalization of skill graphs including a notion of compositionality and propose Skeditor, an integrated framework for modeling and verifying them. Skeditor is coupled with the theorem prover KeYmaera X, which is specialized in the verification of hybrid programs. In an experiment exhibiting the follow mode of a vehicle, we evaluate our skill-based methodology with respect to savings in verification effort and potential to find modeling defects at design time. Compared to non-compositional verification, the initial verification effort needed is reduced by more than 53%.","Knüppel, Alexander; Jatzkowski, Inga; Nolte, Marcus; Thüm, Thomas; Runge, Tobias; Schaefer, Ina",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418113/,57

We ask what lessons can be learned from this experience and identify two, both of which push against mainstream interpretations of recent events. First, and contrary to the view that the crisis exposed social media and Big Tech as a source of dangerous misinformation that needs to be regulated more strictly, the paper argues that the less mediated spaces of the Internet—social media and Twitter, in particular—played an essential role in triggering a more effective policy response based around social distancing, lockdown, and containment. Second, and contrary to the view that things will go back to normal once the worst of the crisis has passed, the paper argues that, as a direct result of lockdown, the status quo has been shifted across multiple sectors of the economy. Three examples of this shift are introduced, notably the forced experimentation with digital technologies in education and health, the increased use of remote work in many companies, and a reduction in environmentally harmful behavior and decrease in pollution levels. The long-term effects of this ‘reset’ are impossible to predict, but a quick return to the ‘old normal’ seems unlikely. The paper concludes with the suggestion that this reset has created a unique historical opportunity for the reappraisal of regulatory approaches across multiple domains and exposed the need for regulatory models better aligned to a less mediated, more decentralized world. COVID-19 is a global tragedy, but—given that it has happened—it should be used as a learning experience to re-imagine a better, more socially, and environmentally responsible future.","Fenwick, Mark; McCahery, Joseph A.; Vermeulen, Erik P.

42981,The use of induced pluripotent stem cells in domestic animals: a narrative review,2020-12-08,"BACKGROUND: Neurogenic dysphagia is common and has no definitive treatment. We assessed whether pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) is associated with reduced dysphagia. METHODS: The PHAryngeal electrical stimulation for treatment of neurogenic Dysphagia European Registry (PHADER) was a prospective single-arm observational cohort study. Participants were recruited with neurogenic dysphagia (comprising five groups – stroke not needing ventilation; stroke needing ventilation; ventilation acquired; traumatic brain injury; other neurological causes). PES was administered once daily for three days. The primary outcome was the validated dysphagia severity rating scale (DSRS, score best-worst 0–12) at 3 months. FINDINGS: Of 255 enrolled patients from 14 centres in Austria, Germany and UK, 10 failed screening. At baseline, mean (standard deviation) or median [interquartile range]: age 68 (14) years, male 71%, DSRS 11·4 (1·7), time from onset to treatment 32 [44] days; age, time and DSRS differed between diagnostic groups. Insertion of PES catheters was successfully inserted in 239/245 (98%) participants, and was typically easy taking 11·8 min. 9 participants withdrew before the end of treatment. DSRS improved significantly in all dysphagia groups, difference in means (95% confidence intervals, CI) from 0 to 3 months: stroke (n = 79) –6·7 (–7·8, –5·5), ventilated stroke (n = 98) –6·5 (–7·6, –5·5); ventilation acquired (n = 35) –6·6 (–8·4, –4·8); traumatic brain injury (n = 24) -4·5 (–6·6, –2·4). The results for DSRS were mirrored for instrumentally assessed penetration aspiration scale scores. DSRS improved in both supratentorial and infratentorial stroke, with no difference between them (p = 0·32). In previously ventilated participants with tracheotomy, DSRS improved more in participants who could be decannulated (n = 66) –7·5 (–8·6, –6·5) versus not decannulated (n = 33) –2·1 (–3·2, –1·0) (p<0·001). 74 serious adverse events (SAE) occurred in 60 participants with pneumonia (9·2%) the most frequent SAE. INTERPRETATION: In patients with neurogenic dysphagia, PES was safe and associated with reduced measures of dysphagia and penetration/aspiration.

We discuss the shift towards analytical frameworks that consider not only the farm level but rather whole food system transformations. We then introduce the multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions which we adopt for the purpose of this book. Moving beyond the technical analysis often found in research on sustainability ‘transitions’, our approach thus adopts agency-centric approach to food systems ‘transformation’. To do this, we introduce the notion of domains of transformation, which represent discrete areas where the conflict between agroecology and the dominant food regime manifests and where the potential for collective and transformation is transformation is most potent.","Anderson, Colin Ray; Bruil, Janneke; Chappell, M.

The 3-phase project involves semi-structured interviews with 60+ participants that were videorecorded using a web-based platform. We report on the emotional and visceral experiences of these direct care workers providing care during the pandemic. We organize the data into four affect categories: fear/anxiety, sadness/grief, anger/frustration, and trauma/stress. The 30 participants include nurses, activities staff, med techs, CNAs, housekeepers, dining staff, chaplains and administrators at nursing homes, assisted living communities, memory care units and continuing care retirement communities. We amplify the voices of these formal caregivers in order to demonstrate how their sensorial and emotive experiences can speak to the human suffering they bore witness to, the underlying ageism that permeates our culture, and the social hierarchy that devalues their labor and their worth as they serve on the frontlines during this unprecedented global pandemic.","Wolf, Christin; Freidus, Andrea; Shenk, Dena",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741837/,57

50828,Functional Analysis of the Fusion and Attachment Glycoproteins of Mojiang Henipavirus,2021-03-22,"The Schnorr blind signing protocol allows blind issuing of Schnorr signatures, one of the most widely used signatures. Despite its practical relevance, its security analysis is unsatisfactory. The only known security proof is informal and in the combination of the generic group model (GGM) and the random oracle model (ROM) assuming that the “ROS problem” is hard. The situation is similar for (Schnorr-)signed ElGamal encryption, a simple CCA2-secure variant of ElGamal. We analyze the security of these schemes in the algebraic group model (AGM), an idealized model closer to the standard model than the GGM. We first prove tight security of Schnorr signatures from the discrete logarithm assumption (DL) in the AGM+ROM. We then give a rigorous proof for blind Schnorr signatures in the AGM+ROM assuming hardness of the one-more discrete logarithm problem and ROS. As ROS can be solved in sub-exponential time using Wagner’s algorithm, we propose a simple modification of the signing protocol, which leaves the signatures unchanged. It is therefore compatible with systems that already use Schnorr signatures, such as blockchain protocols. We show that the security of our modified scheme relies on the hardness of a problem related to ROS that appears much harder. Finally, we give tight reductions, again in the AGM+ROM, of the CCA2 security of signed ElGamal encryption to DDH and signed hashed ElGamal key encapsulation to DL.","Fuchsbauer, Georg; Plouviez, Antoine; Seurin, Yannick",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991751/,57
51808,Roles of bile acids in enteric virus replication,2021-04-23,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore pharmacists’ and physicians’ perceptions of use, barriers to use and the healthcare outcomes associated with use of Australia’s national personally controlled electronic health record—known as My Health Record—in the emergency department. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was deployed, including surveys and individual semi-structured interviews. All physicians and pharmacists who work in the emergency department at Cabrini Health (a non-for-profit healthcare provider in Victoria, Australia) were invited to participate. Due to the timing of elective blocks, physician trainees were excluded from interviews. RESULTS: A total of 40 emergency medicine clinicians responded to the survey. Over 50% (n = 22) of all respondents had used My Health Record in the emergency department at least once. A total of 18 clinicians participated in the semi-structured interviews, which led to the identification of three themes with multiple sub-themes regarding My Health Record: (1) benefits; (2) effectiveness; and; (3) barriers. CONCLUSION: Participants reported My Health Record use in the emergency department delivers efficiencies for clinicians and has a heightened utility for complex patients, consistent with previous research conducted outside of the Australian setting. Barriers to use were revealed: outdated content, a lack of trust, a low perception of value, no patient record and multiple medical record systems. The participants in this study highlighted that training and awareness raising is needed in order to improve My Health Record use in the emergency department, a need stressed by physician’s. Further observational research is required to explores meaningful MHR use at scale.","Mullins, Alexandra K.; Morris, Heather; Bailey, Cate; Ben-Meir, Michael; Rankin, David; Mousa, Mariam; Skouteris, Helen",Health Inf Sci Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8051833/,57

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of VALD-3, a Schiff base ligand synthesized from o-vanillin derivatives, on human breast cancer cells and the possible underlying mechanisms. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-test was used to observe the proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells induced by VALD-3. Flow cytometry analysis showed that VALD-3 triggered cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Western blot analysis revealed that VALD-3 upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bad and Bax), downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, survivin and XIAP) and increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8, Cyto-c and cleaved PARP. VALD-3 also regulated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in breast cancer cells, inhibiting the activation of downstream molecules. By xenografting human breast cancer cells into nude mice, we found that VALD-3 significantly suppressed tumor cell growth while showing low toxicity against major organs. In addition, survival analysis showed that VALD-3 can significantly prolong the survival time of mice (P = 0.036). This study is the first to show that VALD-3 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cells by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, indicating that it could be a potential drug for the treatment of breast cancer.","Li, Hongling; Dang, Chunyan; Tai, Xiaohui; Xue, Li; Meng, Yuna; Ma, Shuping; Zhang, Jing",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8298535/,57

TMAs should be classified according to etiology to indicate targets for treatment. Complement dysregulation is an important cause of TMA that defines cases not related to coexisting conditions, that is, primary atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Ever since the approval of therapeutic complement inhibition, the approach of TMA has focused on the recognition of primary atypical HUS. Recent advances, however, demonstrated the pivotal role of complement dysregulation in specific subtypes of patients considered to have secondary atypical HUS. This is particularly the case in patients presenting with coexisting hypertensive emergency, pregnancy, and kidney transplantation, shifting the paradigm of disease. In contrast, complement dysregulation is uncommon in patients with other coexisting conditions, such as bacterial infection, drug use, cancer, and autoimmunity, among other disorders. In this review, we performed a critical appraisal on complement dysregulation and the use of therapeutic complement inhibition in TMAs associated with coexisting conditions and outline a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and treatment. For future studies, we advocate the term complement-mediated TMA as opposed to the traditional atypical HUS-type classification.","Timmermans, Sjoerd A. M. E.

Filter-feeding megafauna, such as the whale shark, might be particularly affected by microplastic pollution as their feeding mode requires filtration of up to thousands of cubic meters of water. In addition, the habitat range of whale sharks intersects with several recognized microplastic pollution hotspots, among which is the Coral Triangle. Direct evidence for microplastic ingestion in whale sharks however, has not yet been presented. Here we show that whale shark scat collected in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019 contained a mean of 2.8 microplastics g(− 1). Contrary to our expectations, the microplastic concentration in the scat remained consistent from 2012 to 2019. Water samples from the study site in 2019 indicated that the local microplastic pollution (5.83 particles m(− 3)) was higher than in surface waters in other whale shark habitats, but well below other pollution hot-spots found in Southeast Asia and China (range: 100–4100 particles m(− 3)). With the predicted growth in plastic use, leading to increased plastic marine pollution, whale sharks are expected to become more exposed to this form of pollution. To what extent microplastic ingestion impacts the overall health status of this endangered species remains an open question.

METHODS A literature search was performed between January 1990 and March 2010. Studies were considered for inclusion, provided (1) they comprised a series of at least 20 patients, (2) they documented a follow-up period of at least 6 months, (3) they reported on the outcome as expressed by hernia recurrence rates, and (4) they reported on type of mesh material, hiatal closure, and antireflux surgery. RESULTS Twenty-three articles enrolling a cumulative number of 1,446 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Polypropylene meshes seem to be associated with low recurrence rates (0-22.7%, median 1.9%) and acceptable dysphagia rates (0-21.7%, median 3.9%). Higher dysphagia rates after polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and expanded PTFE (ePTFE) mesh hiatoplasty have been recorded (15.5-34.3%). Even though the use of novel biologic implants for hiatal repair is still in its infancy, the existing results from clinical research are promising. CONCLUSIONS Polypropylene meshes seem to provide durable results with low dysphagia rates. Unacceptably high recurrence rates for PTFE/ePTFE meshes have been reported.

OBJECTIVE This study sought to evaluate clinical outcomes and prognostic factors after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with hyperacute stroke within 6 hours of onset. METHODS Forty-seven patients with hyperacute stroke attributable to atherosclerotic C-ICA occlusion underwent emergent CAS. Forty-two patients (89.4%) had tandem intracranial artery occlusion (TIO). When patients showed remnant M1 or proximal M2 occlusions after CAS, intracranial recanalization therapy was performed by using pharmacologic thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire stent. Clinical and radiologic data were compared between patients with favorable (modified Rankin scale, 0-2) and unfavorable outcomes. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to find independent prognostic factors. RESULTS Emergent CAS was successful in all but 1 patient. Seven (16.7%) of 42 patients with TIO did not need further treatment, because thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia ≥2b was achieved immediately after CAS. Of the 35 patients who underwent intracranial recanalization therapy for remnant TIO, thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia ≥2b was achieved in 71.4% (25 of 35). Twenty-six patients (55.3%) had favorable outcomes, and mortality was 6.4% at 3 months. Time from symptom onset to carotid recanalization was inversely and independently associated with a favorable outcome for all patients and for those with TIO (P < .05). CONCLUSION In our patient group, emergent CAS for hyperacute stroke caused by atherosclerotic C-ICA occlusion seemed to be effective and safe. Time to carotid recanalization was inversely and independently associated with a favorable outcome.","Yoon, Woong; Kim, Byung Moon; Kim, Dong Joon; Kim, Dong Ik; Kim, Seul Kee",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599209/,57

One cardiovascular parameter, heart rate variability (HRV), has been found to be predictive of postoperative morbidity and mortality. HRV is defined as variation in time intervals between heartbeats and is affected by cardiac autonomic balance. Furthermore, altered HRV has been shown to predict cardiovascular events in non-surgical settings. In multiple studies, experimentally induced pain in healthy humans leads to reduced HRV suggesting a causal relationship. In a different studies, chronic pain has been associated with altered HRV, however, in the setting of clinical pain conditions, it remains unclear how much HRV impairment is due to pain itself versus autonomic changes related to analgesia. We aim to review the available evidence describing the association between postsurgical pain and HRV alterations in the early postoperative period. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a scoping review of relevant studies using detailed searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. Included studies will involve participants undergoing non-cardiac surgery and investigate outcomes of (1) measures of pain intensity; (2) measures of HRV and (3) statistical assessment of association between #1 and #2. As secondary review outcomes included studies will also be examined for other cardiovascular events and for their attempts to control for analgesic treatment and presurgical HRV differences among treatment groups in the analysis. This work aims to synthesise available evidence to inform future research questions related to postsurgical pain and cardiac complications. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics review and approval is not required for this review. The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.","So, Vincent; Klar, Gregory; Leitch, Jordan; McGillion, Michael; Devereaux, P J; Arellano, Ramiro; Parlow, Joel; Gilron, Ian",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849852/,57
62460,"Functional characterization, tissue distribution and nutritional regulation of the Elovl4 gene in golden pompano, Trachinotus ovatus (Linnaeus, 1758).",2020-09-08,"The gradient-index (GRIN) Luneburg lens antenna offers significant benefits, e.g. high aperture efficiency, low-power, minimal cost, wide beam scanning angle and broad bandwidth, over phased array antennas and reflector antennas. However, the spherical shape of the Luneburg lens geometry complicates the integration of standard planar feed sources and poses significant implementation challenge. To eliminate the feed mismatch problem, the quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO) method can be adopted to modify the lens' spherical feed surface into a planar one. However, Luneburg lenses designed with QCTO method are limited to poor performance due to the presence of the reflections and beam broadening arising from the quasi-conformal mapping. In this paper, we present a new method of implementing QCTO-enabled modified Luneburg lens antenna by designing a broadband anti-reflective layer along with the modified lens's planar excitation surface. The proposed anti-reflector layer is inherently broadband in nature, has a continuously tapered inhomogeneous dielectric permittivity profile along its thickness, and ensures broadband impedance matching. To show the new QCTO modified Luneburg lens antenna, an example lens antenna was designed at Ka-band (26-40 GHz) and fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) based additive manufacturing technique. Electromagnetic performance of the lens antenna was experimentally demonstrated.","Biswas, Soumitra; Mirotznik, Mark",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69631-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724073/,57
63225,The neutralizing human recombinant antibodies to pathogenic Orthopoxviruses derived from a phage display immune library.,2012,"With advances in viral surveillance and next-generation sequencing, highly diverse novel astroviruses (AstVs) and different animal hosts had been discovered in recent years. However, the existence of AstVs in marmots had yet to be shown. Here, we identified two highly divergent strains of AstVs (tentatively named Qinghai Himalayanmarmot AstVs, HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2), by viral metagenomic analysis in liver tissues isolated from wild Marmota himalayana in China. Overall, 12 of 99 (12.1 %) M. himalayana faecal samples were positive for the presence of genetically diverse AstVs, while only HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were identified in 300 liver samples. The complete genomic sequences of HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 were 6681 and 6610 nt in length, respectively, with the typical genomic organization of AstVs. Analysis of the complete ORF 2 sequence showed that these novel AstVs are most closely related to the rabbit AstV, mamastrovirus 23 (with 31.0 and 48.0 % shared amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 indicated that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 form two distinct clusters among the mamastroviruses, and may share a common ancestor with the rabbit-specific mamastrovirus 23. These results suggest that HHMAstV1 and HHMAstV2 are two novel species of the genus Mamastrovirus in the Astroviridae. The remarkable diversity of these novel AstVs will contribute to a greater understanding of the evolution and ecology of AstVs, although additional studies will be needed to understand the clinical significance of these novel AstVs in marmots, as well as in humans.","Ao, Yuan-Yun; Yu, Jie-Mei; Li, Li-Li; Cao, Jing-Yuan; Deng, Hong-Yan; Xin, Yun-Yun; Liu, Meng-Meng; Lin, Lin; Lu, Shan; Xu, Jian-Guo; Duan, Zhao-Jun",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28100306/,57

Method We took a random sample from the Cochrane Stroke Group's Trial Register of transient ischaemic attack or stroke randomised controlled trials, published in English in 1997-2016 inclusive. Two reviewers assessed the published report of the final primary results of stroke randomised controlled trials with a 10-point truncated Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials reporting checklist to investigate adherence over time, univariable associations and independent associations with total Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials reporting score in a multiple linear regression model. Findings In this random sample of 177 stroke randomised controlled trials, the mean score on the truncated Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials checklist was 5.8 (SD 2.2); reporting improved from 1997-2000 (4.9 SD 2.0) to 2001-2009 (5.8 SD 2.1) and to 2010-2016 (6.8 SD 2.1). A higher Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials score was independently associated with publication during epochs following a revision of Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials reporting guidelines (p < 0.001), journal endorsement of the Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials reporting guideline at the time of randomised controlled trial publication (p < 0.001) and modified journal impact factor using median citation distribution (p = 0.012).

We aimed to quantify molecular markers of inflammation in human brain tissue after ICH compared with controls using meta-analysis. METHODS We searched OVID MEDLINE (1946-) and Embase (1974-) in June 2020 for studies that reported any measure of a molecular marker of inflammation in brain tissue from five or more adults after ICH. We assessed risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (mNOS; mNOS score 0-9; 9 indicates low bias), extracted aggregate data, and used random effects meta-analysis to pool associations of molecules where more than two independent case-control studies reported the same outcome and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify over-represented biological processes in pooled sets of differentially expressed molecules (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ID: CRD42018110204). RESULTS Of 7501 studies identified, 44 were included: 6 were case series and 38 were case-control studies (median mNOS score 4, IQR 3-5). We extracted data from 21 491 analyses of 20 951 molecules reported by 38 case-control studies. Only one molecule (interleukin-1β protein) was quantified in three case-control studies (127 ICH cases vs 41 ICH-free controls), which found increased abundance of interleukin-1β protein after ICH (corrected standardised mean difference 1.74, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.21, p=0.036, I2=46%). Processes associated with interleukin-1β signalling were enriched in sets of molecules that were more abundant after ICH. CONCLUSION Interleukin-1β abundance is increased after ICH, but analyses of other inflammatory molecules after ICH lack replication. Interleukin-1β pathway modulators may optimise inflammatory responses to ICH and merit testing in clinical trials.","Loan, James Jm; Kirby, Caoimhe; Emelianova, Katherine; Dando, Owen R; Poon, Michael Tc; Pimenova, Leisan; Hardingham, Giles E; McColl, Barry W; Klijn, Catharina Jm; Al-Shahi Salman, Rustam; Schreuder, Floris Hbm; Samarasekera, Neshika","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362854/,57

METHODS Ten male amateur football players completed a 120 min soccer match simulation (SMS). Before, at half time (HT), full time (FT), and following a period of ET, twitch responses to supramaximal femoral nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were obtained from the knee-extensors to measure neuromuscular fatigue. Within 7 days of the first SMS, a second 120 min SMS was performed by eight of the original ten participants to assess the reliability of the fatigue response. RESULTS At HT, FT, and ET, reductions in maximal voluntary force (MVC; -11, -20 and -27%, respectively, P ≤ 0.01), potentiated twitch force (-15, -23 and -23%, respectively, P < 0.05), voluntary activation (FT, -15 and ET, -18%, P ≤ 0.01), and voluntary activation measured with TMS (-11, -15 and -17%, respectively, P ≤ 0.01) were evident. The fatigue response was robust across both trials; the change in MVC at each time point demonstrated a good level of reliability (CV range 6-11%; ICC2,1 0.83-0.94), whilst the responses identified with motor nerve stimulation showed a moderate level of reliability (CV range 5-18%; ICC2,1 0.63-0.89) and the data obtained with motor cortex stimulation showed an excellent level of reliability (CV range 3-6%; ICC2,1 0.90-0.98). CONCLUSION Simulated soccer exercise induces a significant level of fatigue, which is consistent on repeat tests, and involves both central and peripheral mechanisms.","Goodall, Stuart; Thomas, Kevin; Harper, Liam David; Hunter, Robert; Parker, Paul; Stevenson, Emma; West, Daniel; Russell, Mark; Howatson, Glyn",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-017-3561-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28247027/,57

The primary aim of the study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on clinical demands including burnout among gastroenterologists within the region. The secondary aim was to identify risk factors for burnout and determine regional stressors. METHODS This was a mixed-methods study. Gastroenterologists were surveyed electronically between 1 September to 7 December 2020 via gastroenterology and endoscopy societies of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS) was used to detect burnout. Quantitative data were non-parametric; non-parametric methods were used for statistical comparisons. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for burnout. Content analysis method was used to analyze qualitative data. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS 73.0% reported that they were still significantly affected by the pandemic. Of these, 40.5% reported increased workload and 59.5% decreased workload. Statistically significant differences in weekly working hours, endoscopy, and inpatient volumes were present. No differences were observed in outpatient volumes, likely because of telemedicine. Burnout was common however 50.1% of gastroenterologists were unaware of or did not have access to mental health support. This, as well as depression, being a trainee, and public sector work increased burnout risk significantly. CONCLUSION The effects of the pandemic are multi-faceted and burnout is common amongst Southeast Asian gastroenterologists. Safeguards for mental health are sub-optimal and improvements are urgently needed.","Ong, John; Ong, Andrew Ming Liang; Ong, Sharon; Xin, Xiaohui; Lee, Yeong Yeh; Pausawasdi, Nonthalee; De Lusong, Mark Anthony; Makmun, Dadang; Chong, Vui Heng; Ho, Shiaw Hooi; Lim, Wanyen; Ong, David; Dan, Yock Young; Khor, Christopher",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159640/,57

METHODS Data were retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging. The study examined data from the period 1999 to 2007. A total of 652 subjects were included in the final analysis, and they were categorized as normally employed or unemployed depending on their employment status in 1999. Frailty was defined using the Fried criteria. Multiple confounding factors were adjusted in a multilevel analysis. RESULTS The average age of the participants in 1999 was 59.0 years. A total of 491 participants were normally employed, and 161 participants were unemployed. After adjustment for gender, age, level of education, income, marital status, and number of chronic diseases, late-career unemployment was associated with increased frailty [odds ratio (OR) = 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-2.59]. The risk of developing frailty was higher for participants who were unemployed during late career and had poor self-rated health [OR = 3.54; 95% CI = 1.37-9.20]. CONCLUSIONS Late-career unemployment is associated with increased frailty, especially for those who also have poor self-rated health. Older adults should be encouraged to maintain normal employment during the later stages of their career before retirement. Employers should apply strategies to prevent possible late-career unemployment, and the government should provide resources and help to unemployed older workers so that they can minimize poor health outcomes in late life.

We did a mixed-methods systematic review of mechanisms, enablers and barriers to the promotion of women's and children's health in community mobilisation interventions. Methods We searched for theoretical and empirical peer-reviewed articles between January 2000 and November 2018. First, we extracted and collated proposed mechanisms, enablers and barriers into categories. Second, we extracted and synthesised evidence for them using narrative synthesis. We assessed risk of bias with adapted Downs and Black and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. We assigned confidence grades to each proposed mechanism, enabler and barrier. Results 78 articles met the inclusion criteria, of which 39 described interventions based on a participatory group education model, 19 described community-led structural interventions to promote sexual health in marginalised populations and 20 concerned other types of intervention or multiple interventions at once. We did not have high confidence in any mechanism, enabler or barrier. Two out of 15 proposed mechanisms and 10 out of 12 proposed enablers and barriers reached medium confidence. A few studies provided direct evidence relating proposed mechanisms, enablers or barriers to health behaviours or health outcomes. Only two studies presented mediation or interaction analysis for a proposed mechanism, enabler or barrier.

All the three models with default settings exhibited distinct errors in the simulated vertical temperature profile. Then model calibration was conducted by adjusting three (four) key parameters within FLake and CoLM-Lake (WRF-Lake) in a series of sensitive experiments. Results showed that each model's performance is sensitive to the key parameters and becomes much better when adjusting all the key parameters relative to tuning single parameter. Overall, setting the temperature of maximum water density to 1.1 °C instead of 4 °C in the three models consistently leads to improved vertical thermal structure simulation during cold seasons; reducing the light extinction coefficient in FLake results in much deeper mixed layer and warmer thermocline during warm seasons in better agreement with the observation. The vertical thermal structure can be clearly improved by decreasing the light extinction coefficient and increasing the turbulent mixing in WRF-Lake and CoLM-Lake during warm seasons. Meanwhile, the modeled water temperature profile in warm seasons can be significantly improved by further replacing the constant surface roughness lengths by a parameterized scheme in WRF-Lake. Further intercomparison indicates that among the three calibrated models, FLake (WRF-Lake) performs the best to simulate the temporal evolution and intensity of temperature in the layers shallower (deeper) than 10 m, while WRF-Lake is the best at simulating the amplitude and pattern of the temperature variability at all depths.","Huang, Anning; Lazhu,; Wang, Junbo; Dai, Yongjiu; Yang, Kun; Wei, Nan; Wen, Lijuan; Wu, Yang; Zhu, Xueyan; Zhang, Xindan; Cai, Shuxin",Journal of geophysical research.

72424,From whole monoclonal antibodies to single domain antibodies: think small.,2012,"INTRODUCTION In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) probably occurred in Wuhan, China. By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a pandemic. Containment measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene were recommended. In this study, we start from the hypothesis that engaging with containment measures in a pandemic situation should be more comfortable for some people than for other people. Thus, individual differences should be associated with engagement with containment measures. OBJECTIVE To investigate to what extent two personality traits, extroversion and conscientiousness, are associated with engagement with two containment measures (social distancing and handwashing). METHODS The sample consisted of 715 Brazilian adults aged 18-78 years, who answered the Big Five Inventory 2 Short (BFI-2-S) and factors from the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory 2 (IDCP-2). RESULTS Higher scores for extroversion were associated with lower means for social distancing (p < 0.001) and higher scores for conscientiousness were associated with higher means for social distancing and handwashing (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The findings indicate the importance of acknowledging extroversion and conscientiousness traits as relevant to people's engagement with the measures recommended for COVID-19 containment.","Carvalho, Lucas de F; Pianowski, Giselle; Gonçalves, André P",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1590/2237-6089-2020-0029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294713/,57
72722,Replication of Human Norovirus RNA in Mammalian Cells Reveals Lack of Interferon Response.,2016,"UNLABELLED RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) MDA5 and RIG-I are key players in the innate antiviral response. Upon recognition of viral RNA, they interact with MAVS, eventually inducing type I interferon production. The interferon induction pathway is commonly targeted by viruses. How enteroviruses suppress interferon production is incompletely understood. MDA5 has been suggested to undergo caspase- and proteasome-mediated degradation during poliovirus infection. Additionally, MAVS is reported to be cleaved during infection with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) by the CVB3 proteinase 3C(pro), whereas MAVS cleavage by enterovirus 71 has been attributed to 2A(pro). As yet, a detailed examination of the RLR pathway as a whole during any enterovirus infection is lacking. We performed a comprehensive analysis of crucial factors of the RLR pathway, including MDA5, RIG-I, LGP2, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3, during infection of CVB3, a human enterovirus B (HEV-B) species member. We show that CVB3 inhibits the RLR pathway upstream of TBK1 activation, as demonstrated by limited phosphorylation of TBK1 and a lack of IRF3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that MDA5, MAVS, and RIG-I all undergo proteolytic degradation in CVB3-infected cells through a caspase- and proteasome-independent manner. We convincingly show that MDA5 and MAVS cleavages are both mediated by CVB3 2A(pro), while RIG-I is cleaved by 3C(pro). Moreover, we show that proteinases 2A(pro) and 3C(pro) of poliovirus (HEV-C) and enterovirus 71 (HEV-A) exert the same functions. This study identifies a critical role of 2A(pro) by cleaving MDA5 and MAVS and shows that enteroviruses use a common strategy to counteract the interferon response in infected cells. IMPORTANCE Human enteroviruses (HEVs) are important pathogens that cause a variety of diseases in humans, including poliomyelitis, hand, foot, and mouth disease, viral meningitis, cardiomyopathy, and more. Like many other viruses, enteroviruses target the host immune pathways to gain replication advantage. The MDA5/MAVS pathway is responsible for recognizing enterovirus infections in the host cell and leads to expression of type I interferons (IFN-I), crucial antiviral signaling molecules. Here we show that three species of HEVs all employ the viral proteinase 2A (2A(pro)) to proteolytically target MDA5 and MAVS, leading to an efficient blockade upstream of IFN-I transcription. These observations suggest that MDA5/MAVS antagonization is an evolutionarily conserved and beneficial mechanism of enteroviruses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of enterovirus immune evasion strategies will help to develop countermeasures to control infections with these viruses in the future.","Feng, Qian; Langereis, Martijn A; Lork, Marie; Nguyen, Mai; Hato, Stanleyson V; Lanke, Kjerstin; Emdad, Luni; Bhoopathi, Praveen; Fisher, Paul B; Lloyd, Richard E; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02712-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390337/,57
72762,Leveraging on the genomics and immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 for vaccines development: prospects and challenges.,2020-09-16,"BACKGROUND Background: Analytical treatment interruptions (ATIs) in HIV cure-related research can result in trial participants becoming viremic with HIV, placing HIV-negative sexual partners at elevated risk of acquiring HIV. OBJECTIVE Objective:Our study aimed to generate ethical and practical considerations for designing and implementing appropriate risk mitigation strategies to reduce unintended HIV transmission events during ATIs. METHODS Methods: We conducted 21 in-depth interviews with five types of informants: bioethicists, community members, biomedical HIV cure researchers, socio-behavioral scientists/epidemiologists, and HIV care providers. We used conventional content analysis to analyze the data and generate considerations. RESULTS Results: Key findings include: 1) Ethical permissibility of ATI trials depends on due diligence and informed consent to mitigate risks to participants and their sexual partners; 2) Participants should receive adequate support and/or counseling if they choose to disclose ATI participation to their partners; 3) Measures to protect sexual partners of trial participants from HIV transmission during ATIs should include referral to and/or provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis, as well as other available means of preventing HIV transmission; 4) There is uncertainty regarding the appropriate management of emerging sexually transmitted infections during ATI trials and possible protection measures for multiple and/or anonymous partners of ATI trial participants. CONCLUSION Conclusion: While there is no way to completely eliminate the risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners during ATIs, HIV cure trialists and sponsors should consider the ethical concerns related to the sexual partners of ATI participants. Doing so is essential to ensuring the welfare of participants, their partners and the trustworthiness of research.","Dubé, Karine; Kanazawa, John; Dee, Lynda; Taylor, Jeff; Campbell, Danielle M; Brown, Brandon; Johnson, Mallory O; Saberi, Parya; Sauceda, John A; Sugarman, Jeremy; Peluso, Michael J",HIV research & clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/25787489.2021.1902116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33757411/,57

Arterial blood samples analyzed shortly after darting revealed no abnormalities. Samples analyzed 2 and 1.5 hr after darting revealed moderate hyperkalemia in both animals (6.8 and 6.2 mEq/L, respectively). Shortly after hyperkalemia was recognized, one jaguar developed electrocardiographic abnormalities (sinoventricular rhythm and widened QRS complexes), and a few minutes later, suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitation with chest compressions, intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, and epinephrine was successful, and autonomous breathing and circulation resumed within a few minutes. Anesthesia-related hyperkalemia has been reported in a variety of large felids but has not been reported previously in jaguars. In all reports, α-2 adrenergic agonists were used as part of the immobilization protocol. Due to the presumptively high incidence and mortality caused by this complication, frequent monitoring of electrolyte concentrations and prompt treatment of hyperkalemia is recommended when anesthetizing large felids, including jaguars.","Romano, Marta; Boesch, Jordyn M; Peralta, Santiago; Parker, Christine; Kollias, George",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2017-0147.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900768/,57

METHODS We enrolled case patients hospitalized with severe respiratory illness (SRI) at 2 hospitals and outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and asymptomatic individuals (controls) from 2 affiliated clinics during 2013-2015. We compared the RV prevalence among ILI and SRI cases to those of controls stratified by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus using penalized logistic regression. The attributable fraction (AF) was calculated. RESULTS During 2013-2015, RV was detected in 17.4% (368/2120), 26.8% (979/3654), and 23.0% (1003/4360) of controls, ILI cases, and SRI cases, respectively. The RV AF (95% confidence interval) was statistically significant among children aged <5 years (ILI: 44.6% [30.7%-55.7%] and SRI: 50.3% [38.6%-59.9%]; P < .001) and individuals aged ≥5 years (ILI: 62.9% [54.4%-69.8%] and SRI: 51.3% [38.7%-61.3%]; P < .001) as well as among HIV-infected (ILI: 59.9% [45.8%-70.3%] and SRI: 39.8% [22.3%-53.3%]; P < .001) and HIV-uninfected (ILI: 53.6% [44.7%-61.1%] and SRI: 55.3% [45.6%-63.2%]; P < .001) individuals.

77667,Regulation by S-nitrosylation of protein post-translational modification.,2012,"Within cooperatively breeding societies, individuals adjust cooperative contributions to maximize indirect fitness and minimize direct fitness costs. Yet, little is known about the physiological costs of cooperation, which may be detrimental to direct fitness. Oxidative stress, the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (by-products of energy production) and antioxidant protection, may represent such a cost when cooperative behaviours are energetically demanding. Oxidative stress can lead to the accumulation of cellular damage, compromising survival and reproduction, thus mediating the trade-off between these competing life-history traits. Here, we experimentally increased energetically demanding cooperative contributions in captive Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis). We quantified oxidative stress-related effects of increased cooperation on somatic and germline tissues, and the trade-off between them. Increased cooperative contributions induced oxidative stress in females and males, without increasing somatic damage. Males accumulated oxidative damage in their germline despite an increase in antioxidant defences. Finally, oxidative damage accumulation became biased towards the germline, while antioxidant protection remained biased towards the soma, suggesting that males favour the maintenance of somatic tissues (i.e. survival over reproduction). Our results show that heightened cooperative contributions can ultimately affect direct fitness through oxidative stress costs, which may represent a key selective pressure for the evolution of cooperation.","Mendonça, Rute; Vullioud, Philippe; Katlein, Nathan; Vallat, Armelle; Glauser, Gaétan; Bennett, Nigel C; Helfenstein, Fabrice",Proceedings.

The cause was identified as being a new virus, later named SARS-CoV-2. We can distinguish three clinical phases of the disease with a distinct pathogenesis, manifestations and prognosis. Here, we describe the case of a 45-year-old male, successfully treated for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient was feeling sick in early April 2020; he had a fever and pharyngodynia. When he came to our COVID hospital, his breathing was normal. The nasopharyngeal swab specimen turned out positive. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed mild interstitial pneumonia. The patient was admitted to our department and treated with hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, darunavir, azithromycin and enoxaparin. On day seven of the disease, the patient's respiratory condition got worse as he was developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was given tocilizumab and corticosteroids and was immediately treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). His condition improved, and in the ensuing days, the treatment gradually switched to a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); after 18 days, the patient's clinical condition was good.The successful results we have been able to obtain are closely associated with avoidance of invasive ventilation that may lead to intensive care unit (ICU)-related superinfections. In our opinion, it is fundamental to understand that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that is a consequence of an overwhelming inflammatory response, which can cause severe medical conditions, even in young patients.","Massabeti, Rosanna; Cipriani, Maria Stella; Valenti, Ivana",Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharmacologie clinique,https://doi.org/10.15586/jptcp.v27isp1.691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32650356/,57
79007,Identification and interspecies transmission of a novel bocaparvovirus among different bat species in China.,2016,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Incidence of community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) after lung transplantation (LTx) is 10-68 cases per 100 patient-years. Infected patients may develop graft failure and there seems to be an association between CARV infection and development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). This review summarizes the impact of CARV infection after LTx and potential treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS Detection rate of CARV depends on diagnostic methods. CARV infections after LTx are reported more frequently probably attributed to improved diagnostic methods, especially nucleic acid testing. Paramyxoviridae and picornaviridae are most frequent. For paramyxoviridae, the association with CLAD is reported in various single-center observational studies. Neuraminidase inhibitors are approved for influenza and can be safely used in flu-infected LTx patients. There is no approved treatment for paramyxoviruses, most centers use ribavirin in the infected LTx recipient. SUMMARY Antivirals against CARV in LTx recipients have not yet demonstrated reduced morbidity in randomized clinical trials. Agents against CARV under development are inhibiting viral attachment and use silencing mechanisms of viral replication. The cohort of lung transplant recipients is a focus of intense research because of the high morbidity of CARV infection and intense surveillance of LTx recipeints.","Gottlieb, Jens",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000000633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939491/,57

Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.","Tzur Bitan, Dana; Grossman-Giron, Ariella; Bloch, Yuval; Mayer, Yael; Shiffman, Noga; Mendlovic, Shlomo",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250092/,57

A unidirectional association where depression impacts the change in memory (or vice-versa) and a bidirectional association where the trajectories of both dimensions affect each other lead to different clinical implications. METHOD This study investigated the depression-memory longitudinal association in a sample of 2057 older adults aged between 60 and 99 years old from the Virginia Cognitive Aging Project. The bivariate dual change score model was used to investigate the directionality of the association between episodic memory and three dimensions of depression (somatic symptoms, depressed affect, and positive affect) throughout ten years (five measurement points), controlling for education and sex. RESULTS the bidirectional model showed the best fit between somatic symptoms and memory, with a significant coupling effect observed from initial somatic symptoms to subsequent changes in memory. For depressed and positive affect, the unidirectional model with initial levels of depression predicting following changes in memory showed the best fit to the data, with significant coupling effects observed. Higher initial levels of somatic symptoms and depressed affect predicted a subsequent decline in memory, and higher initial levels of positive affect predicted subsequent better memory performance. Statistical adjustments for covariates (education and sex) had no significant influence on these associations. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support a unidirectional association with higher depressive symptoms preceding a steeper decline in memory in older adults. We discuss the clinical implications for depressive symptoms as a predictor of subsequent memory decline.","Teles, Mariana; Shi, Dingjing",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2021.104501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399242/,57
80336,"Polymorphism and haplotype analyses of swine leukocyte antigen DQA exons 2, 3, 4, and their associations with piglet diarrhea in Chinese native pig.",2015,"BACKGROUND Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the major swine pathogens. This virus causes immune suppression and other secondary infections, leading to significant economic losses in the swine industry. Tea seed saponins (TS) are a natural extract from tea seeds with anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. In this study, we demonstrated that TS possessed anti-PRRSV activity. METHODS MTT assay and trypan blue staining were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity and antiviral ability of TS in cell culture. Apoptosis was measured to assess the safety of TS on Marc-145 cells. Time-of-addition assay, entry inhibition assay and virucidal assay were used to assess the antiviral action of TS. The effect of TS on host cellular gene expression was analysed by real-time PCR. Absolute quantification RT-PCR and western blot were used to study the inhibitory effect of TS on PRRSV N gene and protein expression. RESULTS Our results showed that 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) and 50% effective concentration (EC50) of TS were 59.86 ±0.3841 µg/ml and 24.29 ±1.194 μg/ml, respectively. The maximum non-cytotoxic concentration of TS on Marc-145 cells was 30 μg/ml. TS inhibited PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis and effectively inhibited PRRSV replication by reducing the expression of host cellular gene PABP, and significantly inhibited virus N gene/protein expression. CONCLUSIONS TS possessed anti-PRRSV activity in vitro and could serve as a potential antiviral drug for PRRSV prevention and control.","Li, E; Sun, Na; Zhao, Jun-Xing; Sun, Yao-Gui; Huang, Jian-Gang; Lei, Hai-Min; Guo, Jian-Hua; Hu, Yuan-Liang; Wang, Wen-Kui; Li, Hong-Quan",Antiviral therapy,https://doi.org/10.3851/imp2937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609356/,57
80568,H7N9 pandemic preparedness: A large-scale production of a split inactivated vaccine.,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND Dementia is a progressive disease that decreases quality of life of persons with dementia and is associated with high societal costs. The burden of caring for persons with dementia also decreases the quality of life of family caregivers. The objective of this study was to assess the societal cost-effectiveness of Namaste Care Family program in comparison with usual care in nursing home residents with advanced dementia. METHODS Nursing homes were randomized to either Namaste Care Family program or usual care. Outcome measures of the cluster-randomized trial in 231 residents included Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia (QUALID) and the Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument (GAIN) for family caregivers over 12 months of follow-up. Health states were measured using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire which were translated into utilities. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the amount of time a participant spent in a specific health state with the utility score associated with that health state. Healthcare utilization costs were estimated using standard unit costs, while intervention costs were estimated using a bottom-up approach. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Bootstrapped multilevel models were used after multiple imputation. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. RESULTS The Namaste Care Family program was more effective than usual care in terms of QUALID (- 0.062, 95%CI: - 0.40 to 0.28), QALY (0.0017, 95%CI: - 0.059 to 0.063) and GAIN (0.075, 95%CI: - 0.20 to 0.35). Total societal costs were lower for the Namaste Care Family program as compared to usual care (- 552 €, 95%CI: - 2920 to 1903). However, these differences were not statistically significant. The probability of cost-effectiveness at a ceiling ratio of 0 €/unit of effect extra was 0.70 for the QUALID, QALY and GAIN. CONCLUSIONS The Namaste Care Family program is dominant over usual care and, thus, cost-effective, although statistical uncertainty was considerable.

81493,Oligomeric procyanidins stimulate innate antiviral immunity in dengue virus infected human PBMCs.,2011,"OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to investigate the prognosis of infants with neonatal respiratory inhibition syndrome (NRIS). METHODS Infants with a gestational age of at least 36 weeks and a birth weight of at least 2000 g who were born at Nara Prefecture General Medical Center, in Nara, Japan, between March 2013 and June 2016 were screened for NRIS using our established method. NRIS was defined as severe hypoxemia caused by respiratory inhibition immediately after crying (RIAC) or gastroesophageal reflux (RIGER) or as a respiratory pause during feeding (feeding hypoxemia), accompanied clinically by central cyanosis and a decrease in SpO2 to less than 70%. All infants were monitored using pulse oximetry immediately after birth. Diagnosis of RIAC, feeding hypoxemia, and RIGER are based on observation by both parents and medical staff as well as on on-screen computer analysis using specific software. All infants were examined at a one-month check-up. Parents of the infants who experienced one or more episodes of NRIS accompanied by a decrease in SpO2 to less than 70% for more than approximately 60 s received a questionnaire by mail about their child's development. We conducted a logistic regression analysis with developmental problems as the dependent variable. RESULTS NRIS was observed in 362 (28.5%) infants; 216 (17.0%) infants showed RIAC, 254 (20.0%) infants showed feeding hypoxemia, and 54 (4.2%) infants showed RIGER. Although all infants were monitored in the maternity ward nursery, 184 (85.2%) infants with RIAC and 111 (43.7%) infants with feeding hypoxemia were overlooked. All infants with NRIS were found to have successfully recovered at one month after birth. Sixty-two cases were examined in the follow-up study by the mailed questionnaire. The median age of the subjects at time of study was 22 months. Fourteen cases (22.6%) exhibited developmental problems including delayed speech development, stereotyped interests and behaviors, sensory disturbance, hyperactivity, delayed motor development, and short stature. Developmental problems tended to relate to shorter gestational age (odds ratio, 0.622; p = .068; 95% CI, 0.373-1.036), smaller birth weight (odds ratio, 0.998; p = .069; 95% CI, 0.997-1.000), and maximum duration of SpO2 to less than 70% by RIAC (odds ratio, 1.009; p = .086; 95% CI, 0.999-1.020). All cases had experienced severe hypoxemia accompanied by a decrease in SpO2 to less than 60%. Seven cases had experienced prolonged hypoxemia accompanied by a decrease in SpO2 to less than 70% for at least 2 min. Among the subjects, 19 infants were examined closely, and their natural course of NRIS was observed in the neonatal intensive care unit. No cases demonstrated abnormal findings with blood examinations, chest-abdominal X-ray, echocardiogram, laryngoendoscopy, hearing loss screening, or mass screening. Only one case had a small intracranial hemorrhage as evidenced in a magnetic resonance imaging of the head. CONCLUSIONS The infants with severe NRIS tended to have developmental problems. Spreading knowledge about NRIS worldwide is thought to be very important.","Minowa, Hideki; Takagi, Kumiko; Arai, Ikuyo; Yasuhara, Hajime; Ebisu, Reiko; Ohgitani, Ayako","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2018.1501018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30010451/,57
81581,Lectins purified from medicinal and edible mushrooms: Insights into their antiviral activity against pathogenic viruses.,2021-03-04,"RNA viruses are capable of rapid host shifting, typically due to a point mutation that confers expanded host range. As additional point mutations are necessary for further expansions, epistasis among host range mutations can potentially affect the mutational neighborhood and frequency of niche expansion. We mapped the mutational neighborhood of host range expansion using three genotypes of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) bacteriophage φ6 (wild type and two isogenic host range mutants) on the novel host Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens. Both Sanger sequencing of 50 P. syringae pv. atrofaciens mutant clones for each genotype and population Illumina sequencing revealed the same high-frequency mutations allowing infection of P. syringae pv. atrofaciens. Wild-type φ6 had at least nine different ways of mutating to enter the novel host, eight of which are in p3 (host attachment protein gene), and 13/50 clones had unchanged p3 genes. However, the two isogenic mutants had dramatically restricted neighborhoods: only one or two mutations, all in p3. Deep sequencing revealed that wild-type clones without mutations in p3 likely had changes in p12 (morphogenic protein), a region that was not polymorphic for the two isogenic host range mutants. Sanger sequencing confirmed that 10/13 of the wild-type φ6 clones had nonsynonymous mutations in p12, and 2 others had point mutations in p9 and p5. None of these genes had previously been associated with host range expansion in φ6. We demonstrate, for the first time, epistatic constraint in an RNA virus due to host range mutations themselves, which has implications for models of serial host range expansion.IMPORTANCE RNA viruses mutate rapidly and frequently expand their host ranges to infect novel hosts, leading to serial host shifts. Using an RNA bacteriophage model system (Pseudomonas phage φ6), we studied the impact of preexisting host range mutations on another host range expansion. Results from both clonal Sanger and Illumina sequencing show that extant host range mutations dramatically narrow the neighborhood of potential host range mutations compared to that of wild-type φ6. This research suggests that serial host-shifting viruses may follow a small number of molecular paths to enter additional novel hosts. We also identified new genes involved in φ6 host range expansion, expanding our knowledge of this important model system in experimental evolution.","Zhao, Lele; Seth-Pasricha, Mansha; Stemate, Dragoş; Crespo-Bellido, Alvin; Gagnon, Jacqueline; Draghi, Jeremy; Duffy, Siobain",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01385-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463962/,57
81613,Inhibition of primary effusion lymphoma engraftment in SCID mice by morpholino oligomers against early lytic genes of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.,2011,"BACKGROUND An outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China in late 2019 has resulted in a global pandemic. The virus (SARS-CoV-2) causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome and had been responsible for >14 000 deaths in South Africa (SA) at the time of writing, 30 August 2020. Autopsies in our setting have not been prioritised owing to the infective risks for staff, resulting in a lack of information on the histopathology of the disease in the SA setting. Postmortem biopsies are relatively quick and easy to perform and reduce the infective risk posed by full autopsies. OBJECTIVES To determine whether postmortem biopsies of lung tissue could be used to determine cause of death in lieu of full autopsies in patients dying from COVID-19. METHODS We performed postmortem biopsies of lung tissue on 4 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction who died in the Tygerberg Hospital (Cape Town, SA) intensive care unit (ICU) in June - July 2020, in order to determine their cause of death. The biopsies were performed in the ICU with the necessary personal protective equipment within 2 hours after death. Clinical information was obtained from the hospital records and the histopathology was reviewed by two consultant histopathologists. Microbiology and electron microscopy were also performed on this tissue. RESULTS All 4 patients were aged >50 years and had multiple comorbidities. Pulmonary pathology was present in only 3 cases, and the findings were surprisingly heterogeneous. One case demonstrated several findings including diffuse alveolar damage, extensive fibrin thrombi in pulmonary arteries with pulmonary infarction, organising pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Other findings included type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, intra-alveolar macrophages and squamous metaplasia. An organising pneumonia was present in 2 other cases, although these findings were not deemed to be severe enough to be the cause of death. Fibrin thrombi were present in pulmonary arteries of 3 cases. One case showed no significant acute pulmonary pathology. The cause of death could only be determined in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS The pulmonary findings we observed are in keeping with those described in the international literature. However, the pathology was surprisingly heterogeneous between cases, and was only deemed severe enough to be the cause of death in 1 of 4 cases. While lung-targeted, standardised postmortem biopsies may be safe, easy to perform and provide useful insights into the disease, they are not suitable to replace full autopsies in determining cause of death.","Bruce-Brand, C; Allwood, B W; Koegelenberg, C F N; Lalla, U; Louw, E; Diacon, A H; Schubert, P T",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2020.v110i12.15290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403965/,57
81616,"Redescription and molecular characterization of two species of Pauciconfibula (Monogenea, Microcotylidae) from trachinid fishes in the Mediterranean Sea.",2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND The literature reflects considerable heterogeneity in what constitutes home-based exercise interventions. The variability for where and what ""home-based"" exercise can represent challenges interpretation of findings and appropriate advocacy, referral, or development of these models of care. Therefore, the objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive summary of how home-based exercise is defined and reported in the literature and summarize the range of supportive elements utilized in home-based exercise trials. METHODS We followed methodology for scoping reviews. Relevant research databases were searched from inception to March 2019. Two reviewers independently screened articles to determine eligibility and extracted terminology used to describe home-based exercise and intervention details for intervention delivery. RESULTS Of the 9432 records identified, 229 articles met inclusion criteria. Across the literature, exercise interventions were described as home-based if they were completed at-home, outdoors in the neighbourhood, and in community facilities; or in self-selected environments; or if they were unsupervised. Supportive elements for home-based models ranged with respect to the amount of supervision and resources utilized, including the provision of print materials, exercise equipment, telephone support, home visits, and technology. CONCLUSIONS This review provides a comprehensive summary of strategies previously utilized to deliver home-based exercise interventions in oncology, along with the various definitions of the home-based environment for exercise reported by researchers. Specific recommendations to improve the prescription and reporting of home-based exercise interventions are provided in order to facilitate the delivery, evaluation, and translation of findings into clinical practice.","Lopez, Christian; McGarragle, Kaitlin; Pritlove, Cheryl; Jones, Jennifer M; Alibhai, Shabbir M H; Lenton, Erica; Santa Mina, Daniel",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05453-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296982/,57
82137,Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.) larval diet improves CD8+ lymphocytes proliferation to eliminate chicken coronavirus at an early infection stage.,2021-07-02,"OBJECT The authors undertook this study to assess the safety and efficacy of Onyx embolization in the treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in pediatric patients. METHODS All pediatric Onyx embolization of intracranial AVM cases performed consecutively at a single children's hospital over a 5-year period were collected and evaluated. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (mean age 10.5 years) underwent a total of 38 procedures. An aggregate of 56 pedicles were embolized (mean 1.47 per session). The Spetzler-Martin grade was determined in all cases. Onyx embolization resulted in complete obliteration of the AVM in 3 cases (12%) and partial obliteration in 22 cases (88%). A total of 23 patients underwent surgical treatment. The mean preoperative AVM devascularization in these cases was 72%. One patient was treated with radiosurgery following Onyx embolization. Overall, 10 complications occurred in a total of 38 procedures (26.3%). None of the complications resulted in permanent neurological morbidity. The rate of transient neurological complications was 10.5% (4 of 38 procedures) and the rate of transient nonneurological complications was 5.3% (2 of 38 procedures). The remaining 4 complications were clinically silent (rate of 10.5%). There were no procedure-related deaths in this study population. There was no significant difference in patients with and without complications in terms of demographic characteristics, AVM grade, or embolization features (p ≥ 0.2). Deep venous drainage was associated with higher complication rates (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Onyx utilization is feasible for preoperative or primary embolization in the treatment of pediatric intracranial AVMs; however, the spectrum of complications encountered is broad, and attention must be paid to the technical nuances of and indications for its use to avoid many potential dangerous effects. Although the overall complication rates were higher than expected, all were either clinically silent or had only transient clinical effects. Thus, this experience suggests that Onyx embolization can be performed safely with a low rate of permanent morbidity in pediatric patients harboring these difficult lesions.","Soltanolkotabi, Maryam; Schoeneman, Samantha E; Alden, Tord D; Hurley, Michael C; Ansari, Sameer A; DiPatri, Arthur J; Tomita, Tadanori; Shaibani, Ali",Journal of neurosurgery.

82613,Microevolution of canine influenza virus in shelters and its molecular epidemiology in the United States.,2010,"OBJECTIVES The use of summed planar images generated from single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy has been proposed as a substitute for planar V/Q scans in order to use the revised PIOPED interpretation criteria when only SPECT acquisition is performed in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The aim was to evaluate the accuracy of angular summed planar scans in comparison with true planar images. METHODS Patients included in the 'SPECT study' assessing the diagnostic performance of V/Q SPECT were analysed. Angular summed planar images were generated from SPECT acquisition data and compared with true planar scans. RESULTS Angular summed planar images were successfully generated for 246 patients. Regarding interobserver variability, the interpretation result was different for 15 (6%) summed planar scans with an excellent degree of agreement (κ=0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.88-0.96). With regard to intermodality interpretation variability between conventional planar and angular summed images, the result was different for 63 (26%) of 246 patients with an intermodality degree of agreement of κ=0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.58-0.73). CONCLUSION Planar images generated from SPECT V/Q scintigraphy are not a reliable substitute for true planar V/Q images.","Le Roux, Pierre-Yves; Abgral, Ronan; Jaffrelot, Morgan; Delluc, Aurelien; Gut-Gobert, Christophe; Querellou, Solène; Cornily, Jean-Christophe; Le Gal, Grégoire; Salaün, Pierre-Yves",Nuclear medicine communications,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnm.0b013e328352c7d2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22441133/,57
82960,Antiviral activity of geneticin against dengue virus.,2009,"AIMS The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of E. coli O157 and O26 on Belgian dairy cattle farms, the presence of virulence genes in the confirmed isolates, and the association of E. coli O26 presence with calf diarrhea. METHODS AND RESULTS In total, 233 recto-anal mucosal swabs (RAMS) were obtained from healthy and diarrheic dairy calves on three farms, each alternately visited three consecutive times. RAMS were analyzed for presence of E. coli O157 and O26, and stx1, stx2 and eae virulence genes. Overall, 19% of RAMS tested positive for E. coli O157, while 31% tested positive for E. coli O26. The majority of isolates possessed both stx and eae, denoting a high pathogenic potential to humans. While both serogroups persisted at farm level, persistence within the same animal over time appeared to be relatively rare. Interestingly, E. coli O26 was already abundantly present at a younger age compared to E. coli O157. Calf diarrhea could not be associated with presence of E. coli O26. CONCLUSIONS Young dairy calves are important on-farm reservoirs of potentially pathogenic E. coli O157 and O26. A role of E. coli O26 in calf diarrhea could not be confirmed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY O157 and O26 are responsible for the majority of human STEC infections. Gaining more epidemiological information regarding their occurrence and persistence on cattle farms will contribute to a better understanding of STEC ecology and risk of human transmission.","Engelen, Frederik; Thiry, Damien; Devleesschauwer, Brecht; Heyndrickx, Marc; Mainil, Jacques; De Zutter, Lieven; Cox, Eric",Journal of applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.14909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33103320/,57
83211,Multiplexed detection of analytes on single test strips with antibody-gated indicator releasing mesoporous nanoparticles.,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND In response to noxious stimulation, pupillary dilation reflex (PDR) occurs even in anaesthetized patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of pupillometry with an automated increasing stimulus intensity to monitor intraoperative opioid administration. METHODS Thirty-four patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled. Induction by propofol anaesthesia was increased progressively until the sedation depth criteria (SeD) were attained. Subsequently, a first dynamic pupil measurement was performed by applying standardized nociceptive stimulation (SNS). A second PDR evaluation was performed when remifentanil reached a target effect-site concentration. Automated infrared pupillometry was used to determine PDR during nociceptive stimulations generating a unique pupillary pain index (PPI). Vital signs were measured. RESULTS After opioid administration, anaesthetized patients required a higher stimulation intensity (57.43 mA vs 32.29 mA, P < .0005). Pupil variation in response to the nociceptive stimulations was significantly reduced after opioid administration (8 mm vs 28 mm, P < .0005). The PPI score decreased after analgesic treatment (8 vs 2, P < .0005), corresponding to a 30% decrease. The elicitation of PDR by nociceptive stimulation was performed without changes in vital signs before (HR 76 vs 74/min, P = .09; SBP 123 vs 113 mm Hg, P = .001) and after opioid administration (HR 63 vs 62/min, P = .4; SBP 98.66 vs 93.77 mm Hg, P = .032). CONCLUSIONS During propofol anaesthesia, pupillometry with the possibility of low-intensity standardized noxious stimulation via PPI protocol can be used for PDR assessment in response to remifentanil administration.","Wildemeersch, D; Peeters, N; Saldien, V; Vercauteren, M; Hans, G",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29671874/,57

84075,Missense mutations in small muscle protein X-linked (SMPX) cause distal myopathy with protein inclusions.,2021-05-11,"Food protein-derived bioactive peptides, particularly antihypertensive peptides, are important constituents of functional foods or nutraceuticals. Most antihypertensive are identified as the inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme responsible for the generation of angiotensin II (Ang II), which is a vasoconstricting peptide. Hence, ACE has long been used as a universal target to identify antihypertensive peptides. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a homolog of ACE but uses Ang II as its key substrate to produce angiotensin (1-7), exerting vasodilatory activity via the mas receptor (MasR). Therefore, ACE2 functions in the opposite way as ACE and is an emerging novel target for cardiovascular therapy. The potential of food protein-derived bioactive peptides in targeting ACE2 has been rarely explored. While, recently we found that IRW, an egg white ovotransferrin-derived antihypertensive peptide, reduced blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats via the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR axis, indicating a new mechanism of food protein-derived bioactive peptides in reducing blood pressure. The objectives of this review are to summarize the functions of the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR axis and to examine its potential roles in the actions of food protein-derived antihypertensive peptides. The interaction between antihypertensive peptides and the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR axis will also be discussed.","Liao, Wang; Wu, Jianping",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.1781049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32551837/,57

85131,Replication and Transmission of the Novel Bovine Influenza D Virus in a Guinea Pig Model.,2015,"Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an established treatment for patients at high-risk for endarterectomy. Patients who undergo CAS have been shown to have periprocedural microembolic events on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Flow reversal is often applied in these situations to prevent distal emboli and concurrently allow blood to flush into the common carotid artery. Patients who demonstrate soft plaque morphology that may embolize distally during CAS benefit from flow reversal. Even so, the all-stroke risk in these patients is nearly 1.4%. High-risk patients typically have more difficult plaque morphology; flow reversal decreases the rate of distal emboli but does not offer the intraprocedural visualization seen with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In this paper, we illustrate potential periprocedural outcomes associated with stenting of the stenotic carotid bifurcation under flow reversal and how IVUS influenced endovascular management. Three high-risk patients who underwent CAS with direct common carotid artery cutdown approaches due to common carotid ostia disease with flow-reversal proximal embolic protection also had intraprocedural IVUS performed to evaluate plaque morphology and stability before the protection system was removed. Case 1 illustrates no intraluminal thrombus on IVUS, requiring no further intervention after stent placement. Case 2 demonstrates intraluminal thrombus on IVUS requiring a second stent to stabilize plaque. Case 3 shows the inadequate resolution of thrombus after a second stent, which was addressed with balloon angioplasty. In our experience, using IVUS as an adjunct to CAS under proximal embolic protection helped demonstrate plaque morphology and plaque fragmentation after stent placement. These cases illustrate the potential benefit of allowing stabilization of the plaque before flow reversal is stopped.","Morr, Simon; Vakharia, Kunal; Fanous, Andrew A; Waqas, Muhammad; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.4935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431840/,57

In September 2018 the Trump administration announced its intention to change the guidance on how to identify a potential ""public charge,"" defined as a noncitizen primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. After this change, immigrants' applications for permanent residence could be denied for using a broader range of safety-net programs. We investigated whether the announced public charge rule affected the share of children enrolled in Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, using county-level data. Results show that a 1-percentage-point increase in a county's noncitizen share was associated with a 0.1-percentage-point reduction in child Medicaid use. Applied nationwide, this implies a decline in coverage of 260,000 children. The public charge rule was adopted in February 2020, just before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began in the US.

Although several reports have described blind techniques for post-pyloric feeding-tube placement, no general consensus about method preference has been achieved. MATERIALS AND METHODS The technique is performed as follows: via the nostril, a stylet-tipped feeding tube is advanced about 70 cm; to confirm tip location to the right of the epigastric area, towards the right hypochondriac region, 5 mL shots of air are injected to enable touch detection of bubbling; finally, the tube is advanced to a length of 100 cm, during which the strength of bubbling seems to diminish under palpation. RESULTS We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients whose oral intake was expected to be difficult for 48 hours in the intensive care unit. Forty-one patients were enrolled and the rate of successful placement at first attempt was 95.1%. Mean duration for successful placement was 15 minutes. CONCLUSIONS With a novel technique, from the bedside, without special tools or drugs, we successfully placed post-pyloric feeding tubes. Essential points when inserting the tube are confirmation of the location of the tube tip by palpation of injected air, and to avoid deflection and looping.","Kohata, Hisakazu; Okuda, Nao; Nakataki, Emiko; Itagaki, Taiga; Onodera, Mutsuo; Imanaka, Hideaki; Nishimura, Masaji",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2013.06.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24018178/,57

Furthermore, an exaggerated cardiovascular response with persistently raised blood pressure during hospitalization seems independently associated with in-hospital all-cause mortality, intensive care unit admission and heart failure. However, the real burden of elevated blood pressure during the acute phase of COVID-19 remains undefined. AREAS COVERED The authors review the available evidence on the pharmacotherapy for the treatment of acute elevations in BP (including hypertensive urgency and emergency) in COVID-19 patients. EXPERT OPINION Acute elevations in blood pressure and unstable in-hospital blood pressure may be associated with organ damage and worse outcome in patients with COVID-19. In this setting, hypertensive emergencies require immediate reduction in BP through intravenous treatment according to specific features and goals. Conversely, hypertensive urgencies usually require solely oral treatment. Diuretics, beta-blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers may be of benefit in treating COVID-19 patients with elevated blood pressure values.","Angeli, Fabio; Verdecchia, Paolo; Reboldi, Gianpaolo",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2021.1990264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634987/,57

Hepsin is a type II transmembrane serine protease highly expressed in the liver. Recent studies indicate that hepsin activates pro-hepatocyte growth factor in the liver to enhance Met signaling, thereby regulating glucose, lipid and protein metabolism. In addition, hepsin functions in non-hepatic tissues, including the adipose tissue, kidney, and inner ear, to regulate adipocyte differentiation, urinary protein processing, and auditory function, respectively. In mouse models, hepsin deficiency lowers blood glucose, lipid and protein levels, impairs uromodulin assembly in renal epithelial cells, and causes hearing loss. Elevated hepsin expression has also been found in many cancers. As a type II transmembrane protease, cell surface expression and zymogen activation are essential for hepsin activity.

The marked weight gain that characterizes this disorder appears to result from impaired sympathoadrenal activation, parasympathetic dysregulation, and other hormonal and hypothalamic disturbances that upset the balance between energy intake and expenditure. Given hypopituitarism is commonly present, careful management of hormonal deficits is important for weight control in these patients. In addition, diet, exercise, and pharmacotherapy aimed at augmenting sympathetic output, controlling hyperinsulinism, and promoting weight loss have been used to treat this disease, but these measures rarely lead to sustained weight loss. While surgical interventions have not routinely been pursued, emerging data suggests that surgical weight loss interventions including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can be safely and effectively used for the management of hypothalamic obesity in patients with craniopharyngioma.","Page-Wilson, Gabrielle; Wardlaw, Sharon L; Khandji, Alexander G; Korner, Judith",Pituitary,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11102-011-0349-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21935755/,57

91927,"Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Novel C5-Modified Pyrimidine Ribofuranonucleosides as Potential Antitumor or/and Antiviral Agents.",2019,"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to develop an auto-planning platform to be interfaced with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS). The main goal was to obtain robust and high-quality plans for different anatomic sites and various dosimetric requirements. METHODS Monaco (Elekta, St. Louis, US) was the TPS in this work. All input parameters for inverse planning could be defined in a plan template inside Monaco. A software tool called Robot Framework was used to launch auto-planning trials with updated plan templates. The template modifier external to Monaco was the major component of our auto-planning platform. For current implementation, it was a rule-based system that mimics the trial-and-error process of an experienced planner. A template was automatically updated by changing the optimization constraints based on dosimetric evaluation of the plan obtained in the previous trial, along with the data of the iterative optimization extracted from Monaco. Treatment plans generated by Monaco with all plan evaluation criteria satisfied were considered acceptable, and such plans would be saved for further evaluation by clinicians. The auto-planning platform was validated for 10 prostate and 10 head-and-neck cases in comparison with clinical plans generated by experienced planners. RESULTS The performance and robustness of our auto-planning platform was tested with clinical cases of prostate and head and neck treatment. For prostate cases, automatically generated plans had very similar plan quality with the clinical plans, and the bladder volume receiving 62.5 Gy, 50 Gy, and 40 Gy in auto-plans was reduced by 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. For head and neck cases, auto-plans had better conformity with reduced dose to the normal structures but slightly higher dose inhomogeneity in the target volume. Remarkably, the maximum dose in the spinal cord and brain stem was reduced by more than 3.5 Gy in auto-plans. Fluence map optimization only with less than 30 trials was adequate to generate acceptable plans, and subsequent optimization for final plans was completed by Monaco without further intervention. The plan quality was weakly dependent on the parameter selection in the initial template and the choices of the step sizes for changing the constraint values. CONCLUSION An automated planning platform to interface with Monaco was developed, and our reported tests showed preliminary results for prostate and head and neck cases.","Huang, Xiaotian; Quan, Hong; Zhao, Bo; Zhou, Wing; Chen, Charles; Chen, Yan",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.12848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32180351/,57

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, RT-HNC patients were surveyed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression and the Distress Thermometer (DT) for distress. HADS scores were compared with data pre-COVID-19. Additionally, we evaluated the COVID-19 impact on daily routines, treatment, and cancer care through a questionnaire. RESULTS Fifty patients were included. The HADS mean score and estimated rates were 4.34 (± 4.06)/ 22% for anxiety; 5.08 (± 4.82)/ 22% for depression; in comparison, our historical control had 4.04 (± 3.59)/ 20% for anxiety (p=0.79); and 4.03 (± 3.62)/ 17% for depression (p=0.49). Mean DT score was 3.68 (± 2.77). Responders were aware of COVID-19, afraid of having medical complications, believed it was life-threatening, did not miss appointments, believed their treatment was not impacted, and felt safe at the hospital amid the pandemic. CONCLUSION This study suggests that anxiety, depression, and distress levels found in RT-HNC patients did not increase during the pandemic. Patients were afraid of being infected by COVID-19; however, they complied with their cancer treatment.","Rodrigues-Oliveira, Leticia; Kauark-Fontes, Elisa; Alves, Carolina Guimarães Bonfim; Tonaki, Juliana Ono; Gueiros, Luiz Alcino; Moutinho, Karina; Marta, Gustavo Nader; Barros, Luciana Rodrigues Carvalho; Santos-Silva, Alan Roger; Brandão, Thaís Bianca; Prado-Ribeiro, Ana Carolina",Oral diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.13876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853205/,57
93197,Brazilian strain of bovine respiratory coronavirus is derived from dual enteric and respiratory tropism.,2017,"Background: Advances in suture material and geometry have fueled interest in barbed suture tenorrhaphy. Theoretically, barbed suture allows better load distribution, smoother gliding under pulleys, and improved tendon blood flow. Minimal data exist on whether barbed tendon repair may benefit from supplementation by a peripheral stitch. The purpose of this study is to determine whether peripheral suture repair increases gap resistance in both conventional and barbed core repairs, increases maximum tensile strength, and fails before or after the core repair. Methods: Porcine flexor tendons were harvested and assigned randomly into 4 groups of 10 of varying suture constructs (3-0 PDS™ or 3-0 V-Loc 180™ core with or without peripheral 5-0 Vicryl™ repair). Core repairs were performed using a modified 4-strand cruciate repair. A servohydrolic tester was used for biomechanical testing of linear 2-mm gap resistance and maximum tensile strength. Results: Peripheral repair improved 2-mm gap resistance in all repairs, regardless of core suture type, conventional (173% increase) or barbed (204% increase). No change in the maximum tensile strength was found in either core suture type with peripheral repair. Peripheral repairs always failed before core repairs, at a significantly higher load of 74.2 ± 20.4 N in barbed versus 57.8 ± 12.2 N (P = .04) in conventional core repairs. Conclusions: The addition of peripheral repair improved gap resistance but not ultimate tensile strength in both conventional and barbed flexor tendon repairs in linear testing. The 4-strand cruciate flexor tendon repairs using barbed suture may require peripheral repair to withstand physiologic loads, as core repair alone using barbed suture was insufficient.","Sull, Alan; Inceoglu, Serkan; Wongworawat, Montri D",Hand,https://doi.org/10.1177/1558944715628000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28149218/,57

96025,"Isolation, characterization, and functional analysis of ferret lymphatic endothelial cells.",2015,"OBJECTIVES The study tried to determine if malnutrition (underweight, stunting, wasting, overweight) and enamel defects (enamel hypoplasia, hypomineralized second molar, amelogenesis imperfecta, fluorosis) were associated with early childhood caries (ECC). The study also examined whether malnutrition was associated with the presence of enamel defects in 0-5-year-old children. METHODS The study was a secondary analysis of primary data of a cross-sectional study assessing the association between maternal psychosocial health and ECC in sub-urban Nigerian population collected in December 2018 and January 2019. One hundred and fifty nine children were recruited. Exploratory variables were malnutrition and enamel defects. The outcome variables were the prevalence of ECC in 0-2-year-old, 3-5-year-old, and 0-5-year-old children. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the associations, and socioeconomic status, oral hygiene status, and frequency of in-between-meals sugar consumption were adjusted for. The adjusted prevalence ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p values were calculated. RESULTS The prevalence of ECC was 2.1% in 0-2-year-old children and 4.9% in 3-5-year-old children. In adjusted models, underweight, stunting, and wasting/overweight were not significant risk indicators for ECC in either age group. 0-2-year-old children who had amelogenesis imperfecta (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. 3-5-year-old children who had hypoplasia (p = 0.004), amelogenesis imperfecta (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. 0-5-year-old children with hypoplasia (p<0.001) and fluorosis (p<0.001) were more likely to have ECC than were children who did not have these lesions. There were significant associations between various types of malnutrition and various types of enamel defects. CONCLUSION Although different types of malnutrition were associated with enamel defects, and enamel defects were associated with ECC, malnutrition was not associated with ECC. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between malnutrition and genetically and toxin-induced enamel defects.","Folayan, Morenike Oluwatoyin; El Tantawi, Maha; Oginni, Ayodeji Babatunde; Alade, Michael; Adeniyi, Abiola; Finlayson, Tracy L",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609719/,57
96030,A Coronavirus E Protein Is Present in Two Distinct Pools with Different Effects on Assembly and the Secretory Pathway.,2015,"BACKGROUND Stress is a complex condition that can have a profound effect on an individual's sense of wellbeing and their ability to live a happy and healthy life. COVID-19 and its associated stressors have the potential to disrupt numerous facets of our everyday lives. Pregnant and postpartum women are especially vulnerable to changes in the availability of routine health and social care services and of their support networks. The current study sought to explore stress levels and their influencers among an international cohort of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We conducted an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey in 64 countries between May and June 2020. The survey was hosted on the Pregistry platform and made available in 12 languages, with respondents sought through a variety of social media platforms and parenting forums. In addition to levels of stress, we collected data related to demographics, COVID-19 exposure and worries, lifestyle changes, traditional and social media use, precautionary measures related to COVID-19, and mental health. RESULTS In total, 7185 women were included in our sample. We found statistically significant (p-value <0.05) reductions in stress score among older women (≥35 years of age), those either living with a partner or married, those who had graduated from college, and those with medical coverage. Higher stress scores were found among women who resided in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East, and North America compared with those in Europe. When race and ethnicity were included in the model, black women were found to have higher stress compared to white women. Level of family and community support was inversely associated with level of stress. CONCLUSION Our study is one of the first to explore stress levels among pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found statistically significant differences in stress levels by age, education, marital status, region of residence, race/ethnicity and level of support. Understanding stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and exploring ways to address it, will be key to contributing to the mental and physical health of expectant and new mothers, as well as their children, in both the short and long term.","Wyszynski, Diego F; Hernandez-Diaz, Sonia; Gordon-Dseagu, Vanessa; Ramiro, Noemi; Koenen, Karestan C","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1936489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157929/,57

Research concerning the role of children in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and investigating the clinical effects of infection in children, has been vital. This paper describes the publication trend for pertinent scientific literature relating to COVID-19 in children during the first 6 months of the pandemic. METHODS A comprehensive search of preprint and published literature was conducted daily across four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid-Embase and MedRXiv) between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020. Titles and abstracts were screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. FINDINGS Over the study period, a total of 45 453 papers were retrieved, of which 476 met our inclusion criteria. The cumulative number of children described in included publications totalled (at most) 41 396. The median number of children per paper was 6 (IQR 1-33). Nearly one-third of papers (30.2%) reported on a single child, and a further 28.3% reported on between 1 and 9 children. Half of all the publications originated from Asia. INTERPRETATION Our prospective bibliographic analysis of paediatric COVID-19 publications demonstrated a steady increase in the number of papers over time. Understanding and policy evolved with new information that was gathered over the course of the study period. However, over half of publications were individual case reports or small case series, which may have had a limited contribution to advancement of knowledge. During a pandemic, literature should be interpreted with great caution, and clinical/policy decisions should be continually reviewed in light of emerging evidence.","Stilwell, Philippa Anna; Munro, Alasdair P S; Basatemur, Emre; Talawila Da Camara, Nishanthi; Harwood, Rachel; Roland, Damian",Archives of disease in childhood,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2021-321751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958347/,57

However, dynamic and timely investigations of collateral blood flow and collateral restoration in whole brains of living animals have rarely been reported. Methods: Using multiple modalities of imaging, including synchrotron radiation angiography, laser speckle imaging, and micro-CT imaging, we dynamically explored collateral circulation throughout the whole brain in the rodent middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Results: We demonstrated that compared to control animals, 4 neocollaterals gradually formed between the intra- and extra-arteries in the skull base of model animals after occlusion (p<0.05). Two main collaterals were critical to the supply of blood from the posterior to the middle cerebral artery territory in the deep brain (p<0.05). Abundant small vessel and capillary anastomoses were detected on the surface of the cortex between the posterior and middle cerebral artery and between the anterior and middle cerebral artery (p<0.05). Collateral perfusion occurred immediately (≈15 min) and was maintained for up to 14 days after occlusion. Further study revealed that administration of rapamycin at 15 min after MCAO dilated the existing collateral vessels and promoted collateral perfusion. Principal conclusions: Our results provide evidence of collateral functional perfusion in the skull base, deep brain, and surface of the cortex. Rapamycin was capable of enlarging the diameter of collaterals, potentially extending the time window for ischemic stroke therapy.","Wang, Jixian; Lin, Xiaojie; Mu, Zhihao; Shen, Fanxia; Zhang, Linyuan; Xie, Qing; Tang, Yaohui; Wang, Yongting; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Theranostics,https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.32676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410191/,57

This study constructs an integrated model to investigate the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control (LOC) and objective peer effects. Methods Residential college students (n = 494) were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese university. An item from the World Value Survey was employed to measure internal LOC, while objective peer effects were assessed via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured using Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis and logit regression were combined to estimate various factors' effects on PIU. Results In our sample, the prevalence rate of PIU was 30.6%, and while internal LOC was a protective factor for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree performed contrasting roles on PIU under various network conditions. It acted as a protective factor when exposed to a low prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became a risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective efficacy of betweenness was activated when individuals had more than one PIU friend. Discussion and conclusions Further intervention studies focusing on individuals with a weak internal LOC are recommended during the lockdown. Additionally, interventions that consider the network structures carefully, may enhance the prevention of PIU.","Xia, Yiwei; Fan, Yanying; Liu, Tzu-Hsuan; Ma, Zhihao",Journal of behavioral addictions,https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2021.00028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019485/,57

Currently used nonsurgical treatment modalities have limited effectiveness and usually require several treatment sessions. OBJECTIVE To evaluate effectiveness and safety of a novel endoscopic device for nonsurgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING Single center. PATIENTS This study involved 23 patients with actively bleeding internal hemorrhoids. INTERVENTION The HET Bipolar System is a modified anoscope, with a treatment window, light source, and tissue temperature monitor. The device is inserted into the rectum under direct observation. The tissue carrying superior hemorrhoidal branches and the apex of the internal hemorrhoid is positioned inside the treatment window, clamped with incorporated tissue forceps, and treated with bipolar energy to ligate hemorrhoidal feeding vessels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Rate of hemorrhoidal bleeding after the treatment. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 64.3 ± 9.9 years (range 44-79 years). Eleven patients (47.8%) had grade I hemorrhoids and 12 patients (52.2%) had grade II hemorrhoids. In 18 patients (78.3%), treatment with the HET System was performed with the patient under conscious sedation. Five patients (21.7%) were treated without sedation. All patients tolerated treatment without complaints. The average follow-up period was 11.2 ± 4.7 months. No bleeding or prolapse occurred after the procedure in any of the treated patients.

In addition, much higher recurrence rates are reported after standard surgical treatment of hiatal hernia in morbidly obese patients. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is an effective surgical treatment for morbid obesity and is known to effectively control symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). CASE PRESENTATION Two patients suffering from giant hiatal hernias where a combined LRYGB and hiatal hernia repair (HHR) with mesh was performed are presented in this paper. There were no postoperative complications and at 1 year follow-up, there was no sign of recurrence of the hernia. DISCUSSION The gold standard for all symptomatic reflux patients is still surgical correction of the paraesophageal hernia, including complete reduction of the hernia sac, resection of the sac, hiatal closure and fundoplication. However, HHR outcome is adversely affected by higher BMI levels, leading to increased HH recurrence rates in the obese. CONCLUSION Concomitant giant hiatal hernia repair with LRYGB appears to be safe and feasible.

METHODS This is a retrospective study of 9 lesions of 8 patients with histopathologically proven PEH RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis of PEH was 31 years (median 31 years; range 12 to 62 years). The lesion was unilateral in 7 (88%) patients and bilateral in one (12%). Two patients (25%) had xeroderma pigmentosum, who also had a history of prior surgical intervention in the same eye for conjunctival tumor excision. Referral diagnosis was ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in all cases. Ocular surface mass (n = 4, 44%) was the most common presenting complaint. The mean duration of symptoms was 18 months (median 3 months; range < 1 to 84 months). All lesions were perilimbal, and the mean basal diameter of the tumor was 7 mm (median 6 mm; range 4 to 12 mm). Clinical diagnosis included OSSN (n = 5; 56%), PEH (n = 3; 33%), or leiomyosarcoma (n = 1; 11%). AS-OCT features included irregular hyperreflective epithelium, epithelial dipping, and subepithelial hyperreflective lesion with posterior shadowing in all cases. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of PEH in all cases. The underlying cause of PEH in these cases included vernal keratoconjunctivitis (n = 4; 44%), idiopathic severe blepharitis (n = 2; 22%), or prior surgical intervention (n = 2; 22%). No apparent cause could be determined in one eye (11%). CONCLUSION Ocular surface PEH is a close mimicker of OSSN. Careful history-taking, clinical examination, and characteristic AS-OCT features aid in accurate diagnosis.","Kaliki, Swathi; Maniar, Arpita; Jakati, Saumya; Mishra, Dilip K",International ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-020-01558-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839863/,57

The procedure comprises of apoptosis and pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a programmed procedure for cell death which is inflammatory in nature and this pathway gets activated via human caspase-4, human caspase-11 and human caspase-5. The activation of this process leads to release of pro-inflammatory mediators including cytokines, alarmins, IL-18 and IL-1β. The pro-inflammatory mediators released via interaction of intracellular kinases direct the development of Rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized as disorder/disease that is auto-immune and chronic in nature. It involves erosions in marginal bone along with articular cartilage which is responsible for joint destruction. The cytokine along with its complex network is responsible for inflammation. The process of pyroptosis is linked with the destruction of plasma membrane, that releases these mediators and excessive release of these mediators is linked with rheumatoid arthritis.","Chadha, Swati; Behl, Tapan; Bungau, Simona; Kumar, Arun; Arora, Rashmi; Gupta, Amit; Uddin, Md Sahab; Zengin, Gokhan; Aleya, Lotfi; Setia, Dhruv; Arora, Sandeep",Current research in translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.retram.2020.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830085/,57
105571,Update on Proteomic approaches to uncovering virus-induced protein alterations and virus-host protein interactions during the progression of viral infection.,2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND Currently, patients with gross total resection (GTR) of recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) undergo adjuvant chemotherapy or are followed up until progression. Re-irradiation, as one of the most effective treatments in macroscopic rGBM, is withheld in this situation, as uncertainties about the pattern of re-recurrence, the target volume, and also the efficacy of early re-irradiation after GTR exist. METHODS Imaging and clinical data from 26 consecutive patients with GTR of rGBM were analyzed. The spatial pattern of recurrences was analyzed according to the RANO-HGG criteria (""response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria for high-grade gliomas""). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Furthermore, a systematic review was performed in PubMed. RESULTS All but 4 patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy after GTR. Progression was diagnosed in 20 of 26 patients and 70% of recurrent tumors occurred adjacent to the resection cavity. The median extension beyond the edge of the resection cavity was 20 mm. Median PFS was 6 months; OS was 12.8 months. We propose a target volume containing the resection cavity and every contrast enhancing lesion as the gross tumor volume (GTV), a spherical margin of 5-10 mm to generate the clinical target volume (CTV), and a margin of 1-3 mm to generate the planning target volume (PTV). Re-irradiation of this volume is deemed to be safe and likely to prolong PFS. CONCLUSION Re-irradiation is worth considering also after GTR, as the volumes that need to be treated are limited and re-irradiation has already proven to be a safe treatment option in general. The strategy of early re-irradiation is currently being tested within the GlioCave/NOA 17/Aro 2016/03 trial.","Straube, Christoph; Elpula, Greeshma; Gempt, Jens; Gerhardt, Julia; Bette, Stefanie; Zimmer, Claus; Schmidt-Graf, Friederike; Meyer, Bernhard; Combs, Stephanie E",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

105576,Identification of cellular proteome modifications in response to West Nile virus infection.,2009,"The mechanisms of [8 + 2] cycloaddition reactions between dienylfurans/dienylisobenzofurans and the activated alkyne, DMAD (dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate), have been investigated by DFT calculations. The former [8 + 2] reaction is stepwise, starting from attack of the diene substituent on furan, not the furyl moiety in dienylfurans, to DMAD to give a diradical intermediate, which then undergoes ring closure to form the second bond between DMAD and the furan moiety, generating the final [8 + 2] cycloadducts. In contrast, the latter [8 + 2] reaction starts from [4 + 2] cycloaddition of the diene in the furan ring of dienylisobenzofurans toward DMAD, followed by the rate-determining stepwise [1,5]-vinyl shift, forming the [8 + 2] products. The different mechanisms of [8 + 2] reactions are attributed to the facts that for dienylfurans, the reactive diene part is the diene substituent on furan, but in the case of dienylisobenzofurans, it is the diene in the furan ring (its reaction with DMAD to generate an aromatic benzene ring is the driving force for this regiochemistry). Consequently, the [8 + 2] reactions begin with the reaction of the most reactive part of tetraene (either the diene substituent on furan for dienylfurans or the diene in the furan ring for dienylisobenzofurans) with DMAD. FMO analysis and kinetic study have been carried out to gain more information of the reaction mechanisms. Two [8 + 2] reactions of dienylisobenzofurans with different substituents toward DMAD have also been further analyzed by DFT calculations in this paper.","Cui, Qi; Chen, Yuanyuan; Herndon, James W; Yu, Zhi-Xiang",The Journal of organic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c01960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399448/,57
105868,TRIM56 is an essential component of the TLR3 antiviral signaling pathway.,2012,"Background Childhood maltreatment (CM) significantly increases the risk of adulthood psychopathology. Interplay between susceptible genetic variations and CM contributes to the occurrence of depression. This review aims to systematically synthesize the relationships between genetic variations and depression among those exposed to CM. Methods Electronic databases and gray literature to March 31st, 2020 were searched for literature on the topic of depression and CM limited to English-language. Data extraction and quality assessment of key study characteristics were conducted. Qualitative approaches were used to synthesize the findings. Results The initial search resulted in 9185 articles. A total of 29 articles that met the eligibility criteria were included in this review. High heterogeneity was identified regarding the study sample ages, candidate genes and SNPs, the categorization of CM and depression. The findings of this review include several frequently studied genes (5-HTTLPR, CRHR1, BDNF, CREB1, FKBP5, IL1B, NTRK2, and OXTR). Both consistent and inconsistent findings were identified. Overall, the interplay of CM with CREB1-rs2253206 significantly increased the risk of depression. In contrast, CRHR1-TCA haplotype (rs7209436, rs4792887, rs110402), CRHR1-rs17689882, and CRHR1-rs110402 showed protective effects on depression and depressive symptoms among individuals with a history of maltreatment. Limitations Due to clinical and methodological diversity of the studies a qualitative approach was used. Conclusion This review firstly provides a comprehensive overview of the interplay between CM and genetic variations in adult depression. Future etiological explorations should focus on the above-identified genes for down-stream exploration and address the issues and challenges of gene by environment studies.","Li, Muzi; Liu, Sibei; D'Arcy, Carl; Gao, Tingting; Meng, Xiangfei",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697690/,57

We would like to compare the quality of life (QOL) and long-term defecative function between these two groups of patients 10 years after reconstructive surgery. METHODS Patients who underwent LAARP between 2001 and 2005 were compared with historical controls treated with PSARP between 1996 and 2000. Degrees of continence were graded by the Krickenbeck classification and Kelly's score. QOL was assessed by Hirschsprung's disease/Anorectal Malformation Quality of Life (HAQL) questionnaire. Results were compared using Chi-square test and t test. RESULTS There were 14 LAARP and 7 PSARP patients. All attained voluntary bowel movements. Moderate to severe soiling (Krickenbeck Grade 2 and 3) was found in 3/14 LAARP (21.4%) and 1/7 PSARP (14.3%) patients, p = 1.00. Constipation requiring use of laxatives was present in 3/14 LAARP (28.6%) and 1/7 PSARP (14.3%) patients, p = 0.62. Mean Kelly's scores were 3.79 ± 0.98 (LAARP) and 4.71 ± 1.25 (PSARP), p = 0.12. No patient required Malone antegrade continence enema (MACE). The QOL scores based on the HAQL questionnaire were comparable between the two groups in all areas except social functioning, in which the LAARP patients attained a significantly lower mean score (26.4 vs 71.7, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION The 10-year outcome between LAARP and PSARP patients in terms of QOL and defecative function is comparable. Impairment in social functioning in these patients is reflected by the self-reported lower level of functioning.","Wong, C W Y; Chung, P H Y; Tam, P K H; Wong, K K Y",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-019-04606-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31848691/,57

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To describe family involvement, communication practices and visiting policies in adult ICUs. DESIGN A cross-sectional survey. METHOD A questionnaire consisting of 11 sections was developed, pilot tested and e-mailed to 196 ICUs. The participants were intensive care nurses in adult ICUs in four Nordic countries. RESULTS The survey was conducted in October to December 2019. The response rate was 81% (158/196) of the invited ICUs. Most of the units had fewer than 11 beds. Family participation in patient care, including involvement in ward rounds and presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, varied between the countries, whereas most families in all countries were involved in decision-making. Family conferences were generally initiated by staff or family members. Children under 18 did not always receive information directly from the staff, and parents were not advised about how to inform their children. Although most respondents described open visiting, restrictions were also mentioned in free-text comments. CONCLUSIONS The level of family care in ICUs in the four Nordic countries is generally based on nurses' discretion. Although most Nordic ICUs report having an open or flexible visiting policy, a wide range of potential restrictions still exists. Children and young relatives are not routinely followed up. Family members are included in communication and decision-making, whereas family involvement in daily care, ward rounds and family-witnessed resuscitation seem to be areas with a potential for improvement.","Frivold, Gro; Ågård, Anne Sophie; Jensen, Hanne Irene; Åkerman, Eva; Fossum, Mariann; Alfheim, Hanne Birgit; Rasi, Matias; Lind, Ranveig",Nursing in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1111/nicc.12702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34405494/,57

An often-overlooked capability of this approach is the opportunity to examine the electronic evolution of a chemical system. For AIMD trajectories based on Hartree-Fock or density functional theory methods, the real-time evolution of single-particle molecular orbitals (MOs) can provide detailed insights into the time-dependent electronic structure of molecules. The evolving electronic Hamiltonians at each MD step pose problems for tracking and visualizing a given MO's character, ordering, and associated phase throughout an MD trajectory, however. This report presents and assesses a simple algorithm for correcting these deficiencies by exploiting similarity projections of the electronic structure between neighboring MD steps. Two aspects bring this analysis beyond a simple step-to-step projection scheme. First, the challenging case of coincidental orbital degeneracies is resolved via a quadrupole-field perturbation that nonetheless rigorously preserves energy conservation. Second, the resulting orbitals are shown to evolve adiabatically, in spite of the ""preservation of character"" concept that undergirds a projection of neighboring steps' MOs. The method is tested on water clusters, which exhibit considerable dynamic degeneracies, as well as a classic organic nucleophilic substitution reaction, in which the adiabatic evolution of the bonding orbitals clarifies textbook interpretations of the electronic structure during this reactive collision.","Zhanserkeev, Asylbek A; Talbot, Justin J; Steele, Ryan P",Journal of chemical theory and computation,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323487/,57

In South Africa, the flagship National Department of Health MomConnect program was launched in 2014 to strengthen the quality of maternal and child health (MCH) services and improve mortality outcomes. MomConnect was rapidly rolled out with a limited understanding of how and why the program was expected to work even though studies had shown the effectiveness of the MomConnect program in improving the uptake of MCH services. This study aimed to unearth the initial program theory of the MomConnect program based on explicit and implicit assumptions of how the program was organized and expected to work. METHODS We conducted a document analysis using design- and implementation-related documents of the MomConnect program guided by the principles of Theory of Change (ToC) and Realist Evaluation (RE). Content and thematic analysis approaches were deductively applied to analyze the documents toward constructing ToC and RE-informed models. Abductive thinking and retroduction were further applied to the realist-informed approach to link program context, mechanisms, and outcomes to construct the initial program theory. RESULTS ToC and RE-informed models illustrated how the MomConnect program was organized and expected to work. The process of constructing the ToC provided the platform for the development of the initial program theory, which identified three critical elements: (1) the central modalities of the MomConnect program; (2) the intended outcomes; and (3) the tentative causal links indicating, in a stepwise manner of, how the outcomes were intended to be achieved. The RE approach 'enhanced' the causal links by identifying relevant programmatic contexts and linking the postulated mechanisms of action (empowerment, encouragement, motivation, and knowledge acquisition) to program outcomes. CONCLUSION The application of ToC and RE provided an explicitly cumulative approach to knowledge generation in unveiling the initial program theory of MomConnect rather than delivering answers to questions of program effectiveness.","M Kabongo, Eveline; Mukumbang, Ferdinand C; Delobelle, Peter; Nicol, Edward",BMC medical research methodology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01164-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243136/,57

The Mo/Mas that infiltrate the meninges after infection with the neuropathogenic murine coronavirus strain srr7 are an initial target of infection. Furthermore, higher inflammatory responses were observed in gene-manipulated mice lacking α1,3-fucosyltransferase 9, which determines the expression of the Le(x) structure, than in wild type mice after infection. We investigated Le(x) expression using CD11b-positive peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) and found that Le(x) is inducible in Mo/Mas after infection with srr7, especially in the syncytial cells during the late phase of infection. The number of syncytial cells was reduced after treatment of the infected PECs with anti-Le(x) antibody, during the late phase of infection. In addition, the antibody treatment induced a marked reduction in the number of the infected cells at 24 hours post inoculation, without changing the infected cell numbers during the initial phase of infection. These data indicate that the Le(x) structure could play a role in syncytial formation and cell-to-cell infection during the late phase of infection.","Kakizaki, Masatoshi; Togayachi, Akira; Narimatsu, Hisashi; Watanabe, Rihito",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2015.499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902214/,57

Several techniques have been described for choledochotomy closure. AIMS To present our experience and the lessons learned in more than 200 cases of LCBDE. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 1999 and July 2012, 206 patients with common bile duct stones underwent LCBDE. At the beginning of the series, we performed the closure of the CBD over a T-tube (36 patients), subsequently we favoured closure over an antegrade stent (133 patients) but due to a high incidence of acute pancreatitis in the last 16 patients we have performed primary closure. RESULTS The 3 closure groups were matched for age and sex. Jaundice was the most frequent presentation. A total of 185 (88,5%) patients underwent choledochotomy whereas in 17 (8,7%) patients the transcystic route was used. The group that underwent choledochotomy had a larger size of stones compared to the transcystic group (9,7 vs 7,6mm). In the stented group we found an 11,6% incidence of pancreatitis and 26,1% of hyperamylasemia. In the primary closure group we found a clear improvement of complications and hospital stay. The increased experience of the surgeon and age (younger than 75) had a positive impact on mortality and morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Primary closure of the common bile duct after LCBDE seems to be superior to closure over a T tube and stents. The learning curve seems to have a positive impact on the outcomes making it a safe and reproducible technique especially for patients aged under 75.","Abellán Morcillo, Israel; Qurashi, Kamran; Abrisqueta Carrión, Jesús; Martinez Isla, Alberto",Cirugia espanola,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2013.02.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559592/,57

In the subgroup of patients analysed, a state of hypercoagulability and pro thrombosis was observed through laboratory tests, probably related to the cytokine storm syndrome associated with infection by this virus. With that, we discussed the possibility of this finding being an aggravating factor in the occurrence of stroke in these patients.","Oliveira, Isabella B; Pessoa, Mariana Sl; Lima, Carla Fc; Holanda, Jorge Lb; Coimbra, Pablo P de A",The neuroradiology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1971400920987357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33455541/,57

We studied the diagnostic characteristics of two test systems for detecting antibodies to SARS-Cov-2, registered in the Russian Federation. The first test system is a kit for detecting total antibodies to SARS-Cov-2 using immunochemiluminescence analysis on the «Cobas e 411» analyzer («Roche Diagnostics», Germany). The second test system is a kit for detecting IgM and IgG to SARS-Cov-2 («Core Technology Co., Ltd», China) by immunochromatographic analysis. The biological material for the study was blood serum. We assessed: diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, and predictive value of positive and negative results. In the test system for detecting total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, using an IHLA, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 100%; the predictive value of positive and negative results was 100%. In the test system for the detection of IgM and IgG to Sars-CoV-2, using IHA, diagnostic sensitivity for IgM and IgG were 100%; diagnostic specificity for IgM - 60%, for IgG - 72%; predictive value of a positive result for IgM - 60%, IgG - 68,18%; predictive value of negative results for IgM and IgG - 100%. The best diagnostic characteristics were found in the test system for the detection of total antibodies to SARS-Cov-2, which must be taken into account when deciding whether to purchase test systems for the detection of antibodies to SARS-Cov-2.","Petrova, O V; Tverdokhlebova, D K; Murygina, O I; Smeltsova, E V; Nikulina, D M",Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,https://doi.org/10.51620/0869-2084-2021-66-4-210-212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878241/,57

The fulfillment of this wide potential can present challenges in courses that are part of an integrated curriculum and shorter than traditional courses. This new reality, together with students' increasing concern about the stresses within medical education, led to efforts at Harvard Medical School to implement practical steps towards an optimal learning environment in anatomy. These were based on core elements of ethical anatomy education and principles of trauma-informed care. Anatomy is conceptualized here as the ""first clinical discipline,"" with relational interactions between anatomical educators, medical students and body donors/patients. Essential prerequisites for the implementation of this work were support by the medical school leadership, open partnership between engaged students and faculty, faculty coordination and peer-teaching. Specific interventions included pre-course faculty development on course philosophy and invitations to students to share their thoughts on anatomy. Student responses were integrated in course introductions, combined with a pre-dissection laboratory visit, an introductory guide, and a module on the history and ethics of anatomy. During the course, team-building activities were scheduled, and self-reflection encouraged e.g., through written exercises, and elective life-body drawing. Students' responses to the interventions were overall positive, but need further evaluation. This first attempt of a systematic implementation of an optimal learning environment in anatomy led to the identification of areas in need of adjustment.","McDaniel, Katherine G; Brown, Taylor; Radford, Caitlin C; McDermott, Cynthia H; van Houten, Trudy; Katz, Martha E; Stearns, Dana A; Hildebrandt, Sabine",Anatomical sciences education,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657538/,57

We hypothesised that criteria for inflammation and cell death would predict this type of CS. METHODS We analysed 513 hospitalised patients who were positive for COVID-19 reverse transcriptase PCR and for ground-glass opacity by chest high-resolution CT. To achieve an early diagnosis, we analysed the laboratory results of the first 7 days of hospitalisation. We implemented logistic regression and principal component analysis to determine the predictive criteria. We used a 'genetic algorithm' to derive the cut-offs for each laboratory result. We validated the criteria with a second cohort of 258 patients. RESULTS We found that the criteria for macrophage activation syndrome, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and the HScore did not identify the COVID-19 cytokine storm (COVID-CS). We developed new predictive criteria, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, comprising three clusters of laboratory results that involve (1) inflammation, (2) cell death and tissue damage, and (3) prerenal electrolyte imbalance. The criteria identified patients with longer hospitalisation and increased mortality. These results highlight the relevance of hyperinflammation and tissue damage in the COVID-CS. CONCLUSIONS We propose new early predictive criteria to identify the CS occurring in patients with COVID-19. The criteria can be readily used in clinical practice to determine the need for an early therapeutic regimen, block the hyperimmune response and possibly decrease mortality.","Caricchio, Roberto; Gallucci, Marcello; Dass, Chandra; Zhang, Xinyan; Gallucci, Stefania; Fleece, David; Bromberg, Michael; Criner, Gerard J",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-218323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978237/,57

Their natural history seems to be more aggressive. Most traumatic aneurysms have complex shape, tending to have a large neck or even a fusiform morphology. CASE REPORT We present a case of a traumatic carotid artery aneurysm in a 9-year-old girl that was successfully treated with pipeline embolization device. DISCUSSION Due to its dissecting nature, wall friability and lack of a substantial neck can make surgical clipping and selective coiling difficult and risky. Although endovascular parent artery occlusion is the best approach in the acute phase, in some situations it is not possible or very risky. In such scenario the use of flow diverter devices would be an alternative approach. Additionally, we discuss the potential advantages and risks of flow diverter deployment inside a developing vessel.","Trivelato, Felipe Padovani; Rezende, Marco Túlio Salles; Fonseca, Luiz Venâncio; Bonadio, Lucas Eduardo; Ulhôa, Alexandre Cordeiro; Abud, Daniel Giansante",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-016-3334-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28064352/,57

Secondary injuries are associated with edema, inflammation, excessive cytokine release, excitotoxicity and cell apoptosis. 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid (DLA) is one of the major water-soluble components of chemical constituents from Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM). To investigate the inhibition effects of DLA on secondary injury of SCI, focusing especially on suppression of inflammatory responses and the mechanism of this effect, the following studies were performed: Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores to assess motor functions till 10 days after SCI; Nissl and Fast Blue histological staining and immunohistochemistry of inhibitory-kappa B-alpha (IκB-α) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit protein; levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analysis as an indicator of polymorphonuclear infiltration; IL-6 production in plasma 10 days after SCI; Western blot analysis to determine cytoplasm levels of IκB-α and NF-κB p65 subunit proteins in the nuclear fractions 10 days after SCI. DLA significantly attenuated the motor function and tissue damage following SCI in rats, significant reduced polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and IL-6 production, as well as reduced cytoplasm IκB-α degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit protein after SCI. In conclusion, the results clearly demonstrate that DLA inhibit the inflammation responses induced by SCI via inhibiting effect of production of IL-6 and nuclear translocation of NF-κB.","Chen, Xin; Zhou, Changman; Guo, Jun; Sun, Kai; Zhao, Na; Yang, Jiying; Sun, Yu; Liu, Xiaoguang; Hibi, Toshifumi; Liu, Zhongjun; Han, Jingyan",Brain research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.11.089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21134362/,57

DATA SOURCE A 2011-2019 versions of the American Community Survey developed by the University of Minnesota Integrated Public Use Microdata Series program. RESEARCH DESIGN We use difference-in-difference-in-differences (ie, triple difference) regressions to compare changes in the short-run impacts of local unemployment rates before and after the ACA. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Before the ACA, rises in local unemployment were associated with uninsurance due to losses in private coverage (ie, both nongroup and employer sponsored).Following the ACA's full implementation, the link between employment and coverage was attenuated by access to publicly subsidized qualified health plans on the ACA's nongroup market, and enhanced access to Medicaid in states that expanded. Our findings suggest protections from unemployment-linked uninsured spells are largest in states that expanded Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS Expanded access to coverage under the ACA could mitigate the adverse effects on insurance status and access to care historically linked to job loss. However, should the ACA be repealed, many households stand to lose their ability to turn to Medicaid or subsidized nongroup coverage as safety-net resources to offset the burdens of job loss.","Benitez, Joseph; Williams, Timothy; Goldstein, Evan; Seiber, Eric E",Medical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310457/,57

Objective To assess whether conscious sedation is superior to general anesthesia for early neurological improvement among patients receiving stroke thrombectomy. Design, Setting, and Participants SIESTA (Sedation vs Intubation for Endovascular Stroke Treatment), a single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label treatment trial with blinded outcome evaluation conducted at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany (April 2014-February 2016) included 150 patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation, higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (>10), and isolated/combined occlusion at any level of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery. Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to an intubated general anesthesia group (n = 73) or a nonintubated conscious sedation group (n = 77) during stroke thrombectomy. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was early neurological improvement on the NIHSS after 24 hours (0-42 [none to most severe neurological deficits; a 4-point difference considered clinically relevant]). Secondary outcomes were functional outcome by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 3 months (0-6 [symptom free to dead]), mortality, and peri-interventional parameters of feasibility and safety. Results Among 150 patients (60 women [40%]; mean age, 71.5 years; median NIHSS score, 17), primary outcome was not significantly different between the general anesthesia group (mean NIHSS score, 16.8 at admission vs 13.6 after 24 hours; difference, -3.2 points [95% CI, -5.6 to -0.8]) vs the conscious sedation group (mean NIHSS score, 17.2 at admission vs 13.6 after 24 hour; difference, -3.6 points [95% CI, -5.5 to -1.7]); mean difference between groups, -0.4 (95% CI, -3.4 to 2.7; P = .82). Of 47 prespecified secondary outcomes analyzed, 41 showed no significant differences. In the general anesthesia vs the conscious sedation group, substantial patient movement was less frequent (0% vs 9.1%; difference, 9.1%; P = .008), but postinterventional complications were more frequent for hypothermia (32.9% vs 9.1%; P < .001), delayed extubation (49.3% vs 6.5%; P < .001), and pneumonia (13.7% vs 3.9%; P = .03). More patients were functionally independent (unadjusted mRS score, 0 to 2 after 3 months [37.0% in the general anesthesia group vs 18.2% in the conscious sedation group P = .01]). There were no differences in mortality at 3 months (24.7% in both groups). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation undergoing thrombectomy, conscious sedation vs general anesthesia did not result in greater improvement in neurological status at 24 hours. The study findings do not support an advantage for the use of conscious sedation.

114769,Cell-surface phosphatidylserine regulates osteoclast precursor fusion.,2018,"CASE DESCRIPTION An 11-year-old castrated male mixed-breed dog was examined for a 3-month history of hematochezia and tenesmus. Abdominal ultrasonography and rectal examination prior to referral had revealed a colorectal polyp, diagnosed as a benign colorectal polypoid adenoma after histologic examination of tissue samples. The patient was referred for treatment. CLINICAL FINDINGS A 2-cm-diameter sessile polypoid mass was located approximately 6 cm orad to the anus in the right dorsolateral region of the descending colon just caudal to the pubis. There was no evidence of metastasis on thoracic radiography or abdominal ultrasonography. Results of a CBC and serum biochemical analysis were within reference limits. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and snare electrocautery were used to resect the mass and a definitive histopathologic diagnosis of a sessile colorectal polypoid adenoma was made. A 9.9-mm gastroduodenoscope was used during colonoscopy to inspect the mass. To aid in EMR, a 25-gauge endoscopic injection needle was used to infuse sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution under the base of the polyp, into the submucosa to elevate the mucosa from the muscularis layer beneath the polyp prior to polypectomy. This was necessary because of the sessile, rather than pedunculated, base of the mass. The entire polyp was successfully removed with endoscopic guidance. The clinical signs of hematochezia and tenesmus resolved immediately, and serial rectal examinations were performed over the following 36 months with no palpable evidence of recurrence. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The patient described in the present report underwent successful colonic EMR and snare polypectomy with no known evidence of mass recurrence during the following 36 months, suggesting that this minimally invasive procedure may be a valuable treatment option for sessile polyps. The advantage of this technique was that elevation of the mucosa via injection of saline solution improved visibility of the polyp and helped to separate the polyp base from the deeper submucosal colorectal tissue, making complete resection possible.","Coleman, Kristin A; Berent, Allyson C; Weisse, Chick W",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.244.12.1435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871067/,57

We studied the effect of the pandemic on inpatients with diabetic foot problems in a level-one trauma center in Central Ohio. METHODS A retrospective chart review of patients necessitating a consultation by the foot and ankle surgery service were reviewed from the first 8 months of 2020. A total of 270 patients met the inclusion criteria and divided into pre-pandemic (n = 120) and pandemic groups (n = 150). Demographics, medical history, severity of current infection, and medical or surgical management were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The odds of undergoing any level of amputation was 10.8 times higher during the pandemic versus before the pandemic. The risk of major amputations (below-the-knee or higher) likewise increased with an odds ratio of 12.5 among all patients in the foot and ankle service during the pandemic. Of the patients undergoing any amputation, the odds for receiving a major amputation was 3.1 times higher than before the pandemic. Additionally, the severity of infections increased during the pandemic and a larger proportion of the cases were classified as emergent in the pandemic group compared to the pre-pandemic group. CONCLUSIONS The effect of the pandemic on the health-care system has had a deleterious effect on people with diabetes-related foot problems resulting in more severe infections, more emergencies, and necessitating more amputations.

Convalescent plasma may offer treatment, but efficacy and safety are not established. Measuring seroprevalence in donors would inform public health policy. Here, we survey blood services around the world to assess the different research programmes related to COVID-19 planned or in progress. MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood collection services were surveyed in June 2020 to determine whether they were participating in serosurveys or convalescent plasma collection and clinical trials. RESULTS A total of 48 countries (77% of those contacted) responded. Seroprevalence studies are planned or in progress in 73% of countries surveyed and in all continents, including low- and middle-income countries. Most aimed to inform public health policy. Convalescent plasma programmes have been initiated around the globe (79% of surveyed), about three quarters as clinical trials in high-, middle- and low-income countries. CONCLUSION Blood services around the world have drawn upon their operational capacity to provide much-needed seroprevalence data to inform public health. They have rapidly implemented preparation of potential treatment when few treatments are available and mostly as clinical trials. At the same time, they must continue to provide blood products for recipients despite challenges of working in a state of emergency. It is important to track and coordinate research efforts across jurisdictions to gain a composite evidence-based view that will influence future practice and preparative strategies.","O'Brien, Sheila F; Lieshout-Krikke, Ryanne W; Lewin, Antoine; Erikstrup, Christian; Steele, Whitney R; Uzicanin, Samra; Custer, Brian",Vox sanguinis,https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.12995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165917/,57

However, evidence on the effectiveness of this technology for the care of spine surgery patients is limited. In this systematic review the authors aimed to examine the current utilization of TM for spine surgery. METHODS Using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, the authors performed a systematic review of the literature focused on the themes of telemedicine and spine surgery. Included in the search were randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-controlled studies. Two independent reviewers conducted the study appraisal, data abstraction, and quality assessments of the studies. RESULTS Out of 1463 references from the initial search results, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of TM interventions focused on improving perioperative patient communication and patient education by using mobile phone apps, online surveys, or online materials for consent. The studies reported the feasibility of the use of TM for perioperative care and positive user experiences from the patients. CONCLUSIONS The current increase in TM adoption due to the COVID-19 crisis presents an opportunity to further develop and validate this technology.

Understanding the recognition mechanisms of potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NAbs) against the spike protein is pivotal for developing new vaccines and antibody drugs. Here, we isolated several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) from the B cell receptor repertoires of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent. Among these MAbs, the antibody nCoV617 demonstrates the most potent neutralizing activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies against the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transgenic mouse model in vivo. The crystal structure of S-RBD in complex with nCoV617 reveals that nCoV617 mainly binds to the back of the ""ridge"" of RBD and shares limited binding residues with ACE2. Under the background of the S-trimer model, it potentially binds to both ""up"" and ""down"" conformations of S-RBD. In vitro mutagenesis assays show that mutant residues found in the emerging new lineage B.1.1.7 of SARS-CoV-2 do not affect nCoV617 binding to the S-RBD. These results provide a new human-sourced neutralizing antibody against the S-RBD and assist vaccine development. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a serious threat to global health and the economy, so it is necessary to find safe and effective antibody drugs and treatments. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. It contains a variety of dominant neutralizing epitopes and is an important antigen for the development of new coronavirus antibodies. The significance of our research lies in the determination of new epitopes, the discovery of antibodies against RBD, and the evaluation of the antibodies' neutralizing effect. The identified antibodies here may be drug candidates for the development of clinical interventions for SARS-CoV-2.","Yang, Mei; Li, Jiaqi; Huang, Zhaoxia; Li, Heng; Wang, Yueming; Wang, Xiaoli; Kang, Sisi; Huang, Xing; Wu, Changwen; Liu, Tong; Jia, Zhenxing; Liang, Junlang; Yuan, Xiaohui; He, Suhua; Chen, Xiaoxue; Zhou, Zhechong; Chen, Qiuyue; Liu, Siqi; Li, Jing; Zheng, Huiwen; Liu, Xi; Li, Kenan; Yao, Xiaojun; Lang, Bin; Liu, Longding; Liao, Hua-Xin; Chen, Shoudeng",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01352-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643438/,57
118585,Differential inhibition of HIV replication by the 12 interferon-α subtypes.,2021-05-12,"Because salinity of coastal soils is drastically increasing, the application of biochars to saline-alkali soil amendments has attracted considerable attention. Various Solidago-canadensis-L.-derived biochars prepared through pyrolysis from 400 to 600 °C were applied to coastal saline-alkali soil samples to optimise the biochar pyrolysis temperature and investigate its actual ecological responses. All biochars reduced the soil bulk density and exchangeable sodium stress and increased soil water-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, and organic matter content. Principal-component-analysis results showed that pyrolysis temperature played an important role in the potential application of biochars to improve the coastal saline-alkali soil, mainly contributed to ameliorating exchangeable sodium stress and decreasing biochar-soluble toxic compounds. Furthermore, soil bulk density and organic matter, as well as carboxylic acids, phenolic acids and amines of biochar were major driving factors for bacterial community composition. Compared to low-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed below 550 °C), which showed higher toxicity for Brassica chinensis L. growth due to the higher content of carboxylic acids, phenols and amines, high-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed at or above 550 °C) possessed less amounts of these toxic functional groups, more beneficial soil bacteria and healthier for plant growth. Therefore, high-temperature biochar could be applied as an effective soil amendment to ameliorate the coastal saline-alkali soil with acceptable environmental risk.","Tang, Jiawen; Zhang, Shudong; Zhang, Xiaotong; Chen, Jinhuan; He, Xinyu; Zhang, Qiuzhuo",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408208/,57

MATERIALS AND METHODS As part of this cross-sectional study, during the pandemic, between the dates of 11 March 2020-30 June 2020 at Karadeniz Technical University Faculty of Medicine Perinatology Clinic, fetal structural anomaly detected by ultrasonography or with increased risk in screening test in the first and second trimester of high risk pregnancies, who were therefore recommended a prenatal diagnosis test, were defined as the control group and retrospectively compared with high risk pregnancies of the same periods (11 March 2019-30 June 2019) in the previous year. RESULTS A total of 267 cases were evaluated within the scope of the study. The rate of pregnant women undergoing the first and second trimester screening tests was 83% in the control group and 56% for pregnant women in the study group. When the total number of prenatal diagnostic procedures and the year each of the procedures performed are compared, a statistically significant difference was found between the study and control groups (p: .041 and p < .001, respectively). When evaluating the rates of performed prenatal diagnostic procedures during the first patient visit in comparison to years, a statistically significant difference was observed in the A/S group and in the total number of cases (p = .023, p < .001, respectively). Similarly, the rate of performed prenatal diagnostic procedure during the first patient visit and the patient's city of residence was similarly statistically significant from year to year (p < .05).

This scoping review, undertook a systematic literature assessment. Searches were performed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO Web of Science, Cinahl, the Cochrane Library, and in the gray literature (OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and Danish Health and Medicine Authority databases). Publications from 2000 to July 2020 were of interest. Studies were included if they involved the users' own choice of treatment. Included studies: RCT studies, intervention studies, cohort studies and cased based studies. A total of 4320 articles were screened, of which nine were included. The review identified eight studies from the U.S. and one from Canada testing different interventions for people with severe mental illness and diabetes (one diabetes education program, five randomized controlled trials, one retrospective cohort study, one naturalistic intervention program, and one case vignette). The interventions described in the nine articles involved service users, the majority incorporated individualized healthcare plans, and all interventions were based on multidisciplinary teamwork. Research in the area is limited. Care management interventions tend to focus on a single condition, paradoxically excluding severe mental illness during enrollment. Interventions aimed at people with both conditions often prioritize one condition treatment leading to an unbalanced care.","Zabell, Vicki; Rønne, Sabrina Trappaud; Høgsgaard, Ditte; Jørgensen, Rikke; Gaede, Peter Haulund; Arnfred, Sidse Marie",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.14626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152639/,57
120374,Rab33B and its autophagic Atg5/12/16L1 effector assist in hepatitis B virus naked capsid formation and release.,2015,"BACKGROUND Myeloperoxidase-specific ANCA (MPO-ANCA) are implicated in the pathogenesis of vasculitis and GN. Kinins play a major role during acute inflammation by regulating vasodilatation and vascular permeability and by modulating adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Kinin system activation occurs in patients with ANCA vasculitis. Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction. B1R blockade may have potential as a therapy for ANCA GN and vasculitis.","Hu, Peiqi; Su, Hua; Xiao, Hong; Gou, Shen-Ju; Herrera, Carolina A; Alba, Marco A; Kakoki, Masao; Falk, Ronald J; Jennette, J Charles",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2019010032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772138/,57

However, the relationship of initial BT to stroke severity and degree of benefit from thrombolytic therapy has been delineated incompletely. METHODS We analyzed the public data set of the 2 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator (tPA) stroke trials, comparing patients with lower (<37.0°C) and higher (≥37.0°C) presenting BT. RESULTS Among 595 patients (297 placebo and 298 tPA treated) with documented initial BT, 77.1% had initial BT <37.0°C and 22.9% ≥37.0°C. Patients with higher initial BT had lower baseline stroke severity in both tPA-treated patients (the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale median, 11 versus 15; P=0.05) and placebo-treated patients (median, 13 versus 16; P<0.01). Patients with higher initial BT also had lower infarction volume on computed tomography at 3 months in both tPA-treated patients (median, 9.6 versus 16.7 cm(3); P=0.08) and placebo-treated patients (median, 13.1 versus 28.1 cm(3); P=0.02), but no clinical outcome differences. Analysis of lytic treatment effect found no heterogeneity in the degree of tPA benefit in both higher and lower BT groups (≥37.0°C: odds ratio for the modified Rankin Scale 0-1 outcome, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-6.21 and <37.0°C: odds ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-3.84; heterogeneity P=0.83). CONCLUSIONS In patients with hyperacute stroke, higher presenting temperatures are associated with less severe neurological deficits and reduced final infarct volumes.

Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways that continues to impose a substantial clinical burden worldwide. Asthma exacerbations, characterised by an acute deterioration in respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These episodes are most commonly triggered by respiratory virus infections. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations have been the focus of extensive biomedical research. Developing a robust understanding of the interplay between respiratory viruses and the host immune response will be critical for developing more efficacious, targeted therapies for exacerbations. CONCLUSION: There has been significant recent progress in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus-induced airway inflammation in asthma and these advances will underpin the development of future clinical therapies.","Kumar, Kartik; Singanayagam, Aran; Johnston, Sebastian L",Acta medica academica,https://doi.org/10.5644/ama2006-124.292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33189119/,57

Numerous studies have focused on functionalizing NGCs with neurotrophic factors, for example, to support nerve regeneration over longer gaps, but few directly incorporate therapeutic agents. Herein, we fabricated NGCs from a polyanhydride comprised of salicylic acid (SA), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, then performed in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro studies included cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory response, and NGC porosity measurements. To prepare for implantation, type I collagen hydrogels were used as NGC luminal fillers to further enhance the axonal regeneration process. For the in vivo studies, SA-NGCs were implanted in femoral nerves of mice for 16 weeks and evaluated for functional recovery. The SA-based NGCs functioned as both a drug delivery vehicle capable of reducing inflammation and scar tissue formation because of SA release as well as a tissue scaffold that promotes peripheral nerve regeneration and functional recovery.","Lee, Yong S; Griffin, Jeremy; Masand, Shirley N; Shreiber, David I; Uhrich, Kathryn E",Journal of biomedical materials research.

The in-house assay has a high amplification efficiency (0.99), a high analytical sensitivity (200 copies/mL), and a good reproducibility. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the in-house assay were both 100%, due to the monitoring of the armored RV RNA IPC. Therefore, the in-house duplex real time quantitative RT-PCR assay is a specific, sensitive, reproducible and accurate assay for quantitation of RV RNA in clinical specimens.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a self-expanding stent for ischemic AC-ICD. METHODS Eight patients (mean age, 36 years) underwent self-expanding stenting for ischemic AC-ICD. Imaging findings of ischemic AC-ICD, the reason for stenting, and the clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS AC-ICD involved intracranial internal carotid artery to middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 2, intracranial internal carotid artery alone in 3, and MCA alone in 3 patients. Six AC-ICDs showed complete or near occlusions while 2 had a severe degree of stenosis. Six AC-ICDs showed an intimal flap and 3 had intramural hematomas. Six patients underwent emergent stenting for acute stroke within 6 hours (n=2) or crescendo-type stroke within 24 hours (n=4), while 2 patients had stenting for recurrent ischemia on dual antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation after the initial attack. The mean dissection-related stenosis improved from 93.1% to 20.3% after stenting (P<.05). The mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score improved from 7.5 to 1.4 (P<.05). All patients had excellent or favorable outcomes at 3 months: modified Rankin Scale score, 0 in 3, 1 in 3, and 2 in 1 patient(s). No patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage or ischemic symptom recurrence during the clinical follow-up (mean, 27 months). All stented arteries were patent without significant in-stent stenosis on angiographic follow-up (range, 3-12 months). CONCLUSION Self-expanding stents seem to be safe and effective for AC-ICD presenting with acute/crescendo-type stroke or recurrent ischemia despite adequate medication.","Kim, Dong Joon; Kim, Byung Moon; Suh, Sang Hyun; Kim, Dong Ik",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549188/,57

This study aims to identify, describe, and organize the currently available high-quality design evidence concerning mask use during the spread of respiratory viruses and find evidence gaps. Databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), clinical trial registry, gray literature database, and reference lists of articles were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) in April 2020. The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook Version 5.1.0 and the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) tool. A bubble plot was designed to display information in four dimensions. Finally, twenty-one RCTs and nine SRs met our inclusion criteria. Most studies were of ""Low quality"" and focused on healthcare workers. Six RCTs reported adverse effects, with one implying that the cloth masks reuse may increase the infection risk. When comparing masks with usual practice, over 70% RCTs and also SRs showed that masks were ""beneficial"" or ""probably beneficial""; however, when comparing N95 respirators with medical masks, 75% of SRs showed ""no effect"", whereas 50% of RCTs showed ""beneficial effect"". Overall, the current evidence provided by high-quality designs may be insufficient to deal with a second impact of the pandemic. Masks may be effective in interrupting or reducing the spread of respiratory viruses; however, the effect of an N95 respirator or cloth masks versus medical masks is unclear. Additional high-quality studies determining the impact of prolonged mask use on vulnerable populations (such as children and pregnant women), the possible adverse effects (such as skin allergies and shortness of breath) and optimal settings and exposure circumstances for populations to use masks are needed.","Li, Yanfei; Wei, Zhipeng; Zhang, Jingyun; Li, Rui; Li, Huijuan; Cao, Liujiao; Hou, Liangying; Zhang, Weiyi; Chen, Nan; Guo, Kangle; Li, Xiuxia; Yang, Kehu",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-6745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268424/,57

METHOD Descriptive and correlational analyses were used to examine the frequency of past 7-day adherence to each of 10 guidelines, as well as overall adherence. Guided by a disposition-belief-motivation model of health behavior, path analyses tested associations of personality traits and demographic factors to overall adherence via perceived norms, perceived control, attitudes, and self-efficacy related to guideline adherence, as well as perceived exposure risk and perceived health consequence if exposed. RESULTS Adherence ranged from 94.4% reporting always avoiding eating/drinking inside bars/restaurants/food courts to 13.6% reporting always avoiding touching one's face. Modeling showed total associations with overall adherence for greater conscientiousness (β = .191, p < .001), openness (β = .098, p < .05), perceptions of social endorsement (β = .202, p < .001), positive attitudes (β = .105, p < .05), self-efficacy (β = .234, p < .001), and the presence versus absence or uncertainty of a shelter-in-place order (β = .102, p < .01). Age, self-rated health, sex, education, income, children in the household, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, perceived exposure risk, and perceived health consequence showed null-to-negligible associations with overall adherence. CONCLUSIONS The results clarify adherence frequency, highlight characteristics associated with greater adherence, and suggest the need to strengthen the social contract between government and citizenry by clearly communicating adherence benefits, costs, and timelines.

METHODS A feasibility study among South African sexually active women not desiring pregnancy within 1 year, and not using long-acting or injectable contraceptives. At recruitment, we provided five free urine pregnancy tests for self-testing on the first day of each of the next 3 months. We sent monthly text reminders to use the tests with requests for no-cost text replies. Our main outcome was the proportion of participants self-testing within 5 days of the text reminder over three consecutive months. Other outcomes were ease of use of tests, preference for self-testing versus clinic testing, acceptability of routine self-testing (all binary responses followed by open response options) and response to text messages (four-point Likert scale). RESULTS We followed up 71/76 (93%) participants. Two confirmed new pregnancies at the first scheduled test and completed exit interviews, and 64/69 (93%) self-reported completing all three monthly tests. Self-testing was easy to do (66/71, 93%); advantages were convenience (21/71, 30%) and privacy (18/71, 25%), while the main disadvantage was no nurse present to advise (17/71, 24%). Most would recommend monthly testing (70/71, 99%). Text reminders were generally not bothersome (57/71, 80%); 35/69 (51%) participants replied with test results over all three months. CONCLUSION Providing free pregnancy tests to women at risk of late recognition of pregnancy is feasible to strengthen early confirmation of pregnancy status.","Constant, Deborah; Lopes, Sofia; Grossman, Daniel",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2020-201017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972398/,57

Using the life cycle assessment method, we found that DPT for per person per meal emitted 597 g of CO2 and was far more than that of reusable plastic tableware (RPT, 7.00 g), ceramic tableware (9.55 g) and straw tableware (14.6 g). If the demand growth for DPT continues, 416 MT of CO2 will be emitted due to DPT consumption by 2050 globally. We further explored strategies to reduce CO2 emissions by examining the life cycles of four types of tableware according to sensitivity analysis. According to our results, if the recycling rate of DPT reaches 60% at the end-of-life stage, 50% of CO2 emissions can be cut; if dishwashing instead of hand washing is used to clean RPT, ceramic, and straw tableware, approximately 64%, 71%, and 23% of CO2 emissions can be reduced, respectively. If 60% of DPT is replaced by RPT, this plastic tableware will halve carbon emissions. If the rate reaches 100%, carbon emissions will be reduced by 92%. Although the CO2 emissions of the three types of tableware other than DPT are relatively small, RPT will bring other environmental burdens and human health risks, ceramic tableware is bulky and its additives are toxic. Straw tableware combines practical and safety performance. The results show that the choice of straw tableware plays a significant role in curbing the greenhouse effect without compromising consumer safety.","Sun, Qing; Yi, A-Lan; Ni, Hong-Gang",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118672/,57

In particular, we raise a warning flag about identifiability of the parameters of SIR-like models; often, it might be hard to infer the correct values of the parameters from data, even for very simple models, making it non-trivial to use these models for meaningful predictions.

Vaccination is a viable approach to fight against C. difficile and several efforts in this direction are ongoing. Plants are promising vaccine biofactories offering low cost, enhanced safety, and allow for the formulation of oral vaccines. Herein, the CdeM protein, which is a spore antigen associated with immunoprotection against C. difficile, was selected to begin the development of plant-based vaccine candidates. The vaccine antigen is based in a fusion protein (LTB-CdeM), carrying the CdeM antigen, fused to the carboxi-terminus of the B subunit of the Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin (LTB) as a mucosal immunogenic carrier. LTB-CdeM was produced in plants using a synthetic optimized gene according codon usage and mRNA stability criteria. The obtained transformed tobacco lines produced the LTB-CdeM antigen in the range of 52-90 μg g-1 dry weight leaf tissues. The antigenicity of the plant-made LTB-CdeM antigen was evidenced by GM1 ELISA and immunogenicity assessment performed in test mice revealed that the LTB-CdeM antigen is orally immunogenic inducing significant humoral responses against CdeM epitopes. This report constitutes the first step in the development of plant-based vaccines against C. difficile infection. This article is protected by copyright.

The focus of this study was to investigate the effect of biliatresone on the development of the hepatobiliary system in mice. We successfully synthesized biliatresone with a purity of 98% and confirmed its biliary toxicity. Exposure to high doses of biliatresone caused abortion or death in pregnant mice. Neonatal mice injected with biliatresone developed clinical signs of biliary obstruction, and dysplasia or the absence of extrahepatic biliary tract lumen, which confirmed the occurrence of biliary atresia. In the portal tract of biliary atresia mice, signs of infiltration of inflammatory cells and liver fibrosis were observed. The signature of extrahepatic biliary gene expression in these mice mainly involved the cell adhesion process, and hepatic RNA-seq was highly linked to transcriptional evidence of oxidative stress. When compared with the control group, hepatic glutathione levels were markedly reduced after biliatresone injection. Taken together, these data confirm that biliatresone causes severe developmental abnormalities of the hepatobiliary system in mice. Furthermore, decreased levels of glutathione may play a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in biliatresone-induced experimental biliary atresia.","Yang, Yifan; Wang, Junfeng; Zhan, Yong; Chen, Gong; Shen, Zhen; Zheng, Shan; Dong, Rui",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-020-0467-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681026/,57

According to the available studies, the potential genotoxic impacts of this chlorinated solvent on human beings are still controversial. The present work was carried out to determine the genotoxic effects of PCE on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) using chromosome aberrations (CAs) and cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) tests. Additionally, the antigenotoxic potential of α-tocopherol (α-Toc), a well-known antioxidant agent, on human lymphocytes treated with PCE in vitro was assessed. The cells were exposed for 48 h to PCE (25, 50, 100, and 150 μg/mL) alone as well as in combination with α-Toc (100 μg/mL). The findings of the study suggested that, relative to solvent control, PCE significantly increased the structural CA and MN formation for all concentrations. However, simultaneous treatment of PCE and α-Toc caused a significant reduction of CAs and MNi as compared to cultures treated with PCE alone. Besides, the results showed that PCE has cytotoxic effects on human PBLs as indicated by the significant decrease in mitotic index (MI) and nuclear division index (NDI). Nevertheless, the co-treatment of α-Toc with PCE did not reduce the cytotoxicity of PCE at a significant level. In conclusion, it can be suggested that PCE is genotoxic and cytotoxic in human PBLs, and α-Toc has an antigenotoxic effect on PCE-induced genotoxicity but has no significant effect on the cytotoxicity triggered by PCE.","Kocaman, Ayşe Yavuz; Asfuroğlu, Kübra",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13523-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763835/,57

We have discussed about basic properties of the system and found the basic reproduction number of the system. A condition for the local stability of the uninfected and the infected steady states is presented. The local stability analysis of the model shows that the system is asymptotically stable at the disease-free equilibrium point when the basic reproduction number is less than one. When the basic reproduction number is greater than one endemic equilibrium point exists, and the local stability analysis proves that this point is asymptotically stable. Numerical sensitivity analysis based on model parameters is performed and therefore the result describes the influence of each parameter on the basic reproduction number.","Elkaranshawy, Hesham A; Ezzat, Hossam M; Ibrahim, Nermeen N",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

White matter damage is proposed as substrate of poor outcome, with contributing factors as regional hypoxia and effects of cytokines on oligodendrocytes. We investigated the relation between cerebral oxygenation during (suspected) late-onset sepsis and neurodevelopmental outcome. Prospective cohort study, including preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks and/or birthweight <1500 grams) with (suspected) late-onset sepsis underwent NIRS registration during the first 72 hours of suspected late-onset sepsis. At two years corrected age neurodevelopment was scored using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II. Thirty-two infants were included. Twenty-seven infants were identified with proven late-onset sepsis and five infants had clinical sepsis without positive blood culture. In this study, late-onset sepsis was predominantly caused by coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (72%). All NIRS values were within normal limits. No association was found between NIRS and impaired neurodevelopmental outcome (n = 4) at corrected age two years: composite cognitive score 105 (80-115), composite motor score 103 (82-118) (median and range). In this pilot study, late-onset sepsis (predominantly caused by CoNS with a relatively mild clinical course), was not associated with aberrant NIRS values, nor with impaired neurodevelopmental outcome.

133343,Coexpression of interleukin-6 and -2 from giant panda in Escherichia coli and the biological activity of the fusion protein.,2013,"Adolescents often suffer from short and mistimed sleep. To counteract the resulting daytime sleepiness they frequently consume caffeine. However, caffeine intake may exaggerate sleep problems by disturbing sleep and circadian timing. In a 28-hour double-blind randomized crossover study, we investigated to what extent caffeine disturbs slow-wave sleep (SWS) and delays circadian timing in teenagers. Following a 6-day ambulatory phase of caffeine abstinence and fixed sleep-wake-cycles, 18 male teenagers (14-17 years old) ingested 80 mg caffeine vs. placebo in the laboratory four hours prior to an electro-encephalographically (EEG) monitored nighttime sleep episode. Data were analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian statistics. The analyses suggest that subjective sleepiness is reduced after caffeine compared to placebo. However, we did not observe a substantial influence of the given dose neither on subjective sleep quality nor on SWS, but rather a high inter-individual variability in caffeine-induced SWS changes. Exploratory analyses suggest that particularly those individuals with a higher level of SWS during placebo reduced SWS in response to caffeine. Regarding salivary melatonin onsets, caffeine-induced delays were not evident at group level, and only observed in participants exposed to a higher caffeine dose relative to individual bodyweight (i.e., a dose >1.3mg/kg). Together, the results suggest that 80 mg caffeine are sufficient to induce alertness at a subjective level. However, particularly teenagers with a strong need for deep sleep might pay for these subjective benefits by a loss of SWS during the night. Thus, caffeine-induced sleep-disruptions might change along with the maturation of sleep need.","Reichert, Carolin F; Veitz, Simon; Bühler, Miriam; Gruber, Georg; Deuring, Gunnar; Rehm, Sophia S; Rentsch, Katharina; Garbazza, Corrado; Meyer, Martin; Slawik, Helen; Lin, Yu-Shiuan; Weibel, Janine",Biochemical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2020.114283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069664/,57
133573,"Influenza virus activating host proteases: Identification, localization and inhibitors as potential therapeutics.",2015,"OBJECTIVES Managing uncertainty is central to expert practice, yet how novice trainees navigate these moments is likely different than what has been described by experienced clinicians. Exploring trainees' experiences with uncertainty could therefore help explicate the unique cues that they attend to, how they appraise their comfort in these moments, and how they enact responses within the affordances of their training environment. METHODS Informed by constructivist grounded theory, we explored how novice emergency medicine trainees experienced and managed clinical uncertainty in practice. We used a critical incident technique to prompt participants to reflect on experiences with uncertainty immediately following a clinical shift, exploring the cues they attended to and the approaches they used to navigate these moments. Two investigators coded line-by-line using constant comparison, organizing the data into focused codes. The research team discussed the relationships between these codes and developed a set of themes that supported our efforts to theorize about the phenomenon. RESULTS We enrolled 13 trainees in their first two years of postgraduate training across two institutions. They expressed uncertainty about the root causes of the patient problems they were facing and the potential management steps to take, but also expressed a pervasive sense of uncertainty about their own abilities and their appraisals of the situation. This, in turn, led to challenges with selecting, interpreting, and using the cues in their environment effectively. Participants invoked several approaches to combat this sense of uncertainty about themselves, rehearsing steps before a clinical encounter, checking their interpretations with others, and implicitly calibrating their appraisals to those of more experienced team members. CONCLUSIONS Trainees' struggles with the legitimacy of their interpretations impact their experiences with uncertainty. Recognizing these ongoing struggles may enable supervisors and other team members to provide more effective scaffolding, validation, and calibration of clinical judgments and patient management.","Ilgen, Jonathan S; Regehr, Glenn; Teunissen, Pim W; Sherbino, Jonathan; de Bruin, Anique B H",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527454/,57

The invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes, the world's largest freshwater ecosystem, by dreissenid (zebra and quagga) mussels has dramatically altered the ecology of these lakes. A key open question is how dreissenids affect the cycling of phosphorus (P), the nutrient that limits productivity in the Great Lakes. We show that a single species, the quagga mussel, is now the primary regulator of P cycling in the lower four Great Lakes. By virtue of their enormous biomass, quagga mussels sequester large quantities of P in their tissues and dramatically intensify benthic P exchanges. Mass balance analysis reveals a previously unrecognized sensitivity of the Great Lakes ecosystem, where P availability is now regulated by the dynamics of mussel populations while the role of the external inputs of phosphorus is suppressed. Our results show that a single invasive species can have dramatic consequences for geochemical cycles even in the world's largest aquatic ecosystems. The ongoing spread of dreissenids across a multitude of lakes in North America and Europe is likely to affect carbon and nutrient cycling in these systems for many decades, with important implications for water quality management.","Li, Jiying; Ianaiev, Vadym; Huff, Audrey; Zalusky, John; Ozersky, Ted; Katsev, Sergei",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008223118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495360/,57

To address this gap, we sought to systematically evaluate the psychometric properties of measures to detect substance use and misuse. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature on measures of substance classes associated with HIV risk (heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, alcohol) that were published in English before June 2016 that reported at least one of the following psychometric outcomes of interest: internal consistency (alpha), test-retest/inter-rater reliability (kappa), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. We used meta-analytic techniques to generate pooled summary estimates for these outcomes using random effects and hierarchical logistic regression models. RESULTS Findings across 387 paper revealed that overall, 65% of pooled estimates for alpha were in the range of fair-to-excellent; 44% of estimates for kappa were in the range of fair-to-excellent. In addition, 69, 97, 37 and 96% of pooled estimates for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively, were in the range of moderate-to-excellent. CONCLUSION We conclude that many substance use measures had pooled summary estimates that were at the fair/moderate-to-excellent range across different psychometric outcomes. Most scales were conducted in English, within the United States, highlighting the need to test and validate these measures in more diverse settings.

Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has been performed for various organs, but the feasibility of LESS hepatectomies has yet to be explored fully. METHODS From May 2010 to March 2011, seven patients underwent LESS minor hepatectomies. Patient demographic, operative, and clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS Five left lateral sectionectomies, one segment 3, and one segment 5 resection were performed. The median operative time was 142 min (range, 104-171 min), and the median blood loss was 200 ml (range, 100-450 ml). The median hospital stay was 3 days (range, 1-11 days). For all the patients, the indications for surgery were suspected malignant tumors, and the surgical resection margins were clear for every patient.

METHODS Three primer pairs were designed and used to develop a multiplex PCR assay. And 286 samples from 8 farms in Hubei province were tested by the developed multiplex PCR assay to demonstrate the accuracy. RESULTS Each of target genes of PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3 was amplified using the designed primers, while no other porcine viruses genes were detected. The limit of detection of the assay was 10 copies/μL of PCV1, PCV2 OR PCV3. The results of the tissue samples detection showed that PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3 are co-circulating in central China. The PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3 singular infection rate was 52.4% (150/286), 61.2% (175/286) and 45.1% (129/286), respectively, while the PCV1 and PCV2 co-infection rate was 11.2% (32/286), the PCV1 and PCV3 co-infection rate was 5.9% (17/286), the PCV2 and PCV3 co-infection rate was 23.4% (67/286), and the PCV1, PCV2 and PCV3 co-infection rate was 1.7% (5/286), respectively, which were 100% consistent with the sequencing method and real-time PCR methods.

The causative agent has been suggested as Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, but other agents may contribute to the syndrome and the pathogenesis is not understood. To understand the role of O. ophiodiicola in SFD, a cottonmouth snake model of SFD was designed. Five cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorous) were experimentally challenged by nasolabial pit inoculation with a pure culture of O. ophiodiicola. Development of skin lesions or facial swelling at the site of inoculation was observed in all snakes. Twice weekly swabs of the inoculation site revealed variable presence of O. ophiodiicola DNA by qPCR in all five inoculated snakes for 3 to 58 days post-inoculation; nasolabial flushes were not a useful sampling method for detection. Inoculated snakes had a 40% mortality rate. All inoculated snakes had microscopic lesions unilaterally on the side of the swabbed nasolabial pit, including erosions to ulcerations and heterophilic dermatitis. All signs were consistent with SFD; however, the severity of lesions varied in individual snakes, and fungal hyphae were only observed in 3 of 5 inoculated snakes. These three snakes correlated with post-mortem tissue qPCR evidence of O. ophiodiicola. The findings of this study conclude that O. ophiodiicola inoculation in a cottonmouth snake model leads to disease similar to SFD, although lesion severity and the fungal load are quite variable within the model. Future studies may utilize this model to further understand the pathogenesis of this disease and develop management strategies that mitigate disease effects, but investigation of other models with less variability may be warranted.","Allender, Matthew C; Baker, Sarah; Wylie, Daniel; Loper, Daniel; Dreslik, Michael J; Phillips, Christopher A; Maddox, Carol; Driskell, Elizabeth A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26469977/,57

139947,Surface-displayed porcine IFN-λ3 in Lactobacillus plantarum inhibits porcine enteric coronavirus infection of porcine intestinal epithelial cells.,2019-12-15,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The intrasaccular flow disruptor, the Woven EndoBridge device, is increasingly used for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. Due to unfavorable anatomy, additional stent placement is sometimes required to avoid Woven EndoBridge protrusion into bifurcation branches. We report our experience with the Woven EndoBridge associated with stent placement for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with aneurysms treated with the Woven EndoBridge Single-Layer plus stent placement were evaluated retrospectively with prospectively maintained data. The technical feasibility, procedural complications, aneurysm occlusion, and clinical outcome were studied. RESULTS Seventeen patients and aneurysms treated with the Woven EndoBridge plus stent placement were included. The mean aneurysm size was 7 ± 3.1 mm. Aneurysm locations were the following: MCA (10 patients), anterior communicating artery (3 patients), basilar tip (3 patients), and posterior communicating artery (1 patient). Two lesions were ruptured and treated in the acute phase. The Woven EndoBridge and stent placement were successfully delivered in all cases. There were no permanent/major complications. Among the 2 patients with SAH, minor and completely reversible in-stent thrombosis occurred during treatment. An asymptomatic occlusion of the angular artery with a distal nonbifurcation aneurysm was discovered during the angiographic follow-up. Long-term (10.4 months) angiographic complete (Raymond-Roy I) and near-complete (Raymond-Roy II) occlusion was obtained in 11 (69%) and 2 (12.5%) aneurysms, respectively. The mean sizes of aneurysms showing Raymond-Roy I/Raymond-Roy II and Raymond-Roy III occlusion were 5.5 ± 2.1 mm and 10 ± 1 mm, respectively (P = .003). The mean fluoroscopy time was 35 ± 14 minutes. CONCLUSIONS Aneurysm embolization with the Woven EndoBridge device associated with stent placement appears technically feasible and effective for the treatment of lesions with unfavorable anatomy. In our study, this strategy was relatively safe with a low rate of relevant procedure-related adverse events.","Cagnazzo, F; Ahmed, R; Dargazanli, C; Lefevre, P-H; Gascou, G; Derraz, I; Kalmanovich, S A; Riquelme, C; Bonafe, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

The ideal imaging strategy in this setting is not yet well defined. Bedside pulmonary ultrasound presents an undeniable series of advantages in patients at high risk of infection, and can provide incremental data in the respiratory intensive care for the serial control of the individual patient, as well as for home delivery of stabilized patients. Chest X-ray is characterized by low sensitivity in identifying earlier lung changes. Pulmonary computed tomography shows high sensitivity but should not be routinely performed in all patients, because in the first 48 h it can be absolutely negative, and in the late phase imaging findings may not change the therapeutic approach.

We hypothesized that IGI using wire-reinforced silicone (WRS) tube could achieve endotracheal intubation most rapidly and successfully. Methods In 23 emergency physicians, a prospective randomized crossover manikin study was conducted to examine the three intubation techniques using two kinds of endotracheal tubes. The primary outcome was the intubation time. The secondary outcome was the cumulative success rate for each intubation technique. A significant difference was considered when identifying p < 0.05 between two devices or p < 0.017 in post hoc analysis of the comparison among three devices. Results The mean intubation time using IGI was shorter (p < 0.017) than that of using IBRI and MCL in both endotracheal tubes (17.6 vs. 29.3 vs. 20.2 in conventional polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube; 14.6 vs. 27.4 vs. 19.9 in WRS tube; sec). There were no significant (p < 0.05) differences between PVC and WRS tubes for each intubation technique. The intubation time to reach 100% cumulative success rate was also shorter in IGI (p < 0.017) than that in IBRI and MCL in both PVC and WRS tubes. Conclusions IGI was an equally successful and faster technique compared with IBRI or MCL regardless of the use of PVC or WRS tube. IGI might be an appropriate technique for emergent intubation by experienced intubators during chest compressions.","Choi, Hyun Young; Kim, Wonhee; Jang, Yong Soo; Kang, Gu Hyun; Kim, Jae Guk; Kim, Hyeongtae",Emergency medicine international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/8913093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31781398/,57
142030,Application of Oxford Nanopore Technology to Plant Virus Detection.,2021-07-22,"BACKGROUND Evidence suggests that cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy algorithms improve outcomes after high-risk surgery, but there is some concern that this could promote acute myocardial injury. We evaluated the incidence of myocardial injury in a perioperative goal-directed therapy trial. METHODS Patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery (n=723) were randomly assigned to cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy (intervention group) or usual care as part of the OPTIMISE trial. At four participating sites, 288 patients were enrolled in a biomarker substudy. Serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (TnI) concentration and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration were measured before and at 24 and 72 h after surgery. RESULTS Median preoperative TnI and NT-ProBNP concentrations were 4.3 ng litre(-1) and 144 pg ml(-1), respectively. After surgery, 67 (46%) patients in the intervention group and 68 (48%) patients receiving usual care had TnI concentrations above the 99th centile upper reference limit (P=0.82). Peak serum TnI concentration was similar in the intervention and usual care groups (median [interquartile range]: 10.0 [5.3-21.5] vs 7.8 [5.0-21.8] ng litre(-1); P=0.85), and no differences were observed in serum TnI concentrations over 72 h (repeated-measures anova, P=0.51). Likewise, there were no differences in peak NT-proBNP concentration between intervention and usual care groups (645 [362-1169] vs 659 [381-1028] pg ml(-1); P=0.86) or in serial NT-proBNP concentrations over 72 h (P=0.20). CONCLUSIONS Myocardial injury is common among patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery.

Most of the currently available inhibitors are weak in terms of potency, drug-likeness, and furin specificity thereby necessitating the development of newer compounds especially mechanism-based inhibitors. Here, the roles of active site Cys198 (C198), His194 (H194), and Ser386 (S386) were investigated using computational-site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Data were obtained from six (6) biosystems: wildtype (C198/S386), furin-C198G (S386), furin-S386G (C198), and their peptide (nascent hydrolyzed peptide H2N-RTRR-CO2) bound complexes. The results strongly supported that in wildtype furin but not S386G and C198G mutants, following S386/scissile carbon attack (4.0 Å), the peptide retracted from the active site, representing peptide release post hydrolysis. Furthermore, in S386G mutant, C194 side chain thiolate ion may act as the nucleophile replacement but competing electron-rich centers (H194, H364) and energetically unattainable geometric strain on the peptide may constitute the limiting factors. In biosystems not complexed with peptide (representative of pre-attack state), C198 preferentially engaged H194 imidazole moiety via sulfur-π bond system causing a dihedral and positional restraints on the imidazole ring for ultimate alignment of its NE2 hydrogen atom with the side chain enolate oxygen of S364 required for optimal proton transfer. In summary, small-molecular-weight compounds with dual serine and cysteine protease inhibitory actions may represent a new class of potent and furin-selective compounds for future clinical applications.","Omotuyi, Olaposi I; Hamada, Tsuyoshi",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2015.1041552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25900475/,57
145065,Functional analysis of two cavities in flavivirus NS5 polymerase.,2011,"OBJECTIVE The use of staplers for thoracic surgery has been widely accepted and regarded as a safe procedure. However, complications of stapling are occasionally experienced. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze complications of bronchial stapling. METHODS A retrospective multi-institutional review was conducted by the Central Japan Lung Cancer Surgery Study Group, comprising 29 institutions. All instances of bronchial stapling in thoracic surgery were reviewed during the research period. RESULTS Bronchial stapling was performed 2,030 times, using 36 kinds of staplers. The total number of complications related to stapling was 36 (1.8 %); 31 events occurred intraoperatively and five events occurred postoperatively. The intraoperative complications were air leakage (N = 20) and stapling failure (N = 11), which were caused by stapler-tissue thickness mismatch (N = 17), stapler defect (N = 3), tissue fragility (N = 2), and unknown reasons (N = 9). In all 31 cases, intraoperative complications were recovered intraoperatively with additional suturing, and no further complications were observed postoperatively. The postoperative complications were bronchopleural fistula (BPF) (N = 4) and bleeding from the chest wall (intercostal artery) (N = 1). The rate of BPF was 0.2 % (4 of 2,030). Two of four BPFs induced critical conditions. Postoperative bleeding was caused by the use of Duet TRS(TM). Both total complications and BPF occurred more frequently in the main bronchus than in the lobar or segmental bronchus. No relationship was seen between the incidence of complications and cartridge colors in lobar bronchial stapling. The compression types of staplers were associated with the incidence of complication. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative and postoperative complications of bronchial stapling were studied. Generally, bronchial stapling in recent thoracic surgery was safe, but rare postoperative complications may induce critical conditions. Knowledge of potential complications and causes of bronchial stapling may decrease the incidence of stapling complications.","Yano, Motoki; Yokoi, Kohei; Numanami, Hiroki; Kondo, Ryoichi; Ohde, Yasuhisa; Sugaya, Masakazu; Narita, Kunio; Chihara, Koji; Matsushima, Yasushi; Kobayashi, Ryo; Hikosaka, Yu",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-013-2292-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24129802/,57

Handling of camels is not without its dangers, and 4 cases from South Australia are reported with a review of lethal camel-related issues. Case 1 is a 56-year-old man who died of multiple blunt force injuries after he had attempted to move a 7-year-old female dromedary (Camelus dromedarius). Case 2 is a 65-year-old woman who was crushed by 1 or more camels that she had been training. Case 3 is a 1-year-old girl who died of blunt craniocerebral trauma after the car in which she was traveling rolled when the driver swerved to avoid a herd of camels that had strayed onto the road. Case 4 is a 66-year-old woman who died of ischemic and hypertensive cardiac disease exacerbated by physical activity while rounding up camels. Deaths associated with camels involve kicking, stomping, kneeling or sitting on a victim, or biting and shaking and throwing. Lethal mechanisms include hemorrhage from vascular injuries and internal organ disruption, crush asphyxia, and blunt craniospinal injuries. Death may also follow falls from camels or vehicle collisions. Camels also carry a wide range of zoonotic diseases, the most significant of which is Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome. Handling of camels may also exacerbate underlying organic illnesses such as cardiac disease. Those working with camels should be aware that the size, strength, and temperament of these animals may make them dangerous and that they also carry potentially lethal zoonotic diseases.","Gilbert, John D; Byard, Roger W",The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,https://doi.org/10.1097/paf.0000000000000606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925211/,57

150165,"Identification of multiple novel viruses, including a parvovirus and a hepevirus, in feces of red foxes.",2013,"In industrialized countries respiratory tract infections are one of the most common reasons for medical consultations. It is assumed that almost one third of these infections affect the lower respiratory tract (LRTI), e. g. acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia and influenza. Due to a lack of sufficient and valid investigations on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses, their impact on the pathogenesis of LRTI has probably been underestimated for a long time. Therefore, there might have been many cases of needless antibiotic treatment, particularly in cases of acute bronchitis or acute exacerbations of COPD, because of an assumed bacteriological aetiology. Following the introduction of diagnostic procedures with increased sensitivity, such as polymerase chain reaction, it is possible to reliably detect respiratory viruses and to illuminate their role in the pathogenesis of LRTI of the adult. We have reviewed the current literature to elucidate the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of LRTI.

Method This study was an exploratory cross-sectional survey to explore skin bleaching, skin bleaching patterns and factors associated with skin bleaching among women living in Zimbabwe. An online self-administered questionnaire was sent out to women on social network i.e. WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Findings A total number of 260 respondents, mean age 31.69 (SD, 8.12) years participated in the survey. The prevalence of skin bleaching among the participants was 31.15%. The major reason reported for skin bleaching was to have smooth and healthy skin alongside other factors such as beauty, gaining social favours for example getting married and good jobs. Occupation, complexion and marital status were associated with skin bleaching. The odds of skin bleaching for participants who were employed was 1.45(95% confidence interval [CI],0.32-1.91);p-value 0.02, dark skinned participants 2.56(95% CI, 0.76-2.87);p-value 0.01 and unmarried participants 2.87(95% CI,0.29-3.58);p-value 0.03. Conclusion Evidence from the research suggests skin bleaching might be common among women living in Zimbabwe and possibly poses serious health threats to the women. Skin bleaching seems to be deep rooted in colourism. The colourism seems to be taken advantage of by the cosmetic industry which produce the potentially hazardous products which promise the revered light skin to women but which comes with a price.

151386,Detailed mechanistic insights into HIV-1 sensitivity to three generations of fusion inhibitors.,2009,"Meta-control is necessary to regulate the balance between cognitive stability and flexibility. Evidence from (voluntary) task switching studies suggests performance-contingent reward as one modulating factor. Depending on the immediate reward history, reward prospect seems to promote either cognitive stability or flexibility: Increasing reward prospect reduced switch costs and increased the voluntary switch rate, suggesting increased cognitive flexibility. In contrast, remaining high reward prospect increased switch costs and reduced the voluntary switch rate, suggesting increased cognitive stability. Recently we suggested that increasing reward prospect serves as a meta-control signal toward cognitive flexibility by lowering the updating threshold in working memory. However, in task switching paradigms with two tasks only, this could alternatively be explained by facilitated switching to the other of two tasks. To address this issue, a series of task switching experiments with uncued task switching between three univalent tasks was conducted. Results showed a reduction in reaction time (RT) switch costs to a nonsignificant difference and a high voluntary switch rate when reward prospect increased, whereas repetition RTs were faster, switch RTs slower, and voluntary switch rate was reduced when reward prospect remained high. That is, increasing reward prospect put participants in a state of equal readiness to respond to any target stimulus-be it a task repetition or a switch to one of the other two tasks. The study thus provides further evidence for the assumption that increasing reward prospect serves as a meta-control signal to increase cognitive flexibility, presumably by lowering the updating threshold in working memory.","Fröber, Kerstin; Dreisbach, Gesine","Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience",https://doi.org/10.3758/s13415-020-00825-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901401/,57

The objective of the present study was to analyse intraoperative crystalloid administration practices at two academic medical centres in the USA. METHODS We extracted clinical data from patients undergoing intra-abdominal procedures performed at UC Irvine (UCI) and Vanderbilt University (VU) Medical Centres. Limiting data to uncomplicated elective surgery with minimal blood loss, we quantified variability in fluid administration within individual providers, between providers, and between types of procedures using a corrected coefficient of variation (cCOV). Regression was performed using a general linear model to determine factors most predictive of fluid administration. RESULTS For provider analysis and model building, 1327 UCI and 4585 VU patients were used. The average corrected crystalloid infusion rate across all providers at both institutions was 7.1 (sd 4.9) ml kg(-1) h(-1), an overall cCOV of 70%. Individual providers ranged from 2.3 (sd 3.7) to 14 (sd 10) ml kg(-1) h(-1). The final regression model strongly favoured personnel as predictors over other patient predictors. CONCLUSIONS Wide variability in crystalloid administration was observed both within and between individual anaesthesia providers, which might contribute to variability in surgical outcomes.","Lilot, M; Ehrenfeld, J M; Lee, C; Harrington, B; Cannesson, M; Rinehart, J",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aeu452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586725/,57
151765,Cathepsin B plays a key role in optimal production of the influenza A virus.,2018,"PURPOSE Longitudinal folds in tracheal tube (TT) cuffs cause leakage of pooled secretions past the tube cuff, and the most common in vitro method to test the efficacy of a new tube is a benchtop model using an artificial rigid trachea. This study compared the potential of a static and dynamic ventilation benchtop model and cuff lubrication in testing the tracheal sealing properties of a given TT cuff. METHODS Static trial Six brands of 7.5 mm internal diameter (ID) cuffed TT (n = 8) with high volume-low pressure cuffs were inflated in an artificial trachea (18 mm ID) without and with lubrication. Dynamic trial The same tube cuffs, without lubrication, were subjected to positive pressure ventilation (PPV) + positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5cmH(2)O or to PPV alone (without PEEP) or to PEEP alone (without PPV). Clear water (5 ml) was placed above the tube cuff, and fluid leakage (ml) was measured up to 60 min. RESULTS Gel lubrication, PEEP alone and PPV + PEEP completely prevented fluid leakage across the tube cuffs in all six TT brands tested within 60 min when compared to the static unlubricated model (0% leak versus 100% leak; P < 0.01). Fluid leakage in the static unlubricated model and the PPV group was 1.38-4.76 ml and 0.23-4.47 ml, respectively. CONCLUSION Gel lubrication, PEEP alone, and PPV + PEEP in the benchtop model had a much stronger protective effect than PPV alone on fluid leakage.

152697,Design and Structure-Activity Relationship of a Potent Furin Inhibitor Derived from Influenza Hemagglutinin.,2021-03-11,"Though adolescence is a particularly sensitive period regarding the development of long-lasting health-related attitudes and behaviors, little research has examined the factors which influence their engagement in such behaviors. Adolescent females are particularly sensitive to suffer from overweight and obesity. It is also a time that can impact the health patterns of future generations due to the influence of preconception maternal factors on the health of their offspring. Furthermore, much research has identified a strong socioeconomic gradient in obesity in Ireland, with individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds being particularly likely to develop unhealthy habits. The current study aimed to develop an understanding of the factors which influence the health-related behaviors of adolescent girls of low-socioeconomic status in Ireland, an underrepresented yet particularly sensitive cohort. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine teachers from disadvantaged schools in Dublin and were examined using a thematic analytic approach. Nine themes were identified: lack of interest and knowledge, lack of self-confidence, the dual role of modern technology, behaviors of significant others, need for good role models, availability of convenience foods, inadequate existing approaches and initiatives, lack of resources to promote a healthy lifestyle, and living difficulties at home and in the community. Findings suggested ways for intervening at personal, interpersonal, organizational and community levels. In conclusion, a range of practical changes are required in the home, school, and community environments in order to improve the health of these individuals, and ultimately to improve the health of future generations.","McNamara, Roisin; Quinn, Roisin; Murrin, Celine; Bel-Serrat, Silvia",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246715/,57

METHODS Clinical data and samples for respiratory multiplex PCR test were collected from 717 consecutive patients attending for uncomplicated AURTI at a busy emergency department in Singapore, 2016-2018. RESULTS Influenza (20.6%), rhinoviruses (14.4%), and coronaviruses (3.6%) were the most common viral pathogens. Biannual peaks with year-round activity was identified for Influenza. Although higher rhinoviruses activity was observed in inter-influenza seasonal periods, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses circulated year-round without distinct seasonal patterns. During high influenza activity months, the CDC's and WHO's ILI case definitions had moderate-to-high positive likelihood ratios (LR + s) of 3.8-6.8 and 4.5-10.7 respectively for ruling in influenza. During other months, they had moderately high LR + s of 3.3-3.8 and 3.9-4.6 for clinically diagnosing influenza infection. The ILI case definitions had high specificities (77.2-85.4%) for rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. CONCLUSION The CDC and WHO ILI case definitions can be applied to clinically diagnose influenza in the tropics, regardless of the time of the year.","Aung, Aung H; Lye, David C; Cui, Lin; Ooi, Chee K; Chow, Angela Lp",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.03.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741485/,57

154986,Achieving a golden mean: mechanisms by which coronaviruses ensure synthesis of the correct stoichiometric ratios of viral proteins.,2010,"Sialylated glycans and glycoproteins are involved in cellular communication and are crucial for distinguishing between signal pathways. Sialylation levels and patterns modulate recognition events and are regulated by the enzymatic activity of sialyltransferases and neuraminidases. Abnormal activity of these enzymes is related to diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Monitoring these enzymatic activities offers valuable diagnostic tools. This work presents an impedimetric biosensing platform for following and detecting sialylation and desialylation processes. This platform is based on a native biantennary N-glycan substrate attached to a glassy carbon electrode. Changes in the molecular layer, as a result of enzymatic reactions, were detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, displaying high sensitivity to the enzymatic surface reactions. Increase in the molecular layer roughness in response to the sialylation was visualized using atomic force microscopy. After enzymatic sialylation, the presence of sialic acid was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry by coupling of the redox active marker aminoferrocene. The sialylation showed selectivity toward the N-glycan compared to another glycan substrate. A time dependent sialylation was followed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, proving that the new system can be applied to evaluate the enzymatic kinetics. Our findings suggest that analyzing sialylation processes using this platform can become a useful tool for the detection of pathological states and pathogen invasion.","Alshanski, Israel; Sukhran, Yonatan; Mervinetsky, Evgeniy; Unverzagt, Carlo; Yitzchaik, Shlomo; Hurevich, Mattan",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142198/,57
155771,"Characterization of a novel alphaherpesvirus isolated from the fruit bat Pteropus lylei, in Viet Nam.",2020-07-15,"KEY MESSAGE Nitric oxide is a dynamic gaseous molecule involved in signalling, crosstalk with stress regulators, and plant abiotic-stress responses. It has great exploratory potentials for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in crops. Nitric oxide (NO), a redox-active gaseous signalling molecule, though present uniformly through the eukaryotes, maintain its specificity in plants with respect to its formation, signalling, and functions. Its cellular concentrations are decisive for its function, as a signalling molecule at lower concentrations, but triggers nitro-oxidative stress and cellular damage when produced at higher concentrations. Besides, it also acts as a potent stress alleviator. Discovered in animals as neurotransmitter, NO has come a long way to being a stress radical and growth regulator in plants. As a key redox molecule, it exhibits several key cellular and molecular interactions including with reactive chemical species, hydrogen sulphide, and calcium. Apart from being a signalling molecule, it is emerging as a key player involved in regulations of plant growth, development and plant-environment interactions. It is involved in crosstalk with stress regulators and is thus pivotal in these stress regulatory mechanisms. NO is getting an unprecedented attention from research community, being investigated and explored for its multifaceted roles in plant abiotic stress tolerance. Through this review, we intend to present the current knowledge and updates on NO biosynthesis and signalling, crosstalk with stress regulators, and how biotechnological manipulations of NO pathway are leading towards developing transgenic crop plants that can withstand environmental stresses and climate change. The targets of various stress responsive miRNA signalling have also been discussed besides giving an account of current approaches used to characterise and detect the NO.","Zhou, Xianrong; Joshi, Shrushti; Khare, Tushar; Patil, Suraj; Shang, Jin; Kumar, Vinay",Plant cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00299-021-02705-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974111/,57
155928,Autoimmune Processes Involved in Organ System Failure Following Infection with SARS-CoV-2.,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide peril. The PCR tests are widely used to detect infections. However, multiple regression analysis revealed no correlation between the examination rate among population (ER) and the success of containment, which is achieved by social distancing. ER and fatality rate were even positively correlated. Japan has been criticized for its very low ER, but it achieved better containment than other major countries with much higher ER on 29 May. The estimation of the true infection rate (TIR) among population revealed that the low fatality rate in Japan and other Asian countries is partly due to low TIR. Fatality of COVID-19 is highly accentuated in aged persons. Despite having the highest aging rate in the world, the fatality rate in Japan is relatively low. The corrected fatality rate of Japan is the second-lowest among the G20 countries. Mimicking the attenuation of viral virulence due to natural selection would be a promising strategy to overcome pandemic. The prevention of in-hospital transmission, especially from severe cases, would be the key to achieve this. Attenuation of the viral virulence in the second wave is evident in many European countries, and also in Tokyo.","Sonoo, Masahiro; Idogawa, Masashi; Kanbayashi, Takamichi; Shimohata, Takayoshi; Kobayashi, Masahito; Hayashi, Hideyuki",Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,https://doi.org/10.11477/mf.1416201643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051387/,57
156395,The guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 participates in rotavirus replication.,2019,"BACKGROUND Chronic kidney disease is a common comorbid condition among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH). We characterized baseline kidney function in the REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) trial cohort. METHODS REPRIEVE enrolled PWH with low to moderate cardiovascular risk based on traditional risk factors to evaluate the effect of statin therapy on cardiovascular events. We determined baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, and Cockcroft-Gault equations, and we evaluated baseline factors associated with eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 by logistic regression. We performed Bland-Altman plots and scatterplots to assess agreement between equations. RESULTS Among 7770 participants enrolled, the median age was 50 years, 31% were female (natal sex), 43% black or African American and 15% Asian, the median body mass index (calculated as calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 25.8, and the median CD4 cell count 620/µL. The median CKD-EPI eGFR was 97 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 38% had an eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2. In the adjusted model, factors associated with eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 included white race, older age, higher body mass index, high-income region of enrollment, hypertension, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The CKD-EPI and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equations demonstrated strong agreement, particularly at lower eGFR values. Overall, there was 56% concordance between the 3 equations (categories <60, 60 to <90, ≥90 mL/min), improving to 73% after accounting for individual body surface area. CONCLUSIONS REPRIEVE enrolled a diverse cohort including a substantial number of PWH with reduced kidney function. Factors associated with reduced eGFR included traditional risk factors and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure. Three commonly used equations have only fair agreement, with potential implications for both clinical care and epidemiologic studies.

156657,TAX1BP1 Restrains Virus-Induced Apoptosis by Facilitating Itch-Mediated Degradation of the Mitochondrial Adaptor MAVS.,2017,"BACKGROUND Sensitive and specific detection of nodal status, sites of metastases and low-volume recurrent disease could greatly improve management of patients with advanced prostate cancer. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a well-established marker for prostate carcinoma with increased levels of expression in high-grade, hormone-refractory and metastatic disease. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) J591 is directed against an extracellular epitope of PSMA and has been shown to efficiently target disseminated disease including metastases in lymph nodes and bone. Its use as a diagnostic imaging agent however is limited due to its slow pharmacokinetics. In this study a diabody derived from mAb J591 was developed as a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer with improved pharmacokinetics for the detection of PSMA expression in prostate cancer. METHODS A diabody in VH-VL orientation and with a C-terminal cysteine was expressed in HEK293T cells and purified by a combination of metal ion affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Specificity and affinity were determined in cell binding studies. For SPECT imaging, the diabody was site-specifically labelled with [99mTc(CO)3]+ via the C-terminal His tag and evaluated in a subcutaneous DU145/DU145-PSMA prostate carcinoma xenograft model. RESULTS J591C diabody binds to PSMA-expressing cells with low nanomolar affinity (3.3 ± 0.2 nM). SPECT studies allowed imaging of tumour xenografts with high contrast from 4 h post injection (p.i.). Ex vivo biodistribution studies showed peak tumour uptake of the tracer of 12.1% ± 1.7% injected dose (ID)/g at 8 h p.i. with a tumour to blood ratio of 8.0. Uptake in PSMA-negative tumours was significantly lower with 6.3% ± 0.5% at 8 h p.i. (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The presented diabody has favourable properties required to warrant its further development for antibody-based imaging of PSMA expression in prostate cancer, including PSMA-specific uptake, favourable pharmacokinetics compared to the parental antibody and efficient site-specific radiolabelling with 99mTc.","Kampmeier, Florian; Williams, Jennifer D; Maher, John; Mullen, Gregory E; Blower, Philip J",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/2191-219x-4-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602403/,57

We used data from the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), conducted through face-to-face interviews between August 2019 and March 2020 (before the onset of the epidemic), in a representative national sample of adults aged 50 and over, and data obtained through telephone interviews carried out among the same participants (ELSI-COVID-19 initiative), conducted between May 26 and June 8, 2020 (during the epidemic). The analyses were based on odds ratios (OR) estimated by logistic regression. The participants' mean age was 59.9 years (SD = 6.5). The prevalence of going out to work in the previous seven days was 38.4% (95%CI: 31.3-46.1), 50.2% among men and 25.1% among women (formal work, self-employment, and informal work). The results showed that among men, the likelihood of going out to work was lower among those aged 60 to 69 years compared to those aged 50 to 59 years (OR = 0.27; 95%CI: 0.15-0.48). Among women, the likelihood was lower among those who were self-employed (OR = 0.28; 95%CI: 0.12-0.64) or in informal employment before the epidemic (OR = 0.25; 95%CI: 0.09-0.69), compared to those in formal employment. One of the hypotheses to explain this association is that women in informal employment were more likely to be dismissed, and that self-employed women have stopped working during the epidemic.","Castro, Camila Menezes Sabino de; Vaz, Camila Teixeira; Moreira, Bruno de Souza; Mambrini, Juliana Vaz de Melo; Torres, Juliana Lustosa; Braga, Luciana de Souza; Andrade, Fabíola Bof de; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00193320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206834/,57

The aim of this study was to evaluate a new method of PSH repair in combination with an additional flat mesh reinforcement of the abdominal wall. METHODS In a pilot case series, seven patients suffering from complex PSHs (≥5 cm diameter and/or recurrence) underwent surgery and were treated by intraperitoneal onlay technique (IPOM) with a synthetic 3-D funnel-shaped mesh implant. The demographics, perioperative, and follow-up data are presented in this report. RESULTS The surgical strategy varied between purely laparoscopic (n = 1), laparoscopically assisted (hybrid n = 3), or open techniques (n = 3) using original or suture-reconstructed mesh devices. The funnel mesh implantations in IPOM technique were combined with attached flat meshes in the appropriate position of the abdominal wall. No procedure-related complications occurred. The mean length of hospital stay was 12 days and the mean operating time was 171 min. No recurrence of PSH or incisional hernias was observed during a mean follow-up period of 12.3 months (range from 7 to 22). CONCLUSION The use of a 3-D mesh implant has so far shown to be a promising option in the treatment of primary and recurrent PSHs. Its use proved to be reasonable in both laparoscopic and open IPOM technique. PSHs were preferably repaired using the original, unmodified implant, but when we also found it safe to incise, place and then suture the mesh around the pre-existing ostomy.","Köhler, G; Koch, O O; Antoniou, S A; Lechner, M; Mayer, F; Klinge, U; Emmanuel, K",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-014-1302-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112385/,57

The RCT-DUPLICATE initiative uses a structured process to design RWE studies emulating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and compare results. Here, we report findings of the first 10 trial emulations, evaluating cardiovascular outcomes of antidiabetic or antiplatelet medications. Methods: We selected 3 active-controlled and 7 placebo-controlled RCTs for replication. Using patient-level claims data from US commercial and Medicare payers, we implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria, selected primary endpoints, and comparator populations to emulate those of each corresponding RCT. Within the trial-mimicking populations, we conducted propensity score matching to control for >120 pre-exposure confounders. All study parameters were prospectively defined and protocols registered before hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Success criteria for the primary analysis were pre-specified for each replication. Results: Despite attempts to emulate RCT design as closely as possible, differences between the RCT and corresponding RWE study populations remained. The regulatory conclusions were equivalent in 6 of 10. The RWE emulations achieved a HR estimate that was within the 95% CI from the corresponding RCT in 8 of 10 studies. In 9 of 10, either the regulatory or estimate agreement success criteria were fulfilled. The largest differences in effect estimates were found for RCTs where second-generation sulfonylureas were used as a proxy for placebo regarding cardiovascular effects. Nine of 10 replications had a standardized difference between effect estimates of <2, which suggests differences within expected random variation. Conclusions: Agreement between RCT and RWE findings varies depending on which agreement metric is used. Interim findings indicate that selection of active comparator therapies with similar indications and use patterns enhances the validity of RWE. Even in the context of active comparators, concordance between RCT and RWE findings is not guaranteed, partially because trials are not emulated exactly. More trial emulations are needed to understand how often and in what contexts RWE findings match RCTs.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk of contracting the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with 12% of total coronavirus cases confirmed among them recently. 80% of the infected persons show only mild, moderate symptoms or stay asymptomatic. The single-stranded viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR from the respiratory tract, urine, blood and, particulary in children, from stool samples for 30-40 days. We have no valid data of how many HCWs have been infected since the Hungarian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, due to the lack of the systematic screening. HCWs could play a critical role in transmission and might jeopardize the health of both their patients and their own family members.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohorts and randomized controlled studies to determine the association between sedentary behavior and body weight and obesity in adults. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Relevant studies were identified from searches of the MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and PubMed databases up to May 2017, and by manual searches of in-text citations. Studies that evaluated the association in adults between sedentary behavior and body weight or obesity, while controlling for physical activity, were included. Overall, 31 publications met the eligibility criteria, including 23 prospective cohort studies with data that could be extracted for a quantitative meta-analysis, and a single randomized controlled trial. RESULTS There were no significant associations between sedentary behavior and any measure of body weight or obesity, with the exception of waist circumference. For the latter outcome, over a 5-year follow-up period, each 1 h per day increase-from baseline to follow-up-in sedentary behavior was associated with a 0.02 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.04; p = 0.001) increase in waist circumference.

We meta-analyzed the proportion of deaths in different age groups in vaccination versus control periods in countries with low vaccination rates; (2) countries with age-independent vaccination policies; and (3) countries with standard age-dependent vaccination policies. Findings. Countries that prioritized vaccination among older people saw an increasing share of deaths among 0-69 year old people in the vaccination versus the two control periods (summary prevalence ratio 1.32 [95 CI% 1.24-1.41] and 1.35 [95 CI% 1.26-1.44)]. No such change was seen on average in countries with age-independent vaccination policies (1.05 [95 CI% 0.78-1.41 and 0.97 [95 CI% 0.95- 1.00], respectively) and limited vaccination (0.93 [95 CI% 0.85-1.01] and 0.95 [95 CI% 0.87-1.03], respectively). Prevalence ratios were associated with the difference of vaccination rates in elderly versus non-elderly people. No significant changes occurred in the share of deaths in age 0-49 among all 0-69 deaths in the vaccination versus pre-vaccination periods. Interpretation. The substantial shift in the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths in countries that rapidly implemented vaccination predominantly among elderly may herald the population level-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination and a favorable evolution of the pandemic towards endemicity with fewer elderly deaths. Funding. This study received no specific funding.","Pastorino, R.; Pezzullo, A. M.; Villani, L.; Causio, F. A.; Axfors, C.; Contopoulos-Ioannidis, D. G.; Boccia, S.; Ioannidis, J. P.

This means that in addition to scientific and political measures we also need to deal with the imaginative culture generated by the disease that has now permeated every aspect of life in the nightmare figure of the vampire. The essay accordingly draws on a range of sources, from fifteenth-century theories of disease to early models of circulation to contemporary news reports tracking the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, and concludes that ‘thinking with vampires’ can sensitise us to the new realities of pandemic living.","Groom, Nick",The Critical Quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1111/criq.12576,57

However, few studies have directly tested the protective capabilities of microbial pigments applied externally as shielding materials. In this study, liquid cultures of Bacillus subtilis were shielded by various pigment solutions, and solid media cultures of Bacillus subtilis were co-inoculated with the highly pigmented microorganisms Aspergillus niger and Neurospora crassa. These experiments were conducted in a compact, automated payload aboard the International Space Station (ISS) interior for 30 days. Post-flight phenotypic analyses of liquid cultures showed that solutions of carotenoid pigments were effective at minimizing detrimental effects of spaceflight. Elevated growth rate was observed for solid cultures, and distinct morphology changes were identified in both liquid and solid samples and quantified as markers of spaceflight-induced stress. These findings collectively progress our understanding of microbial pigments for the development of space-related applications.","Sharma, S.; Smith, R. S. H.; Lee, N. A.; Wilson, S. L.; Smith, M.

164501,Basic reproduction numbers of three strains of mouse hepatitis viruses in mice,2021-09-24,"Background Molecular interactions have been studied as independent complex networks in systems biology. However, molecular networks dont exist independently of each other. In a network of networks approach (called multiplex), we uncover the design principles for the joint organization of transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results We find that TRN and PPI networks are non-randomly coupled in the TRN-PPI multiplex across five different eukaryotic species. Gene degrees in TRN (number of downstream genes) are positively correlated with protein degrees in PPI (number of interacting protein partners). Gene-gene interactions in TRN and protein-protein interactions in PPI also non-randomly overlap in the multiplex. These design principles are conserved across the five eukaryotic species. We show that the robustness of the TRN-PPI multiplex is dependent on these design principles. Further, functionally important genes and proteins, such as essential, disease-related and those involved in host-pathogen PPI networks, are preferentially situated in essential parts of the human multiplex with highly overlapping interactions. Conclusion We unveil the multiplex architecture of TRN and PPI networks across different species. Multiplex architecture may thus define a general framework for studying molecular networks across the different species of life. This approach may uncover the building blocks of the hierarchical organization of molecular interactions.","Mahajan, Tarun; Dar, Roy D",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.233304,57

We set out to examine the initial pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection among different racial and ethnic groups in a large multiracial city in the United States and investigate the implications for containing possible future outbreaks. Design. Cross-sectional study. Methods. We accessed racially stratified data released daily by the Chicago Department of Public Health and analyzed the ethic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infections and fatalities over a 30-day period at the outset of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Chicago. We computed the point prevalence and the cause-specific mortality rates for White, Hispanic, and African Americans to compare infection and death rates among Hispanics and African Americans relative to Whites. Results. We found that the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among Hispanics and African Americans, respectively, were 1.59 and 2.38 times the infection rate among the White population in Chicago. The corresponding death rates for Hispanics and African Americans, respectively, were 1.29 and 3.65 times the death rate in the White population. When infection and death rates for African Americans vs Whites were analyzed (using Mann-Whitney U testing), the P value was <.0001 for both measures, demonstrating statistical significance. Comparing these same measures for Hispanic vs Whites, neither the infection rates (P=.1091) nor death rates (P=.3817) reached a level of statistical significance. Conclusion. During the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, Hispanic and African American Chicagoans were infected and died at greater rates than Whites. Multiple factors likely account for these differences;however, controlling these factors could have the effect of mitigating the initial impact of the disease in the most affected population groups and reducing the overall magnitude of the disease in the United States. © 2021 Cliggott Publishing Co..

164569,Energy dynamics for systemic configurations of virus-host co-evolution,2020-05-15,"In this paper, we propose a novel super-resolution and infection edge detection co-guided learning network for COVID-19 CT segmentation (CogSeg). Our CogSeg is a coherent framework consisting of two branches. Specifically, we use image super-resolution (SR) as an auxiliary task, which assist segmentation to recover high-resolution representations. Moreover, we propose an infection edge detection guided region mutual information (RMI) loss, which uses the edge detection results of segmentation to explicitly maintain the high order consistency between segmentation prediction and ground truth around infection edge pixels. Our CogSeg network can effectively maintain high-resolution representation and leverages edge details to improve the segmentation performance. When evaluated on two publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets, our CogSeg improves 10.63 and 13.02 points than the established baseline method (i.e. U-Net) w.t.r mIoU. Moreover, our CogSeg achieves more appealing results both quantitatively and qualitatively than the state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 IEEE.","Sang, Y.; Sun, J.; Wang, S.; Qi, H.; Li, K.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icassp39728.2021.9414327,57

Particularly, trajectories of domain-specific and domain-general cognitive functions and how cognition interacts with mood, fatigue, and quality of life are not well described. Aims: To determine the prevalence, trajectories and wider impact of domain specific cognitive impairment in long term stroke survivors, in relation to mood, fatigue, and quality of life. Methods: Participants who previously took part in the Oxford Cognitive Screening study, completed the 6 month follow up with cognitive, mood, fatigue, and quality of life assessments and agreed to be contacted for future research will be recruited into OX-CHRONIC. The eligible cohort is between 2- and 9-years post stroke. Cognition will be assessed with a detailed neuropsychological battery, alongside questionnaire measures of mood, fatigue, activities of daily life and quality of life measures at two timepoints, one year apart. Additionally, medical records will be accessed to extract further clinical information about the stroke and patients may opt-in to wear an activity monitor for one week to provide fine-grained measures of sleep and activity. The study protocol and study materials were approved by the national ethics committee (REC Ref:19/SC/0520). Planned outputs: OX-CHRONIC will provide detailed data on the evolving cognitive profiles of stroke survivors over several years post-stroke.

To this end, we first learn a generative font space with non-negative matrix factorization from a set of classic fonts. In this space we generate new true-type-fonts through active learning, render texts with the new font, and measure individual users' reading speed. Bayesian optimization sequentially generates new fonts on the fly to progressively increase individuals' reading speed. The results of a user study show that this adaptive font generation system finds regions in the font space corresponding to high reading speeds, that these fonts significantly increase participants' reading speed, and that the found fonts are significantly different across individual readers.","Kadner, Florian; Keller, Yannik; Rothkopf, Constantin A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10741v1.pdf,57

Better pre-conceptional maternal nutrition improves the nutrition of the early embryo. Vitamins B12 and folate are important for fetal neural development. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in India. Methods: In the Pune Rural Intervention in Young Adolescents (PRIYA) adolescents (N=557, 226 females) were provided with vitamin B12 (2g/day) with or without multiple micronutrients, or a placebo, from preconception until delivery. All groups received mandatory iron and folic acid. We used the Bayleys Scale of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 24-42 months of age to investigate effects on offspring neurodevelopment. We examined cord blood concentrations of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Results: Participants in the three groups had similar baseline B12 levels. These improved in the B12 supplemented groups at pre-conceptional and pregnancy (28 weeks gestation) measurements, reflected in higher cord holo-TC levels compared to the placebo. Neurodevelopmental outcomes are available for 74 children. Offspring in the B12 alone group (n=21) performed better than the placebo (n=27) on cognition (p=0.044) and language (p=0.020) domains (adjusted for maternal baseline B12 levels). There were no differences between the B12+MMN (n=26) and placebo group. Cord blood BDNF levels were highest in the B12 alone group (not statistically significant). Conclusion: Pre-conceptional vitamin B12 supplementation improved maternal B12 status and offspring neurodevelopment at 2 years of age. The usefulness of cord BDNF as a marker of brain development needs further investigation. Our results highlight the importance of intervening in the pre-conceptional period.","D'souza, N.; Behere, R.

However, many methods used for influenza research and vaccine development require sequence editing and protein expression, limiting their applicability and the progress of related research to specialists. Rapid tools allowing even novice influenza researchers to properly analyze and visualize influenza protein sequences with accurate nomenclature are needed to expand the research field. To address this need, we developed Librator, a system for analyzing and designing protein sequences of influenza virus Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA). With Librator’s graphical user interface (GUI) and built-in sequence editing functions, biologists can easily analyze influenza sequences and phylogenies, automatically port sequences to visualize structures, then readily mutate target residues and design sequences for antigen probes and chimeric/mosaic proteins efficiently and accurately. This system provides optimized fragment design for Gibson Assembly5 of HA and NA expression constructs based on peptide conservation of all historical HA and NA sequences, ensuring fragments are reusable and compatible, allowing for significant reagent savings. Use of Librator will significantly facilitate influenza research and vaccine antigen design.","Li, Lei; Stovicek, Olivia; Guthmiller, Jenna J.; Changrob, Siriruk; Fu, Yanbin; Dugan, Haley L.; Stamper, Christopher T.; Zheng, Nai-Ying; Huang, Min; Wilson, Patrick C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.441999,57

The E484K and L452R amino acid substitutions on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with reduced neutralization by antibodies from acquired immunity. This study examines the respective association of these mutations with infection in persons who had previously received a COVID-19 vaccine. Methods. Genetic sequences from SARS-CoV-2 specimens collected from Maryland residents and reported to Maryland Department of Health were linked to vaccination history. The prevalence of infections in fully vaccinated persons -- defined as being at least two weeks past receiving the final scheduled dose of a COVID-19 vaccine series -- was compared between infections caused by viruses carrying E484K to those not carrying E484K, and between infections caused by viruses carrying L452R to those not carrying L452R, using logistic regression to adjust for confounding. Results. Of 9,048 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 specimens examined, 265 (2.9%) were collected from fully vaccinated persons. In adjusted analysis, the E484K substitution was associated with an increase in the odds of the sequenced specimen being collected from a fully vaccinated person (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.83). The L452R mutation was not significantly associated with infections in vaccinated persons (OR 1.07, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.68). Conclusion. Though more than 97% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were in persons who were not fully vaccinated, the E484K mutation was associated with increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated persons. Linking vaccination and sequencing data can help identify and estimate the impact SARS-CoV-2 mutations may have on vaccine effectiveness.","Feder, K. A.; Patel, A.; Vepachedu, V.

Design - Case-crossover study comparing recent (1-14 days after vaccination) with less recent exposure to vaccination among cases of CVT. Setting - National data for Scotland from 1 December 2020, with diagnosed CVT case ascertainment through neuroimaging studies up to 17 May 2021 and diagnostic coding of hospital discharges up to 28 April 2021 and with linkage to vaccination records. Main outcome measure - Primary acute cerebral venous thrombosis Results - Of 50 primary acute CVT cases, 29 were ascertained only from neuroimaging studies, 2 were ascertained only from hospital discharges, and 19 were ascertained from both sources. Of these 50 cases, 14 had received the Astra-Zeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine and 3 the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. The incidence of CVT per million doses in the first 14 days after vaccination was 2.2 (95% credible interval 0.9 to 4.1) for ChAdOx1 and 1 (95% credible interval 0.1 to 2.9) for BNT162b2. The rate ratio for CVT associated with exposure to ChAdOx1-S in the first 14 days compared with exposure 15-84 days after vaccination was 3.2 (95% credible interval 1.1 to 9.5). The 95% credible interval for the rate ratio associated with recent versus less recent exposure to BNT162b2 (0.6 to 95.8) was too wide for useful inference. Conclusions - These findings support a causal association between CVT and the AstraZeneca vaccine with too few cases with Pfizer vaccine to make inference on any causal relationship. The absolute risk of post-vaccination CVT in this population-wide study in Scotland was lower than has been reported for populations in Scandinavia and Germany; the reasons for this remain to be established.","McKeigue, P.

Specifically, there is little research synthesising the prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders in people with cerebral palsy, and there is no summary of the instruments used to measure this. This systematic review will summarise the current body of evidence investigating psychiatric disorders in people with cerebral palsy, as well as the measurement or diagnostic instruments used to measure psychiatric disorder. Findings: To be included in the review, articles must report on psychiatric disorders in people with cerebral palsy or use standardised tools that allow for clinical thresholds to be derived, written in English, and published after 1980. A comprehensive, electronic database search strategy will be implemented targeting relevant papers indexed in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and PubMed. Searches will include terms that relate to psychiatric disorders (E.g., mood disorders, anxiety disorders, ADHD, autism) in people with cerebral palsy. Data will be extracted based on age, psychiatric disorder, and cerebral palsy severity. We will summarise the findings as a narrative and will provide overall prevalence estimates for psychiatric disorders. Discussion: The systematic review will provide novel insights into the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in people with cerebral palsy. It will also provide recommendations about the types of instruments that have been used and implemented in health research related to cerebral palsy.

Here we investigate early life influences on immune expression profiles using a natural population of field voles, Microtus agrestis, in which we are able to monitor variation between and within individuals though time by repeat (longitudinal) sampling of individually marked animals. We analysed the co-expression of 20 immune genes in early life to create a correlational network consisting of three main clusters, one of which (containing Gata3, Il10 and Il17) was associated with later life reproductive success and susceptibility to chronic bacterial (Bartonella) infection. More detailed analyses supported associations between early life expression of Il17 and reproductive success later in life, and of increased Il10 expression early in life and later infection with Bartonella. We also found significant association between an Il17 genotype and the early life expression of Il10. Our results demonstrate that immune expression profiles can be manifested during early life with effects that persist through adulthood and that shape the variability among individuals in susceptibility to infection and fitness widely seen in natural populations.","Wanelik, Klara M; Begon, Mike; Bradley, Janette E; Friberg, Ida M; Taylor, Christopher H; Jackson, Joseph A; Paterson, Steve",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.08.463659,57

Design/methodology/approach: The COVID-19 pandemic created a wide variety of problems for higher education. Classes moved quickly from in-person to virtual instruction with little time for training;faculty and students had to adapt to new learning platforms, learning styles, study techniques and technological challenges. Emotions ran high due to constant change, transitions and numerous unknowns. The LC structure embedded in the curriculum of this US medical school aided in the navigation of these challenges. Findings: Of the 95 MD1–MD4 respondents combined who responded to the COVID-19 LC survey, 67% rated the LC sessions good/outstanding, 20% average, 7% poor/fair and 5% N/A. When asked if LCs had helped them during the pandemic, overall, 66% said “yes” and 34% said “no.” When asked how LCs have helped during the pandemic, themes emerged related to safety, adapting to feelings of isolation/mental health/emotional support, and academic progress. Originality/value: The small LC group structure created a sense of security for receiving academic help, emotional support, a network of assistance resources and a place to process COVID-19 losses and insecurities. Receptivity to utilizing the LC structure for support may relate to the medical students' commitment to addressing health disparities, serving the underserved and embracing a medical school culture that values community. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mitchell, A.

172725,Bias invariant RNA-seq metadata annotation,2020-11-27,"Filoviruses are prime examples of emerging human pathogens that are transmitted to humans by zoonotic spillover events. Since their initial discovery, filovirus outbreaks have occured with increasing frequency and intensity. There is an urgent need to better understand their enzootic ecology and pathogenic potential, given recent zoonotic virus spillover events including the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic. Several novel filoviruses have been discovered with a markedly wider geographic distribution than previously described. One of these novel filoviruses, Lloviu virus (LLOV), was first identified in 2002 in Schreiber’s bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Spain, Portugal, and southern France. Subsequently, in 2016, LLOV was detected during the passive monitoring of bats in Hungary. Here we report the first isolation of infectious Lloviu virus; from the blood of an asymptomatic Schreiber’s bat, subsequently cultivated in the Miniopterus sp. kidney cell line SuBK12-08. We also show that LLOV is able to infect monkey and human cells, suggesting that LLOV might have spillover potential. We performed a multi-year surveillance of LLOV and detected LLOV RNA in both deceased and asymptomatic live animals as well as in coupled ectoparasites from the families Nycteribiidae and Ixodidae. We present data on the natural infection and seropositivity of Schreiber’s bats and provide novel LLOV genomic sequence information from a bat host and an arthropod parasite. Our data support the role of bats, specifically Miniopterus schreibersii as natural reservoirs for the LLOV filovirus in Europe. We also suggest that bat-associated parasites might play a role in the natural ecology of filoviruses in temperate climate regions compared to filoviruses in the tropics. These results raise the possibility of cross-species transmission events via bat-human interactions.","Kemenesi, Gábor; Tóth, Gábor Endre; Mayora-Neto, Martin; Scott, Simon; Temperton, Nigel; Wright, Edward; Mühlberger, Elke; Hume, Adam J.; Zana, Brigitta; Boldogh, Sándor András; Görföl, Tamás; Estók, Péter; Lanszki, Zsófia; Somogyi, Balázs A.; Nagy, Ágnes; Pereszlényi, Csaba István; Dudás, Gábor; Földes, Fanni; Kurucz, Kornélia; Madai, Mónika; Zeghbib, Safia; Maes, Piet; Vanmechelen, Bert; Jakab, Ferenc",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.10.455806,57
174307,Protection against avian coronavirus conferred by oral vaccination with live bacteria secreting LTB-fused viral proteins,2021-10-04,"AimCOVID-19 clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases. While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. MethodsThe systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. ResultsSeventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR = 2.65 (1.81-3.90)), male sex (OR = 2.05(1.39-3.04)) and severe obesity (OR = 2.57 (1.31-5.05)). Active cancer (OR = 1.46 (1.04-2.04)) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles. ConclusionsBased on the findings of this study, a range of easily assessed parameters are valuable to predict elevated risk of severe illness and mortality as a result of COVID-19, including patient characteristics and detailed comorbidities, alongside the novel inclusion of real-time symptoms and vital measurements.","Booth, Adam; Reed, Angus Bruno; Ponzo, Sonia; Yassaee, Arrash; Aral, Mert; Plans, David; Labrique, Alain; Mohan, Diwakar",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248610,57

The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented stressors on teachers. However, the article problematises and goes beyond the dominant narrative of ‘sudden crisis’ on the grounds that this may obscure the complex realities of a profession suffering mental health challenges well before the pandemic. The authors highlight their concerns about the predominant discourse surrounding teachers’ wellbeing, the inefficacy of tokenistic interventions, and offer a more holistic, context-sensitive conceptualisation of ‘being-well’, rooted in love and compassion for oneself and each other.From the lens of positive sociology, the authors call for structurally contextualised wellbeing provision that recognises teachers’ pre-existing pressures and stressors and sustains cultures of care beyond the temporal boundaries of the pandemic. Drawing on the ethic of care, they advocare a shift from ‘the duty of care’ to ‘a duty to care’. Wellbeing and struggling are conceptualised here as interrelated and co-dependent phenomena influenced by theories of compassion, including Buddhist notions of Love Mode and Power Mode. The authors see love as connectedness and emphasise the importance of relationality in teachers’ sense of being-well as individuals who interconnect in a complex education system.

SARS-CoV-2 utilises the catalytic site of full-length membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry causing downregulation of tissue ACE2. We reported downregulation of cardiac ACE2 is associated with increased plasma ACE2 activity. In this prospective observational study in recovered COVID-19 patients, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 from cell membranes and increased plasma ACE2 activity. MethodsWe measured plasma ACE2 catalytic activity using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay in a cohort of Australians aged [â¥]18 years (n=66) who had recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR testing) and age and gender matched uninfected controls (n=70). Serial samples were available in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. ResultsPlasma ACE2 activity at a median of 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-38 days] was 97-fold higher in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p<0.0001). There was a significant difference in plasma ACE2 activity according to disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19 associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (p=0.027). Men (n=39) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive had higher median plasma ACE2 levels compared to women (n=27) (p<0.0001). We next analysed whether an elevated plasma ACE2 activity level persisted following SARS-CoV-2 infection in subjects with blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post infection. Plasma ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated in almost all subjects, with no significant differences between timepoints in post-hoc comparisons (p>0.05). DiscussionThis is the first description that plasma ACE2 activity is elevated after COVID-19 infection, and the first with longitudinal data indicating plasma ACE2 activity remains elevated out to a median of 114 days post-infection. Larger studies are now needed to determine if persistent elevated plasma ACE2 activity identifies people at risk of prolonged illness following COVID-19.","Patel, Sheila K; Juno, Jennifer A; Hogarth, P Mark; Lee, Wen Shi; Kent, Stephen J; Burrell, Louise M",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.20207514,57

Based on these projections, individuals and governments have advocated lifting containment measures such as social distancing to shift the peak forward and limit societal and economic disruption. Paradoxically, the COVID-19 pandemic data exhibits phenomenology opposite to the projections of the SIR models. Here, we present a new model that replicates the observed phenomenology and quantitates pandemic dynamics with simple and actionable analytical tools for policy makers. Specifically, it offers a prescription of achievable and economically palatable measures for ending an epidemic.","Duclos, T. G.; Reichert, T.

Distance learning has limited learning tools and media that can be used such as instant messaging applications video recording and video conferencing. Entrepreneurship courses are taught using video and instant messages and are expected to achieve learner goals making students have an interest in becoming an entrepreneur after graduation. The use of learning media during PJJ needs to be seen on the level of its influence on learning objectives therefore it is necessary to see whether there are differences in the level of student entrepreneurial interest based on video and instant messages. There were 128 students who received entrepreneurship courses as the research sample and the t-test method was used to determine whether there was a difference between the two media. The test results show that the level of student interest in entrepreneurship is in the low category and there is no difference in the effect of the use of video and instant messages on student interest in entrepreneurship.,"Siti, Martiah; Dian, Theodora Berta",Jurnal Pendidikan Ekonomi (JUPE),https://doi.org/10.26740/jupe.v9n2.p48-53,57

We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 measures on sexual behaviour, and to characterize heterosexuals who were at high risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infection (STI) during the pandemic. A longitudinal cohort study (2016- 2020) was conducted among Dutch heterosexual males and females aged 21-28 years in 2020. We used data on behavioural and psychological characteristics from: pre-lockdown (June-August 2019), lockdown (March-May 2020), and postlockdown (June-August 2020). Behaviour change was compared between subgroups identified with latent class analysis. Four latent classes were identified (n=239). Individuals in class 1 (48% of study population) and 2 (36%) were at low risk of acquiring STI pre-lockdown, during, and post-lockdown, and reported mostly steady partnerships. Individuals in class 3 (9%) and 4 (7%) reported multiple casual partners pre-lockdown, and class 4 continued having multiple partners during lockdown (56% reported same/increased partner numbers compared to pre-lockdown versus 18% in class 3). Class 4 was characterized by less condom use, lower health goals, less positive STI/COVID-19 prevention attitudes, and higher impulsiveness compared to class 3. Post-lockdown, 36% in class 3 and 42% in class 4 reported same/increased partner numbers compared to pre-lockdown. Of individuals who wanted an STI test during or post-lockdown in class 3 (57%) and 4 (75%), 62% and 56% respectively did not get tested, mainly because they were not able to get an appointment. STI risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was low in most heterosexuals, but specific subgroups engaged in high-risk behaviour during lockdown and post-lockdown. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, impulsive individuals with low health goals and less positive infection prevention attitudes should be prioritized for STI testing, and targeted with behavioural interventions tailored to these psychological characteristics..","van Wees, D.; Godijk, N.; den Daas, C.; Kretzschmar, M.; Heijne, J.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.331,57

This article presents the findings of a study conducted during the lockdown among school heads in primary and secondary schools. The authors identify the challenges and issues the school heads faced in the first weeks of the epidemic and examine the positive experiences that may represent examples of good practice for dealing with similar problems in the future. The study was carried out through an online questionnaire containing 12 single-answer and multiple-choice questions and one Likert-type scale. The school heads were free to write their answers to two open-ended questions. The findings show that schools responded quickly to the changed circumstances and continued to deliver education to their students without interruption, although their approaches differed significantly. A great deal of improvisation was observed, as was to be expected, as the state did not have a pre-prepared plan and was not able to provide a quick and adequate response.","Ermenc, K.

Around 100 years ago, Nikola Tesla proposed a flow control device intended to operate similarly to an electronic diode, allowing fluid to pass easily in one direction but providing high resistance in reverse. Here we use experimental tests of Tesla's diode to illustrate principles of the electronic-hydraulic analogy. We design and construct a differential pressure chamber (akin to a battery) that is used to measure flow rate (current) and thus resistance of a given pipe or channel (circuit element). Our results prove the validity of Tesla's device, whose anisotropic resistance derives from its asymmetric internal geometry interacting with high-inertia flows, as quantified by the Reynolds number (here, Re ~ 1e3). Through the design and testing of new fluidic diodes, we explore the limitations of the analogy and the challenges of shape optimization in fluid mechanics. We also provide materials that may be incorporated into lesson plans for fluid dynamics courses, laboratory modules and further research projects.","Nguyen, Quynh M.; Huang, Dean; Zauderer, Evan; Romanelli, Genevieve; Meyer, Charlotte L.; Ristroph, Leif",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14813v1.pdf,57
177648,"Clusters consisting only of virus types with two mutations in the helicase found by Autoencoder analysis in Washington State, USA",2021-07-22,"Adenoviruses (AdVs) are prevalent and give rise to chronic and recurrent disease. The human AdV (HAdV) species B and C, such as HAdV-C2, C5 and B14, cause respiratory disease, and constitute a health threat for immuno-compromised individuals. HAdV-Cs are well known for lysing cells, owing to the E3 CR1-β-encoded adenovirus death protein (ADP). We previously reported a high-throughput image-based screening framework and identified an inhibitor of HAdV-C2 multi-round infection, Nelfinavir Mesylate. Nelfinavir is the active ingredient of Viracept, an FDA-approved inhibitor of the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) aspartyl protease, and used to treat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is not effective against single round HAdV infections. Here, we show that Nelfinavir inhibits the lytic cell-free transmission of HAdV, indicated by the suppression of comet-shaped infection foci in cell culture. Comet-shaped foci occur upon convection-based transmission of cell-free viral particles from an infected cell to neighbouring uninfected cells. HAdV lacking ADP was insensitive to Nelfinavir, but gave rise to comet-shaped foci indicating that ADP enhances but is not required for cell lysis. This was supported by the notion that HAdV-B14 and B14p1 lacking ADP were highly sensitive to Nelfinavir, although HAdV-A31, B3, B7, B11, B16, B21, D8, D30 or D37 were less sensitive. Conspicuously, Nelfinavir uncovered slow-growing round-shaped HAdV-C2 foci, independent of neutralizing antibodies in the medium, indicative of non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission. Our study demonstrates the repurposing potential of Nelfinavir with post-exposure efficacy against different HAdVs, and describes an alternative non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission mode of HAdV.

Methods Online surveys were sent to 285 Canadian and American surgeons in late April and early May 2020. Results Response rate was 63% (180)-84% (152) American and 16% (28) Canadian. Forty-three percent (76) of respondents were in private practice, 36% (64) academics, 13% (24) privademics, and 6% (12) hospital employed. The most common telemedicine platform was Zoom. During the pandemic, 42% of patient visits were conducted via telemedicine;however, 37% required a subsequent in-person office visit. The most common complaint by surgeons was the inability to provide routine in-office procedures. The most beneficial feature was ease of use, and the most frustrating feature was connectivity difficulty. Time spent was similar to in-person visits, and surgeons were likely to recommend their platforms. Surgeons were neutral about using telehealth in the future and were most likely to use it for follow-up visits. New patient visits for traumatic injuries or fractures were of limited value. Canadians used telemedicine for a greater proportion than Americans (50 vs. 40%, p &lt;0.05) and spent more time than in-person visits (7/10 vs. 5/10, p &lt;0.05). Americans were more likely to use telemedicine for postoperative follow-up visits (6/10 vs. 4/10, p &lt;0.05) and in mornings before clinic opens (4/10 vs. 2/10, p &lt;0.05).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19-related lockdown on the PM concentrations in the North, Central, and South Zones of Cerrejon, Colombia, the largest open-pit coal mine in Latin America. To compare the levels before and during the emergency shutdown, we analyzed both the ground-based daily PM10 and PM2.5 data and the satellite (Terra/Aqua MODIS)-based daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) values from March 6 through April 13, 2020. The average PM10 concentrations in the North and South Zones, in contrast to those observed at other global monitoring sites, increased by 13-38% and 4-7%, respectively, although they decreased by 26-31% in the Central Zone, between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods. Furthermore, during the latter, the daily PM2.5 levels in the South Zone rose by up to 43%, and we found higher AOD values (>= 0.4) over the Central and South Zones as well as significant AOD-contributing loads upwind and downwind of the coal production pits. Finally, the increases in humidity and temperature (>= 3.5% and > 0.3 K, respectively), decrease in planetary boundary layer height (>= 0.11 km), wind field variability, and rural biomass burning events shaped the spatial-temporal behavior of the PM in this region, and changes in meteorology and external sources nearly offset the reduction in emissions from mining activities. These results establish a baseline for developing future regulations and mitigation plans.","Arregoces, H.

On the other hand, only few studies have focused on small molecule drugs capable of unleashing NK cell against cancer. In this context, repurposing small molecule is an attractive strategy to identify new immunotherapies from already approved drugs. Here, we screened 1,200 FDA-approved drugs from the Prestwick Chemical Library, to identify compounds that increase NK cell cytotoxic potential. Using a high-throughput luciferase-release cytotoxicity assay, we found that the antibiotic colistin sulfate increased cytotoxicity of human NK cells towards cancer cells. The effect of colistin was short lived and was not observed when NK cells were pretreated with the drug, showing how NK cell activity was potentiated only when the compound was present at the time of recognition of cancer cells. Further studies are needed to uncover the mechanism of action and the pre-clinical efficacy of colistin sulfate in mouse cancer models.","Cortés-Kaplan, Serena; Hasim, Mohammed S.; Kaczmarek, Shelby; Taha, Zaid; Maznyi, Glib; McComb, Scott; Lee, Seung-Hwan; Diallo, Jean-Simon; Ardolino, Michele",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.20.457155,57

We evaluated the association between recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine (RZV) and COVID-19 outcomes at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Methods: In a cohort design, adults aged [≥]50 years who received [≥]1 RZV dose prior to 3/1/2020 were matched 1:2 to unvaccinated individuals and followed until 12/31/2020. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for COVID-19 outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. In a test-negative design, cases had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and controls had only negative tests, from 3/1/2020-12/31/2020. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% CIs for prior receipt of RZV were estimated using logistic regression. Results: In the cohort design, 149,244 RZV recipients were matched to 298,488 unvaccinated individuals. The aHRs (95% CI) for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization were 0.84 (0.81-0.87) and 0.68 (0.64-0.74), respectively. In the test-negative design, 8.4% of 75,726 test-positive cases and 13.1% of 340,898 test-negative controls had received [≥]1 RZV dose. The aOR (95% CI) was 0.84 (0.81-0.86).

The main research problem of the paper is formulated in the form of a question concerning the impact of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of the Zielony in Poland in commercial transactions by entities belonging to the local currency system. In order to achieve the objective and solve the main problem, the article uses such research methods as: the method of critical analysis of literature, historical method, statistical method, comparative method, observational method, free expert interview, as well as analysis and synthesis, deduction and induction and abstraction. We conducted a critical analysis of the literature and analysis of statistical data of the complementary currency Zielony in Poland in the period from March 2015 to June 2021, and the results of the expert interview showed that this currency is not a tool to support the functioning of local economy entities during non-financial crises, such as COVID-19 pandemic. This is influenced by, among other things, full or partial lockdown and other restrictions on the functioning of commercial entities during a pandemic. The consequences of such solutions include the weakening of economic activity and a decrease in the value of turnover of entities operating in various sectors of the local economy, especially entities of a service nature, which constitute about 80% of the structure of the Zielony complementary currency system in Poland. The main conclusion resulting from the conducted research is as follows: the complementary currency Zielony in Poland can influence the creation of local entrepreneurship and sustainable development and support the activities of the sector of small- and medium-sized enterprises, but these benefits are possible to achieve primarily in conditions of stable and undisturbed functioning of the economy. The realization of the payment function of the complementary currency, the Zielony, and its use in payments of entities belonging to those industries covered by lockdown and other administrative restrictions is impossible (or insignificant) at this time due to the absence (or hindered) of its circulation in the economy. The research results and conclusions presented in the article meet the assumptions of the application objective and can provide the entities of the micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprise sector with knowledge about the dependencies resulting from the use of the complementary currency in the lockdown period by the entities that implement the assumptions of the system of complementary currencies.","Stępnicka, Nina Zimon Grzegorz Brzozowiec Dariusz",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169184,57

The next step in the methodological framework was to estimate the influence of different factors on the self-sufficiency ratio, as it depends on natural, financial, economic, and political factors. The results show that the SEE region expresses a high level of SSR in food, so it shows that the region is quite ready to respond to the challenges posed by the crisis. However, as the SEE region is a group of very different countries, regional cooperation should be strengthened as food production is considered. © 2021 by the authors.

182742,T cell memory specific for self and non-self antigens in rats persistently infected with Borna disease virus.,1993-09-11,"Since December 2019, Wuhan has became an outbreak epicentre of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. This study inferred the epidemic spread in Wuhan, which is of great importance for government immediately deployed mitigation interventions. In view of the fact that the virus is infectious during the incubation period, we added new variables to the SEIR model. We used the data published by Wuhan government from Dec 8, 2019, to Feb 4, 2020 to forecast the spreading trend and the number of infected people, then simulated the results of different government control efforts by changing the control variables. Furthermore, we used mathematical formulas to infer the basic reproduction number, and then calculated the probability of the neighbor being infected at each time step, simulated the epidemic course of epidemic by using the cellular automata model. Our finding suggested that the epidemic outbreak earlier under the government’s powerful control measures and the outbreak period begin on mid-January, then reach a peak on the mid-February. The cumulative number of infections in Wuhan would be controlled at 58310. More importantly, The basic reproduction number is 3.13, which indicated that the virus is high risk. Simultaneously, the cellular automata model is very suitable for simulating the spread course after the public health interventions.","Wang, SiYou Fang Hui Ma ZhiHong Wang XiuFen",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1533/4/042065,57
182755,Translational diffusion of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules is constrained by their cytoplasmic domains,1989-12-01,"This review summarizes relevant scientific literature analyzing the lung-gut axis and its association with coronavirus infection (COVID-19), lesions to the gastrointestinal tract caused by this infection, and state of the microbiome. Approximately 20%–50% of COVID-19 patients have such symptoms as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in their feces. Therefore, investigation of the virus effect on the gastrointestinal tract and its commensal flora is important not only for research purposes, but for clinical practice, since patients with COVID-19 demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative changes in their microbiome. The latter may serve as a basis for the development of additional probiotic therapy for gastrointestinal lesions in COVID-19 patients. Despite the existing evidence, it is still necessary to clarify the effect of the intestinal microbiome on the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection and the disease course. © 2021, Dynasty Publishing House.

DESIGNLiving systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCESEligible publications identified from >500 databases indexed through 31st July 2020 and additional studies from reference lists, with planned continual surveillance for at least two years. STUDY SELECTIONObservational and interventional studies that report on the association between cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. DATA EXTRACTIONSingle-reviewer extraction and quality evaluation (using ROBINS-I), with half the records independently extracted and evaluated by a second reviewer. RESULTSOf 23,427 titles screened, 175 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. The most reported drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with ACEI/ARB exposure being associated with higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled unadjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30). Among patients with COVID-19, unadjusted estimates showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with being hospitalized (OR 2.25, 1.70 to 2.98) and having severe disease (OR 1.50, 1.27 to 1.77) but not with the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.45, -1.33 to 0.43 days) or all-cause mortality (OR 1.25, CI 0.98 to 1.58). However, after adjustment, ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with testing positive for COVID-19 (pooled adjusted OR 1.01, 0.93 to 1.10), being hospitalized (OR 1.16, 0.80 to 1.68), having severe disease (1.04, 0.76 to 1.42), or all-cause mortality (0.86, 0.64 to 1.15). Similarly, subgroup analyses involving only hypertensive patients revealed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with being hospitalized (OR 0.84, 0.58 to 1.22), disease severity (OR 0.88, 0.68 to 1.14) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.77, 0.54 to 1.12) while it decreased the length of hospitalization (mean difference -0.71, -1.11 to -0.30 days). After adjusting for relevant covariates, other cardiovascular drug classes were mostly not found to be associated with poor COVID-19 clinical outcomes. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high level of heterogeneity in terms of effect sizes and a serious risk of bias, mainly due to confounding in the included studies. CONCLUSIONOur comprehensive review shows that ACEI/ARB exposure is associated with COVID-19 outcomes such as susceptibility to infection, severity, and hospitalization in unadjusted analyses. However, after adjusting for potential confounding factors, this association is not evident. Patients on cardiovascular drugs should continue taking their medications as currently recommended. Higher quality evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine any adverse or beneficial effects of cardiovascular drugs.

One of the effects is the change in interaction and communication patterns within a family. Nurses are required to have a perspective on family care needs, so indirectly the role of nurses to provide family care, communication and interaction must be well established. Communication is needed to build family resilience in responding to COVID-19. A literature review was conducted using electronic databases such as ProQuest and Pubmed. The search identified 9 relevant articles on family nursing care;while 2 articles address the main topic, 7 articles and 1 book were considered as supporting data. Family nursing care implements a component such as communication or conversation between nurses and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. The studies emphasize the importance of family nursing care during the pandemic, and stress the need for the nurse to understand and incorporate individual family circumstances into the discussion. This will allow them to help promote the optimal family functioning and protect the health of family members.","Patungo, V.; Thome, A. L.; Nompo, R.

Many African countries? fragile health and transportation systems have been further weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic. This literature review confirms the interdependence of the key functional areas of comprehensive development planning and the importance of building and maintaining a sound transportation infrastructure. With respect to partnerships with China, African nations need to strengthen government functional areas more comprehensively, considering all of the areas of development planning including trade as well as transportation and aid issues. It is all the more apparent given the COVID-19 pandemic that these trade deals need to include simultaneous heavy investments in healthcare, education, housing, public utilities (water and electricity), and economic development through improved supply chain management and the use of advanced digital technology. In addition to the deal structures for China?s investments in Africa?s transportation infrastructure, there are also opportunities to reimagine the African nations? internal transportation spending. For example, there are models in the United States for using transportation funds to invest in health clinics in transit stations. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought this issue to bear, and it is a problem that can be rectified with ?comprehensive? development planning that takes into account all of the key functional areas of planning: healthcare, environmental protection, safety, education, housing, economic development, and transportation. Five recommendations follow the literature review and discussion.","Hamilton, Clovia Maliphol Sira",Transportation Research Record,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981211031228,57
182766,Distinct molecular mechanisms for protein sorting within immature secretory granules of pancreatic beta-cells,1994-07-01,"This paper examines the current state of knowledge focusing on the second-order impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic through a geospatial lens. The purpose is twofold: (1) present a global programme – Cities’ COVID Mitigation Mapping (C2M2) programme – focusing on urban areas that explores second-order impacts through the use of geospatial tools and technologies, and (2) identify and assess the emerging literature on second-order impacts using geospatial data and analysis to support this project. Effects of the pandemic are rapidly unfolding across the world;however, an assessment of the literature reveals that second-order impacts of COVID-19 are seasonal, spatial, and scalar across multiple thematic areas includ-ing the economy, environmental health sector, education, and migration/mobility. Successive waves of the pandemic are continuing to be met with specific public health measures (e.g. lockdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing guidance, mandates for the use of personal protective equipment) that will have long-term impacts on vulnerable populations. A literature review was conducted to identify how the pandemic’s second-order impacts derived from geospatial data and analysis can provide the basis for using geospatial data to study vulnerable urban populations more generally. This review reveals a gap in the literature, with far more articles emphasizing geospatial approaches to assess first-order impacts and alimited number of articles focused on geospatial approaches investigating second-order impacts. Nonetheless, this nascent literature provides the basis for designing approaches with local partners and by local and regional governments to apply geospatial data and methodologies to the development of mitigation strategies to prioritize limited resources to minimize the long-term consequences of COVID-19.

182769,Targeting of protein ERGIC-53 to the ER/ERGIC/cis-Golgi recycling pathway,1995-10-01,"COVID-19 pandemic consequences are tragic, and many problems will persist after the health problem ends. Some studies have focused on mental health issues, reporting worrying percentages. It is known that there is a bidirectional relationship between mental health and sleep quality, and it would be expected that sleep would be affected by the pandemic. In order to know the Portuguese people’s habits before and during the confinement, we carried out a survey of 188 people aged 13 to 84 (38 ± 15) to find out the most frequent sleep patterns, habits and disorders before and during confinement. With this survey it was also intended to measure the most frequent changes in sleep patterns, habits, and disturbances on the general population and according to demographic data (gender, age group and professional status), sleep disorders arise, perceptions about sleep during confinement and if Portuguese think that in the future the sleep patterns will be the pre or during outbreak. Results indicate that, comparing before and during confinement, there is a slight correlation between gender and sleep disorders (before vs. during), a correlation between age group and professional status time to wake up, and between professional status and sleep disorders, and a strong correlation between the professional situation and changes in the invigorated feeling level (p <0.001). Support for mental health and interventions to improve sleep quality should be offered to the population in general, and, according to our study, the Portuguese population.","Silva, Ema Pinto Sobral Sónia Rolland",Informatics,https://doi.org/10.3390/informatics8030051,57

The index case was confirmed on February 18, 2020 in Daegu City, and within two weeks, 3,081 connected cases were identified. Doubling times during the initial stages of the outbreak were less than 2 days. A stochastic model fitted to the time series of confirmed cases suggests that the basic reproduction number (R0) of 18 COVID-19 was 8.5 [95% credible interval (CrI): 6.3, 10.9] among the church members, whereas R0 = 1.9 [95% CrI: 0.4, 4.4] in the rest of the population of Daegu City. The model also suggests that there were 4 [95% CrI: 2, 11] undetected cases when the first case reported symptoms on February 7. The Shincheonji Church cluster is likely to be emblematic of other outbreak-prone populations where R0 of COVID-19 is higher. Understanding and subsequently limiting the risk of transmission in such high-risk places is key to effective control.","Kim, J.-H.; Lee, H.; Won, Y.

To achieve effective control of the pandemic, efforts need to be holistic and global. Understanding patients demographics and clinical characteristics will assist in the control of the infection. However, there is a paucity of studies on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients from Nigeria and indeed Africa. Thus, this retrospective case series evaluated the medical records of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Patients demographics, and other clinical variables were assessed and presented. Data of 14 patients with complete records were included in the study. Most of the patients (78.6%) were males and the mean age of the study participants is 63.5 years (SD; 11.5). The commonest presenting symptoms were fever (93%), cough (71.4%), and dyspnoea (57.1%). At presentation, 13 patients had coexisting diseases while 8 (57.0%) patients had moderate disease and the remaining 6 (43.0%) had severe cases. After management, 1 patient died, two were referred and 11 recovered and were discharged alive. Thus, this study has identified advanced age, male gender, and comorbidity as increased risk factors for hospitalisation. The patient survival outcome in this study was also good.","Raji, Y.

182812,Membrane protein sorting in the yeast secretory pathway: evidence that the vacuole may be the default compartment,1992-10-01,"Background Over recent years chronic stress and burnout have been reported by doctors working in general practice in the UK NHS and internationally. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed general practitioners working lives; adding potential pressures from avoiding infection and addressing pent-up demand for care, but also changing processes such as rapidly taking up remote consultations. To date, there has been a focus on exploring the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing of hospital clinicians. No registered systematic reviews currently focus on exploring the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners. Aims and objectives To synthesise the current international evidence base exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners, and which factors are associated with their reported mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. Methods In this paper we report a systematic review protocol, following PRISMA guidance. In our search strategy we will identify primary research studies or systematic reviews exploring the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo and Medrxiv) and Google Scholar. We will hand-search reference lists and grey literature. Two reviewers will undertake all stages including study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, with arbitration by a third reviewer where necessary. We will use standardised quality assessment tools to ensure transparency and reduce bias in quality assessment. Depending on the quality of included studies, we may undertake a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies from narrative synthesis that are rated as low quality using the checklists. We will describe the findings across studies using narrative thematic data synthesis, and if sufficiently homogenous data are identified, we will pool quantitative findings through meta-analysis.","Jefferson, L.; Golder, S.; Dale, V.; Essex, H.; McHugh, E.; Bloor, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.05.21261627v1?rss=1,57

However, the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated public health restrictions on individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) has largely been overlooked. Not only do people with IDD have a greater risk of severe complications and death from the virus as shown in large-scale studies, but they also face significant short- and long-term consequences of COVID-related public health measures on their mental health and well-being. At a time when this vulnerable population is already feeling undervalued, ignored, and forgotten, it is imperative that the risks facing adults and children with IDD-as well as their families and caregivers-are recognized, valued, and addressed through a disability-inclusive approach to Canada's pandemic policy response planning. This requires both a mainstreaming of disability inclusion into all COVID-19 response and recovery policies as well as disability-specific policies to address the unique barriers and challenges encountered by people with IDD during the pandemic. The recommendations in this policy briefing aim to achieve a more inclusive, accessible, and sustainable Canada for people with IDD both during and after the pandemic-an approach that will result in benefits for all of society.","Majnemer, A.; McGrath, P.

Comparative results based on employment status, gender, and background were evaluated to identify the impact. While all the groups maintain having information about the pandemic and necessary safety protocols, there is an observable difference in the apprehension levels of financial and mental stability. Due to job security, employed people are less tense and better connected to their family, while unemployed people and students are more concerned with their productivity and quality of work. Students also display higher feelings of uncertainty and helplessness. A considerable number of people feel lonely and deserted during the pandemic. Such thoughts may leave a lasting effect if not tackled at the earliest. While an increase in awareness about mental health is observable, rural and unemployed people are less inclined to approach a professional.

It is of great importance to examine the impact of the healthcare reorganization adopted to confront the COVID19 pandemic on the quality of care provided by healthcare systems to non COVID 19 patients. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID19 national lockdown (March 9, 2020) on the quality of care provided to patients with hip fracture (HF) in Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna, 2 large regions of northern Italy severely hit by the pandemic. Methods. We calculated the percentage of HF patients undergoing surgery within 2 days of hospital admission. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed on weekly data from December 11, 2019 to June 9, 2020 (6 months), interrupting the series in the 2nd week of March. The same data observed the year before were included as a control time series with no intervention (lockdown) in the middle of the observation period. Results. Before the lockdown, 2day surgery was 69.9% in Piedmont and 79.2% in Emilia-Romagna; after the lockdown, these proportions were equal to 69.8% (-0.1%) and 69.3% (-9.9%), respectively. While Piedmont did not experience any drop in the amount of surgery, Emilia-Romagna exhibited a significantly decline at a weekly rate of -1.29% (95% CI = -1.71 to -0.88). Divergent trend patterns in the 2 study regions reflect local differences in pandemic timing as well as in healthcare services capacity, management, and emergency preparedness.","Golinelli, D.; Lenzi, J.; Adorno, E.; Gianino, M.

Previous studies on tool site selection have addressed the relevance of targeted resources and raw materials for tools, but few have considered the broader foraging landscape. In this first landscape-scale study of the ecological contexts of wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) tool-use, we investigate the conditions required for nut-cracking to occur and persist over time at discrete locations in Bossou (Guinea). We examine this at three levels: selection, frequency of use, and inactivity. We find that, further to the presence of a nut tree and availability of raw materials, abundance of food-providing trees as well as proximity to nest sites were significant predictors of nut-cracking occurrence. This suggests that the spatial distribution of nut-cracking sites is mediated by the broader behavioural landscape and is influenced by non-extractive foraging of predictable resources, as well as non-foraging activities. Additionally, tool availability was greater at sites with higher frequency of nut-cracking and was negatively correlated with site inactivity. Our findings indicate that the technological landscape of the Bossou chimpanzees shares affinities with the ‘favoured places’ model of hominin site formation and provides new insights for reconstructing ancient patterns of landscape use.","Almeida-Warren, Katarina; Matsuzawa, Tetsuro; Carvalho, Susana",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.24.457369,57

We report on a Grounded Theory study of the role of coordination in security patch management. The reported theory consists of four inter-related dimensions, i.e., causes, breakdowns, constraints, and mechanisms. The theory explains the causes that define the need for coordination among interdependent software and hardware components and multiple stakeholders' decisions, the constraints that can negatively impact coordination, the breakdowns in coordination, and the potential corrective measures. This study provides potentially useful insights for researchers and practitioners who can carefully consider the needs of and devise suitable solutions for supporting the coordination of interdependencies involved in security patch management.","Dissanayake, Nesara; Zahedi, Mansooreh; Jayatilaka, Asangi; Babar, Muhammad Ali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03458v2.pdf,57

The qualitative study discovered that students confront seven significant challenges: internet coverage, mental fatigue, learning devices, environmental disturbance, pedagogical challenges, lack of motivation, and social interaction. Meanwhile, the fuzzy Delphi analysis of the expert consensus of the theme is at a reasonable level. The overall expert consensus agreement findings exceed 75%, the overall value of the threshold (d) is 0.2, and the -cut exceeds 0.5. The study provides important insights into online learning issues and the fields for further improvement. This study also discusses the avenue for future research by future researchers for more significant benefits and contributions to knowledge in general. © 2021.

184213,Release of Rice dwarf virus from insect vector cells involves secretory exosomes derived from multivesicular bodies.,2009,"The Australian National Cabinet four-step plan to transition to post-pandemic re-opening begins with vaccination to achieve herd protection and protection of the health system against a surge in COVID-19 cases. Assuming a pre-vaccination reproduction number for the Delta variant of 5, we show that for the current Mixed program of vaccinating over 60s with AstraZeneca and 16-60s with Pfizer we would not achieve herd immunity. We would need to cover 85% of the population (including many 5-16 year-olds to achieve herd immunity). At lower reproduction number of 3 and our current Mixed strategy, we can achieve herd immunity without vaccinating 5-15 year olds. This will be achieved at a 60% coverage pursuing a strategy targetting high transmitters or 70% coverage using a strategy targetting the vulnerable first. A reproduction number of 7 precludes achieving herd immunity, however vaccination is able to prevent 75% of deaths compared with no vaccination. We also examine the impact of vaccination on death in the event that herd immunity is not achieved. Direct effects of vaccination on reducing death are very good for both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. However we estimate that the Mixed or Pfizer program performs better than the AstraZeneca program. Furthermore, vaccination levels below the herd immunity threshold can lead to substantial (albeit incomplete) indirect protection for both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. Given the potential for not reaching herd immunity, we need to consider what level of severe disease and death is acceptable, balanced against the consequences of ongoing aggressive control strategies.","McBryde, E.

New forms of cultural consumption and their convenience have raised the question as to whether concert halls will still be needed in the future, and whether the audience will take on the extra time and effort to be present in person at a musical artistic event. In an analysis of international surveys, we formed an accurate picture of music listening habits in the period before and during the pandemic. We also administered a survey, completed by 134 music teachers. Although the findings cannot be generalised to society as a whole, the respondents in the sample are well acquainted with the artistic setting and possess sufficient prior experience, so their opinion is relevant to the topic. Despite the convenience of the online space and the rich selection of art available, the interviewed music teachers will still prefer live music events, which offer them a more profound experience.","Váradi, Judit",Central European Journal of Educational Research,https://doi.org/10.37441/cejer/2021/3/1/9345,57

Objective To describe and identify the dissemination of educational materials and their acceptance regarding the COVID-19 pandemic by a regional drug information center (RDIC) linked to a Brazilian public university. Method The educational materials were disseminated in the communication channels (social media) of the RDIC and university. Seventeen educational notices were produced and disclosed from May to August 2020. The measure of reach was considered to be the number of “likes”, sharing and number of people reached. Results Overall, 28.9% (n = 4070) of the online visitors “liked” the material about vaccines tested for COVID-19, followed by 12.9% (n = 1824) “likes” of the material about ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment, and 8.9% (n = 1250) “likes” of the material that explained the time necessary to develop and test a vaccine and the duration of the pandemic. Conclusion The interest expressed by the “likes” of educational materials about vaccines indicates that the DIC in question has a strategic role in disseminating scientifically backed information about the COVID-19 pandemic.","dos Santos, Jaqueline Rocha Borges",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667276621000809; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667276621000809?v=s5,57

186286,"Synthesis, crystal structure, structure-activity relationships, and antiviral activity of a potent SARS coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitor.",2006,"INTRODUCTION: As we conduct this study, the world is in the grasp of a deadly pandemic. In less than six months since its first diagnosis in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 infectious disease due to the novel coronavirus has infected over 5,000,000 people and claimed over 350,000 lives. In the United States, most of the cases are in large urban settings along the coasts, but the disease is slowly progressing through the mainland. Kansas, with its particular location in the midwest United States, has seen a relatively small number of cases, but these are increasing. The Kansas government took radical measures to prevent the spread of the disease. According to the Health Beliefs Model, an individual’s perception of risk will dictate engagement with preventive behaviors. Knowledge about the disease and preventive measures drive the risk assessment. Knowledge is dependant on the sources of information used. This study explored these metrics in a sample of Kansans living in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A combination of snowball samples and random distribution through social media was used to recruit participants to an online survey. The risk and knowledge instrument was developed and validated by WHO Europe. Data collection lasted 96 hours. RESULTS: The attitudes and behaviors of Kansans concerning COVID-19 were consistent with its location in an area of the country with a relatively lower incidence of the disease. Participants had good knowledge about the disease and preventive measures and were willing to comply with recommendations from local authorities. CONCLUSION: Localized information sources that cater to the community are often primary, while social media is not a valuable source for information pertinent to COVID-19.","Geana, Mugur V.",Kans J Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324058/,57

METHODS Observe the clinical signs and symptoms of each patients; do laboratory examination periodically; and at last do Stat analysis of all the cases. RESULTS The first onset symptom of the 27 cases is high fever accompany with toxic symptom such as muscular soreness, headache, etc. The patient's condition may be most serious in the 2nd week. The amount of end-brush blood WBC decrease, especially the lymphocyte decrease more obviously. The amount of CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) decrease obviously is another important characteristic. The chest X-ray show pulmonary lesion in the 2nd day after onset of the illness, but 40.7% cases show positive change after 6 days onset. During the 7 - 12 days the pulmonary lesion become most serious. Seven cases are treated by steroid in the first 3 days when the chest X-ray is normal, but they become positive during 6 - 8 days of the course. Whether the state of the illness is serious or not seems no obvious relationship to when they are treated by steroid. And large dosage of steroid may inhibit the level of CD(4)(+) and CD8 (P < 0.05). Two severe cases present double infection after large dosage of steroid. CONCLUSION The course of a infectious atypical pneumonia is almost 3 weeks, the 1st week can be decided as early stage, the 2nd week is decided as fastigium, the 3rd week is decided as stage of recovery. During the fastigium, the disease transform very quickly, we need pay more attention to the patient. The CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of SARS patient decrease obviously, it seems the immuno-function inhibited seriously. The serious case is easily accompany with severe secondary infection in the late stage, so the use of steroid must be carefully and the dosage need not to be much more.","Li, Xing-wang; Jiang, Rong-meng; Guo, Jia-zhen; Wang, Qing-yue",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12899789/,57

187388,Isolation of coronavirus envelope glycoproteins and interaction with the viral nucleocapsid.,1980,"mRNA3 specified by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus appears to be functionally tricistronic, having the capacity to encode three small proteins (3a, 3b, and 3c) from separate open reading frames (ORFs). The mechanism by which this can occur was investigated through in vitro translation studies using synthetic mRNAs containing the 3a, 3b, and 3c ORFs, and the results suggest that translation of the most distal of the three ORFs, that for 3c, is mediated by an unconventional, cap-independent mechanism involving internal initiation. This conclusion is based on several observations. A synthetic mRNA whose peculiar 5' end structure prevents translation of the 5'-proximal ORFs (3a and 3b) directs the synthesis of 3c normally. Translation of 3c, unlike that of 3a and 3b, was insensitive to the presence of the 5' cap analog 7-methyl-GTP, and it was unaffected by alteration of the sequence contexts for initiation on the 3a and 3b ORFs. Finally, an mRNA in which the 3a/b/c infectious bronchitis virus coding region was placed downstream of the influenza A virus nucleocapsid protein gene directed the efficient synthesis of 3c as well as nucleocapsid protein, whereas initiation at 3a and 3b could not be detected. Expression of the 3c ORF from this mRNA, however, was abolished when the 3a and 3b coding region was deleted, indicating that 3c initiation is dependent on upstream sequence elements which together may serve as a ribosomal internal entry site similar to those described for picornaviruses.","Liu, D X; Inglis, S C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1527853/,57

These provide assistance to 150 patients. We have a Peritoneal Dialysis Clinic with 35 patients, two Post-Transplant Clinics with about 120 patients in follow-up in Savona and Albenga, and three Pre-Dialysis Clinics across the three locations. Finally, there is an autonomous hospital ward with 15 beds that has continued its activity, even if at reduced regimes. With this report we intend to share the strategy we used to prevent the spread of the SARS CoV-2 virus among the patients and the staff at our Unit, following the National, Regional and Corporate guidelines published during ""Phase 1"". We decided that the Haemodialysis Centres needed to remain a safe place. To insure this, medical and nursing staff and patients had to behave conscientiously and collaboratively, and according to the official Hospital guidance. Our main concern was to protect patients who, despite suffering complications and being at high risk because of their age, immunodepression and multiple comorbidities, were forced to leave their house three times a week to be treated with dialysis. The results of this strategy have ensured that, of the 150 patients undergoing haemodialysis, only 3 have been tested positive: no patients in Albenga, 2 in Savona and 1 in Cairo Montenotte, all of them lived and were infected in their nursing homes. Also, there was no positivity among any of the staff members across the three locations. Our results are extremely positive and confirm the validity that prevention and protection procedures had in the earlier stages of the pandemic.","Repetto, Monica; Caputo, Carmela; Ciabattoni, Marzia; Garneri, Debora; Santoni, Oscar; Tarroni, Alice; Tosetti, Fanny; Vigo, Emanuela Chiara; Cappuccino, Laura; Murgia, Anna Maria; Mancuso, Giancarlo",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33295705/,57

The assessment was limited to public laboratories found within the Thai Bureau of Quality and Safety of Food, National Institute of Health and regional medical science centres. METHODS The World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory assessment tool was adapted to Thailand through a participatory approach. This adapted version employed a specific scoring matrix and comprised 16 modules with a quantitative output. Two teams jointly performed the on-site assessments in December 2010 over a two-week period, in 17 public health laboratories in Thailand. The assessment focused on the capacity to identify and accurately detect pathogens mentioned in Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) in a timely manner, as well as other public health priority pathogens for Thailand. RESULTS Performance of quality management, budget and finance, data management and communications was considered strong (>90%); premises quality, specimen collection, biosafety, public health functions, supplies management and equipment availability were judged as very good (>70% but ≤90%); while microbiological capacity, staffing, training and supervision, and information technology needed improvement (>60% but ≤70%). CONCLUSIONS This assessment is a major step in Thailand towards development of an optimized and standardized national laboratory network for the detection and reporting of infectious disease that would be compliant with IHR (2005). The participatory strategy employed to adapt an international tool to the Thai context can also serve as a model for use by other countries in the Region. The participatory approach probably ensured better quality and ownership of the results, while providing critical information to help decision-makers determine where best to invest finite resources.","Peruski, Anne Harwood; Birmingham, Maureen; Tantinimitkul, Chawalit; Chungsamanukool, Ladawan; Chungsamanukool, Preecha; Guntapong, Ratigorn; Pulsrikarn, Chaiwat; Saengklai, Ladapan; Supawat, Krongkaew; Thattiyaphong, Aree; Wongsommart, Duangdao; Wootta, Wattanapong; Nikiema, Abdoulaye; Pierson, Antoine; Peruski, Leonard F; Liu, Xin; Rayfield, Mark A",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26693144/,57

To date, molecular assays for the detection of SARS-CoV has focused mainly on reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of specimens. However, RT-PCR assays currently available have low sensitivity during the early stage of the disease in which the viral load in specimens is very low. A method for concentrating and purifying SARS-CoV RNA by a magnetic bead capture system was developed and followed by an RT-PCR assay in this study with the goal of improving the sensitivity of the RT-PCR method. This approach takes advantage of the cooperative interaction between adjacently hybridized oligonucleotides. A capture probe was covalently coupled to magnetic beads and a second probe, which anneals adjacent to the capture probe site, was prehybridized in solution to the target. It was shown that, when applied to SARS RNA samples, the sensitivity of nucleic acid capture RTPCR was about 10-fold greater than routine RT-PCR. This nucleic acid capture system was effective in improving the sensitivity of the RT-PCR, due to enriching and purifying SARS-CoV RNA. The method will be helpful for the early detection of the SARS-associated coronavirus.","Hei, Ai-Lian; Cai, Jian-Ping",DNA and cell biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16101344/,57

However, this practice remains controversial because the safety and efficacy of the technique has not been carefully documented. METHODS The authors assessed the safety and efficacy of a sealed gauze dressing with wall suction applied (GSUC) compared to vacuum assisted-closure (VAC), both soaked with topical antimicrobials. Subjects included 31 hospitalized patients with acutely infected wounds compared with 56 patients with noninfected wounds. RESULTS There were significant reductions in wound surface area and volume in both infected and noninfected groups; there was no significant difference in the rate of change observed in the GSUC vs the VAC arms of the study. In the infected group, the reduction in wound surface area was 4.4% per day for GSUC and 4.8% per day for VAC. Wound volume was 7.8% per day for GSUC, and 9.7% per day for VAC (P < 0.001 for all). Evidence of wound infection in all patients, regardless of treatment group, resolved by 96 hours of onset of treatment, and there were no complications specifically related to the use of a sealed dressing over infected wounds. CONCLUSION Gauze dressing with wall suction and VAC therapy can be used in selected acute, infected wounds and both methods of treatment appear to be similarly effective for reducing wound surface area and volume. ﻿﻿﻿.","Dorafshar, Amir H; Franczyk, Mieczyslawa; Karian, Laurel; Teven, Chad; Wroblewski, Kristen; Gottlieb, Lawrence J; Lohman, Robert F",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25866892/,57
189402,Replication-defective bovine adenovirus type 3 as an expression vector.,1999,"The 65-nucleotide leader on the cloned bovine coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA, when marked by mutations, has been shown to rapidly convert to the wild-type leader of the helper virus following DI RNA transfection into helper virus-infected cells. A model of leader-primed transcription in which free leader supplied in trans by the helper virus interacts by way of its flanking 5'UCUAAAC3' sequence element with the 3'-proximal 3'AGAUUUG5' promoter on the DI RNA minus strand to prime RNA replication has been used to explain this phenomenon. To test this model, the UCUAAAC element which occurs only once in the BCV 5' untranslated region was either deleted or completely substituted in input DI RNA template, and evidence of leader conversion was sought. In both cases, leader conversion occurred rapidly, indicating that this element is not required on input RNA for the conversion event. Substitution mutations mapped the crossover region to a 24-nucleotide segment that begins within the UCUAAAC sequence and extends downstream. Although structure probing of the bovine coronavirus 5' untranslated region indicated that the UCUAAAC element is in the loop of a prominent stem and thus theoretically available for base pair-directed priming, no evidence of an unattached leader early in infection that might have served as a primer for transcription was found by RNase protection studies. These results together suggest that leader conversion on the DI RNA 5' terminus is not guided by the UCUAAAC element and might arise instead from a high-frequency, region-specific, homologous recombination event perhaps during minus-strand synthesis rather than by leader priming during plus-strand synthesis.","Chang, R Y; Krishnan, R; Brian, D A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8627745/,57

RESULTS The levels of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes in SARS group [(589 +/- 435) x 10(6)/L, (316 +/- 267) x 10(6)/L and (215 +/- 165) x 10(6)/L, respectively] were significantly lower than those of the normal group (P < 0.01). When compared the SARS group with AIDS group, we found the level of CD4(+) T-lymphocyte in the former was higher (P < 0.01), while the CD3(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes were lower (P < 0.01). There were 54 (44%) patients in SARS group and 39 (76%) patients in AIDS group showed low levels of CD4(+) T-lymphocyte (< 200 x 10(6)/L). The count of T-lymphocyte subsets of SARS group decreased to the lowest level during the 10(th) and 12(th) day after the onset of symptoms.

Recent evidence suggests that cross-reactivity represents the inherent nature of the T-cell repertoire. We identified HLA-A2 binding HPV16 E7 variant peptides from human, bacterial, or viral origin which are able to drive CD8(+)-T-cell responses directed against wild-type HPV16 E7 amino acid 11 to 19/20 (E7(11-19/20)) epitope YMLDLQPET(T) in vitro. CD8(+) T cells reacting to the HLA-A2-presented peptide from HPV16 E7(11-19(20)) recognized also the HLA-A2 binding peptide TMLDIQPED (amino acids 52 to 60) from the human coronavirus OC43 NS2 gene product. Establishment of coronavirus NS2-specific, HLA-A2-restricted CD8(+)-T-cell clones and ex vivo analysis of HPV16 E7 specific T cells obtained by HLA-A2 tetramer-guided sorting from PBL or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from patients with cervical cancer showed that cross-reactivity with HPV16 E7(11-19(20)) and coronavirus NS2(52-60) represents a common feature of this antiviral immune response defined by cytokine production. Zero of 10 patients with carcinoma in situ neoplasia and 3 of 18 patients with cervical cancer showed > or =0.1% HPV16 E7-reactive T cells in CD8(+) peripheral blood lymphocytes. In vivo priming with HPV16 was confirmed in patients with cervical cancer or preinvasive HPV16-positive lesions using HLA-A2 tetramer complexes loaded with the E6-derived epitope KLPQLCTEL. In contrast, we could not detect E6-reactive T cells in healthy individuals. These data imply that the measurement of the HPV16 E7(11-19(20)) CD8(+)-T-cell response may reflect cross-reactivity with a common pathogen and that variant peptides may be employed to drive an effective cellular immune response against HPV.","Nilges, Katja; Höhn, Hanni; Pilch, Henryk; Neukirch, Claudia; Freitag, Kirsten; Talbot, P J; Maeurer, Markus J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12692247/,57

This process proved useful during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and was adopted shortly after by a number of countries to meet new International Health Regulations that require each country to have the capacity for early detection and reporting. The GPHIN identified the early SARS outbreak in China, was credited with the first alert on MERS-CoV and has played a significant role in the monitoring of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Future developments are being considered to advance the GPHIN's capacity in light of other Big Data sources such as social media and its analytical capacity in terms of algorithm development. Conclusion The GPHIN's early adoption of Big Data has increased global capacity to detect international infectious disease outbreaks and other public health events. Integration of additional Big Data sources and advances in analytical capacity could further strengthen the GPHIN's capability for timely detection and early warning.","Dion, M; AbdelMalik, P; Mawudeku, A",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769954/,57
190658,Morphologic changes in the nasal cavity associated with sialodacryoadenitis virus infection in the Wistar rat.,1995,"CEACAM1 on leukocytic, endothelial, and epithelial cells functions in homophilic adhesion, tumor suppression, regulating cell adhesion and proliferation, and in heterophilic adhesion as a receptor for E-selectin and Neisseria meningiditis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and murine coronaviruses. The 8 transmembrane isoforms of human CEACAM1 possess an extracellular N-terminal IgV domain, followed by variable numbers of IgC2 domains. To establish which key amino acids contribute specifically to CEACAM1 homophilic adhesion, exposed amino acids in the N-terminal domain of a soluble form of CEACAM1 were subjected to mutagenesis. Analyses of mutant proteins with conformationally dependent antibodies indicated that most mutations did not substantially affect the structural integrity of CEACAM1. Nevertheless, decreased adhesion was observed for the single mutants V39A or D40A (single-letter amino acid codes) in the CC' loop and for the triple mutants located in the GFCC'C"" face of the N-terminal domain. Interestingly, whereas single mutations in R64 or D82 that are predicted to form a salt bridge between the base of the D and F beta strands close to the critical V39 and D40 residues also abolish adhesion, an amino acid swap (R64D and D82R), which maintains the salt bridge was without significant effect. These studies indicate that the CC' loop plays a crucial role in the homophilic adhesion of CEACAM1. They further predict that specific hydrophobic amino acid residues on the nonglycosylated GFCC'C"" face of CEACAM1 N-terminal domain are not only involved in heterophilic interactions with Opa proteins and H influenzae, but are also critical for protein-protein interactions between 2 CEACAM1 molecules on opposing cells.","Watt, S M; Teixeira, A M; Zhou, G Q; Doyonnas, R; Zhang, Y; Grunert, F; Blumberg, R S; Kuroki, M; Skubitz, K M; Bates, P A",Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11520797/,57

191388,Evidence for immunisation failure in vaccinated adult dogs infected with canine parvovirus type 2c.,2008,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) neurovirulence gene encoding ICP34.5 controls the autophagy pathway. HSV-1 strains lacking ICP34.5 are attenuated in growth and pathogenesis in animal models and in primary cultured cells. While this growth defect has been attributed to the inability of an ICP34.5-null virus to counteract the induction of translational arrest through the PKR antiviral pathway, the role of autophagy in the regulation of HSV-1 replication is unknown. Here we show that HSV-1 infection induces autophagy in primary murine embryonic fibroblasts and that autophagosome formation is increased to a greater extent following infection with an ICP34.5-deficient virus. Elimination of the autophagic pathway did not significantly alter the replication of wild-type HSV-1 or ICP34.5 mutants. The phosphorylation state of eIF2alpha and viral protein accumulation were unchanged in HSV-1-infected cells unable to undergo autophagy. These data show that while ICP34.5 regulates autophagy, it is the prevention of translational arrest by ICP34.5 rather than its control of autophagy that is the pivotal determinant of efficient HSV-1 replication in primary cell culture.","Alexander, Diane E; Ward, Stephen L; Mizushima, Noboru; Levine, Beth; Leib, David A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855538/,57

It mediates the transactivation of transcription from the HIV-1 LTR by binding to the transactivation response (TAR) element in a complex with cyclin T1. Because of its critical and early role in HIV gene expression, Tat and its interaction with the TAR element constitute important therapeutic targets for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Based on the known nucleolar localization properties of Tat, we constructed a chimeric small nucleolar RNA-TAR decoy that localizes to the nucleoli of human cells and colocalizes in the nucleolus with a Tat-enhanced GFP fusion protein. When the chimeric RNA was stably expressed in human T lymphoblastoid CEM cells it potently inhibited HIV-1 replication. These results demonstrate that the nucleolar trafficking of Tat is critical for HIV-1 replication and suggests a role for the nucleolus in HIV-1 viral replication.","Michienzi, Alessandro; Li, Shirley; Zaia, John A; Rossi, John J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12376617/,57

The requirements for coronavirus nucleocapsid assembly are being studied. Two forms (approximately 50 kDa and 55 kDa) of the bovine coronavirus (BCV) N protein were detected in infected cells. However, only one form, a 50 kDa species, was detected in extracellular virions. After treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP), the 55 kDa intracellular form increased in mobility to comigrate with the 50 kDa form; whereas, the 50 kDa intracellular species and N from extracellular virions was not sensitive to CIAP treatment. The data indicate that specificity exists with regard to assembly of N into the mature virion. The data suggests that processing of N may take place during assembly of either nucleocapsids or virions and that the processing may be a dephosphorylation event.","Hogue, B G",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830489/,57

These mutant virus strains were devoid of up to seven or eight of 22 glycosylation sites in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 because of mutations at the Asn or Thr/Ser sites of the N-glycosylation motifs. In one of the strains, a novel glycosylation site was created near a deleted glycosylation site. The affected glycosylation sites were predominantly clustered in regions of gp120 that are not involved in the direct interaction with either CD4, CCR5, CXCR4, or gp41.

Informed response requires accurate information about agents and diseases that have the potential to be used as weapons. METHODS The authors reviewed information about the most probable bioterrorist weapons (those from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Category A) from the World Wide Web and print journals and distilled it into a resource list that is current, relevant to dentistry and noncommercial. The Web sites cited include those sponsored by federal agencies, academic institutions and professional organizations. The articles cited include those published in English within the last six years in refereed journals that are available in most higher education institutions. RESULTS The authors present the information in a table that provides a quick-reference guide to resources describing agents and diseases with the greatest potential for use as weapons: anthrax, botulism, plague, smallpox, tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers. This article presents Web site and journal citations for background and patient-oriented information (fact sheets), signs and symptoms, and prophylactic measures and treatment for each of the agents and diseases. The table facilitates quick access to this information, especially in an emergency. This article also points out guidelines for response should a suspected attack occur. CONCLUSIONS Armed with information about biological weapons, dentists can provide faster diagnosis, inform their patients about risks, prophylaxis or treatment and rethink their own role in terrorism response.

Dengue disease is endemic in most tropical countries, with an estimated 2.5 billion people living in areas at risk of DENV infection. Due to the lack of vaccines and antiviral drugs, it is now a huge public health burden around the world. In order to screen large compound libraries for the identification of novel antivirals targeting DENV, it is essential to develop a high throughput screening (HTS) amenable assay. Here, we present the development, optimization and validation of a cytopathic effect-based assay against Dengue virus serotype-2 (DENV-2). The assay conditions, including cell culturing conditions, DMSO tolerance and the multiplicity of infection, were optimized in both 96- and 384-well plates. Assay robustness and reproducibility were determined under the optimized conditions in 96-well plate, including Z'-value of 0.71, signal-to-background ratio of 6.88, coefficient of variation of 6.3% in mock-infected cells and 12.3% in DENV-2 infected cells. This assay was further miniaturized into a 384-well plate format with similar assay robustness and reproducibility comparing with these in the 96-well plate format. This assay was then validated using the LOPAC(1280) compound library, demonstrating its repeatability with comparable assay robustness and reproducibility. This fully developed and validated HTS amenable assay could be used in future studies to screen large compound libraries for the identification of novel antivirals against dengue disease.","Che, Pulin; Wang, Lihua; Li, Qianjun",International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20057980/,57

We performed the screening of HCoV-229E by real-time RT-PCR and sequencing of HCoV-229E gene fragments derived from conventional PCR. At meantime, we also screened the HCoV-229E positive samples for the co-infection with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HMPV by real-time RT-PCR. Finally, demographic and clinical data associated with HCoV-229E infection were examined retrospectively. RESULTS We detected 103 (62.5%) of 158 specimens were positive for HCoV-229E by real-time RT-PCR. When tested for other respiratory viruses, 26 HCoV-229E positive patients were found to be co-infected with other viruses. Of which HCoV-NL63 was observed in 3 specimens (11.5%), HCoV-HKU1 in 3 (11.5%) and HMPV in 20 (76.9%). The main clinical manifestations were noted as: headache (in 70.9%), sore throat (69%), chills (68%), cough (33%), sputum (21.3%), rhinorrhea (21.4%), nasal obstruction (16.5%), and a few of patients were visible as vomiting (6.8%), dyspnea (3.9%), diarrhea (in 1.9%).

To begin to explore the underlying mechanism(s) of this viral effect, we sought in the present study to: (1) determine whether SDAV invades and replicates in lacrimal gland acinar cells in vitro and (2) assess whether short-term SDAV challenge interferes with the viability or function of acinar cells in vitro. For comparison we also evaluated the relative infectivity of SDAV in acinar epithelial cells from lacrimal, submandibular and parotid glands, given that salivary tissues are known to be highly susceptible to SDAV infection in vivo. Acinar epithelial cells from lacrimal, submandibular or parotid glands were isolated from male rats, exposed briefly to SDAV or control cell antigen and then cultured for four, eight or twelve days. At experimental termination, SDAV titers in both media and sonicated cell extracts were evaluated by plaque assay titration on mouse L2 cell monolayers. To evaluate functional aspects of lacrimal gland acinar cells, SDAV-infected cells were incubated in the presence or absence of dihydrotestosterone and culture media were analyzed by RIA to measure the extent of the androgen-induced increase in secretory component (SC) production. Our results showed that: (1) SDAV invades and replicates in lacrimal gland acinar cells, Viral challenge resulted in a significant, time-dependent increase in SDAV titers, that were primarily cell-associated and greatly exceeded amounts contained in the original inoculum; (2) SDAV infection did not compromise lacrimal acinar cell viability or prevent the cellular SC response to androgens. Viral presence, though, did often attenuate the magnitude of this hormone action; and (3) SDAV infects salivary acinar cells, but the kinetics and magnitude or viral replication in lacrimal, submandibular and parotid cells showed considerable variations. These findings demonstrate that SDAV invades and replicates in acinar epithelial cells from lacrimal and salivary glands. The resulting release of infectious progeny may play a role in the SDAV-induced pathology of exocrine tissues in vivo.","Wickham, L A; Huang, Z; Lambert, R W; Sullivan, D A",Ocular immunology and inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9326763/,57

Although majority of the COVID-19 patients have mild to moderate clinical events, up to 5-10% may have severe, life threatening events that urgently require effective drugs. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral therapies in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS An extensive search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), prospective case series studies that evaluated therapies COVID-19. The outcomes searched for were mortality, recovery rate, length of hospital stay and clinical improvement from January to May 15, 2020. Independent reviewers searched, identified, screened, and related studies were included. RESULTS Total of five RCTs on 439 patients and seventeen case series involving 1656 patients were found in the specified review period that reported the use of Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Remdesivir. Oseltamivir, Ribavirin in patients with COVID-19; but none of which showed efficacy of antiviral therapy. Such current findings impede researchers from recommending an appropriate and effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making it a serious concern for the global community.

193152,A structural determinant of human cytomegalovirus US2 dictates the down-regulation of class I major histocompatibility molecules.,2006,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the coronavirus of the chicken (Gallus gallus), is one of the foremost causes of economic loss within the poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-type and egg-laying birds. The virus replicates not only in the epithelium of upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, but also in many tissues along the alimentary tract and elsewhere e.g. kidney, oviduct and testes. It can be detected in both respiratory and faecal material. There is increasing evidence that IBV can infect species of bird other than the chicken. Interestingly breeds of chicken vary with respect to the severity of infection with IBV, which may be related to the immune response. Probably the major reason for the high profile of IBV is the existence of a very large number of serotypes. Both live and inactivated IB vaccines are used extensively, the latter requiring priming by the former. Their effectiveness is diminished by poor cross-protection. The nature of the protective immune response to IBV is poorly understood. What is known is that the surface spike protein, indeed the amino-terminal S1 half, is sufficient to induce good protective immunity. There is increasing evidence that only a few amino acid differences amongst S proteins are sufficient to have a detrimental impact on cross-protection. Experimental vector IB vaccines and genetically manipulated IBVs--with heterologous spike protein genes--have produced promising results, including in the context of in ovo vaccination.","Cavanagh, Dave",Veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17296157/,57
193197,[Persistence of the Sindbis virus in cultures producing oncornavirus].,1978,"In February 2003, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in humans in Guangdong Province, China, and caused an epidemic that had severe impact on public health, travel, and economic trade. Coronaviruses are worldwide in distribution, highly infectious, and extremely difficult to control because they have extensive genetic diversity, a short generation time, and a high mutation rate. They can cause respiratory, enteric, and in some cases hepatic and neurological diseases in a wide variety of animals and humans. An enormous, previously unrecognized reservoir of coronaviruses exists among animals. Because coronaviruses have been shown, both experimentally and in nature, to undergo genetic mutations and recombination at a rate similar to that of influenza viruses, it is not surprising that zoonosis and host switching that leads to epidemic diseases have occurred among coronaviruses. Analysis of coronavirus genomic sequence data indicates that SARS-CoV emerged from an animal reservoir. Scientists examining coronavirus isolates from a variety of animals in and around Guangdong Province reported that SARS-CoV has similarities with many different coronaviruses including avian coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-like viruses from a variety of mammals found in live-animal markets. Although a SARS-like coronavirus isolated from a bat is thought to be the progenitor of SARS-CoV, a lack of genomic sequences for the animal coronaviruses has prevented elucidation of the true origin of SARS-CoV. Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV shows that the 5' polymerase gene has a mammalian ancestry; whereas the 3' end structural genes (excluding the spike glycoprotein) have an avian origin. Spike glycoprotein, the host cell attachment viral surface protein, was shown to be a mosaic of feline coronavirus and avian coronavirus sequences resulting from a recombination event. Based on phylogenetic analysis designed to elucidate evolutionary links among viruses, SARS-CoV is believed to have branched from the modern Group 2 coronaviruses, suggesting that it evolved relatively rapidly. This is significant because SARS-CoV is likely still circulating in an animal reservoir (or reservoirs) and has the potential to quickly emerge and cause a new epidemic.","Jackwood, Mark W",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17039827/,57

The primary end-point was healing of the ulcer. Secondary end-points included changes in the Wexner Constipation Score and Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). RESULTS Thirty-six patients with SRUS were identified (31 women), with a median age of 44 (15–81) years. The commonest symptoms were rectal bleeding (75%) and obstructed defaecation (64%). The underlying anatomical diagnosis was internal rectal prolapse (n = 20), external rectal prolapse (n = 14) or anismus (n = 2). Twenty-nine patients underwent LVR and one a stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) procedure. Nine (30%) required a further operation, six required posterior STARR for persistent SRUS and two a per-anal stricturoplasty for a narrowing at the healed SRUS site. Healing of the SRU was seen in 27 (90%) of the 30 patients and was associated with significant improvements in Wexner and FISI scores at a 3-year follow-up. CONCLUSION Almost all cases of SRUS in the present series were associated with rectal prolapse. LVR resulted in successful healing of the SRUS with good function in almost all patients, but a significant number will require further surgery such as STARR for persistent obstructed defaecation.","Evans, C; Ong, E; Jones, O M; Cunningham, C; Lindsey, I",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678526/,57

194097,Prevalence and genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats from China.,2006,"Adjuvants, substances included in many vaccines in order to improve immune responses, are challenging to develop and license because adjuvant compounds that stimulate strong protective immunity also frequently induce significant toxicity. Adjuvant design and development has until recently been largely empirical; but with the current knowledge that most adjuvants act via receptors of the innate immune system, molecular-based approaches are rapidly advancing the field. Data support the concept that proinflammatory pathways induced by innate immune receptor triggering underlie many of the observed toxic effects. Importantly, the cellular signaling pathways that lead to inflammation are known, for a number of innate immune receptors, to be distinct from those that are involved in the costimulation of protective adaptive immune responses, leading to approaches for attenuating inflammatory signaling that should lead to safer and more effective vaccine adjuvants. This article addresses whether there is a clear rationale for the separation of toxicity from efficacy in the function of adjuvants based upon innate immune receptor ligands.","Hauguel, Travis M; Hackett, Charles J",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17981755/,57

The technique was tested on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues from piglets naturally infected with PEDV. Five different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were tested in this study. PEDV antigen was consistently detected in the PLP (4% paraformaldehyde, 100 mM L-lysine dihydrochloride, 10 mM sodium m-periodate in phosphate-buffered saline)-fixed PEDV-infected Vero cells or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues from piglets naturally infected with PEDV. The C9-2-2 MAb gave the strongest reactivity and least background staining, detecting 10 of 10 infected pigs. The positive reaction was cytoplasmic. Positive enterocytes were distributed over the tip and along the sides of atrophied or fused villi in the jejunum and ileum. Positive-staining cells were not detected in the crypts. No staining was observed in cecum and colon. No positive cells were observed when the C9-2-2 MAb was reacted with the tissue sections from noninfected piglets or from transmissible gastroenteritus virus (TGEV)- and rotavirus-infected piglets. The selected anti-PEDV MAbs tested on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections are useful for diagnosis when virus isolation is not available. This method would be of particular value in countries where both PEDV and TGEV are epizootic and would aid in differentiating between PEDV and TGEV infection.","Kim, O; Chae, C; Kweon, C H","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12968761/,57

Statistical analysis was done on SPSS version 20. RESULTS Age above 45 years, diabetes, hypertension, history of COVID contact were independent risk factors for COVID positivity. HCQ intake did not show an independent association. However, when adjusted for other risk factors, HCQ dose as per Government recommendations, 2-3, 4-5 and 6 or more weeks reduced the probability of COVID positivity by 34%, 48%, 72% respectively. COVID free median survival time was higher in non-diabetics, non-hypertensives, persons below 45 years, with no prior exposure to COVID case and those who took HCQ for more than 6 weeks With modeling extent of risk reduction under different scenarios of risk and HCQ intake was 1-65% .

MATERIAL AND METHODS A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect databases. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) with placebo in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopic surgery were retrieved. The primary endpoint was the visual analogue scale (VAS) score at 24 hours and cumulative morphine consumption at 24 hours. The secondary outcomes were complications of nausea/vomiting, sedation and dizziness. After tests for publication bias and heterogeneity among studies were performed, data were aggregated for random-effects models when necessary. RESULTS Five clinical studies (gabapentin group n = 4 and pregabalin group n = 1) were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. Gabapentinoids were associated with reduced pain scores at 24 hours. Similarly, gabapentinoids were associated with a reduction in cumulative morphine consumption at 24 hours. Furthermore, gabapentinoids can significantly reduce the occurrence of nausea/vomiting. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of sedation and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative use of gabapentinoids was able to reduce postoperative pain, total morphine consumption, and morphine-related complications following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Further studies should determine the optimal dose and whether pregabalin is superior to gabapentin in controlling acute pain after shoulder surgery.","Galindo-Ávalos, J; Colin-Vázquez, A; López-Valencia, J; Gómez-Gómez, J M; Bernal-Fortich, L D",Acta ortopedica mexicana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767888/,57
195085,Virome analysis for identification of novel mammalian viruses in bat species from Chinese provinces.,2012,"Concerns have been raised about the value of genomic research for prevention and public health, especially for complex diseases with risk factors that are amenable to environmental modification. Given that gene-environment interactions underlie almost all human diseases, the public health significance of genomic research on common diseases with modifiable environmental risks is based not necessarily on finding new genetic ""causes"" but on improving existing approaches to identifying and modifying environmental risk factors to better prevent and treat disease. Such applied genomic research for environmentally caused diseases is important, because 1) it could help stratify disease risks and differentiate interventions for achieving population health benefits; 2) it could help identify new environmental risk factors for disease or help confirm suspected environmental risk factors; and 3) it could aid our understanding of disease occurrence in terms of transmission, natural history, severity, etiologic heterogeneity, and targets for intervention at the population level. While genomics is still in its infancy, opportunities exist for developing, testing, and applying the tools of genomics to clinical and public health research, especially for conditions with known or suspected environmental causes. This research is likely to lead to population-wide health promotion and disease prevention efforts, not only to interventions targeted according to genetic susceptibility.","Khoury, Muin J; Davis, Robert; Gwinn, Marta; Lindegren, Mary Lou; Yoon, Paula",American journal of epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15840611/,57

In the three surveys, 98 birds in total were handled for examination, and blood was collected for laboratory analysis from 90 of these birds. All birds seemed to be in good condition. Body weights of females were significantly lower in 1994 than in the other years. Fleas (Parapsyllus humboldti) and ticks (Ornithodoros amblus) were found on the penguins and in their nests. Females had significantly higher plasma calcium and phosphorus levels, and they had lower weights than males. No other differences were found between the sexes. Hematology, plasma chemistries, and plasma mineral levels varied between years. Positive antibody titers for Chlamydophila psittaci (62%), avian adenovirus (7%; 1994 only), paramyxovirus-2 (7%; 1993 only), and Salmonella Pullorum (7%) were found.

Background The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious health problem to human beings. The evidence suggests that inflammatory markers related to liver damage increase in severe forms of COVID-19 compared to mild cases. Methods The electronic databases ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched for articles published up to May, 2020. Data from each identified study was combined using the random effects model to estimate standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Sensitivity and publication bias were also calculated. Results Totally, 23 studies were included in this meta-analysis comprising 4313 patients with COVID-19. The random effects results demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of CRP [SMD = 3.26 mg/L; (95% CI 2.5, 3.9); p<0.05; I2 = 98.02%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00], TNFα [SMD = 1.78 ng/mL; (95% CI 0.39, 3.1); p=0.012; I2 = 98.2%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00], and IL-6 [ SMD = 3.67 ng/mL; (95% CI 2.4, 4.8); p<0.05; I2 = 97.8%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00] compared with those with the mild form of the disease. Significant heterogeneity was present. No significant publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses showed a similar effect size while reducing the heterogeneity. Conclusion The data suggests that enhanced inflammation may be associated with COVID-19-related liver damage, possibly involving inflammatory marker-related mechanisms.","Amiri-Dashatan, Nasrin; Koushki, Mehdi; Ghorbani, Fatemeh; Naderi, Nosratollah",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244370/,57

Vaccines are amongst the most effective means of preventing disease in both animals and humans. In many cases, diseases have been eradicated or their impact on animal health and welfare greatly reduced. It is an ethical responsibility to ensure the availability of a wide range of vaccines even where the market needs to be financially supported, as in the case of less common animal species and those with less common conditions (commonly referred to by the acronym MUMS: Minor Use and Minor Species). Mass slaughter is becoming unacceptable to society and we must move to a 'vaccinate to live' policy wherever possible. We need to use vaccines to avoid the high costs of disease and to enhance food safety. In developing vaccines, we need to minimise animal testing. In addition, we need to ensure that the public acceptthe use of vaccines in food-producing animals as a means of protecting the health and welfare of all animals. As we look to the future, vaccines will be vital to ensure our ability to provide more food to a growing global population.

The increasing number of children adopted internationally (>20,000 in 2003, from the United States State Department) provides a unique situation for the spread of emerging infections through the combination of international travel by parents through areas where such infections may be contracted and the nature of the living conditions for many of the orphans being placed by this process. RECENT FINDINGS The recent literature on three emerging infections--avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and measles--describes clinical aspects of the illnesses and their epidemiology. For avian influenza aspects of the agrarian economy in southeast Asia enabled the virus to reach the human population. The potential for further adaptation to people could set the stage for a new pandemic. SARS evolved in rural China and spread worldwide in one season with an approximate 10% mortality. Attention to public-health measures led to control of this new illness. Most recently, outbreaks of measles in Chinese orphanages have been documented. These findings demonstrate the potential of such infections to be transmitted during the process of international adoption, and in the case of measles the realization of this potential in recent reported cases from Chinese orphanages brought to the United States on commercial airlines. SUMMARY Clinicians involved in international adoption and public-health officials assessing emerging infections need to work together in monitoring these issues.","Krilov, Leonard R",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15353957/,57

The purpose of this study was to correlate 18F-FDG PET with standard sarcoidosis activity parameters during infliximab treatment. METHODS Twelve patients with refractory sarcoidosis were treated with 6 cycles of infliximab. Pre- and post-therapy 18F-FDG PET was visually evaluated and SUVmax was measured. In addition, the effect of infliximab was evaluated by changes in symptoms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), vital capacity (VC), diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and chest radiography. SUVmax and conventional parameters were correlated. RESULTS Clinical improvement as judged by conventional parameters was seen in all patients, though with a minor response in one. Symptoms improved in 11/12 patients while chest radiographic stages did not change. The decrease in ACE was 39% and in sIL-2R 47% (p<0.01). Improvement of VC and DLCO was 5.4% and 3.3% (p<0.05), respectively. 18F-FDG PET revealed either improvement or normalization in 11/12 (92%) clinically responding patients. The overall decrease in SUVmax was 55% (p<0.01); the patient with a limited response showed a 34% increase. A decrease in SUVmax of the lung parenchyma correlated with an improvement of VC (r=-0.75, p<0.01). No significant correlation between SUVmax and other parameters was found. CONCLUSION Changes imaged by 18F-FDG PET during infliximab treatment in sarcoidosis patients correlate with signs of clinical improvement to a considerate extent, which supports the hypothesis that 18F-FDG uptake represents disease activity.","Keijsers, R G M; Verzijlbergen, J F; van Diepen, D M; van den Bosch, J M M; Grutters, J C","Sarcoidosis, vasculitis, and diffuse lung diseases : official journal of WASOG",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19382534/,57

We therefore set out to evaluate (1) the feasibility of IRT imaging to identify subjects with fever, and (2) the optimal instrumental configuration and validity for such testing. METHODS Over a 20-day inclusive period, 176 subjects (49 hospital inpatients without SARS or suspected SARS, 99 health clinic attendees and 28 healthy volunteers) were recruited. Remotely sensed IRT readings were obtained from various parts of the front and side of the face (at distances of 1.5 and 0.5 m), and compared to concurrently determined body temperature measurements using conventional means (aural tympanic IRT and oral mercury thermometry). The resulting data were submitted to linear regression/correlation and sensitivity analyses. All recruits gave prior informed consent and our Faculty Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. RESULTS Optimal correlations were found between conventionally measured body temperatures and IRT readings from (1) the front of the face at 1.5m with the mouth open (r=0.80), (2) the ear at 0.5 m (r=0.79), and (3) the side of the face at 1.5m (r=0.76). Average IRT readings from the forehead and elsewhere were 1 degrees C to 2 degrees C lower and correlated less well. Ear IRT readings at 0.5 m yielded the narrowest confidence intervals and could be used to predict conventional body temperature readings of < or = 38 degrees C with a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 88% respectively. CONCLUSIONS IRT readings from the side of the face, especially from the ear at 0.5 m, yielded the most reliable, precise and consistent estimates of conventionally determined body temperatures. Our results have important implications for walk-through IRT scanning/screening systems at airports and border crossings, particularly as the point prevalence of fever in such subjects would be very low.","Chan, Lung-Sang; Cheung, Giselle T Y; Lauder, Ian J; Kumana, Cyrus R",Journal of travel medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15544710/,57

Older adults have emerged as a critically vulnerable population as earlier data suggests a disproportionately increased incidence of COVID-19 in this population, as well as worse health outcomes. Disease attenuating behaviors such as social distancing has been encouraged and mandated across different countries leading to downstream economic ramifications. This paper seeks to outline the economic implications of COVID-19 in the U.S. (particularly in terms of vocational, retail, and service industries), highlighting the role of nursing homes in disease dissemination. We also discuss potential costs associated with COVID-19 management focusing on the senior population who rely on Medicare benefits for health insurance.","Ramgobin, Devyani; Benson, Jamal; Kalayanamitra, Ricci; Shahid, Zainab; Cai, Alice; McClafferty, Brendan; Groff, Andrew; Patel, Ravi; Vunnam, Ramarao; Golamari, Reshma; Sahu, Nitasa; Jones, Kirk; Bhatt, Dhirisha; Jain, Rohit",South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579802/,57

SUMMARY Often a re-intervention is indicated for the resolution of an anastomotic (sub-) obstruction. This re-intervention is associated with the morbidity and mortality of a laparotomy and a prolonged hospital stay. In the case here presented, a 68-year-old man underwent a laparoscopic rectosigmoid resection for a rectal adenocarcinoma. An end-to-end circular stapled colorectal anastomosis was performed. At first without any postoperative problems, the patient presented with a stenosis of the anastomosis 6 months postoperatively. This stenosis did not result in a total obstruction but was sufficiently advanced to cause faecal impaction and discomfort, which was confirmed using a retrograde gastrografine bowel study. Colonoscopic dilatations were insufficient and after several days the patient experienced a recurrence of the original stenosis. A minimally invasive re-intervention with T.E.M. was performed in combination with laparoscopy to solve the stenosis. To our knowledge, this technique has not yet been described. CONCLUSION In this paper we describe a possible minimally invasive technique to avoid laparotomy after colorectal or colo-anal anastomotic stenosis. Both the duration of the hospital stay and patient morbidity can be reduced in this way.","de Rycker, J; Pauli, S; Van Cleemput, M",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21337846/,57

Male gender, previous suicide attempt(s), comorbid mental disorders, adverse life-situations, acute psycho-social stressors etc. also constitute robust risk factors. Anxiety and minor depression present with a low to moderate increase in suicide risk but anxiety-depression comorbidity increases this risk dramatically Contrary to the traditional psychoanalytic approach which considers suicide as a retrospective murder or an aggression turned in-wards, more recent studies suggest that the motivations to commit suicide may vary and are often too obscure. Neurobiological data suggest that low brain serotonin activity might play a key role along with the tryptophan hydroxylase gene. Social factors include social support networks, religion etc. It is proven that most suicide victims had asked for professional help just before committing suicide, however they were either not diagnosed (particularly males) or the treatment they received was inappropriate or inadequate. The conclusion is that promoting suicide prevention requires the improving of training and skills of both psychiatrists and many non-psychiatrists and especially GPs in recognizing and treating depression and anxiety. A shift of focus of attention is required in primary care to detect potentially suicidal patients presenting with psychological problems. The proper use of antidepressants, after a careful diagnostic evaluation, is important and recent studies suggest that successful acute and long-term antidepressant pharmacotherapy reduces suicide morbidity and mortality.","Gonda, Xenia; Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Kaprinis, George; Rihmer, Zoltan",Annals of general psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17803824/,57

Herein we show that axonal damage occurred in areas of demyelination and also in adjacent areas devoid of myelin damage. Immunodeficient MHV-infected RAG1-/- mice (mice defective in recombinase activating gene 1 expression) do not develop demyelination unless they receive splenocytes from a mouse previously immunized against MHV (G.

In the present study, we show that adoptive transfer of T cells was also required for the majority of the axonal injury observed in these animals. Both demyelination and axonal damage were apparent by 7 days posttransfer. Recent data suggest that axonal injury is a major factor in the long-term disability observed in patients with multiple sclerosis. Our data demonstrate that immune system-mediated damage to axons is also a common feature in mice with MHV-induced demyelination. Remarkably, there appeared to be a minimal, if any, interval of time between the appearance of demyelination and that of axonal injury.","Dandekar, A A; Wu, G F; Pewe, L; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390613/,57

Suspension of elective dental care across the United States during the initial phase of the pandemic was necessary to prevent viral transmission. The emergency dental care that was provided had to be tailored to minimize the generation of aerosols. With the suspension of elective care, over time, the proportion of dental emergencies was anticipated to rise. Dentists who care for children have continued to provide emergency dental treatment to this vulnerable population. Treatment decisions for pediatric dental emergencies had to be tailored to principles of public health that best mitigated risk of viral transmission. Decisions needed to balance the benefits of chosen treatment modality for the individual child with the risk of viral transmission to dental professionals and their staff, patients, and community. The paucity of reliable research for dentists to aid in clinical decision making may have left careproviders feeling ethically and morally insecure in shifting from a patient-centered to a community-centered paradigm. We present analysis of four pediatric emergency case scenarios that are representative of those likely to present to a private practice, academic setting, or emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis aims to empower dentists who care for children to implement the American Dental Association's Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct within the context of a global health crisis.","Ritwik, Priyanshi; Patterson, Kimberly K; Alfonzo-Echeverri, Elsa",The Journal of clinical ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548430/,57

During the pandemic and implementation of adopted preventive measures, it has increased by more than 100% in some cities. This presents an unsustainable development, particularly in terms of urban environment. The above-mentioned development has accelerated the research related to optimal allocation of logistics centres considering the last-mile distribution. Unfortunately, the theoretical mathematical model that finds an optimal urban logistics centre location based on the matrix of distance, number, and weight of shipments is not applicable in most cities. Therefore, the following research methodology was chosen in accordance with the approved territorial plan. The authors considered those locations in Bratislava—the capital of Slovak Republic—which are designated, or suitable for building up of an urban logistics centre. These localities were afterwards evaluated in a real-world case study employing methods of mathematical programming (linear programming), the nearest neighbour method, and the Clarke-Wright method. The presented methodology can be applied not only when deciding on the appropriate location of the city logistics centre, but also at optimizing the vehicle routing problem. Taking into account the urban logistics sustainability and the e-commerce growth, it was analysed whether the suggested location of urban logistics centre is feasible to provision examined facilities using electric vehicles. The range of considered electric vehicles of N2 category present in the market tends to be at the limits of distribution routes length for the given case study. Therefore, the article also deals with the fast-charging possibilities of vehicles during handling operations and the use of hybrid freight vehicles in city logistics.","Settey, Tomáš Gnap Jozef Beňová Dominika Pavličko Michal Blažeková Oľga",Sustainability,,57

The results showed that the lower ratio of DSi to[Formula: see text] (0.044 ± 0.001) was mainly controlled by the domination of carbonate mineral in the sedimentary rock of the Yalongjiang River drainage basin. The DSi:[Formula: see text] ratio was positively correlated with discharge (P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the water retention time (P < 0.01) and chlorophyll a, implying that the variations of DSi:[Formula: see text] ratio were mainly determined by the rock chemical weathering processes and the hydrologic process outside the reservoirs and the biological processes within the cascade reservoirs. The phytoplankton photosynthetic process stoichiometrically assimilated DSi and [Formula: see text], resulted in 3.46 × 104 t·Si a-1 and 1.89 × 104 t·C a-1 sequestering in the cascade reservoirs, respectively. Compared with the situation of dam-free in the lower reaches of Yalongjiang River, the export flux of [Formula: see text] and DSi at the mouth of Yalongjiang River was reduced by 11.87% and 62.50%, respectively; the ratio of DSi:[Formula: see text] decreased by 36.01% for only building the Ertan dam and 53.15% for the cascade damming, respectively. The water renewal time prolonged from 45 to 126.6 days due to the regulation of the cascade reservoirs in the mainstream. Ultimately, a conceptual model on migration-transformation of DIC and DSi within the cascade reservoirs in the lower reaches of Yalongjiang River was established. These findings demonstrated that riverine cascade damming could extend the biogeochemical coupling cycle of DIC and DSi within the inland aquatic ecosystems and ensure the ecological environment security in the hot-dry valley.","Deng, Haojun; Tao, Zhen; Gao, Quanzhou; Yao, Ling; Feng, Yong; Li, Yinhua; Ding, Jian; Wang, Zhengang; Lyu, Xiaoxi; Xu, Peng",,,57

235466,Orf Virus VIR Antagonizes p53-Mediated Antiviral Effects to Facilitate Viral Replication,2020,"BACKGROUND: Allocation of adequate healthcare facilities is one of the most important factors that public health policymakers consider when preparing for infectious disease outbreaks. Negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) are one of the critical resources for control of infectious respiratory diseases, such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. However, there is insufficient attention to efficient allocation of NPIR-equipped hospitals. METHODS: We aim to explore any insufficiency and spatial disparity of NPIRs in South Korea in response to infectious disease outbreaks based on a simple analytic approach. We examined the history of installing NPIRs in South Korea between the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) in 2015 to evaluate the allocation process and spatial distribution of NPIRs across the country. Then, for two types of infectious diseases (a highly contagious disease like COVID-19 vs. a hospital-based transmission like MERS-Cov), we estimated the level of disparity between NPIR capacity and demand at the sub-regional level in South Korea by applying the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. RESULTS: Geospatial information system (GIS) mapping reveals a substantial shortage and misallocation of NPIRs, indicating that the Korean government should consider a simple but evidence-based spatial method to identify the areas that need NPIRs most and allocate funds wisely. The 2SFCA method suggests that, despite the recent addition of NPIRs across the country, there should still be more NPIRs regardless of the spread pattern of the disease. It also illustrates high levels of regional disparity in allocation of those facilities in preparation for an infectious disease, due to the lack of evidence-based approach. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of evidence-based decision-making processes in allocating public health facilities, as misallocation of facilities could impede the responsiveness of the public health system during an epidemic. This study provides some evidence to be used to allocate the resources for NPIRs, the urgency of which is heightened in the face of rapidly evolving threats from the novel COVID-19 outbreak.","Kim, Hyoungah; Kim, Dohyeong; Paul, Christopher; Lee, Chang Kil",Int. j. health policy manag,,57

Thus, multiple combinations of high, low and medium sensitivity and vulnerability were identified for South American and for the countries with the highest absolute receipts from tourism, but an alarming scenario for the most dependent countries on international tourism, many of them small island countries in development (SIDS).

257089,Evaluation of Activation and Inflammatory Activity of Myeloid Cells During Pathogenic Human Coronavirus Infection,2020,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and clinical outcome among patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional multicenter clinical study. A total of 95 patients infected with COVID-19 were enrolled. The COVID-19 diagnostic standard was polymerase chain reaction detection of target genes of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic results, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained. ARDS was defined as an oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) &#8804;300 mm Hg. FINDINGS: Multivariate analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; p = 0.008) and high body mass index (OR, 1.327; p = 0.024) were independent risk factors associated with patients with pneumonia. For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.046; p = 0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase level (OR, 1.010; p = 0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS. A total of 70 patients underwent CT imaging repeatedly after treatment. Patients were divided in a disease exacerbation group (n = 19) and a disease relief group (n = 51). High body mass index (OR, 1.285; p = 0.017) and tobacco smoking (OR, 16.13; p = 0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease exacerbation after treatment. IMPLICATIONS: These study results help in the risk stratification of patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Patients with risk factors should be given timely intervention to avoid disease progression.","Yu, Tao; Cai, Shaohang; Zheng, Zhidan; Cai, Xuejuan; Liu, Yuanyuan; Yin, Sichun; Peng, Jie; Xu, Xuwen",Clin Ther,,57
258080,Identification of the SHREK Family of Proteins as Broad-Spectrum Host Antiviral Factors,2021,"The National Health Service (NHS) Pathways triage system collates data on enquiries to 111 and 999 services in England. Since the 18th of March 2020, these data have been made publically available for potential COVID-19 symptoms self-reported by members of the public. Trends in such reports over time are likely to reflect behaviour of the ongoing epidemic within the wider community, potentially capturing valuable information across a broader severity profile of cases than hospital admission data. We present a fully reproducible analysis of temporal trends in NHS Pathways reports until 14th May 2020, nationally and regionally, and demonstrate that rates of growth/decline and effective reproduction number estimated from these data may be useful in monitoring transmission. This is a particularly pressing issue as lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted and evidence of disease resurgence must be constantly reassessed. We further assess the correlation between NHS Pathways reports and a publicly available NHS dataset of COVID-19-associated deaths in England, finding that enquiries to 111/999 were strongly associated with daily deaths reported 16 days later. Our results highlight the potential of NHS Pathways as the basis of an early warning system. However, this dataset relies on self-reported symptoms, which are at risk of being severely biased. Further detailed work is therefore necessary to investigate potential behavioural issues which might otherwise explain our conclusions.","Leclerc, Quentin J; Nightingale, Emily S; Abbott, Sam; Jombart, Thibaut",Sci Rep,,57
260817,Expression pattern analysis of antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originated in China in December 2020 and declared pandemic by WHO. This coronavirus mainly spreads through the respiratory tract and enters cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, and fatigue. Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, anorexia, and vomiting) may be present in 50% of patients and may be associated with worst prognosis. Other risk factors are older age, male gender, and underlying chronic diseases. Mitigation measures are essential to reduce the number of people infected. Hospitals are a place of increased SARS-CoV-2 exposure. This has implications in the organization of healthcare services and specifically endoscopy departments. Patients and healthcare workers safety must be optimized in this new reality. Comprehension of COVID-19 gastrointestinal manifestations and implications of SARS-CoV-2 in the management of patients with gastrointestinal diseases, under or not immunosuppressant therapies, is essential. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress and major societies recommendations regarding the implications of COVID-19 in gastroenterology, namely the adaptations that gastroenterology/endoscopy departments and professionals must do in order to optimize the provided assistance, as well as the implications that this infection will have, in particularly vulnerable patients such as those with chronic liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease under or not immunosuppressant therapies.","Ferreira-Silva, Joel; Peixoto, Armando; Rodrigues-Pinto, Eduardo; Macedo, Guilherme",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,,57

266275,Coinfections and their molecular consequences in the porcine respiratory tract,2020,"Previous studies have reported a reduction in pediatric emergency visits for communicable diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been related to the use of face masks and school closures. As Sweden imposed less strict restrictions as compared to most countries we aimed to assess the effect of the behavioral changes, however without school closures and general usage of face masks in the society, on the spread of communicable diseases in children. We calculated cumulative incidences of pediatric emergency visits for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), gastroenteritis and as a control diagnosis urinary tract infections (UTIs) comparing 2020 with 2018-2019. Our results suggests that the behavioral changes including improved basal hygiene routines and physical distancing, had a major impact on the disease transmission of LRTIs (cumulative incidence 0.24% in 2020 versus 0.57% during 2018-2019, p<0.001) and gastroenteritis (0.26% versus 0.87%, p<0.001) in children but observed a small increase in UTIs (0.22% versus 0.20%, p=0.01).

The objectives of this study were to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and the COVID-19 cases at the community-level and to assess how SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations should be integrated into a wastewater-based epidemiological statistical model that can provide reliable forecasts for the number of COVID-19 infections and the evolution over time as well. Weekly variations on the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and COVID-19 cases from April 29, 2020 through February 17, 2021 were obtained in Borough of Indiana, PA. Vector autoregression (VAR) model with different data forms were fitted on this data from April 29, 2020 through January 27, 2021, and the performance in three weeks ahead forecasting (February 3, 10, and 17) were compared with measures of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). A stationary block bootstrapping VAR method was also presented to reduce the variability in the forecasting values. Our results demonstrate that VAR(1) estimated with the logged data has the best interpretation of the data, but a VAR(1) estimated with the original data has a stronger forecasting ability. The forecast accuracy, measured by MAPE, for 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks in the future can be as low as 11.85%, 8.97% and 21.57%. The forecasting performance of the model on a short time span is unfortunately not very impressive. Also, a single increase in the SARS-CoV-2 concentration can impact the COVID-19 cases in an inverted-U shape pattern with the maximum impact occur in the third week after. The flexibility of this approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different locations where the wastewater surveillance system has been implemented.","Cao, Yongtao; Francis, Roland",Sci Total Environ,,57

In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control-among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. Moreover, we allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. We then examine predictions from these models for a variety of scenarios. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a ""trace & isolate"" approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a ""trace & isolate"" approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific behavioural responses.","Grimm, Veronika; Mengel, Friederike; Schmidt, Martin",Sci Rep,,57

This paper presents a single-institution case series of hospitalized myasthenia gravis patients with COVID 19. We identified eight patients previously diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, four of whom presented with clear signs of myasthenia gravis symptom worsening on admission. No form of respiratory support was needed during the complete duration of stay for three patients, oxygen therapy was administered to two patients, while the remaining three patients required mechanical ventilation. Treatment was successful for seven patients, six of whom were discharged without any myasthenia gravis symptoms. One patient died after eleven days of intensive care unit treatment. Although treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis and COVID-19 patients is challenging, case series of myasthenia gravis patients with COVID-19 treated in our institution demonstrates relatively favorable treatment outcome. Our data seem to support the notion that immunosuppressive medication does not seem to result in worse outcomes. Our data also support the notion that intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is safe and should be administered to patients with myasthenia gravis and COVID-19 in case of myasthenia gravis worsening since benefits seem to greatly outweigh the risks.","Zupanic, Sven; Peric Situm, Martina; Majdak, Maja; Karakas, Mirna; Basic, Silvio; Sporis, Davor",Acta neurol.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the common clinical manifestations of severe COVID-19 and it is also responsible for the current shortage of ventilators worldwide. This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 ARDS patients and establish a diagnostic system based on artificial intelligence (AI) method to predict the probability of ARDS in COVID-19 patients. We collected clinical data of 659 COVID-19 patients from 11 regions in China. The clinical characteristics of the ARDS group and no-ARDS group of COVID-19 patients were elaborately compared and both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning-based method were used to build the prediction models. Results indicated that the median age of ARDS patients was 56.5 years old, which was significantly older than those with non-ARDS by 7.5 years. Male and patients with BMI > 25 were more likely to develop ARDS. The clinical features of ARDS patients included cough (80.3%), polypnea (59.2%), lung consolidation (53.9%), secondary bacterial infection (30.3%), and comorbidities such as hypertension (48.7%). Abnormal biochemical indicators such as lymphocyte count, CK, NLR, AST, LDH, and CRP were all strongly related to the aggravation of ARDS. Furthermore, through various AI methods for modeling and prediction effect evaluation based on the above risk factors, decision tree achieved the best AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in identifying the mild patients who were easy to develop ARDS, which undoubtedly helped to deliver proper care and optimize use of limited resources.","Xu, Wan; Sun, Nan-Nan; Gao, Hai-Nv; Chen, Zhi-Yuan; Yang, Ya; Ju, Bin; Tang, Ling-Ling",Sci Rep,,57

These trials have been highly anticipated worldwide. We expect investigators of the trials will soon report the clinical and laboratory findings from the medical perspective. This manuscript provides documentary style information on the process of monitoring key data and making recommendations to the sponsor and investigators based on analytical insights when dealing with the emergent situation from the statistical viewpoint. Having monitored data sequentially from 237 patients, we comment on the strength and weakness of the study design and suggest the treatment effect of remdesivir on severe COVID-19 cases. Our experience with using the Dynamic Data Monitoring (DDM) tool has demonstrated its efficiency and reliability in supporting DSMB's instantaneous review of essential data during the emergent situation. DDM, when used properly by disciplined statisticians, has shown its capability of exploring the trial data flexibly and, in the meantime, protecting the trial's scientific integrity.","Shih, Weichung J; Yao, Chen; Xie, Tai",Ther Innov Regul Sci,,57

Although rapid point-of-care testing for detecting viral antigen is important for management of the outbreak, the current antigen tests are less sensitive than nucleic acid testing. In our current study, we produce monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that exclusively react with SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit no cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling suggest that the mAbs bind to epitopes present on the exterior surface of the nucleocapsid, making them suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. We further select the optimal pair of anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP mAbs using ELISA, and then use this mAb pair to develop immunochromatographic assay augmented with silver amplification technology. Our mAbs recognize the variants of concern (501Y.V1-V3) that are currently in circulation. Due to their high performance, the mAbs of this study can serve as good candidates for developing antigen detection kits for COVID-19.","Yamaoka, Yutaro; Miyakawa, Kei; Jeremiah, Sundararaj Stanleyraj; Funabashi, Rikako; Okudela, Koji; Kikuchi, Sayaka; Katada, Junichi; Wada, Atsuhiko; Takei, Toshiki; Nishi, Mayuko; Shimizu, Kohei; Ozawa, Hiroki; Usuku, Shuzo; Kawakami, Chiharu; Tanaka, Nobuko; Morita, Takeshi; Hayashi, Hiroyuki; Mitsui, Hideaki; Suzuki, Keita; Aizawa, Daisuke; Yoshimura, Yukihiro; Miyazaki, Tomoyuki; Yamazaki, Etsuko; Suzuki, Tadaki; Kimura, Hirokazu; Shimizu, Hideaki; Okabe, Nobuhiko; Hasegawa, Hideki; Ryo, Akihide",Cell Rep Med,,57

It rapidly spread, at first in China, then resulting in an epidemic in other countries throughout the world. One of such controversial topics is the issue of diagnostics and interpretation of test for COVID-19. According to Polish and global guidelines, the basis for diagnosis is molecular testing - real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Taking all these data into consideration, the aim of the study was to compare RT-PCR with serological test in our employees post-exposure. According to Polish and global guidelines, the basis for diagnosis is molecular testing, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The aim: To compare RT-PCR with serological test in our employees post-exposure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Material and methods: 79 employees of the Clinic, 19 men and 60 women in the age range 27-69 years were evaluated. Tests were begun four days after information about the positive test in our ""Employee 0"" and lasted for 7 days. At first, we made RT-PCR tests on the specimen from nasopharyngeal swab. Then, we accomplished rapid antibodies tests. This test is based on the qualitative assessment of the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies by immunochromatography using a sample of capillary blood from the fingertip. RESULTS: Results: All the tests were negative. No employee developed symptoms during the 7-day follow-up after the end of the tests. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: As routine tests for patients have been implemented widely, but similar solutions for employees have not gained popularity. Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) e.g. facemask and shields, transparent screens, disposable medical uniforms, minimalization the contact time, increasing distance from both colleagues and patients (if possible), and strictly follow sanitary procedures largely contributed to the absence of illness in the surveyed group of employees.","Kwiatkowska, Marlena; Chomicka, Inga; Malyszko, Jolanta",Wiad Lek,,57
317361,Editorial: 2020 - The year of viruses,2020,"Sentiment analysis, social networks analysis, and social media sensing are becoming important tools to extract meaningful information from text, adopted in several contexts, ranging from social interactions, touristic activities, shopping and e-commerce, to name a few. In particular, the current CoVid-19 quarantine the world is witnessing has shown the potential of such tools as a way to monitor and understand people's mood and feelings, in a time where people are resorting, more than ever, to social networks to engage and communicate with others. Indeed, when performing social network content analysis, privacy is a major concern. On the one hand, privacy issues and international laws and acts drive such analysis (e.g., GDPR), with the aim of protecting persons' privacy and security. On the other hand, these can limit somehow such activities. Hence, a precise and accurate identification of the strategies to adopt should be done to balance privacy issues and sentiment analysis activities. Taking into account the requirements of a Urban Innovation Action project, which is based on the active involvement of citizens, this work aims to describe limitations and potentialities of social networks monitoring and analysis to understand users' mood about the project actions adopted in the city of Ravenna (in Italy) to improve specific districts.","Mambelli, G.; Prandi, C.; Mirri, S.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee Symposium on Computers and Communications,,57

320170,In silico T cell epitope identification for SARS-CoV-2: Progress and perspectives,2021,"PURPOSE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates predominantly in the upper respiratory tract and is primarily transmitted by droplets and aerosols. Taking the medical history for typical COVID-19 symptoms and PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing have become established as screening procedures. The aim of this work was to describe the clinical appearance of SARS-CoV-2-PCR positive patients and to determine the SARS-CoV-2 contact risk for health care workers (HCW). METHODS: The retrospective study included n = 2283 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests from n = 1725 patients with otorhinolaryngological (ORL) diseases performed from March to November 2020 prior to inpatient treatment. In addition, demographic data and medical history were assessed. RESULTS: n = 13 PCR tests (0.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The positive rate showed a significant increase during the observation period (p < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical symptoms that led to a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 before PCR testing. The patients were either asymptomatic (n = 4) or had symptoms that were interpreted as symptoms typical of the ORL disease or secondary diagnoses (n = 9). CONCLUSION: The identification of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients is a considerable challenge in clinical practice. Our findings illustrate that taking a medical history alone is of limited value and cannot replace molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially for patients with ORL diseases. Our data also demonstrate that there is a high probability of contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in everyday clinical practice, so that the use of personal protective equipment, even in apparently ""routine cases"", is highly recommended.","Weiss, Roxanne; Guchlerner, Leon; Loth, Andreas G; Leinung, Martin; Wicker, Sabine; Kempf, Volkhard A J; Berger, Annemarie; Rabenau, Holger F; Ciesek, Sandra; Stöver, Timo; Diensthuber, Marc",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,57

Gaertn.) are sources of many bioactive compounds, such as rutin, quercetin, emodin, fagopyrin and other (poly)phenolics. In damaged or milled grain under wet conditions, most of the rutin in common and Tartary buckwheat is degraded to quercetin by rutin-degrading enzymes (e.g., rutinosidase). From Tartary buckwheat varieties with low rutinosidase activity it is possible to prepare foods with high levels of rutin, with the preserved initial levels in the grain. The quercetin from rutin degradation in Tartary buckwheat grain is responsible in part for inhibition of &#945;-glucosidase in the intestine, which helps to maintain normal glucose levels in the blood.

326361,Sierra: discovery of differential transcript usage from polyA-captured single-cell RNA-seq data,2020,"AIMS: To explore variables associated with the serological response following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. METHODS: Eighty-six healthcare workers adhering to the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 were enrolled in January-February 2021. All subjects underwent two COVID-19 mRNA vaccine inoculations (Pfizer/BioNTech) separated by 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected before the 1st and 1-4 weeks after the second inoculation. Clinical history, demographics, and vaccine side effects were recorded. Baseline anthropometric parameters were measured, and body composition was performed through dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = -0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non-smokers [1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive [650 ± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005]. Multivariate analysis showed that higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, and longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation were associated with lower Ab titres, independent of BMI, age. and gender. CONCLUSIONS: Central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab titres following COVID-19 vaccination. Although it is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS-CoV-2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID-19, it is well-established that neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our findings, therefore, call for a vigilant approach, as subjects with central obesity, hypertension, and smoking could benefit from earlier vaccine boosters or different vaccine schedules.","Watanabe, Mikiko; Balena, Angela; Tuccinardi, Dario; Tozzi, Rossella; Risi, Renata; Masi, Davide; Caputi, Alessandra; Rossetti, Rebecca; Spoltore, Maria Elena; Filippi, Valeria; Gangitano, Elena; Manfrini, Silvia; Mariani, Stefania; Lubrano, Carla; Lenzi, Andrea; Mastroianni, Claudio; Gnessi, Lucio",Diabetes metab. res. rev,,57

Vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most promising candidates for combating this global epidemic, and scientists all over the world have made great efforts to this end. However, manipulation of the SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in the biosafety level 3 laboratory. This makes experiments complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, a safer system for working with this virus is urgently needed. Here, we report the construction of plasmid-based, non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 replicons with turbo-green fluorescent protein and/or firefly luciferase reporters by reverse genetics using transformation-associated recombination cloning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Replication of these replicons was achieved simply by direct transfection of cells with the replicon plasmids as evident by the expression of reporter genes. Using SARS-CoV-2 replicons, the inhibitory effects of E64-D and remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2 replication were confirmed, and the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of remdesivir and E64-D was estimated by different quantification methods respectively, indicating that these SARS-CoV-2 replicons are useful tools for antiviral drug evaluation.","Wang, Bei; Zhang, Chongyang; Lei, Xiaobo; Ren, Lili; Zhao, Zhendong; Wang, Jianwei; Huang, He",Virol. sin.

334184,Respiratory mucus as a virus-host range determinant,2021,"BACKGROUND: Digital remote patient monitoring can add value to virtual wards; this has become more apparent in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care providers are overwhelmed, resulting in clinical teams spread more thinly. We aimed to assess the impact of introducing an app-based remote patient monitoring system (Huma Therapeutics) on a clinician's workload in the context of a COVID-19-specific virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: This prospective feasibility study aimed to evaluate the health economic effects (in terms of clinical workload) of a mobile app on a telephone-based virtual ward used in the monitoring of patients with COVID-19 who are clinically ready for discharge from the hospital. METHODS: A prospective feasibility study was carried out over 1 month where clinician workload was monitored, and full-time equivalents savings were determined. An NHS hospital repurposed a telephone-based respiratory virtual ward for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 in the amber zone (according to the National Health Service definition) were monitored for 14 days postdischarge to help identify deteriorating patients earlier. A smartphone-based app was introduced to monitor data points submitted by the patients via communication over telephone calls. We then comparatively evaluated the clinical workload between patients monitored by telephone only (cohort 1) with those monitored via mobile app and telephone (cohort 2). RESULTS: In all, 56 patients were enrolled in the app-based virtual ward (cohort 2). Digital remote patient monitoring resulted in a reduction in the number of phone calls from a mean total of 9 calls to 4 calls over the monitoring period. There was no change in the mean duration of phone calls (8.5 minutes) and no reports of readmission or mortality. These results equate to a mean saving of 47.60 working hours. Moreover, it translates to 3.30 fewer full-time equivalents (raw phone call data), resulting in 1.1 fewer full-time equivalents required to monitor 100 patients when adjusted for time spent reviewing app data. Individual clinicians spent an average of 10.9 minutes per day reviewing data. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based remote patient monitoring technologies may offer tangible reductions in clinician workload at a time when service is severely strained. In this small-scale pilot study, we demonstrated the economic and operational impact that digital remote patient monitoring technology can have in improving working efficiency and reducing operational costs. Although this particular RPM solution was deployed for the COVID-19 pandemic, it may set a precedent for wider utilization of digital, remote patient monitoring solutions in other clinical scenarios where increased care delivery efficiency is sought.","Shah, Sachin Shailendra; Gvozdanovic, Andrew; Knight, Matthew; Gagnon, Julien",JMIR Form Res,,57

338046,From hesitancy to hope: One physician's experience with the Moderna trial,2021,"BackgroundThe majority of COVID-19 symptom presentations in adults and children appear to run their course within a couple of weeks. However, a subgroup of adults has started to emerge with effects lasting several months or more after initial infection. However, little is known about long term physical, mental and social health effects of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. The purpose of this review was to determine these impacts well into the second year of the pandemic. MethodsA search was conducted using PUBMED, Web of Science, Science Direct, and COCHRANE between 11/1/2019 and 9/1/2021. Search inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) COVID-19 illness and symptoms in children; (2) SARS-COv2 in children; (3) English language; and (4) human studies only. ResultsThe few studies that have documented long-term physical symptoms in children show that fatigue, difficulty in concentrating (brain fog), sleep disturbances, and sensory problems are the most reported outcomes. Most studies examining the impact of COVID-19 in pediatric populations have focused on initial clinical presentation, and symptoms, which are similar to those in adult populations. Additionally, COVID-19 has had a moderate impact on children and adolescents social environment, which may exacerbate current and future physiological, psychological, behavioral, and academic outcomes. ConclusionsThere are limited studies reporting long physical symptoms of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. However, pediatric COVID-19 cases are underreported due to low rates of testing and symptomatic infection, which calls for more longitudinal studies. Children who have experienced COVID-19 illness should be monitored for long physiological, psychological, behavioral, and academic outcomes.","Borel, Madeline; Xie, Luyu; Mihalcea, Adrian; Kahn, Jeffrey; Messiah, Sarah E",,,57

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community ice hockey teams from Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Parents and coaches of ice hockey players (ages 11-17, all divisions of play). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed a questionnaire developed and validated to measure concussion knowledge, beliefs and concussion management behaviour (ie, coaches removing athletes from play; parents taking children with suspected concussions to physicians) consistent with the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). The questionnaire examined specific HAPA constructs (ie, risk perception, outcome expectancies, action self-efficacy, intention, action planning, maintenance self-efficacy, recovery self-efficacy) relevant to concussion management behaviour. RESULTS: Participants included 786 parents (31.8% with coaching experience) and 10 non-parent coaches. Of the participants, 649 (82.6%) previously received concussion education. Based on a multivariable regression analysis adjusting for coaching experience, previous history of a child sustaining one or more concussions, first aid experience and cluster by team, exposure to concussion education was associated with a mean score difference of 1.36 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.03), p<0.0001, in the knowledge score. Exposure to concussion education was not significantly associated with any of the HAPA constructs based on Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. CONCLUSION: Exposure to concussion education may be associated with small overall differences in concussion knowledge but may not be associated with significant differences in beliefs or intended behaviours related to concussion management among youth hockey parents and coaches.When providing education or recommendations for concussion education sources to coaches and parents, educational strategies grounded in behavioural change theory that specifically target the motivators of behavioural change should be considered.","Black, Amanda M; Yeates, Keith Owen; Babul, Shelina; Nettel-Aguirre, Alberto; Emery, Carolyn A",BMJ Open,,57

In particular, conspiracy theories argued on the effect of specific new technologies like 5G and misinformation tarnished the reputation of brands like Huawei. Language plays a crucial role in understanding the motivational determinants of social media users in sharing misinformation, as people extract meaning from information based on their discursive resources and their skillset. In this paper, we analyze textual and non-textual cues from a panel of 4923 tweets containing the hashtags #5G and #Huawei during the first week of May 2020, when several countries were still adopting lockdown measures, to determine whether or not a tweet is retweeted and, if so, how much it is retweeted. Overall, through traditional logistic regression and machine learning, we found different effects of the textual and non-textual cues on the retweeting of a tweet and on its ability to accumulate retweets. In particular, the presence of misinformation plays an interesting role in spreading the tweet on the network. More importantly, the relative influence of the cues suggests that Twitter users actually read a tweet but not necessarily they understand or critically evaluate it before deciding to share it on the social media platform.","Di Domenico, Giandomenico Tuan Annamaria Visentin Marco",Italian Journal of Marketing,,57
348801,"Long, Noncoding RNA Dysregulation in Glioblastoma",2021,"The infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, mainly causes alterations in the respiratory system. In severely ill patients, the disease often evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome that can predispose patients to a state of hypercoagulability, with thrombosis at both venous and arterial levels. This predisposition presents a multifactorial physiopathology, related to hypoxia as well as to the severe inflammatory process linked to this pathology, including the additional thrombotic factors present in many of the patients. In view of the need to optimise the management of hypercoagulability, the working groups of the Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology-Resuscitation and Pain Therapy (SEDAR) and of Intensive, Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) have developed a consensus to establish guidelines for actions to be taken against alterations in haemostasis observed in severely ill patients with COVID-19. These recommendations include prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in these patients, and in the peripartum, management of patients on long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment, bleeding complications in the course of the disease, and the interpretation of general alterations in haemostasis.","Llau, J V; Ferrandis, R; Sierra, P; Hidalgo, F; Cassinello, C; Gómez-Luque, A; Quintana, M; Amezaga, R; Gero, M; Serrano, A; Marcos, P",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,,57
349485,To cut or not to cut: New rules for proteolytic shedding of membrane proteins,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented amounts of information communicated to the public relating to STEM. The pandemic can be seen as a ‘wicked problem’ defined by high complexity, uncertainty and contested social values requiring a transdisciplinary approach formulating social policy. This article argues that a ‘Critical STEM Literacy’ is required to engage sufficiently with STEM knowledge and how science operates and informs personal health decisions. STEM literacy is necessary to critique government social policy decisions that set rules for behaviour to limit the spread of COVID-19. Ideas of scientific, mathematical and critical literacy are discussed before reviewing some current knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to aid interpretation of the examples provided. The article draws on experience of the pandemic in the United Kingdom (UK), particularly mathematical modelling used to calculate the reproductive rate (R) of COVID-19, communication of mortality and case data using graphs and the mitigation strategies of social distancing and mask wearing. In all these examples, there is an interaction of STEM with a political milieu that often misrepresents science as activity to generate one dependable truth, rather than through careful empirical validation of new knowledge. Critical STEM literacy thus requires appreciation of the social practices of science such as peer review and assessment of bias. Implications of the pandemic for STEM education in schools requiring critical thinking and in understanding disease epidemiology in a global context are discussed.","Braund, Martin","Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education",,57

In this paper, we improve upon previous visual self-supervised RL by incorporating object-level reasoning and occlusion reasoning. Specifically, we use unknown object segmentation to ignore distractors in the scene for better reward computation and goal generation; we further enable occlusion reasoning by employing a novel auxiliary loss and training scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm, ROLL (Reinforcement learning with Object Level Learning), learns dramatically faster and achieves better final performance compared with previous methods in several simulated visual control tasks.

However, the phosphorylation of protein is significantly altered during cancer progression which triggers abnormal cellular pathways and this phosphorylation can serve as an emergent diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for cancer. Herein, we develop a nanostructured mesoporous gold electrode (NMGE)-based biosensor that enables a highly sensitive detection of protein phosphorylation with electrochemical signal amplification. The biosensor comprises nanostructured mesoporous gold electrodes whose electro-conductive framework is superior to that of the nonporous electrodes. We characterize our developed nano/mesoporous gold electrode with various electrochemical methods in the presence of the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- redox system. We find that the mesoporous gold electrode catalyzes both the oxidation and reduction processes of the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- system and generates a current signal that is 3 times higher than that of the nonporous gold electrode. This superior signal transduction of our nano/mesoporous gold electrode is enabled through a pore-induced (i) high electrochemically active surface area and (ii) reduced impedance with a high signal to noise ratio. The assay utilizes direct adsorption of an immunoprecipitated purified BRAF protein towards the mesoporous gold electrode and thus avoids the cumbersome sensor surface functionalization. Our developed biosensor detects the phosphorylated BRAF protein with a 2.5-fold increase in sensitivity and an &#8776;10-fold increase in the limit of detection (LOD) in comparison with the nonporous gold electrodes. The assay also works on a wide dynamic range from 0.5 to 20 ng µL-1 of the protein which further shows its potential for clinical application. We envisage that this nanostructured mesoporous gold biosensor will be of high interest for clinical application.","Ahmed, Emtiaz; Masud, Mostafa Kamal; Hossain, Md Shahriar A; Na, Jongbeom; Sina, Abu Ali Ibn; Yamauchi, Yusuke; Trau, Matt",Analyst,,57

Despite their importance, the development of a practical, real-time means of monitoring bioaerosols has remained elusive. Here, we present a novel, simple, and highly efficient means of obtaining enriched bioaerosol samples. Aerosols are collected into a thin and stable liquid film by the unique interaction of a superhydrophilic surface and a continuous two-phase centrifugal flow. We demonstrate that this method can provide a concentration enhancement ratio of â¼2.4 × 106 with a collection efficiency of â¼99.9% and an aerosol-into-liquid transfer rate of â¼95.9% at 500 nm particle size (smaller than a single bacterium). This transfer is effective in both laboratory and external ambient environments. The system has a low limit of detection of <50 CFU/m3air using a straightforward bioluminescence-based technique and shows significant potential for air monitoring in occupational and public-health applications.","Heo, Ki Joon; Ko, Hyun Sik; Jeong, Sang Bin; Kim, Sang Bok; Jung, Jae Hee",Nano Lett,,57

371403,Editorial overview: Virus reverse genetics approaches for the development of preventive and therapeutic vaccines,2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-Cov-2 virus pandemic causes serious emotional consequences. It has occurred widespread medical courses suspension, and graduations were anticipated. Field hospitals, set up to treat patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, were the main workplaces of newly graduated doctors. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of medical interns and newly graduated doctors. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study performed using a digital platform. Links to forms were sent in two moments: moment 1 (M1), at the beginning of the pandemic, in the first half of April/2020 and moment 2 (M2), after six months of pandemic, in the second half of September/2020. All students from the medical internship and all doctors graduated since 2018 from the three medical schools in Sergipe-NE-Brazil were invited. RESULTS: 335 forms were answered in April and 148 in September. In M1 88.9% considered themselves exposed to excess of information about COVID-19, which was associated with anxiety symptoms (p = 0.04). Long family physical distance was also associated with these symptoms, as increased appetite (p = 0.01), feeling shortness of breath (p = 0.003) and sweating (p = 0.007). Fear of acquire COVID-19 was reported as intense by almost half of participants, and of transmitting by 85.7% in M1. In M2 41.2% reported the death of friends or relatives. Psychiatric illness was described by 38.5% and psychotropic drugs use by 30.1% in M1, especially those who lived alone (p = 0.03) and the single ones (p = 0.01). Alcohol intake was reported by 54.3%, and among doctors graduated in 2020 it increased from 50% in M1 to 85% in M2 (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of medical students and newly graduated doctors. Exposure to excessive COVID-19 information and family physical distance were associated to anxiety symptoms. Among doctors graduated in 2020, alcohol intake increased during pandemic evolution.","Ferreira, Lis Campos; Amorim, Rívia Siqueira; Melo Campos, Fellipe Matos; Cipolotti, Rosana",PLoS One,,57

374740,Tracing genetic signatures of bat-to-human coronaviruses and early transmission of North American SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite high contagiousness and rapid spread, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to heterogeneous outcomes across affected nations. Within Europe (EU), the United Kingdom (UK) is the most severely affected country, with a death toll in excess of 100,000 as of January 2021. We aimed to compare the national impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the risk of death in UK patients with cancer versus those in continental EU. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the OnCovid study database, a European registry of patients with cancer consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 in 27 centres from 27th February to 10th September 2020. We analysed case fatality rates and risk of death at 30 days and 6 months stratified by region of origin (UK versus EU). We compared patient characteristics at baseline including oncological and COVID-19-specific therapy across UK and EU cohorts and evaluated the association of these factors with the risk of adverse outcomes in multivariable Cox regression models. FINDINGS: Compared with EU (n = 924), UK patients (n = 468) were characterised by higher case fatality rates (40.38% versus 26.5%, p < 0.0001) and higher risk of death at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.36-1.99]) and 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis (47.64% versus 33.33%; p < 0.0001; HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.33-1.88]). UK patients were more often men, were of older age and have more comorbidities than EU counterparts (p < 0.01). Receipt of anticancer therapy was lower in UK than in EU patients (p < 0.001). Despite equal proportions of complicated COVID-19, rates of intensive care admission and use of mechanical ventilation, UK patients with cancer were less likely to receive anti-COVID-19 therapies including corticosteroids, antivirals and interleukin-6 antagonists (p < 0.0001). Multivariable analyses adjusted for imbalanced prognostic factors confirmed the UK cohort to be characterised by worse risk of death at 30 days and 6 months, independent of the patient's age, gender, tumour stage and status; number of comorbidities; COVID-19 severity and receipt of anticancer and anti-COVID-19 therapy. Rates of permanent cessation of anticancer therapy after COVID-19 were similar in the UK and EU cohorts. INTERPRETATION: UK patients with cancer have been more severely impacted by the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic despite societal risk mitigation factors and rapid deferral of anticancer therapy. The increased frailty of UK patients with cancer highlights high-risk groups that should be prioritised for anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Continued evaluation of long-term outcomes is warranted.","Pinato, David J; Scotti, Lorenza; Gennari, Alessandra; Colomba-Blameble, Emeline; Dolly, Saoirse; Loizidou, Angela; Chester, John; Mukherjee, Uma; Zambelli, Alberto; Aguilar-Company, Juan; Bower, Mark; Galazi, Myria; Salazar, Ramon; Bertuzzi, Alexia; Brunet, Joan; Mesia, Ricard; Sita-Lumsden, Ailsa; Colomba, Johann; Pommeret, Fanny; Seguí, Elia; Biello, Federica; Generali, Daniele; Grisanti, Salvatore; Rizzo, Gianpiero; Libertini, Michela; Moss, Charlotte; Evans, Joanne S; Russell, Beth; Wuerstlein, Rachel; Vincenzi, Bruno; Bertulli, Rossella; Ottaviani, Diego; Liñan, Raquel; Marrari, Andrea; Carmona-García, M C; Sng, Christopher C T; Tondini, Carlo; Mirallas, Oriol; Tovazzi, Valeria; Fotia, Vittoria; Cruz, Claudia A; Saoudi-Gonzalez, Nadia; Felip, Eudald; R Lloveras, Ariadna; Lee, Alvin J X; Newsom-Davis, Thomas; Sharkey, Rachel; Chung, Chris; García-Illescas, David; Reyes, Roxana",Eur J Cancer,,57

379386,Structural biology in the fight against COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Specific details about cardiovascular complications, especially arrhythmias, related to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) are not well described. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the incidence and predictive factors of cardiovascular complications and new-onset arrhythmias in Black and White hospitalized COVID-19 patients and determine the impact of new-onset arrhythmia on outcomes. METHODS: We collected and analyzed baseline demographic and clinical data from COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, between March 1 and May 1, 2020. RESULTS: Among 310 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 61.4 ± 16.5 years, with 58,7% females, and 67% Black patients. Black patients were more likely to be younger, have diabetes and obesity. The incidence of cardiac complications was 20%, with 9% of patients having new-onset arrhythmia. There was no significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes between Black and White patients. A multivariate analysis determined age &#8805;60 years to be a predictor of new-onset arrhythmia (OR = 7.36, 95% CI [1.95;27.76], p = .003). D-dimer levels positively correlated with cardiac and new-onset arrhythmic event. New onset atrial arrhythmias predicted in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.99 95% CI [1.35;6.63], p = .007), a longer intensive care unit length of stay (mean of 6.14 days, 95% CI [2.51;9.77], p = .001) and mechanical ventilation duration(mean of 9.08 days, 95% CI [3.75;14.40], p = .001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that new onset atrial arrhythmias are commonly encountered in COVID-19 patients and can predict in-hospital mortality. Early elevation in D-dimer in COVID-19 patients is a significant predictor of new onset arrhythmias. Our finding suggest continuous rhythm monitoring should be adopted in this patient population during hospitalization to better risk stratify hospitalized patients and prompt earlier intervention.","Dagher, Lilas; Shi, Hanyuan; Zhao, Yan; Wetherbie, Andrew; Johnsen, Erik; Sangani, Deep; Nedunchezhian, Saihariharan; Brown, Margo; Miller, Peter; Denson, Joshua; Schieffelin, John; Marrouche, Nassir",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,,57
382983,"The Impacts of Antivirals on the Coronavirus Genome Structure and Subsequent Pathogenicity, Virus Fitness and Antiviral Design",2020,"Aims: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the prognostic value of fasting hyperglycemia in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were performed up until 18th February 2021. Fasting hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose level above the reference value. The outcome of interest was poor outcome, which was a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. The effect estimate was in odds ratio (OR). Results: There were 9,045 patients from 12 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The prevalence of fasting hyperglycemia was 29%. The incidence of poor outcome was 15%. Fasting hyperglycemia was associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 (OR 4.72 [3.32, 6.72], p<0.001; I2: 69.8%, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis in patients without prior history of diabetes showed that fasting hyperglycemia was associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 (OR 3.387 [2.433, 4.714], p<0.001; I2: 0, p=0.90). Fasting hyperglycemia has a sensitivity of 0.57 [0.45, 0.68], specificity of 0.78 [0.70, 0.84], PLR of 2.6 [2.0, 3.3], NLR of 0.55 [0.44, 0.69], DOR of 5 [3, 7], and AUC of 0.74 [0.70, 0.78] for predicting poor outcome. In this pooled analysis, fasting hyperglycemia has a 32% post-test probability for poor outcome, and absence of fasting hyperglycemia confers to a 9% post-test probability. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity varies by chronic kidney disease but not by age, male (gender), hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Conclusion: Fasting hyperglycemia was associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients, with or without diabetes.

However, as a common problem of non-financial disclosure regulation, companies can decide the extent and content of their reporting, which could potentially result in merely symbolic disclosures with little substance. We examine the disclosure of substantive actions in modern slavery statements, defined as those disclosures of corporate actions that can positively affect working conditions in supply chains. We examine the corporate disclosure of these actions over time in order to evaluate whether legally mandated disclosure requirements could lead to progress in combatting modern slavery. For this purpose, we collected modern slavery statements from companies that had issued such statements for at least two different years after the introduction of the regulatory requirement in the United Kingdom and performed a content analysis with a coding instrument that captures substantive actions against modern slavery. Our analysis uncovers extremely heterogeneous reporting practices, especially regarding the disclosure of the effectiveness of actions against modern slavery. Based on our analysis, we identify best practices of substantive disclosures to offer a benchmark for corporate self-reports of modern slavery and inform policymaking on modern slavery reporting.","Schaper, Stefan Pollach Irene",Journal of Cleaner Production,,57

The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the recently emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is one significant and unfortunate example of what the world will have to face in the future with emerging viruses in absence of appropriate treatment. The discovery of potent and specific antiviral inhibitors and/or vaccines to fight these massive outbreaks is an urgent research priority. Enzymes involved in the capping pathway of viruses and more specifically RNA N7- or 2'O-methyltransferases (MTases) are now admitted as potential targets for antiviral chemotherapy. We designed bisubstrate inhibitors by mimicking the transition state of the 2'-O-methylation of the cap RNA in order to block viral 2'-O MTases. This work resulted in the synthesis of 16 adenine dinucleosides with both adenosines connected by various nitrogen-containing linkers. Unexpectedly, all the bisubstrate compounds were barely active against 2'-O MTases of several flaviviruses or SARS-CoV but surprisingly, seven of them showed efficient and specific inhibition against SARS-CoV N7-MTase (nsp14) in the micromolar to submicromolar range. The most active nsp14 inhibitor identified is as potent as but particularly more specific than the broad-spectrum MTase inhibitor, sinefungin. Molecular docking suggests that the inhibitor binds to a pocket formed by the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and cap RNA binding sites, conserved among SARS-CoV nsp14. These dinucleoside SAM analogs will serve as starting points for the development of next inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 N7-MTase.","Ahmed-Belkacem, Rostom; Sutto-Ortiz, Priscila; Guiraud, Mathis; Canard, Bruno; Vasseur, Jean-Jacques; Decroly, Etienne; Debart, Françoise",Eur J Med Chem,,57

392485,Excessive ammonium assimilation by plastidic glutamine synthetase causes ammonium toxicity in Arabidopsis thaliana,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected all facets of everyday life including the practice of medicine. Hospital systems and medical practices have evolved to protect patients, physicians, and staff and conserve personal protective equipment and resources. Orthopaedic practices have been specifically affected by social distancing and stay at home guidelines, limiting in-office practice and elective surgery restrictions. This, in turn, has had an effect on resident education. Previous literature has been published regarding how academic programs have adjusted to these changes. However, the effects on smaller orthopaedic residencies with nonacademic faculty has not been discussed. The orthopaedic residency at Baylor University Medical Center of Dallas is a fifteen-resident program with a combination of hospital employed and private practice faculty. We adjusted our resident education in mid-March 2020 to keep residents safe while trying to maximize surgical and clinical education and outside research. GOALS: Our goals were to come up with a plan allowed for continuing high-level patient care and resident education while protecting residents and limiting burnout. MODEL: We devised a four-team system with five-day call periods. Interactions between teams were strictly minimized. We also moved to a web-based academic curriculum and devised a system for safe resident participation in surgical cases. The model has been adjusted based on attending and resident feedback. CONCLUSION: Until we develop effective treatments or vaccination for COVID-19, there is a possibility that it will be an ongoing threat. Resident education must also adapt to the changing environment while continuing to provide residents safe opportunities for patient care, didactic education, and research. We believe we have come up with a sustainable, adaptable model for resident education during this challenging time.","Oguayo, Chris C; Chu, Jennifer; Jones, Alan L",,,57

401926,Aster proteins regulate the accessible cholesterol pool in the plasma membrane,2020,"The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on containing SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying treatment strategies. While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.","Palmer, Katie; Monaco, Alessandro; Kivipelto, Miia; Onder, Graziano; Maggi, Stefania; Michel, Jean-Pierre; Prieto, Rita; Sykara, Georgia; Donde, Shaantanu",Aging Clin Exp Res,,57

We conducted a scoping review of the available literature on COVID-19 to assess the potential effect on neurologists in terms of prevalent comorbidities and incidence of new neurologic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Scopus databases for adult patients with preexisting neurologic disease who were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19 or reported incidence of secondary neurologic events following diagnosis of COVID-19. Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined. RESULTS: Among screened articles, 322 of 4,014 (8.0%) of hospitalized patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 had a preexisting neurologic illness. Four retrospective studies demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (incidence of 6%, 20%, and 36.4%, respectively). Inconsistent reporting and limited statistical analysis among these studies did not allow for assessment of comparative outcomes. CONCLUSION: Emerging literature suggests a daunting clinical relationship between COVID-19 and neurologic illness. Neurologists need to be prepared to reorganize their consultative practices to serve the neurologic needs of patients during this pandemic.","Herman, Collin; Mayer, Kirby; Sarwal, Aarti",Neurology,,57
410700,Development of a Mouse-Adapted MERS Coronavirus,2020,"This survey assessed the symptoms/signs, protective measures, awareness, and perception levels regarding COVID-19 among dentists in Lombardy, Italy. Moreover, an analysis of the answers gathered in areas with different prevalence of the disease was carried out. All Lombardy's dentists were sent an online ad hoc questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into four domains: personal data, precautionary measures (before patient arrival;in the waiting room;in the operating room), awareness, and perception. Three thousand five hundred ninety-nine questionnaires were analyzed. Five hundred two (14.43%) participants had suffered one or more symptoms referable to COVID-19. Thirty-one subjects were positive to the virus SARS-CoV-2 and 16 subjects developed the disease. Only a small number of dentists (n = 72, 2.00%) were confident of avoiding infection;dentists working in low COVID-19 prevalence areas were more confident than those working in the Milan area and high prevalence area (61.24%, 61.23%, and 64.29%, p < 0.01 respectively). The level of awareness was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the Milan area (71.82%) than in the other areas. This survey demonstrated that dentists in the COVID-19 highest prevalence area, albeit reported to have more symptoms/signs than the rest of the sample, were the ones who adopted several precautionary measures less frequently and were the more confident of avoiding infection.","Cagetti, M.

The emergence of COVID-19 worldwide has had serious consequences for physical and psychological health. Spain is one of the countries that has been most-seriously affected by the pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the COVID-19 fear scale (FCV-19S), assessing its structural validity, differential item functioning, and measurement invariance by gender and age. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was carried out in several stages. Descriptive, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, scale reliability, item differential functioning, and measurement invariance tests were carried out. Results. We obtained a single-factor scale with excellent goodness-of-fit indices and high internal consistency (alpha = .90;omega = .93) adapted to the general Spanish population. We also found a significant relationship with depression (r = .72) and anxiety (r = .84). Gender invariance testing indicated that men and women understood the scale items differently, with differences also being found by age group. Conclusions. This is the first study attempting to assess the gender and age invariance of the FCV-19S scale. The scale demonstrates adequate psychometric properties, high internal consistency, and an appropriate relationship with depression and anxiety. Men and women in the general Spanish population have different perceptions of the fear of infection by COVID-19, and the fear affects some age groups more than others.

416608,SARS_CoV2 RBD gene transcription cannot be driven by CMV promoter,2021,"Nanobiotechnology has undoubtedly influenced major breakthroughs in medical sciences. Application of nanosized materials has made it possible for researchers to investigate a broad spectrum of treatments for diseases with minimally invasive procedures. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been a subject of investigation for numerous applications in agriculture, water treatment, biosensors, textiles, and the food industry as well as in the medical field, mainly due to their antimicrobial properties and nanoparticle nature. In general, AgNPs are known for their superior physical, chemical, and biological properties. The properties of AgNPs differ based on their methods of synthesis and to date, the biological method has been preferred because it is rapid, nontoxic, and can produce well-defined size and morphology under optimized conditions. Nevertheless, the common issue concerning biological or biobased production is its sustainability. Researchers have employed various strategies in addressing this shortcoming, such as recently testing agricultural biowastes such as fruit peels for the synthesis of AgNPs. The use of biowastes is definitely cost-effective and eco-friendly; moreover, it has been reported that the reduction process is simple and rapid with reasonably high yield. This review aims to address the developments in using fruit- and vegetable-based biowastes for biologically producing AgNPs to be applied as antimicrobial coatings in biomedical applications.","Vigneswari, Sevakumaran; Amelia, Tan Suet May; Hazwan, Mohamad Hazari; Mouriya, Govindan Kothandaraman; Bhubalan, Kesaven; Amirul, Al-Ashraf Abdullah; Ramakrishna, Seeram",,,57

Concurrently, the Magnetic Expansion Control (MAGEC) rod has been issued with a number of field safety notices and UK regulator medical device alerts. METHODS: This document serves to provide an overview of the current situation regarding the use of MAGEC rods, primarily in the UK, and the impact that the pandemic has had on the management of patients with these rods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The care of each patient must of course be determined on an individual basis; however, the experience of the authors is that a short delay in scheduled distractions and clinic visits will not adversely impact patient treatment. The authors caution against a gap in distractions of longer than 6 months and emphasise the importance of continued remote patient monitoring to identify those who may need to be seen more urgently.","Hothi, Harry; Tucker, Stewart; Shafafy, Masood; Nnadi, Colin; Cheung, Kenneth M C; Dal Gal, Elisabetta; Tognini, Martina; Henckel, Johann; Skinner, John; Hart, Alister",Eur Spine J,,57

Design/methodology/approach: Written submissions from stakeholders received in response to austerity measures were analysed to identify the arguments presented to support/oppose funding cuts to PAOs. These narratives were thematically grouped into accounting, political, artistic and social categories to deliberate on the tensions that exist between these when funding PAOs. Findings: This study identifies the arguments presented by grass-root PAOs on the rationale of their existence from a Pacific perspective. The analysis suggests that accounting, hitherto considered as a “sword” can also be used as a “shield” if PAOs direct their research accordingly and offers future research directions. Originality/value: Prior studies concerning funding difficulties of PAOs have relied on opinions obtained ex-post from selected stakeholders. There are no known studies, which factor the opinions of grass-root PAOs, captured “during” funding deliberations.

423441,Structural mechanism for modulation of functional amyloid and biofilm formation by Staphylococcal Bap protein switch,2021,"We present rest-frame optical spectroscopic observations of 24 Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) at redshifts 1.7-4.6 with KECK/NIRES. Our targets are selected based on their extreme red colors to be the highest luminosity sources from the WISE infrared survey. In 20 sources with well-detected emission we fit the key [O III], H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] diagnostic lines to constrain physical conditions. Of the 17 targets with a clear detection of the [O III]$\rm \lambda$5007A emission line, 15 display broad blueshifted and asymmetric line profiles, with widths ranging from 1000 to 8000 $\rm km\ s^{-1}$ and blueshifts up to 3000 $\rm km\ s^{-1}$. These kinematics provide strong evidence for the presence of massive ionized outflows of up to $8000\ \rm M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$, with a median of $150\ \rm M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$. As many as eight sources show optical emission line ratios consistent with vigorous star formation. Balmer line star-formation rates, uncorrected for reddening, range from 30--1300 $\rm M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$, with a median of $50\ \rm M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$. Estimates of the SFR from SED fitting of mid and far-infrared photometry suggest significantly higher values. We estimate the central black hole masses to be of order $10^{8-10}\rm\ M_\odot$, assuming the present-day $\rm M_{BH}-\sigma_*$ relation. The bolometric luminosities and the estimated masses of the central black holes of these galaxies suggest that many of the AGN-dominated Hot DOGs are accreting at or above their Eddington limit. The combination of ongoing star formation, massive outflows, and high Eddington ratios suggest Hot DOGs are a transitional phase in galaxy evolution.","Finnerty, Luke; Larson, Kirsten; Soifer, B.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the electrophysiology (EP) lab activity in a referral center in Iran during the COVID-19 era. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted on EP lab activity in Shahid Chamran Heart Center, Isfahan, Iran. Two periods of COVID-19 occurrence peaks in Iran were compared with same date in 2019. Information was collected on number of diagnostic and therapeutic electrophysiology studies (EPSs) and implantation of intracardiac devices such as permanent pacemaker (PPM), implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Results: In the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic, both of EPSs and intracardiac device implantations decreased by 80% compared to the same period in 2019. The most common type of device implanted during this period was PPM (70%);however, at the time of control, the ICD (73%) was the most common. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (PSVT) was the best indication for diagnostic and therapeutic EPSs in covid and control periods. In the second peak of prevalence of COVID-19 virus infection in Iran, 6% and 36% decreases in device implantations and EPSs were seen, respectively. During this period, the number of procedures increased, although it was still lower than in 2019.

METHODS: Prospective, observational, single-center, cohort study. Sixty-four post-COVID-19 patients and fifty control were recruited. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmological examination including: Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire (OSDI), Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundus examination, Schirmer test type 1, Tear Break Up Time test (tBUT), evaluation of conjunctival hyperemia, corneal staining and tear film osmolarity test. RESULTS: OSDI score was higher in the post-COVID19 group in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (respectively p<0.001 and p =0.012). Mean tBUT in post-COVID-19 patients was 6.95 ± 4.07 sec compared to a mean tBUT of 10.12 ± 3.90 sec in the control group. The post-COVID-19 group showed a higher number of patients with a simultaneous impairment of OSDI score and tBUT (p = 0.019). The Schirmer test results were strikingly significant both in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (p <0.001 and p = 0.0014 respectively). Both quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed a significant difference in terms of tear osmolarity in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the ocular surface assessment of post-COVID-19 patients with heathy control a statistically significant increase of DED has emerged both in subjective and objective evaluations. Our clinical results support the findings that suggested a susceptibility of the ocular surface to the virus and it underlines the importance of the ocular surface assessment in post-COVID-19 patients for a correct diagnosis and therapy.","Gambini, Gloria; Savastano, Maria Cristina; Savastano, Alfonso; De Vico, Umberto; Crincoli, Emanuele; Cozzupoli, Maria Grazia; Culiersi, Carola; Rizzo, Stanislao",Cornea,,57

We assessed sensitivity using 128 serum samples from symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19-infected patients, and specificity using 1204 samples submitted for routine serologies prior to COVID-19's emergence, plus 64 pandemic-era samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative patients with respiratory symptoms. Assays were evaluated as stand-alone tests and as components of a two-test algorithm in which positive results obtained using one assay were verified using a second assay. Results. The two nucleocapsid antibody tests were more sensitive than the spike-protein antibody test overall (70% and 70% versus 57%; P&#8804;0.003), with pronounced differences observed using samples collected 7-14 days after symptom onset. All three assays were comparably sensitive (&#8805;89%, P&#8805;0.13) using samples collected >14 days after symptom onset. Specificity was higher using the nucleocapsid antibody tests (99.3% and 99.7%) compared with the spike protein antibody test (97.8%, P&#8804;0.002). When any two assays were paired in a two-test algorithm, specificity was 99.9% (P<0.0001 to 0.25 compared with the individual assays), and positive predictive value (PPV) improved substantially with minimal effect on negative predictive value (NPV). Conclusions. Two nucleocapsid antibody tests outperformed a spike protein antibody test. Pairing two different serologic tests in a two-test algorithm improves PPV compared with the individual assays alone, while maintaining NPV.","Turbett, Sarah E; Anahtar, Melis; Dighe, Anand S; Garcia Beltran, Wilfredo; Miller, Tyler; Scott, Hannah; Durbin, Sienna Marie; Bharadwaj, Maheetha; Thomas, Jason; Gogakos, Tasos S; Astudillo, Michael; Lennerz, Jochen; Rosenberg, Eric S; Branda, John A",J. clin. microbiol,,57
433952,Tenofovir-Amino Acid Conjugates Act as Polymerase Substrates-Implications for Avoiding Cellular Phosphorylation in the Discovery of Nucleotide Analogues,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and variants has led to significant mortality. We recently reported that an RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 system, termed prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human (PAC-MAN), offered an antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Here, we expand in silico analysis to use PAC-MAN to target a broad spectrum of human- or livestock-infectious RNA viruses with high specificity, coverage, and predicted efficiency. Our analysis reveals that a minimal set of 14 crRNAs is able to target >90% of human-infectious viruses across 10 RNA virus families. We predict that a set of 5 experimentally validated crRNAs can target new SARS-CoV-2 variant sequences with zero mismatches. We also build an online resource (crispr-pacman.stanford.edu) to support community use of CRISPR-Cas13 for broad-spectrum RNA virus targeting. Our work provides a new bioinformatic resource for using CRISPR-Cas13 to target diverse RNA viruses in order to facilitate development of CRISPR-based antivirals.","Lin, Xueqiu; Liu, Yanxia; Chemparathy, Augustine; Pande, Tara; La Russa, Marie; Qi, Lei Stanley",Cell Rep Med,,57
434945,Association of the Hepatitis B Virus Large Surface Protein with Viral Infectivity and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-mediated Liver Carcinogenesis,2020,"With the rapid spread of the novel COVID-19 virus, there is an increasing demand for screening COVID-19 patients. Typical methods for screening coronavirus patients have a large false detection rate. An effective and reliable screening method for detecting coronavirus is required. For this reason, some other reliable methods such as Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is employed to detect coronavirus accurately. In this paper, we present a 3D-Deep learning based method that automatically screens coronavirus patients using 3D volumetric CT image data. Our proposed system assists medical practitioners to effectively screen out COVID-19 patients. We performed extensive experiments on two datasets i.e., CC-19 and COVID-CT using various state-of-the-art 3D Deep learning based methods including 3D ResNets, C3D, 3D DenseNets, I3D, and LRCN. The results of the experiments show the competitive effectiveness of our proposed approach.","Khan, A.

Objective: This review synthesized the evidence of correlation between demographic factors, social media exposure, stressors and anxiety and depression status in the early phase of COVID-19. Method: A systematically search included observational studies published before May15, 2020. We selected studies designed with valid measuring instruments of anxiety and depression. Result: 20 articles were included (19 cross-sectional) for review. People who were divorced/widowed, with poor self-rated health status, chronic illness and previous psychiatric illness had higher anxiety and depression prevalence. Higher COVID-19 awareness (including COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary measure) decreased anxiety and depression. The protective measures to reduce anxiety and depression levels included avoiding sharing meals, frequently washing hands and wearing mask. Economic loss, academic delay, influence of daily life, worrying and symptoms related to infection were stressors of anxiety and depression. There were lots of inconsistent results due to convenience sampling and diverse measuring instrument. Conclusion: Our review suggested that reliable information from health authorities, enhancing health literacies and prevention measures of general population can reduce anxiety and depression levels.","Lin, Chung-Yi; Lin, Ying-Li",Arch.

Here, we interrogated the brain stems and olfactory bulbs in postmortem patients who had COVID-19 using imaging mass cytometry to understand the local immune response at a spatially resolved, high-dimensional, single-cell level and compared their immune map to non-COVID respiratory failure, multiple sclerosis, and control patients. We observed substantial immune activation in the central nervous system with pronounced neuropathology (astrocytosis, axonal damage, and blood-brain-barrier leakage) and detected viral antigen in ACE2-receptor-positive cells enriched in the vascular compartment. Microglial nodules and the perivascular compartment represented COVID-19-specific, microanatomic-immune niches with context-specific cellular interactions enriched for activated CD8+ T cells. Altered brain T-cell-microglial interactions were linked to clinical measures of systemic inflammation and disturbed hemostasis. This study identifies profound neuroinflammation with activation of innate and adaptive immune cells as correlates of COVID-19 neuropathology, with implications for potential therapeutic strategies.","Schwabenland, Marius; Salié, Henrike; Tanevski, Jovan; Killmer, Saskia; Lago, Marilyn Salvat; Schlaak, Alexandra Emilia; Mayer, Lena; Matschke, Jakob; Püschel, Klaus; Fitzek, Antonia; Ondruschka, Benjamin; Mei, Henrik E; Boettler, Tobias; Neumann-Haefelin, Christoph; Hofmann, Maike; Breithaupt, Angele; Genc, Nafiye; Stadelmann, Christine; Saez-Rodriguez, Julio; Bronsert, Peter; Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter; Blank, Thomas; Thimme, Robert; Glatzel, Markus; Prinz, Marco; Bengsch, Bertram",Immunity,,57

In this sense, the role that essential and toxic metals/metalloids have in the development and course of this disease is being studied. Metals/metalloids such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury or vanadium, are elements with known toxic effects in mammals, while trace elements such as cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc are considered essential. Given the importance of metals/metalloids in nutrition and human health, the present review was aimed at assessing the relationship between various essential and toxic metals/metalloids and the health outcomes related with the COVID-19. We are in the position to conclude that particular attention must be paid to the load/levels of essential trace elements in COVID-19 patients, mainly zinc and selenium. On the other hand, the exposure to air pollutants in general, and toxic metal/metalloids in particular, should be avoided as much as possible to reduce the possibilities of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.","Domingo, Jose L; Marquès, Montse",Food Chem Toxicol,,57

460724,Pathways and challenges towards a complete characterization of microgels,2020,"Background: The rapid growth in cases of COVID-19 has challenged national healthcare capacity, testing systems at an advanced ICU, and public health infrastructure level. This global study evaluates the association between multi-factorial healthcare capacity and case fatality of COVID-19 patients by adjusting for demographic, health expenditure, population density, and prior burden of non-communicable disease. It also explores the impact of government relationships with civil society as a predictor of infection and mortality rates. Methods: Data were extracted from the Johns Hopkins University database, World Bank records and the National Civic Space Ratings 2020 database. This study used data from 86 countries which had at least 1,000 confirmed cases on 30th April 2020. Negative binomial regression model was used to assess the association between case fatality (a ratio of total number of confirmed deaths to total number of confirmed cases) and healthcare capacity index adjusting for other covariates. Findings: Regression analysis shows that greater healthcare capacity was related to lesser case-fatality [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.5811; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4727–0.7184; p &lt; 0.001] with every additional unit increase in the healthcare capacity index associated with a 42% decrease in the case fatality. Health expenditure and civil society variables did not reach statistical significance but were positively associated with case fatalities. Interpretation: Based on preliminary data, this research suggests that building effective multidimensional healthcare capacity is the most promising means to mitigate future case fatalities. The data also suggests that government's ability to implement public health measures to a degree determines mortality outcomes.","Khan, Jahidur Rahman; Awan, Nabil; Islam, Md.

Herein, different databases are reviewed to evaluate modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and study the effects of negative pressure ventilation, air conditioning system, and related protection approaches of this virus. Droplet transmission was commonly reported to occur in particles with diameter >5 µm that can quickly settle gravitationally on surfaces (1-2 m). Instead, fine and ultrafine particles (airborne transmission) can stay suspended for an extended period of time (&#8805;2 h) and be transported further, e.g., up to 8 m through simple diffusion and convection mechanisms. Droplet and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can be limited indoors with adequate ventilation of rooms, by routine disinfection of toilets, using negative pressure rooms, using face masks, and maintaining social distancing. Other preventive measures recommended include increasing the number of screening tests of suspected carriers of SARS-CoV-2, reducing the number of persons in a room to minimize sharing indoor air, and monitoring people's temperature before accessing a building. The work reviews a body of literature supporting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through air, causing COVID-19 disease, which requires coordinated worldwide strategies.","Delikhoon, Mahdieh; Guzman, Marcelo I; Nabizadeh, Ramin; Norouzian Baghani, Abbas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,57

A list of precautionary measures were set by healthcare professional experts to protect public from infection, social physical distancing measures being the most efficient. On the other hand, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established protective guidelines for healthcare workers to guarantee a healthy workplace and safe environment. The physical distancing measures have obviously reshaped the relationship between family members leading to better quality of family life. Meanwhile, travel suspension also led to slightly higher health standards with less air pollution, lower traffic induced stress levels and subsequently a greener footprint. Herein, we intend to highlight the impact of COVID-19 pandemic protective measures on family connections, as well as on environmental health. Moreover, we aimed at pointing out the effect on Saudi Arabian cultural and humanitarian behavior in dealing with the pandemic under the governance care of the custodian of the two holy mosques; King Salman Al-Saud. In fact, a combination of restrictive and protective measures is the most efficient to curb COVID-19 spread. In addition to improving the quality of social life, this pandemic revealed a healthier climate, which will certainly be visible on a large scale.

465953,Metagenomic analysis of fecal and tissue samples from 18 endemic bat species in Switzerland revealed a diverse virus composition including potentially zoonotic viruses,2021,"BACKGROUND: Old age is associated with a significantly increased mortality in COVID-19 patients exposed to long-term controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and suggested to be due to the hyperinflammatory response associated with the viral infection. However, our understanding of age-related differences in the response to CMV in the absence of a viral infection remains insufficient. METHODS: Young (7-8 months) and old (28-32 months) F344 BN hybrid rats were exposed to the ICU condition for 5 days, i.e., complete immobilization, mechanical ventilation, and extensive monitoring. Transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and proteomics (Proximity Extension Assay) analyses of the diaphragm and proteomics analysis of plasma were conducted to investigate the molecular differences between young and old rats exposed to the ICU condition. RESULTS: According to multi-omics analyses, significant differences were observed in the diaphragm between young and old rats in response to 5 days CMV and immobilization. In young rats, metabolic pathways were primarily downregulated in response to immobilization (post-synaptic blockade of neuromuscular transmission). In old rats, on the other hand, dramatic immune and inflammatory responses were observed, i.e., an upregulation of specific related pathways such as ""IL-17 signaling pathway"", along with a higher level of inflammatory factors and cytokine/chemokine in plasma. CONCLUSIONS: The dramatically increased mortality in old ICU patients with COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and cytokine storm need not only reflect the viral infection but may also be associated with the ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) and hyperinflammatory responses induced by long-term CMV per se. Although mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention in COVID-19 ICU patients, CMV should be cautiously used especially in old age and other means of respiratory support may be considered, such as negative pressure ventilation.","Lyu, Qiong; Wen, Ya; Zhang, Xiang; Addinsall, Alex B; Cacciani, Nicola; Larsson, Lars",Skelet Muscle,,57

However, it is imperative that instructors realize that the challenge is greater than simply converting paper-based assignments into a digital format. There has been very little research done examining the cognitive effects of writing on a smartphone, compared to writing on paper. The current study therefore sought to examine how recollection of content differed depending on the medium used for notetaking. A population of 138 Japanese university students of English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) were asked to transcribe a short text, either by paper or by smartphone, and then quizzed on the content immediately afterwards. Students who wrote the text by hand were found to have significantly greater recollection of the content compared to those who had 'tapped' on smartphones. These results follow precursor research which indicated that Japanese students compose significantly slower on their phones in English (Lee, 2020b), and wrote significantly less in writing tasks (Lee, 2019, 2020a) than handwriting counterparts.","Lee, Bradford J",Acta Psychol (Amst),,57

This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic on population birth outcomes in Wales, rates of primary immunisations and examine expectant mothers experiences of pregnancy including self-reported levels of stress and anxiety. MethodsPopulation-level birth outcomes in Wales: Stillbirths, prematurity, birth weight and Caesarean section births before (2016-2019) and during (2020) the pandemic were compared using national-level routine anonymised data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. The first three scheduled primary immunisations were compared between 2019 and 2020. Self-reported pregnancy experience: 215 expectant mothers (aged 16+) in Wales completed an online survey about their experiences of pregnancy during the pandemic. The qualitative survey data was analysed using codebook thematic analysis. FindingsThere was no significant difference between annual outcomes including gestation and birth weight, stillbirths, and Caesarean sections for infants born in 2020 compared to 2016-2019. There was an increase in late term births ([≥]42 weeks gestation) during the first lockdown (OR: 1.28, p=0.019) and a decrease in moderate to late preterm births (32-36 weeks gestation) during the second lockdown (OR: 0.74, p=0.001). Fewer babies were born in 2020 (N=29,031) compared to 2016-2019 (average N=32,582). All babies received their immunisations in 2020, but there were minor delays in the timings of vaccines. Those due at 8-weeks were 8% less likely to be on time (within 28-days) and at 16-weeks, they were 19% less likely to be on time. The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of 71% of survey respondents, who reported anxiety, stress and loneliness; this was associated with attending scans without their partner, giving birth alone, and minimal contact with midwives. InterpretationThe pandemic had a negative impact on mothers experiences of pregnancy; however, population-level data suggests that this did not translate to adverse birth outcomes for babies born during the pandemic.","Jones, Hope; Seaborne, Mike; Cowley, Laura; Odd, David E; Paranjothy, Shantini; Akbari, Ashley; Brophy, Sinead",,,57
476323,A HaloTag-TEV genetic cassette for mechanical phenotyping of proteins from tissues,2020,"BACKGROUND: The availability and utility of public statements and policies on gender equity from professional surgical societies has not been studied. METHODS: Professional surgical society websites were searched for publicly available statements and policies related to gender equity. These were compiled and assessed for critical components. RESULTS: Publicly available statements/policies were published in every surgical society, though few pertained specifically to gender. Nearly all were recently written or revised. The most common statement/policy addressed discrimination and harassment. The only policies/statements that reliably contained all four key components pertained to professional conduct at national meetings. All policies that provided consequences also contained specific reporting processes. CONCLUSIONS: Gender equity statements and policies are deficient among professional surgical societies. Prioritization of publicizing statements/policies that describe the challenges and provide potential solutions to well-documented gender inequities within surgical fields allows professional societies to promote a diverse and equitable workforce.","Heisler, Christine A; Miller, Pringl; Stephens, Elizabeth H; Ton, Jessica; Temkin, Sarah M",Am. j. surg,,57

This has led to a growing interest in disaster medicine. In this review, we report current evidence related to disasters and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such as cardiovascular diseases during disasters, management of disaster hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19. This review summarizes the time course and mechanisms of disaster-related diseases. It also discusses the use of information and communication technology (ICT) as a cardiovascular risk management strategy to prevent cardiovascular events. During the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, we used the ""Disaster Cardiovascular Prevention"" system that was employed for blood pressure (BP) monitoring and risk management using ICT. We introduced an ICT-based BP monitoring device at evacuation centers and shared patients' BP values in the database to support BP management by remote monitoring, which led to improved BP control. Effective use of telemedicine using ICT is important for risk management of cardiovascular diseases during disasters and pandemics in the future.","Narita, Keisuke; Hoshide, Satoshi; Tsoi, Kelvin; Siddique, Saulat; Shin, Jinho; Chia, Yook-Chin; Tay, Jam Chin; Teo, Boon Wee; Turana, Yuda; Chen, Chen-Huan; Cheng, Hao-Min; Sogunuru, Guru Prasad; Wang, Tzung-Dau; Wang, Ji-Guang; Kario, Kazuomi",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),,57

Design: Retrospective. Setting: Two acute care inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (AR1 and AR2) and 1 long-term acute care hospital (LTAC). Participants: Records of inpatients seen by the vision service. Interventions: Records from a one-year telemedicine pilot performed at AR1 and then expanded to AR2 and LTAC during COVID-19 were reviewed. In the virtual visits, an occupational therapist (OT) measured the patients' vision with the iPad apps and forwarded results to the off-site Optometrist (OD) for review prior to a video visit. The OD provided diagnosis and education, press-on prisms, strategies and modifications, and follow-up recommendations. Providers completed the telehealth usability questionnaire (10-point scale). Main Outcome Measures: Vision exams per month at AR1 before and with telemedicine. Results: With telemedicine at AR1, mean visits per month significantly increased from 10.7 ± 5 to 14.9 ± 5 (p=0.002). Prism was trialed in 40% of cases of which 83% were successful, similar to previously reported in-person success rates. COVID-19 caused only a marginal decrease in visits per month (p = 0.08) at AR1, whereas the site without an established program (AR2) had a 3-4 week gap in care while the program was initiated. Cases at the LTAC tended to be more complex and difficult to manage virtually. The telehealth usability questionnaire median category scores were 7 for Ease of Use, 8 for Interface Quality, 6 for Reliability, and 9 for Satisfaction and Future Use. Conclusions: The virtual vision clinic process improved inpatient access to eye and visual neuro-rehabilitation assessment before and during the COVID-19 quarantine and was well accepted by providers and patients.","Keilty, Matthew; Houston, Kevin E; Collins, Caroline; Trehan, Ritika; Chen, Ya-Ting; Merabet, Lotfi; Watts, Amy; Pundlik, Shrinivas; Luo, Gang",Arch Rehabil Res Clin Transl,,57

498562,Competition between the Photothermal Effect and Emission in Potential Phototherapy Agents,2021,"In this review, we evaluate the mechanisms behind the decentralized finance protocols for generating stable, passive income. Currently, such savings interest rates can be as high as 20% annually, payable in traditional currency values such as US dollars. Therefore, one can benefit from the growth of the cryptocurrency markets, with minimal exposure to their volatility risks. We aim to explain the rationale behind these savings products in simple terms. The key to this puzzle is that asset deposits in cryptocurrency ecosystems are of intrinsic economic value, as they facilitate network consensus mechanisms and automated marketplaces (e.g. for lending). These functions create wealth for the participants, and they provide unique advantages unavailable in traditional financial systems. Our review speaks to the notion of decentralized basic income - analogous to universal basic income but guaranteed by financial products on blockchains instead of public policies. We will go through their implementations of how savings can be channeled into the staking deposits in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols, through fixed-rate lending protocols and staking derivative tokens, thereby exposing savers with minimal risks. We will discuss potential pitfalls, assess how these protocols may behave in market cycles, as well as suggest areas for further research and development.","Lau, Hakwan; Tse, Stephen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14312v2.pdf,57

Nevertheless, the risk of mortality has not been previously quantified. The aim of this meta-analysis is to quantify the risk of mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. A meta-analysis was conducted analyzing the impact of (1) sex, (2) age, (3) CVD with coronary artery disease (CAD), (4) CAD alone, (5) CVD without CAD, (6) hypertension, (7) cerebrovascular diseases, and (8) diabetes on mortality. Relative risk was assessed for dichotomous variables, mean difference for continuous variables. Twenty-six studies were included, encompassing 8497 patients. Males had 16% higher risk of mortality than females (p < 0.05) and elderly patients had higher chance of dying than younger patients (p < 0.0001). Patients with overall CVD have a 1.96-fold higher mortality risk (p < 0.0001). CAD increases risk of mortality by 1.90-fold (p < 0.05). CVD-CAD were found to increase risk up to 2.03-fold (p < 0.05). Hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes increase the risk of death up to 1.73-fold, 1.76-fold and 1.59-fold, respectively (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05, respectively).

This paper explores the governance of human resources during the pandemic, looking at the Quebec health system as a revelatory case. We identify three issues related to health human resource (HHR) policies: working conditions, recognition at work and scope of practice. We empirically probe these issues based on an analysis of popular media, policy reports and participant observation by the lead authors in various forums and research projects. Using an integrated model of HHR, we identify major vulnerabilities in this domain. Persistent labour shortages, endemic deficiencies in working environments and inequity across occupational categories limit the ability to address critical HHR issues. We propose three ways to eliminate HHR vulnerabilities: reorganize work through participatory initiatives, implement joint policy making to rebalance power across the health workforce, and invest in the development of capacities at all system levels.","Denis, Jean Louis; Côté, Nancy; Fleury, Charles; Currie, Graeme; Spyridonidis, Dimitrios",Int. j. health plann. manage,,57

This study aims to evaluate the dissemination of the COVID-19 research data underlying scientific publications. Analysis of COVID-19 publications from December 1, 2019, to April 30, 2020, was conducted through the PubMed Central repository to evaluate the research data available through its publication as supplementary material or deposited in repositories. The PubMed Central search generated 5,905 records, of which 804 papers included complementary research data, especially as supplementary material (77.4%). The most productive journals were The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and The Lancet Infectious Diseases, the most frequent keyword was pneumonia, and the most used repositories were GitHub and GenBank. An expected growth in the number of published articles following the course of the pandemics is confirmed in this work, while the underlying research data are only 13.6%. It can be deduced that data sharing is not a common practice, even in health emergencies, such as the present one. High-impact generalist journals have accounted for a large share of global publishing. The topics most often covered are related to epidemiological and public health concepts, genetics, virology and respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia. However, it is essential to interpret these data with caution following the evolution of publications and their funding in the coming months.","Lucas-Dominguez, Rut; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo; Vidal-Infer, Antonio; Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael",Scientometrics,,57

AIM: The study was performed to describe the changes in hospital admissions during the first phase of the pandemic. METHODS: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health established a national preparedness register with daily updates on COVID-19 cases and the use of health services. We used individual-level information on inpatients from the electronic journal systems for all hospitals in Norway to estimate daily hospital admissions. RESULTS: Before the onset of the pandemic in March, there was an average of 2400 inpatient admissions per day in Norway, which decreased to approximately 1500 in the first few days after lockdown measures were implemented. The relative magnitudes of the decreases were similar in men and women and across all age groups. The decreases were substantial for both elective (54%) and emergency (29%) inpatient care. The admission rate gradually increased and reached pre-pandemic levels in June. However, the reductions in admissions for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease seemed to persist. CONCLUSIONS: The elective and emergency inpatient admission rates were substantially reduced a few days after the pandemic response measures were implemented. The ways in which the lack or postponement of care may have affected the health and well-being of patients is an important issue to be addressed in future research.","Helgeland, Jon; Telle, Kjetil E; Grøsland, Mari; Huseby, Beate M; Håberg, Siri; Lindman, Anja S E",Scand J Public Health,,57

We sought to evaluate this question using a well-validated scoring system (the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema [RALE] score) using data over 6 months from a large, multi-hospital healthcare system including all adult (age &gt;= 18) patients. Methods: We collected CXRs, demographic, historic and clinical data from patients with a nasoand/ or oropharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR visiting the ED for COVID-19-related complaints between March and September 2020. Two independent reviewers quantified radiographic edema using the RALE scoring system. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was calculated using 1 liter per minute (lpm) supplemental O2 to 3% FiO2 conversion and capped at 15 lpm O2. We examined the association of radiographic edema with hypoxemia, need for hospital admission, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation within 7 days of admission and 30-day mortality. Results: 453 patients met criteria for inclusion (median age 54, 51% female). Inter-rate agreement for RALE score was excellent (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.89, 95% CI 0.87-0.92, p &lt; 0.0001). 99 patients had a normal (RALE = 0) CXR on ED visit. Median RALE score was 3. RALE scores negatively correlated with degree of hypoxemia as quantified by SpO2-FiO2 (SF) ratio (r =-0.34, p &lt; 0.001). Patients admitted to the hospital had higher RALE scores than those who were discharged home (median 2 IQR [0, 6] vs 3 [10, 17], p &lt; 0.001). Among 199 patients admitted to the hospital, RALE scores were higher in those requiring admission to the ICU compared to those who did not (7 [14,20], 2 [8,16], p = 0.007). Patients in the 3rd and 4th RALE quartiles were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and had higher 30-day mortality compared to those with RALE scores below the median, even after adjustment for age, SF ratio and history of diabetes (p &lt; 0.02 for all). Conclusions: The RALE score is highly reproducible and easily implementable in adult patients presenting to the ED with COVID-19. Its association with physiologic parameters and outcomes makes it a readily available tool for prognostication and early ICU triage, particularly in patients with severe radiographic edema as quantified by the RALE score.","Kotok, D.; Girard, C.; Rivera Robles, J.; Kim, A.; Shettigar, S.; Lavina, A.; Gillenwater, S.; Hadeh, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,57

Cytoplasmic extracts containing viral proteins and template RNA were prepared by lysolecithin permeabilization of MHV-infected cells. Synthetic leader RNA which differed in sequence from the endogenous leader RNA was added to the extracts and demonstrated to be incorporated into MHV mRNAs. Irrespective of the size of leader RNAs added, the exogenous leader RNA was joined to the endogenous mRNA at the same site, which corresponds to a UCUAA pentanucleotide repeat region. Only leader RNAs containing the pentanucleotide sequences could be utilized for transcription. Mismatches between the intergenic site and the exogenous leader sequence within the pentanucleotide repeat region were corrected in the in vitro system. This in vitro system thus established a novel mechanism of leader-primed transcription using exogenous RNA in trans, and suggests the involvement of a specific ribonuclease activity during coronavirus mRNA synthesis.","Baker, S C; Lai, M M",The EMBO journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2174358/,57

The importance of HGSF for poverty alleviation (SDG1) and zero hunger (SDG 2) have been recognized by the United Nations Hunger Task Force and the African Union Development Agency–New Partnership for African Development (AUDA-NEPAD), which formulated a strategy for HGSF to improve nutrition for the growing youth population across Africa. A scoping review was conducted to understand the lessons learned from SFPs, which included fish and fish products from small-scale producers, identifying the challenges and best practices for the inclusion of fish, opportunities for improvements across the supply chain, and gaps in nutritional requirements for schoolchildren which could be improved through the inclusion of fish. Challenges to the inclusion fish in SFPs include food safety, supply and access to raw materials, organizational capacity, and cost, while good practices include the engagement of various stakeholders in creating and testing fish products, and repurposing fisheries by-products or using underutilized species to ensure cost-effective solutions. This study builds evidence of the inclusion of nutritious fish and fish products in SFPs, highlighting the need to replicate and scale good practices to ensure sustainable, community-centred, and demand-driven solutions for alleviating poverty, malnutrition, and contributing to greater health and wellbeing in adolescence.","Ahern, Molly B.; Thilsted, Shakuntala Haraksingh; Kjellevold, Marian; Overå, Ragnhild; Toppe, Jogeir; Doura, Michele; Kalaluka, Edna; Wismen, Bendula; Vargas, Melisa; Franz, Nicole",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574190/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10092080,57
591780,Single cell transcriptomics comes of age,2020-08-27,"Since the emergence of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), profound alterations in general and specialist dental practice have been imposed to provide safe dental care. The guidelines introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate healthcare disruption are inconsistent regarding the dental practice re-installation, particularly during a transitional time. Despite the successful mass vaccination campaigns rolled out in 2021, the presence of more than 80 genotypes of COVID-19, rapid neutralisation of antibodies within a short period of seropositivity, and the likelihood of recurrent infection raise some doubts on whether vaccination alone will provide long-term immunity against COVID-19 and its variants. Here, from this perspective, we aim to provide an initial proposal for dental services reinstallation, easily applicable in various care settings. We discuss the potential options for the transition of dental services, as well as challenges and opportunities to adapt to new circumstances after mass COVID-19 vaccination. The proposal of the universal three-tier system of dental services resumption, determined by regional COVID-19 rates, testing accessibility, and vaccination rollout has been presented. Following herd COVID-19 immunity enhancement, it would be prudent to confer various preventative measures until virus spread naturally diminishes or becomes less virulent. Based on modelling data, dental practices may not return to normal, routine operation even after global vaccination as there would still be a significant risk of outbreaks of infection. Variable, multi-level measures will still be required, depending on the local COVID-19 cases rate, to secure safe dental care provision, despite predicted success of vaccination agendas. This approach can be implemented by achievable, practical means as a part of risk assessment, altered work pattern, and re-arrange of dental surgery facilities. The adequate standard operating procedure, with the support of rapid point-of-care testing at workplace, would vastly intensify the uninterrupted recovery of the dental care sector.","Farshidfar, Nima; Jafarpour, Dana; Hamedani, Shahram; Dziedzic, Arkadiusz; Tanasiewicz, Marta",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068858/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10102116,57

Here, we develop a metapopulation SEIR disease model that uses dynamic mobility networks, derived from US cell phone data, to capture the hourly movements of millions of people from local neighborhoods (census block groups, or CBGs) to points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants, grocery stores, or religious establishments. We simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from March 1-May 2, 2020 among a population of 105 million people in 10 of the largest US metropolitan statistical areas. We show that by integrating these mobility networks, which connect 60k CBGs to 565k POIs with a total of 5.4 billion hourly edges, even a relatively simple epidemiological model can accurately capture the case trajectory despite dramatic changes in population behavior due to the virus. Furthermore, by modeling detailed information about each POI, like visitor density and visit length, we can estimate the impacts of fine-grained reopening plans: we predict that a small minority of ""superspreader"" POIs account for a large majority of infections, that reopening some POI categories (like full-service restaurants) poses especially large risks, and that strategies restricting maximum occupancy at each POI are more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our models also predict higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups solely from differences in mobility: disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce mobility as sharply, and the POIs they visit (even within the same category) tend to be smaller, more crowded, and therefore more dangerous. By modeling who is infected at which locations, our model supports fine-grained analyses that can inform more effective and equitable policy responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Chang, S.

592312,Analysis of the humoral immune responses among cynomolgus macaque naturally infected with Reston virus during the 1996 outbreak in the Philippines,2012-10-11,"The diagnosis and treatment of sepsis have always been a challenge for the physician, especially in critical care setting such as emergency department (ED), and currently sepsis remains one of the major causes of mortality. Although the traditional definition of sepsis based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria changed in 2016, replaced by the new criteria of SEPSIS-3 based on organ failure evaluation, early identification and consequent early appropriated therapy remain the primary goal of sepsis treatment. Unfortunately, currently there is a lack of a foolproof system for making early sepsis diagnosis because conventional diagnostic tools like cultures take a long time and are often burdened with false negatives, while molecular techniques require specific equipment and have high costs. In this context, biomarkers, such as C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT), are very useful tools to distinguish between normal and pathological conditions, graduate the disease severity, guide treatment, monitor therapeutic responses and predict prognosis. Among the new emerging biomarkers of sepsis, Presepsin (P-SEP) appears to be the most promising. Several studies have shown that P-SEP plasma levels increase during bacterial sepsis and decline in response to appropriate therapy, with sensitivity and specificity values comparable to those of PCT. In neonatal sepsis, P-SEP compared to PCT has been shown to be more effective in diagnosing and guiding therapy. Since in sepsis the P-SEP plasma levels increase before those of PCT and since the current methods available allow measurement of P-SEP plasma levels within 17 min, P-SEP appears a sepsis biomarker particularly suited to the emergency department and critical care.","Piccioni, Andrea; Santoro, Michele Cosimo; de Cunzo, Tommaso; Tullo, Gianluca; Cicchinelli, Sara; Saviano, Angela; Valletta, Federico; Pascale, Marco Maria; Candelli, Marcello; Covino, Marcello; Franceschi, Francesco",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440976/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57080770,57

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese civil servants have faced high workloads that may contribute to mental disorders. We assessed the prevalence of both depression and anxiety symptoms among civil servants in Jiangsu and surrounding provinces using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Methods: The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used to assess the severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results: In total, 867 Chinese civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control were included in our study. Overall, 37.25 and 38.06% of all respondents reported having symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Respondents who were younger and more educated and those who had fewer years of work experience had higher scores for both depression and anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that being a woman, being younger, having more education and having fewer years of work experience were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, whether they had experience combating infectious diseases or worked in frontline, there was no significant difference between respondents with and without experience, as well as between frontline and non-frontline workers, in both symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions: The civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control reported suffering from varying degrees of mental disorders. Therefore, more attention should be devoted to the psychological distress of these civil servants.","Hu, Qingqing; Hu, Xiaochu; Zheng, Beibei; Li, Lanjuan",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996707/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.601791,57

METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study. We evaluated the feasibility of a strategy based on the conversion of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations to manage IBD outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 4-item telephone survey (3 closed questions and a 100-point numeric description scale) was conducted to evaluate satisfaction of patients with telephone consultations. RESULTS: Between March 11 and April 8, 2020, 98% of the 216 scheduled face-to-face visits could be converted to telephone consultations, and we resolved an additional 162 urgent consultations by telephone. The rate of IBD-related hospitalization and visits to the emergency department decreased by 50% and 58%, respectively, compared with rates in the same period the previous year. The 4-item survey was conducted in 171 outpatients. In closed questions, patients reported a very high degree of satisfaction with telephone consultations, with no differences between scheduled (n = 123) and urgent consultations (n = 48; P = NS). The overall satisfaction rating with the telephone consultation evaluated with the numerical description scale was 94% and 93% for scheduled and urgent consultations, respectively (P < 0.82). Less than 20% of patients would have preferred a face-to-face visit to the telephone consultation at the time. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy based on the conversion of face-to-face visits to telephone consultations was able to guarantee a minimum standard quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The data document quantitative trait loci (QTL) with statistically significant effects on CD4, CD8, and CD8 memory T cells, and on subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells that express P-glycoprotein. Some of the loci detected were robust, in the sense that they produced effects of similar size both in mated female mice, and in a population that included male and female virgin animals. Some of the effects were stable, in that they were apparent at both 8 and 18 months of age, but others were age-specific, showing effects either at 8 or at 18 months but not at both ages. Genes that had an effect on the same T cell subset were in almost all cases additive rather than epistatic, and their combined effects could produce large overall effects, leading in the most dramatic case to a two-fold difference in CD8 memory cells. The analysis also documented two QTL, on chromosomes 4 and 13, that regulate an age-sensitive composite index of T cell subset pattern which has been shown previously to be a predictor of life expectancy in these mice. The analysis thus reveals both subset-specific genes and others which modulate the overall pattern of age-sensitive changes in T cell subset distributions.","Jackson, A U; Galecki, A T; Burke, D T; Miller, R A",Genes Immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595899/,57

However, using that objective ignores that some of these interventions, like bans of public events or lockdowns, must be transitory and as short as possible because of their significant economic and societal costs. Here, we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating epidemic outbreaks. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the desired maximum of disease prevalence and the maximum decrease of disease transmission that the interventions can achieve. We study the implications of our theoretical results for designing non-pharmaceutical interventions in 16 cities and regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of each region’s contact rate necessary to control the epidemic optimally. Our results contribute to establishing a rigorous methodology to design optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for mitigating epidemic outbreaks.","Angulo, Marco Tulio; Castaños, Fernando; Moreno-Morton, Rodrigo; Velasco-Hernández, Jorge X.; Moreno, Jaime A.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975462/,57

Understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance to be able to respond to outbreaks and take action against spread of the disease. Transmission within the household is a concern, especially because infection control is difficult to apply within the household domain. Methods We used comprehensive administrative register data from Denmark, comprising the full population and all COVID-19 tests, to estimate household transmission risk and attack rate. Results We studied the testing dynamics for COVID-19 and found that the day after receiving a positive test result within the household, 35% of potential secondary cases were tested and 13% of these were positive. After a primary case in 6,782 households, 82% of potential secondary cases were tested within 14 days, of which 17% tested positive as secondary cases, implying an attack rate of 17%. Among primary cases, those aged 0-24 were underrepresented when compared with the total population. We found an approximately linearly increasing relationship between attack rate and age. We investigated the transmission risk from primary cases by age, and found an increasing risk with age of primary cases for adults, while the risk seems to decrease with age for children. Conclusions Although there is an increasing attack rate and transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 with age, children are also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 within the household.","Lyngse, F. P.; Kirkeby, C.

Given the similarities in clinical and laboratory features between this disease and sepsis, and the differences in treatment strategies for these two diseases, specific diagnostic markers are crucial for the correct diagnosis and management of AOSD. Previous studies have shown plasma heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a promising potential biomarker for AOSD; thus, this study aimed to detect serum HBP levels in patients with AOSD or sepsis to assess its potential as a biomarker for differential diagnosis. We found that serum HBP levels were significantly higher in patients with active AOSD than that in those with inactive AOSD. Patients with sepsis had higher serum HBP levels compared with those who had active or inactive AOSD. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess whether HBP could be used to differentiate active from inactive AOSD; this was 0.811 with sensitivity 0.650, specificity 0.811, and cutoff HBP value of 35.59 ng/ml. The area under the ROC curve for HBP as a biomarker to differentiate AOSD from sepsis was 0.653, with sensitivity 0.759, and specificity 0.552, and cutoff HBP value of 65.1 ng/ml. Taken together, the results of our study suggest that serum HBP could be a useful diagnostic biomarker to evaluate disease activity in patients with AOSD, and to differentiate AOSD from sepsis.","Tian, Rui; Chen, Xia; Yang, Chengde; Teng, Jialin; Qu, Hongping; Liu, Hong-Lei",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33868298/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.654811,57

A critical examination of the Corona crisis uncovers that in order to understand and explain the unpreparedness of the health systems, we need a new conceptual framework. This helps us to look at this phenomenon in a new way, address new problems, and come up with creative solutions. Our proposal is that “health lag” is a concept that could help frame and explain this unpreparedness and unreadiness. The term “health lag” refers to the failure of health systems to keep up with clinical medicine. In other words, health issues in most situations fall behind clinical medicine, leading to social, cultural, and economic problems. In the first step to define health lag, we have to explain the distinction between clinical medicine and health and address the role of individual health, public health, and epidemic in this dichotomy. Thereafter, the reasons behind health lag will be analyzed in three levels: theoretical, practical, and institutional. In the third step, we will point out the most important consequences of health lag: the medicalization of health, the inconsistency of biopolitics, inadequate ethical frameworks, and public sphere vulnerabilities.

This entails a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the viral genomes of interest for preferred nucleotides, codon bias, nucleotide changes at the 3(rd) position (NT3s), synonymous codon usage and relative synonymous codon usage. In this study, the variations in the N proteins among 13 different coronaviruses (CoVs) were analysed at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in an attempt to reveal how these viruses adapt to their hosts relative to their preferred codon usage in the N genes. The results revealed that, overall, eighteen amino acids had different preferred codons and eight of these were over-biased. The N genes had a higher AT% over GC% and the values of their effective number of codons ranged from 40.43 to 53.85, indicating a slight codon bias. Neutrality plots and correlation analyses showed a very high level of GC3s/GC correlation in porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV (pedCoV), followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS CoV), porcine delta CoV (dCoV), bat CoV (bCoV) and feline CoV (fCoV) with r values 0.81, 0.68, -0.47, 0.98 and 0.58, respectively. These data implied a high rate of evolution of the CoV genomes and a strong influence of mutation on evolutionary selection in the CoV N genes. This type of genetic analysis would be useful for evaluating a virus’s host adaptation, evolution and is thus of value to vaccine design strategies.","Sheikh, Abdullah; Al-Taher, Abdulla; Al-Nazawi, Mohammed; Al-Mubarak, Abdullah I.; Kandeel, Mahmoud",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418305809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31911390/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418305809; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113806,57

Unprecedented hardship due to ongoing fears of exposure and threats to personal safety, along with societal measures enacted to curb disease transmission, have had broad psychosocial impact on patients and healthcare workers alike. These changes can significantly affect diagnosing and managing behavioral emergencies such as agitation in the emergency department. On behalf of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry, we highlight unique considerations for patients with severe behavioral symptoms and staff members managing symptoms of agitation during COVID-19. Early detection and treatment of agitation, precautions to minimize staff hazards, coordination with security personnel and psychiatric services, and avoidance of coercive strategies that cause respiratory depression will help mitigate heightened risks to safety caused by this outbreak.","Wong, Ambrose H.; Roppolo, Lynn P.; Chang, Bernard P.; Yonkers, Kimberly A.; Wilson, Michael P.; Powsner, Seth; Rozel, John S.",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.5.47789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726244/,57

We investigated the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia based on the timing of dexamethasone administration. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study based on medical record reviews was conducted between June 10 and September 21, 2020. We compared the risk of severe COVID-19, defined as the use of a high-flow nasal cannula or a mechanical ventilator, between groups that received dexamethasone either within 24 hours of hypoxemia (early dexamethasone group) or 24 hours after hypoxemia (late dexamethasone group). Hypoxemia was defined as room-air SpO(2) <90%. RESULTS: Among 59 patients treated with dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia, 30 were in the early dexamethasone group and 29 were in the late dexamethasone group. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis or hospitalization, or the use of antiviral or antibacterial agents between the two groups. The early dexamethasone group showed a significantly lower rate of severe COVID-19 compared to the control group (75.9% vs. 40.0%, p=0.012). Further, the early dexamethasone group showed a significantly shorter total duration of oxygen supplementation (10.45 days vs. 21.61 days, p=0.003) and length of stay in the hospital (19.76 days vs. 27.21 days, p=0.013). However, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and in-hospital mortality rates were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Early administration of dexamethasone may prevent the progression of COVID-19 to a severe disease, without increased mortality.","Lee, Hyun Woo; Park, Jimyung; Lee, Jung-Kyu; Park, Tae Yeon; Heo, Eun Young",Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078038/; https://doi.org/10.4046/trd.2021.0009,57
596312,High prevalence and genetic diversity of hepatitis B viruses in insectivorous bats from China,2019-08-07,"Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential cell function. To safeguard this process in the face of environmental threats and internal stressors, cells mount an evolutionarily conserved response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Invading pathogens induce cellular stress that impacts protein folding, thus the UPR is well situated to sense danger and contribute to immune responses. Cytokines (inflammatory cytokines and interferons) critically mediate host defense against pathogens, but when aberrantly produced, may also drive pathologic inflammation. The UPR influences cytokine production on multiple levels, from stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, to modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways, and the regulation of cytokine transcription factors. This review will focus on the mechanisms underlying cytokine regulation by the UPR, and the repercussions of this relationship for infection and autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases. Interrogation of viral and bacterial infections has revealed increasing numbers of examples where pathogens induce or modulate the UPR and implicated UPR-modulated cytokines in host response. The flip side of this coin, the UPR/ER stress responses have been increasingly recognized in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Examples include monogenic disorders of ER function, diseases linked to misfolding protein (HLA-B27 and spondyloarthritis), diseases directly implicating UPR and autophagy genes (inflammatory bowel disease), and autoimmune diseases targeting highly secretory cells (e.g., diabetes). Given the burgeoning interest in pharmacologically targeting the UPR, greater discernment is needed regarding how the UPR regulates cytokine production during specific infections and autoimmune processes, and the relative place of this interaction in pathogenesis.","Smith, Judith A.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556237/,57

597170,Identification of nucleic acid aptamers against lactate dehydrogenase via SELEX and high-throughput sequencing,2021-05-24,"BACKGROUND: Persistent infection of the Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) has been reported in clinical cases, experimental animals, and various cell culture systems. We previously reported the establishment of spontaneous JEV persistent infection, assisted by defective interfering particle accumulation and/or attenuated helper viruses, in BHK-21 cells devoid of virus-induced apoptosis, cBS6-2 and cBS6-3. However, cell-specific factors may play important roles in controlling JEV replication and have never been assessed for this specific phenomenon. Recent evidence suggests that viruses have evolved various mechanisms to cope with endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways for their efficient amplification and transmission, including the unfolded protein response (UPR). RESULTS: To identify the host cell factors that affect JEV persistence, we investigated the expression of essential UPR factors in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells. Of the selected UPR factors tested, the most noticeable deviations from those of the normal BHK-21 cells with JEV acute infection were as follows: the suppression of C/EBP homologous binding protein (CHOP) and the constant up-regulation of immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP) expression in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells. In JEV acute infection on normal BHK-21 cells, silencing CHOP expression through specific siRNA blocked cell death almost completely. Meanwhile, depletion of BiP by specific siRNA unlocked CHOP expression in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells, resulting in massive cell death. Fulminant apoptotic cell death for both cell clones on tunicamycin treatment revealed that the JEV persistently infected cells still contained functional arms for cell fate decisions. CONCLUSIONS: BHK-21 cells with JEV persistent infection strive against virus-induced apoptosis through constant up-regulation of BiP expression, resulting in the complete depletion of CHOP even with apparent virus amplification in the cells. Accordingly, the attenuation of virus replication as well as the modifications to cell metabolism could be additional factors contributing to the development of JEV persistent infection in mammalian cells.

597541,Antiviral activity of a Bacillus sp. P34 peptide against pathogenic viruses of domestic animals,2014-10-09,"The present spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, provoking COVID–19 disease, progresses rapidly worldwide. In current absence of a curative treatment and an effective, safe vaccine, there is a pressing need to focus on identifying and correcting deficits in immune function in order to reduce risk of severe progress of the disease and to lower the number of infections and fatalities. This paper evaluates the most recent literature on zinc status related to antiviral immunity and its possible role in COVID–19. It is concluded that zinc is a critical factor for antiviral immunity. There is ample evidence suggesting that zinc depletion, also prevalent in high–income nations, compromises immune functions. Notably, major risk groups for COVID–19, the elderly, men more than women, obese individuals and patients with diabetes are all at risk of zinc deficiency. Moreover, various widely used antihypertensive drugs and statin therapy have been reported to negatively influence zinc status. As zinc depletion impairs antiviral immunity, it is hypothesised to increase susceptibility for COVID–19. Therefore, dietary preventive measures and prompt implementation of zinc supplementation for risk groups should be considered. Large–scale studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of micronutrients and antiviral immunity, in particular drug–micronutrient immunity interaction.","Mossink, J P",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33235974/,57

It is evident that adopting innovative technologies such as blockchain can help in effective planning operations and resource deployments. Blockchain technology can play an important role in the healthcare sector, such as improved clinical trial data management by reducing delays in regulatory approvals, and streamline the communication between diverse stakeholders of the supply chain, etc. Moreover, the spread of misinformation has intensely increased during the outbreak, and existing platforms lack the ability to validate the authenticity of data, leading to public panic and irrational behavior. Thus, developing a blockchain-based tracking system is important to ensure that the information received by the public and government agencies is reliable and trustworthy. In this paper, we review various blockchain applications and opportunities in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and develop a tracking system for the COVID-19 data collected from various external sources. We propose, implement, and evaluate a blockchain-based system using Ethereum smart contracts and oracles to track reported data related to the number of new cases, deaths, and recovered cases obtained from trusted sources.

This study describes the extent, variation, and fluctuation of Canadian adult intensive care unit (ICU) visitation policies before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an environmental scan of Canadian hospital visitation policies throughout the first wave of the pandemic. We conducted a two-phased study analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: We collected 257 documents with reference to visitation policies (preCOVID, 101 [39%]; midCOVID, 71 [28%]; and lateCOVID, 85 [33%]). Of these 257 documents, 38 (15%) were ICU-specific and 70 (27%) referenced the ICU. Most policies during the midCOVID/lateCOVID pandemic period allowed no visitors with specific exceptions (e.g., end-of-life). Framework analysis revealed five overarching themes: 1) reasons for restricted visitation policies; 2) visitation policies and expectations; 3) exceptions to visitation policy; 4) patient and family-centred care; and 5) communication and transparency. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, most Canadian hospitals had public-facing visitor restriction policies with specific exception categories, most commonly for patients at end-of-life, patients requiring assistance, or COVID-19 positive patients (varying from not allowed to case-by-case). Further studies are needed to understand the consistency with which visitation policies were operationalized and how they may have impacted patient- and family-centred care.

Detailed evaluation of several compartments (airways, alveolar walls, airspaces, and vasculature) was performed to determine the range of histologic features. The cohort consisted of 47 males and 21 females with a median age of 73 years (range 30–96). Co-morbidities were present in most patients with 60% reporting at least three conditions. Tracheobronchitis was frequently present, independent from intubation or superimposed pneumonia. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was seen in 87% of cases. Later phases of DAD were less frequent and correlated with longer duration of disease. Large vessel thrombi were seen in 42% of cases but platelet (CD61 positive) and/or fibrin microthrombi were present at least focally in 84%. Ultrastructurally, small vessels showed basal membrane reduplication and significant endothelial swelling with cytoplasmic vacuolization. In a subset of cases, virus was detected using different tools (immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein, RNA in situ hybridization, lung viral culture, and electron microscopy). Virus was seen in airway epithelium and type 2 pneumocytes. IHC or in situ detection, as well as viable form (lung culture positive) was associated with the presence of hyaline membranes, usually within 2 weeks but up to 4 weeks after initial diagnosis. COVID-19 pneumonia is a heterogeneous disease (tracheobronchitis, DAD, and vascular injury), but with consistent features in three centers. The pulmonary vasculature, with capillary microthrombi and inflammation, as well as macrothrombi, is commonly involved. Viral infection in areas of ongoing active injury contributes to persistent and temporally heterogeneous lung damage.","Borczuk, Alain C.; Salvatore, Steven P.; Seshan, Surya V.; Patel, Sanjay S.; Bussel, James B.; Mostyka, Maria; Elsoukkary, Sarah; He, Bing; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Fortarezza, Francesco; Pezzuto, Federica; Navalesi, Paolo; Crisanti, Andrea; Fowkes, Mary E.; Bryce, Clare H.; Calabrese, Fiorella; Beasley, Mary Beth",Mod Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-020-00661-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879413/,57

As RT-PCR is not widely available and is time-consuming, it limits decision making on removal from and return to work of possibly contagious HCW. Aim In this study we evaluated the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag rapid test (PanbioCAgRT) in 825 hospital HCW. Methods and findings: This study consisted of two phases. In the validation phase, we tested hospital HCW with mild symptoms (three days or less) in parallel using the PanbioCAgRT and the RT-qPCR test. The PanbioCAgRT demonstrated 86.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV and 98.5% NPV with regard to RT-qPCR. For HCW with PanbioCAgRT-/RT-qPCR+, the median Ct value was 30.9, whereas for the HCW with PanbioCAgRT+/RT-qPCR+ the median Ct value was 19.3 (p<0.001). In the second phase, we implemented an on-site antigen test-based strategy for symptomatic hospital HCW: HCW that tested positive with the PanbioCAgRT on-site were considered SARS-CoV-2 positive and were sent home. HCW that tested negative with the PanbioCAgRT on-site were allowed to work with PPE pending RT-qPCR test results from the laboratory. Sensitivity of the antigen test-based strategy was 72.5% and NPV was 97%. For HCW with PanbioCAgRT-/RT-qPCR+ median Ct values were 27.8. Conclusion The PanbioCAgRTt validated in this study showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples obtained from HCW with high viral loads. The antigen-based testing strategy proposed in this study seems to be effective, safe and easy to implement in a wide range of occupational healthcare settings.","Kolwijck, E.; Brouwers-Boers, M.; Broertjes, J.; van Heeswijk, K.; Runderkamp, N.; Meijer, A.; Hermans, M.H.A.; Leenders, S.

The SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that rapidly spread worldwide and during this process acquired mutations. This study was carried out to identify mutations in RdRp as the SARS-CoV-2 spread in India. We compared the 668 RdRp sequences reported from India with the first reported RdRp sequence from Wuhan, China. Our data revealed that RdRp have acquired sixty mutations among Indian isolates. Our protein modelling study also revealed that several mutants including D833Y, A699S, Y149C and C464F can potentially alter stability and flexibility of RdRp. We also predicted the potential B cell epitopes contributed by RdRp and identified thirty-six linear continuous and twenty-five discontinuous epitopes. Among sixty RdRp mutants identified in this study, 40% of them localises in the B cell epitopes region. Altogether, this study highlights the need to identify and characterize the variations in RdRp to understand the impact of these mutations on SARS-CoV-2.","Kumar, Sushant; Azad, Gajendra Kumar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.04.442686,57

Patients and Methods Age-adjusted race-stratified prevalence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity), preexisting medical conditions (pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, malignancy), poor health behaviors (smoking, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity), and adverse socioeconomic factors (education, household income, health insurance) was computed in 435,139 American adult participants from 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (BRFSS). Correlation was assessed between health determinants and the race-stratified COVID-19 crude mortality and infection-fatality-ratio computed from respective state public health departments in 47 states. Results Blacks had a higher prevalence of comorbidities (63.3% [95%CI:62.4-64.2%] vs. 55.1% [95%CI:54.7-55.5]) and adverse socioeconomic factors (47.0% [95%CI:46.0-47.9%] vs. 30.9% [95%CI:30.6-31.3]) than Whites. The prevalence of preexisting medical conditions was similar among Blacks (30.4% [95%CI:28.8-32.1%]) and Whites (30.8% [95%CI:30.2-31.4%]). The prevalence of poor health behaviors was higher in Whites (57.2% [95%CI:56.3-58.0%]) than Blacks (50.2% [95%CI:46.2-54.2%]). The comorbidities and adverse socioeconomic factors were highest in the Southern region, and poor health behaviors were highest in the Western region. Cumulative incidence rate (per 100,000 persons) was three-fold higher in Blacks (1546.4) compared withwith Whites (540.4). The crude mortality (per 100,000 persons) was two-fold higher in Blacks (83.2) than Whites (33.2). However, the infection-fatality-ratio (per 100-cases) was similar between Whites (6.2) and Blacks (5.4). Within racial groups, the geographic distribution of health determinants did not correlate with state-level COVID-19 mortality and infection-fatality ratio (p>0.05 for all). Conclusions Racial disparities in COVID-19 are largely driven by the higher cumulative incidence of infection in Blacks. There is a discordance between the geographic dispersion of COVID-19 mortality and the regional distribution of health determinants.","Parcha, Vibhu; Malla, Gargya; Suri, Sarabjeet S.; Kalra, Rajat; Heindl, Brittain; Berra, Lorenzo; Fouad, Mona N.; Arora, Garima; Arora, Pankaj",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542454820301880?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542454820301880; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2020.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043273/,57

This information is usually text-based and rarely machine-readable, thus creating challenges for outbreak researchers. Here, we introduce a generalizable data assembly algorithm that automatically curates text-based, outbreak-related information and demonstrate its performance across three outbreaks. Methods: After developing an algorithm with regular expressions, we automatically curated data from health agencies via three information sources: formal reports, email newsletters, and Twitter. A validation data set was also curated manually for each outbreak. Findings: When compared against the validation data sets, the overall cumulative missingness and misidentification of the algorithmically curated data were [≤]2% and [≤]1%, respectively, for all three outbreaks. Conclusions: Within the context of outbreak research, our work successfully addresses the need for generalizable tools that can transform text-based information into machine-readable data across varied information sources and infectious diseases.","Majumder, M.

This study aimed at describing the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection, clinical aspects of the disease and the determinants of survival. METHODS: The medical records of Prince Mohamed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital were reviewed between April 2014 and December 2015 to identify admission and discharge with MERS-CoV. Patient’s characteristics, epidemiologic and clinical data and laboratory results were extracted and described. Logistic regression analyses were used to model the determinants of the survival of these patients. Significance of the results were judged at the 5% level. RESULTS: 249 confirmed cases were admitted mostly in August (20.48%) and September (14.86%) of the year 2015. A third (39.36%) reported contact with an index case, developed the disease after 6.2 days and continued to shed the virus for 13.17 days on average. The case fatality rate was 20.08%. Independent predictors of being discharged alive among confirmed cases were younger age (OR(A) = 0.953), breathing ambient air (OR(A) = 8.981), not being transferred to the ICU (OR(A) = 24.240) and not receiving renal replacement therapy (OR(A) = 8.342). These variables explain 63.9% of the variability of patients’ status at discharge. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV spread from human-to-human as community acquired and nosocomial infection.

This study aims to critically examine the media portrayal of older persons’ everyday information and communication technology (EICT) usage during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 51 articles published in three leading German newspapers between March 2020 and November 2020 were identified from the LexisNexis academic database. Data were analyzed employing critical discourse and thematic analysis. RESULTS: EICT use was associated with youthful, consumption-orientated, and active lifestyles, while non-use was constructed as failures on the policy or individual level. The pandemic seemed to have acted as an amplifier, further exacerbating and perpetuating stereotypical, dichotomous, but also empowering aging images. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Neo-liberal rational and binary distinctions of active users and non-users opened and encouraged critical discussions on positive aging trends, the concept of the third and fourth age, and aging-and-innovation discourses. Moreover, the crucial educative role of the media in raising awareness about power imbalances and reducing EICT-related ageism is stressed.","Köttl, Hanna; Tatzer, Verena C; Ayalon, Liat",Gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnab126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34436557/,57

The pharmaceutical supply chain involves some level of commingling of a collection of stakeholders such as distributors, manufacturers, wholesalers, and customers. The biggest challenge associated with this supply chain is temperature monitoring as well as counterfeit drug prevention. Many drugs and vaccines remain viable within a specific range of temperatures. If exposed beyond this temperature range, the medicine no longer works as intended. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor-based blockchain framework is proposed that tracks and traces drugs as they pass slowly through the entire supply chain. On the one hand, these new technologies of blockchain and IoT sensors play an essential role in supply chain management. On the other hand, they also pose new challenges of security for resource-constrained IoT devices and blockchain scalability issues to handle this IoT sensor-based information. In this paper, our primary focus is on improving classic blockchain systems to make it suitable for IoT based supply chain management, and as a secondary focus, applying these new promising technologies to enable a viable smart healthcare ecosystem through a drug supply chain.","Singh, Rajani; Dwivedi, Ashutosh Dhar; Srivastava, Gautam",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20143951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32708588/,57

A key function of Nef is to remove the CD4 receptor from the cell surface by hijacking clathrin- and AP2-dependent endocytosis. However, exactly how Nef does this has been elusive. Here, we describe the underlying mechanism as revealed by a 3.0Å crystal structure of a fusion protein comprised of Nef and the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 bound to the tetrameric AP2 complex. An intricate combination of conformational changes occurs in both Nef and AP2 to enable CD4 binding and downregulation. A pocket on Nef previously identified as crucial for recruiting class I MHC is also responsible for recruiting CD4, revealing a potential approach to inhibit two of Nef’s activities and sensitize the virus to immune clearance.","Kwon, Yonghwa; Kaake, Robyn M.; Echeverria, Ignacia; Suarez, Marissa; Shamsabadi, Mohammad Karimian; Stoneham, Charlotte; Ramirez, Peter W.; Kress, Jacob; Singh, Rajendra; Sali, Andrej; Krogan, Nevan; Guatelli, John; Jia, Xiaofei",Nat Struct Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719457/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-020-0463-z,57

Artificial modification of CpG frequency is a valid approach for live attenuated vaccine development, and if this is to be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we must first understand the role CpG motifs play in regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication. Accordingly, the CpG composition of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 genome was characterised in the context of other coronaviruses. CpG suppression amongst coronaviruses does not significantly differ according to genera of virus, but does vary according to host species and primary replication site (a proxy for tissue tropism), supporting the hypothesis that viral CpG content may influence cross-species transmission. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits overall strong CpG suppression, this varies considerably across the genome, and the Envelope (E) open reading frame (ORF) and ORF10 demonstrate an absence of CpG suppression. While ORF10 is only present in the genomes of a subset of coronaviruses, E is essential for virus replication. Across the Coronaviridae, E genes display remarkably high variation in CpG composition, with those of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having much higher CpG content than other coronaviruses isolated from humans. Phylogeny indicates that this is an ancestrally-derived trait reflecting their origin in bats, rather than something selected for after zoonotic transfer. Conservation of CpG motifs in these regions suggests that they have a functionality which over-rides the need to suppress CpG; an observation relevant to future strategies towards a rationally attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","Digard, Paul; Lee, Hui Min; Sharp, Colin; Grey, Finn; Gaunt, Eleanor",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.083816,57

Barriers have included medicolegal issues surrounding provider reimbursement, interstate licensure, and malpractice liability as well as technological challenges. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited typical evaluation of patients with neurological issues and resulted in a surge in demand for virtual medical visits. Meanwhile, federal and state governments took action to facilitate the rapid implementation of telehealth programs, placing a temporary lift on medicolegal barriers that had previously limited its expansion. This created a unique opportunity for widespread telehealth use to meet the surge in demand for remote medical care. After initial hurdles and challenges, our experience with telemedicine in neurosurgery at Penn Medicine has been overall positive from both the provider and the patients’ perspective. One of the unique challenges we face is guiding patients to appropriately set up devices in a way that enables an effective neuro exam. However, we argue that an accurate and comprehensive neurologic exam can be conducted through a telemedicine platform, despite minor weaknesses inherent to absence of physical presence. Additionally, certain neurosurgical visits such as post-operative checks, vascular pathology, and brain tumors inherently lend themselves to easier evaluation through telehealth visits. In the era of COVID-19 and beyond, telemedicine remains a promising and effective approach to continue neurologic patient care.","Blue, Rachel; Yang, Andrew I.; Zhou, Cecilia; De Ravin, Emma; Teng, Clare W.; Arguelles, Gabriel R.; Huang, Vincent; Wathen, Connor; Miranda, Stephen P.; Marcotte, Paul; Malhotra, Neil R.; Welch, William C.; Lee, John YK.",World Neurosurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426065/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020310378; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.066; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020310378?v=s5,57

Sequence analysis predicts that DpTV replicase contains a putative helicase domain (Hel). However, the helicase activity in alphatetraviruses has never been formally determined. In this study, we determined that DpTV Hel is a functional RNA helicase belonging to superfamily-1 helicase with 5′–3′ dsRNA unwinding directionality. Further characterization determined the length requirement of the 5′ single-stranded tail on the RNA template and the optimal reaction conditions for the unwinding activity of DpTV Hel. Moreover, DpTV Hel also contains NTPase activity. The ATPase activity of DpTV Hel could be significantly stimulated by dsRNA, and dsRNA could partially rescue the ATPase activity abolishment caused by mutations. Our study is the first to identify an alphatetravirus RNA helicase and further characterize its dsRNA unwinding and NTPase activities in detail and should foster our understanding of DpTV and other alphatetraviruses.","Wang, Qinrong; Han, Yajuan; Qiu, Yang; Zhang, Shaoqiong; Tang, Fenfen; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Jiamin; Hu, Yuanyang; Zhou, Xi",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22995190/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682212004266; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2012.08.045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682212004266,57

607482,Comparison of broad-spectrum antiviral activities of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (−) and the eIF4A-inhibitor Silvestrol,2020-01-10,"We report here structural morphology and nonlinear behavior of pure and co-doped Zn(0.90-x)Fe(0.1)M(x)O with (M = Cu, Ni and (x = 0.00, 0.10) and (0.00 ≤ y ≤ 0.20)) at different sintering temperatures (T(s) = 850 and 1000 °C). It is found that the co-doping of ZnO by (Fe + Cu) or (Fe + Ni) up to 0.30 does not deform the well-known wurtzite structure of ZnO, as well as pure and 0.1 of Fe-doped ZnO. The SEM micrographs did not show any secondary phases at the boundaries of grains as compared to ZnO, the average grain size is decreased for Fe and (Fe + Cu) samples, while it is increased for (Fe + Ni) samples. The nonlinear coefficient α and breakdown field E(B) are generally increased by 0.1 of Fe addition, but they are shifted to lower values as T(s) increases for all samples. Furthermore, they are gradually increased/decreased to higher/lower values for (Fe + Cu/Fe + Ni) samples up to 0.30 of co-doping content. The values of α and E(B) are increased from 30.06, 2115.38 V/cm for ZnO at 850 °C to 50.07, 5012 V/cm by (0.1Fe + 0.2Cu) co-doping, and from 23.53, 1956.52 V/cm to 45.58, 4750 V/cm at 1000 °C, while they are, respectively, decreased by (0.1Fe + 0.2Ni) to 13.19, 312 V/cm and 11.85, 172.42 V/cm. Similar behavior was generally obtained for nonlinear conductivity σ(L) and height of potential barrier φ(B), whereas the vice is versa for the behavior of leakage current J(k) and residual voltage K(r). Our results are discussed in terms of the comparative participation between the effects of co-doping of (Fe + Cu) and (Fe + Ni) to ZnO for supporting the potential barrier as compared to individual doping by Fe, Cu and Ni. This study perhaps recommended these samples for optoelectronic and ferromagnetic investigation after COVID-19 is over.","Al-Naim, Abdullah F.; Afify, N.; Sedky, A.; Ibrahim, S.

607636,Antivirals with common targets against highly pathogenic viruses.,2021-03-18,"Organoids are in vitro miniaturized and simplified model systems of organs that have gained enormous interest for modelling tissue development and disease, and for personalized medicine, drug screening and cell therapy. Despite considerable success in culturing physiologically relevant organoids, challenges remain to achieve real-life applications. In particular, the high variability of self-organizing growth and restricted experimental and analytical access hamper the translatability of organoid systems. In this Review, we argue that many limitations of traditional organoid culture can be addressed by engineering approaches at all levels of organoid systems. We investigate cell surface and genetic engineering approaches, and discuss stem cell niche engineering based on the design of matrices that allow spatiotemporal control of organoid growth and shape-guided morphogenesis. We examine how microfluidic approaches and lessons learnt from organs-on-a-chip enable the integration of mechano-physiological parameters and increase accessibility of organoids to improve functional readouts. Applying engineering principles to organoids increases reproducibility and provides experimental control, which will, ultimately, be required to enable clinical translation.","Hofer, Moritz; Lutolf, Matthias P.",Nat Rev Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623712/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41578-021-00279-y,57

Certains biomédicaments (BM) sont en cours d’évaluation dans des essais thérapeutiques avec pour rationnel cet orage cytokinique. À l’inverse, nous pouvons nous interroger sur le risque d’infection à SARS-CoV-2 chez les patients au long cours sous BM. L’objectif principal de notre étude était de déterminer l’impact de la prise d’un biomédicament sur le taux d’hospitalisation, de passage en réanimation (ICU) et de décès chez les patients sous BM atteints d’une infection à SARS-CoV-2. Matériel et méthodes Étude de cohorte rétrospective multicentrique à partir des données médico-administratives de l’Entrepôt de Données de Santé (EDS) de l’APHP. L’ensemble des patients recevant un BM (anti-TNF, anti-IL-12/23, anti-IL-17 ou anti-intégrine) était inclus. Les événements d’intérêt étaient la survenue d’une hospitalisation, d’un séjour en ICU ou d’un décès dans le cadre d’une infection à SARS-CoV-2 (confirmée par RT-PCR ou TDM thoracique) entre le 01/02 et le 22/04/20. Le risque d’hospitalisation/ICU/décès était évalué selon la méthodologie du Ratio de Morbidité/Mortalité Standardisé (SMR) en calculant le rapport entre le nombre observé et le nombre attendu. Le nombre attendu d’hospitalisation/ICU/décès était calculé en appliquant le taux d’hospitalisation/ICU/décès à SARS-CoV-2 de la population d’Ile-de-France (par tranche âge de 20 ans et sexe) au nombre de personnes sous BM dans la sous-classe correspondante de la même source de données (données EDS de l’AP–HP). Résultats Un total de 7 808 patients (âge médian 45 ans, 51 % de femmes) étaient inclus, dont 48 avec un diagnostic d’infection à SARS-CoV-2, 19 (40 %) hospitalisés, 4 (8 %) en ICU et 1 décès. En comparaison avec la population d’Ile-de-France, les taux d’hospitalisation et d’ICU étaient significativement élevés chez les patients sous BM avec SR=2,19, 95 %CI 1,32–3,42, p <0,001 et SR=6,04, 95 %CI 1,62–15,45, p <0,001 respectivement, significativement observés chez les [20–40]. Cependant, une analyse post-hoc suggérait que les SR d’hospitalisation et d’ICU étaient surestimés, un retour aux comptes rendus mettant en évidence une poussée de la pathologie sous-jacente comme principal motif d’hospitalisation chez les [20-40[et non une infection à SARS-CoV-2 nécessitant une hospitalisation ou un passage en ICU.

In this paper, we present the case study of Chemnitz University of Technology (Germany), where digital classes were introduced in a matter of weeks. By analyzing syllabus data, we found that the use of video and video conferencing is an important current development. Related to these findings, we present evidence from instructional psychology and social media research that can help in the design of teaching during this crisis. We highlight the need for multimodal learning, i.e., learning settings that use multiple sensory modalities. Importantly, we present a strategy of hybrid campuses for this and potential future emergencies. This approach describes how the social distancing measures currently in effect can be used to re‐think higher education based on a reasonable use of technology.

METHODS: : The study was performed in the context of the mandatory health surveillance at the workplaces, in the period between 25th January 2021 and 26th March 2021, when 6904 HCWs (78% of workforce) gained full protection. HCWs were classified by having received the full vaccine schedule or not. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by conventional RT-PCR on rhino-pharyngeal swabs, followed by gene sequencing in positive vaccinated HCWs. RESULTS: : We observed 84 SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs, most among unvaccinated HCWs. Gene sequencing was successful in 5 cases only, 4 B.1.1.7 and 1 B1.525 variants. In the same period, Lombardy registered 192.829 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 40.029 of which in Brescia county. The incidence rate of the B.1.1.7 variant rose from 70% to 97%. CONCLUSIONS: : Results confirm the protective effects of BNT162b2. The vaccine campaign was effective not only in reducing the appearance of symptoms but also in decreasing the incidence of infections among vaccinated HCWs.

608900,Development and clinical evaluation of a rapid diagnostic kit for feline leukemia virus infection,2014-03-19,"Pereboom and Caruso propose the quarantine model as an alternative to existing models of criminal justice. They appeal to the established public health practice of quarantining people, which is believed to be effective and morally justified, to explain why -in criminal justice- it is also morally acceptable to detain wrongdoers, without assuming the existence of a retrospective moral responsibility. Wrongdoers in their model are treated as carriers of dangerous diseases and as such should be preventively detained (or rehabilitated) until they no longer pose a threat to society. Our main concern in this paper is that Pereboom and Caruso adopt an idiosyncratic meaning of quarantine regulations. We highlight a set of important disanalogies between their quarantine model and the quarantine regulations currently adopted in public health policies. More specifically, we argue that the similarities that Pereboom and Caruso propose to substantiate their analogy are not consistent—despite what they claim—with the regulations underlying quarantine as an epidemiological process. We also notice that certain quarantine procedures adopted in public health systems are inadequate to deal with criminal behaviors. On these grounds, we conclude that Pereboom and Caruso should not appeal to the quarantine analogy to substantiate their view, unless they address the issues and criticism we raise in this paper.","Levin, Sergei; Farina, Mirko; Lavazza, Andrea",Crim Law Philos,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11572-021-09608-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567281/,57

While a definite diagnosis is based on microbiological evidence, the relationship between lung ultrasound (LU) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 is less clear. Lung ultrasound is a point-of-care imaging tool that proved to be useful in the identification and severity assessment of different pulmonary conditions, particularly in the setting of emergency and critical care patients in intensive care units; HRCT of the thorax is regarded as the mainstay of imaging evaluation of lung disorders, enabling characterization and quantification of pulmonary involvement.

Simultaneously, research shows that contact with nature can improve various facets of well-being, including physical, social, and mental well-being. However, nature is not always accessible for older adults due to mobility restrictions and related care needs that come with age. A promising strategy aims at bringing nature inside through pervasive technologies. However, so far, there is little academic understanding of essential nature characteristics, psychological processes involved, and means for implementation in practice. The current study used a three-folded rapid review to assess current understanding and strategies used for improving well-being for older adults through virtual reality representations of nature. Searches were performed across three databases, followed-up by content-based evaluation of abstracts. In total, a set of 25 relevant articles was identified. Only three studies specifically focus on digital nature as an intervention strategy for improving well-being amongst older adults. Although these studies provide useful starting points for the design and (technological) development of such environments, they do not generate understanding of how specific characteristics of virtual nature representations impact social well-being measures in particular, and of the underlying psychological processes involved. We conclude that follow-up research is warranted to close the gap between insights and findings from nature research, gerontology, health research, and human-technology interaction.","Van Houwelingen-Snippe, Josca; Ben Allouch, Somaya; Van Rompay, Thomas J.

The MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PL(pro)) is a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. To facilitate these efforts, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme by X-ray crystallography. The molecule consists of a ubiquitin-like domain and a catalytic core domain. The catalytic domain displays an extended right-hand fold with a zinc ribbon and embraces a solvent-exposed substrate-binding region. The overall structure of the MERS-CoV PL(pro) is similar to that of the corresponding SARS-CoV enzyme, but the architecture of the oxyanion hole and of the S3 as well as the S5 specificity sites differ from the latter. These differences are the likely reason for reduced in vitro peptide hydrolysis and deubiquitinating activities of the MERS-CoV PL(pro), compared to the homologous enzyme from the SARS coronavirus. Introduction of a side-chain capable of oxyanion stabilization through the Leu106Trp mutation greatly enhances the in vitro catalytic activity of the MERS-CoV PL(pro). The unique features observed in the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV PL(pro) should allow the design of antivirals that would not interfere with host ubiquitin-specific proteases.","Lei, Jian; Mesters, Jeroen R.; Drosten, Christian; Anemüller, Stefan; Ma, Qingjun; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992731/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.06.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214001739; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214001739,57

A rapid, specific and sensitive detection method is always needed to control the influenza in its early stages by timely intervention of therapy and early clinical management. OBJECTIVES: To develop RT-LAMP assays for detection of influenza A viruses, their further subtyping into seasonal (H1N1, H3N2) and novel pandemic H1N1 viruses and to evaluate clinical applicability of optimized RT-LAMP assays on patients’ samples. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we optimized RT-LAMP assay to detect IAVs by using primers against matrix gene and subtyping of IAVs was done by using primers against hemagglutinin gene. Optimized RT-LAMP assays were applied on clinical samples from patients having influenza like illness and results were compared with conventional one-step RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: RT-LAMP assays successfully detected and differentiated IAVs into H1N1, H3N2 and pdm09/H1N1 subtypes. One hundred and sixty seven clinical swab samples from influenza suspected patients were taken and tested with RT-LAMP assay, detecting 30 (17.9%) samples positive for Influenza A virus. Out of 30 samples, 21, 7 and 2 were found positive for pdm09/H1N1, H3N2 and seasonal H1 respectively. Conventional one-step RT-PCR detected a total of 27 (16.2%) samples for influenza A and further subtyping showed 20 and 7 samples positive for pdm09/H1N1 and H3N2 virus respectively whereas none was found positive for seasonal H1N1. RT-LAMP assay demonstrated higher sensitivity (93.8%) than conventional RT-PCR (84.4%) for influenza A viruses detection in clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: RT-LAMP assay is rapid, sensitive, specific and cost effective method for detection of influenza A viruses than conventional one-step RT-PCR and it can serve as a good alternate for diagnosis and surveillance studies during influenza outbreaks in resource-limited setups of developing countries.","Sharma, Vikrant; Chaudhry, Dhruva; Kaushik, Samander",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.12.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093417304111; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093417304111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253497/,57

METHODS: Adult allogeneic HSCT recipients vaccinated with two doses of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine, separated by 3 weeks, and patients with proven influenza A/H1N1pdm09 infection were included. Antibody responses were measured by hemagglutination-inhibition assay 1) on days 0, 21, 42 and 6 months after the first vaccine injection in vaccinated patients and 2) before pandemic and after influenza A/H1N1pdm09 infection, in patients presented natural infection. RESULTS: At baseline, 3% of 59 recipients of adjuvanted vaccine and 0% of 20 infected patients were seroprotected (antibody titer ≥ 1/40). Seroprotection rate observed 42 days after vaccination was not different from that observed after natural infection (66% and 60% respectively, p = 0.78). In vaccinated patients, seroprotection rate increased significantly from 54% to 66% between day 21 and 42 (p = 0.015). Moreover, after 6 months, seroprotection rate in 21 vaccinated patients was similar to that observed in 10 infected patients evaluated at least 76 days after infection (D76–217) (60% and 81% respectively, p = 0.2). In multivariate analysis, no immunosuppressive treatment or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and longer time between transplantation and vaccination/infection were associated with a stronger humoral response. The adjuvanted vaccine was safe with low rate of GVHD worsening. CONCLUSION: In HSCT recipients, two doses of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 adjuvanted vaccine were safe and induced a humoral response comparable to that triggered by natural infection in these patients.","Dhédin, Nathalie; Krivine, Anne; Le Corre, Nicole; Mallet, Alain; Lioure, Bruno; Bay, Jacques-Olivier; Rubio, Marie-Thérèse; Agape, Philippe; Thiébaut, Anne; Le Goff, Jérôme; Autran, Brigitte; Ribaud, Patricia",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X13016629; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13016629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24333120/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.11.073,57

The main features of PSO are summarized, and the most important contributions in several geophysical fields are analyzed. The aim is to indicate the fundamental steps of the evolution of PSO methodologies that have been adopted to model the Earth’s subsurface and then to undertake a critical evaluation of their benefits and limitations. Original works have been selected from the existing geophysical literature to illustrate successful PSO applied to the interpretation of electromagnetic (magnetotelluric and time-domain) data, gravimetric and magnetic data, self-potential, direct current and seismic data. These case studies are critically described and compared. In addition, joint optimization of multiple geophysical data sets by means of multi-objective PSO is presented to highlight the advantage of using a single solver that deploys Pareto optimality to handle different data sets without conflicting solutions. Finally, we propose best practices for the implementation of a customized algorithm from scratch to perform stochastic inverse modeling of any kind of geophysical data sets for the benefit of PSO practitioners or inexperienced researchers.","Pace, Francesca; Santilano, Alessandro; Godio, Alberto",Surv Geophys,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-021-09638-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33867608/,57

Here, a plausible mechanism for arenavirus budding is presented, building on recent evidence that viral proteins embed in the inner lipid layer of the cell membrane. Experimental results confirm that viral protein is associated with increased membrane curvature, whereas a mathematical model is used to show that localized increases in curvature alone are sufficient to generate viral buds. The magnitude of the protein-induced curvature is calculated from the size of the amphipathic region hypothetically removed from the inner membrane as a result of translation, with a change in membrane stiffness estimated from observed differences in virion deformation as a result of protein depletion. Numerical results are based on experimental data and estimates for three arenaviruses, but the mechanisms described are more broadly applicable. The hypothesized mechanism is shown to be sufficient to generate spontaneous budding that matches well both qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental observations.","Schley, David; Whittaker, Robert J.; Neuman, Benjamin W.",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23864502/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2013.0403,57

Several strategies are applied to restrict the spread of this disease such as lockdown, adequate social distance in different activities, hand disinfection and the use of masks. Potential hazard outdoors comes from released viruses, which may remain in the air for a while and settle down afterward and contaminating surfaces. Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is known to act as a natural environmental virucide. The virucidal effectivity of UVR depends on a first order on the sensitivity of the virus against UVR as well as on the amount of incoming UVR. Here, we present estimates of the potential of solar UVR in inactivating SARS‐CoV‐2 in the environment. This is done by combining DNA‐damaging surface solar UVR retrieved by satellites and the available information on fluence for inactivation of Coronaviridae. Our results show that solar UVR has a high potential to inactivate these viruses, but the degree depends strongly on location and season. In the subtropics (Sao Paulo, 23.5°S), the daily survival fraction is lower than 10(−4) during the whole year, while close at norther latitudes (Reykjavik, 64°N), such a reduction can be found in June and July only.","Carvalho, Fernanda R.S.; Henriques, Diamantino V.; Correia, Osvaldo; Schmalwieser, Alois W.",Photochem Photobiol,https://doi.org/10.1111/php.13345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33075169/,57

It has already killed more than 250,000 people. Because of this, it is necessary quick and precise diagnosis test. The current gold standard is the RT-PCR with DNA sequencing and identification, but its results takes too long to be available. Tests base on IgM/IgG antibodies have been used, but their sensitivity and specificity may be very low. Many studies have been demonstrating the Covid-19 impact in hematological parameters. This work proposes an intelligent system to support Covid-19 diagnosis based on blood testing. We tested several machine learning methods, and we achieved high classification performance: 95.159% +- 0.693 of overall accuracy, kappa index of 0.903 +- 0.014, sensitivity of 0.968 +- 0.007, precision of 0.938 +- 0.010 and specificity of 0.936 +- 0.011. These results were achieved using classical and low computational cost classifiers, with Bayes Network being the best of them. In addition, only 24 blood tests were needed. This points to the possibility of a new rapid test with low cost. The desktop version of the system is fully functional and available for free use.","Barbosa, V. A. d. F.; Gomes, J.

Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health-care workers (HCWs). The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCWs. RESEARCH QUESTION: ▪▪▪ STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. INTERPRETATION: The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections. In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.","Wahidi, Momen M.; Shojaee, Samira; Lamb, Carla R.; Ost, David; Maldonado, Fabien; Eapen, George; Caroff, Daniel A.; Stevens, Michael P.; Ouellette, Daniel R.; Lilly, Craig; Gardner, Donna D.; Glisinski, Kristen; Pennington, Kelly; Alalawi, Raed",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361152/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220308503; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369220308503,57

Pulmonary sepsis can be of sufficient concern to physicians due to their noticeable symptoms, which usually rely less on screening tools. AIM: To investigate the efficiency of the international normalized ratio (INR) for the early rapid recognition of adult nonpulmonary infectious sepsis. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study. A total of 108 sepsis patients and 106 nonsepsis patients were enrolled according to relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Commonly used clinical indicators, such as white blood cell, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR), platelets (PLT), prothrombin time, INR, activated partial thromboplastin time, and quick Sequential “Sepsis-related” Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores were recorded within 24 h after admission. The diagnostic performances of these clinical indicators were analyzed and compared through multivariate logistic regression analysis, Spearman correlation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: The INR value of the sepsis group was significantly higher than that of the nonsepsis group. INR has superior diagnostic efficacy for sepsis, with an area under the curve value of 0.918, when those preexisting diseases which significantly affect coagulation function were excluded. The diagnostic efficacy of the INR was more significant than that of NLCR, PLT, and qSOFA (P < 0.05). Moreover, INR levels of 1.17, 1.20, and 1.22 could be used to categorize the relative risk of nonpulmonary infections sepsis into three categories: low, medium and high risk, respectively. CONCLUSION: The INR is a promising and easily available biomarker for diagnosis, and it can be used as one of the indicators for early screening of adult nonpulmonary infectious sepsis. When its value is higher than the optimal cutoff value (1.22), high vigilance is required for adult nonpulmonary infectious sepsis.","Zhang, Jing; Du, Hui-Min; Cheng, Ming-Xiang; He, Fa-Ming; Niu, Bai-Lin",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616807/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i25.7405,57

Asymptomatic carriers are of great concern as they can undermine the interventions to stop the pandemic. However, there is limited information about the characteristics and outcomes of the asymptomatic patients. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study and retrieved data of 79 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients at admission from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The asymptomatic patients could happen at any age, ranged from 9 to 96 years. These patients also had lower levels of alanine aminotransferase and C-reactive protein. Patchy shadowing was the most common manifestation in computed tomography scan. Some asymptomatic carriers developed mild or moderate symptoms during hospitalization. Age and comorbidities, especially hypertension, may be predictive factors for symptom development in the initially asymptomatic carriers at admission. Early detection and treatment for these presymptomatic patients before symptom onset can shorten the communicable period for the coronavirus and reduce the occurrence of severe cases.","Yu, Chao; Zhou, Miao; Liu, Yang; Guo, Tinglin; Ou, Chongyang; Yang, Liye; Li, Yan; Li, Dongliang; Hu, Xinyu; Shuai, Li; Wang, Bin; Zou, Zui",Virulence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32722990/; https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2020.1802194,57

To test the feasibility of in-hospital video telemedicine, a dedicated telemedicine device was set up in the patient's room. This device and the accompanying Bluetooth stethoscope were used by the health care team located just outside the room for inpatient rounding and consultations from supportive services. Video telemedicine facilitated inpatient care and interactions with support services, reducing the number of health care providers with potential exposure to infection and decreasing personal protective equipment use. In the setting of strict isolation for highly infectious viral illness, telemedicine can be used for inpatient care activities such as interprofessional rounding and provision of supportive services. Key Points: Telehealth supports patient care in isolation. Telehealth reduced health care provider exposures.

Driven by game theoretic considerations and inspired by the work of US National Research Council's Committee on Food Habits (1943) during WWII, and the post-WWII Yale Communication Research Program, the present research shows how to achieve enhanced adherence to health regulations without coercion. To this aim, we combine three elements: (i) indirect measurements, (ii) personalized interventions, and (iii) attitude changing treatments (IMPACT). We find that a cluster of short interventions, such as elaboration on possible consequences, induction of cognitive dissonance, addressing next of kin and similar others and receiving advice following severity judgements, improves individuals' health-preserving attitudes. We propose extending the use of IMPACT under closure periods and during the resumption of social and economic activities under COVID-19 pandemic, since efficient and lasting adherence should rely on personal attitudes rather than on coercion alone. Finally, we point to the opportunity of international cooperation generated by the pandemic.","Fischer, Ilan; Avrashi, Shacked; Oz, Tomer; Fadul, Rabab; Gutman, Koral; Rubenstein, Daniel; Kroliczak, Gregory; Goerg, Sebastian; Glöckner, Andreas",R Soc Open Sci,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32968537/,57
616649,Virus neutralising activity of African fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) sera against emerging lyssaviruses,2010-12-20,"SARS-CoV-2 incidence and mortality in Europe have shown wide variation. Northern Italy in particular the Lombardy region, north-eastern French regions, Switzerland and Belgium were amongst the hardest hit, while the central and southern Italian regions, all the Balkan countries from Slovenia to Greece and the Islands of Malta and Cyprus had much fewer cases and deaths per capita, and deaths per number of cases. Differences in public health measures, and health care delivery, in the author’s opinion, can only partly explain the difference. The geographical distribution of Phlebotomus sand-flies and the relative distribution of arthropod borne diseases Leishmaniasis and Phlebovirus infections especially the Sicilian Sandfly fever group corresponds to most areas of low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. A hypothesis is proposed whereby repeated arthropod or sandfly vector infection of humans by novel viruses of zoonotic origins carrying bat or mammalian RNA/DNA possibly since many generations, such as phleboviruses may have resulted in the development of an effective evolutionary immune response to most novel zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 by means of survival of the fittest. This process probably ran in parallel and concurrent with the progressive evolution of novel coronaviruses which spread from one mammalian species to another. Other possible, but less likely mechanisms for the role of sandfly meals within a much shorter time frame may have led to , (i) previous exposure and infection of humans with the SARS-Cov-2 virus itself , or a closely related corona virus in the previous decades, or (ii) exposure of human populations to parts coronavirus protein namely either S or more likely N protein carried mechanically by arthropods, but without clinical disease causing direct immunity or (iii) by causing infection with other arthropod borne viruses which could carry bat DNA/RNA and have similar functional proteins resulting in an immediate cross-reactive immune response rather than by natural selection . The Evidence possibly supporting or disputing this hypothesis is reviewed, however the major problem with the hypothesis is that to date no coronavirus has ever been isolated from arthropods. Such a hypothesis can only be supported by research investigating the possible biological relationship of arthropods and coronaviruses where paradoxically they may be promoting immunity rather than disease.","Balzan, Martin",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720320879?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720320879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759006/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110121,57

However, data on inequities in COVID-19 across granular categories of socio-demographic characteristics is more sparse. Methods Neighbourhood-level counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ontario, Canada recorded as of July 28th, 2020 were extracted from provincial and local reportable infectious disease surveillance systems. Associations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality and 18 neighbourhood-level measures of immigration, race, housing and socio-economic characteristics were estimated with Poisson generalized linear mixed models. Housing characteristic variables were subsequently added to models to explore if housing may have a confounding influence on the relationships between immigration, race, and socio-economic status and COVID-19 incidence. Results There were large inequities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality across the socio-demographic variables examined. Neighbourhoods having a higher proportion immigrants, racialized populations, large households and low socio-economic status were associated with COVID-19 risk. Adjusting for housing characteristics, especially unsuitably crowded housing, attenuated COVID-19 risks. However persistent risk remained for neighbourhoods having high proportions of immigrants, racialized populations, and proportion of Black, Latin American, and South Asian residents. Conclusions Socio-demographic factors account for some of the neighbourhood-level differences in COVID-19 across Ontario. Housing characteristics account for a portion, but not all, of the excess burden of COVID-19 experienced by immigrant, racialized, low income and low education populations.","van Ingen, T.; Brown, K.

Can Antimicrobial Peptides Be Used against SARS-CoV-2?,2020-12-15,"Bats are considered to be natural reservoirs for several viruses of clinical importance, including rabies virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. Type I interferons (IFNs) is an important part of the immune system in the defense against viral infection. To investigate the function of type I IFNs upon viral infection in bats, the nucleic acid, and amino acid sequences of Egyptian Rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) IFN-α and -β were characterized. Sequence data indicated that bat IFN-α consists of 562-bp encoded 187-aa, and IFN-β consisted of 558-bp encoded 186-aa. Phylogenetic analysis of the overall identity of IFN-β shared the highest sequence homology with pig IFN-β in both nucleotide and amino acid level. Stimulation of bat primary kidney cells (BPKCs) and bat lung cell lines, Tb-1 Lu, with polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) or exogenous bat type I IFNs resulted in increased type I IFNs mRNA expression in BPKCs, but not in Tb-1 Lu. Characterization of the bat IFN-α and -β genes allows understanding of the immune responses upon stimulation in different tissues, thus providing practical strategies for control and treatment of clinically important diseases. These results are important especially for the virus infection, and suggest that future molecular studies on virus infection experiment of bats in vitro will require careful consideration of the differences of type I IFN expression patterns in different cell types.","Omatsu, Tsutomu; Bak, Eun-Jung; Ishii, Yoshiyuki; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Tohya, Yukinobu; Akashi, Hiroomi; Yoshikawa, Yasuhiro",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18436311/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.03.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242708001293; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242708001293,57

MAIN BODY: The Herpesviridae family uses a number of proteins that are responsible for host shutoff by directly targeting messenger RNA (mRNA), including virion host shutoff (VHS) protein and the immediate-early regulatory protein ICP27 of herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and the SOX (shutoff and exonuclease) protein and its homologs in Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies, although these proteins are not homologous. In this review, we highlight evidence that host shutoff is promoted by the VHS, ICP27 and SOX-like proteins and that they also contribute to immune evasion. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies regarding the host shutoff proteins will not only contribute to provide new insights into the viral replication, expression and host immune evasion process, but also provide new molecular targets for the development of antiviral drugs and therapies.","He, Tianqiong; Wang, Mingshu; Cheng, Anchun; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Jia, Renyong; Liu, Mafeng; Zhu, Dekang; Chen, Shun; Zhang, Shaqiu; Zhao, Xin-Xin; Huang, Juan; Sun, Di; Mao, Sai; Ou, Xuming; Wang, Yin; Xu, Zhiwen; Chen, Zhengli; Zhu, Lin; Luo, Qihui; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling; Tian, Bin; Pan, Leichang; Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Chen, Xiaoyue",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430029/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01336-8,57

Accordingly, in the present study, the pharmacological activities of Juglans regia (L.) pellicle extract (WPE) were investigated. The antiviral effect was tested against Herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, Poliovirus 1, Adenovirus 2, Echovirus 9, Coxsackievirus B1 through the plaque reduction assay. The antibacterial and antifungal activities were evaluated against medically important strains, by the microdilution method. DPPH and superoxide dismutase (SOD)s-like activity assays were used to determine the antioxidant effect. Besides, the extract was screened for cytotoxicity on Caco-2, MCF-7, and HFF1 cell lines by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were also evaluated. Interestingly, WPE inhibited Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) replication, bacterial and fungal growth. WPE showed free radical scavenging capacity and inhibited superoxide anion formation in a dose-dependent manner. These effects could be attributed to the high content of phenols and flavonoids, which were 0.377 ± 0.01 mg GE/g and 0.292 ± 0.08 mg CE/g, respectively. Moreover, WPE was able to reduce Caco-2 cell viability, at both 48 h and 72 h.

Despite these advances in technology, US state agencies face many challenges related to the dissemination of their local health data. It is essential for the public to have access to high-quality data that are easy to interpret, reliable, and trusted. These challenges have been at the forefront throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify the most significant challenges faced by state agencies, from the perspective of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) coordinator from each state, and to assess if the coordinators from states with a WDQS perceive these challenges differently. METHODS: We surveyed BRFSS coordinators (N=43) across all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. We surveyed the participants about contextual factors and asked them to rate system aspects and challenges they faced with their health data system on a Likert scale. We used two-sample t tests to compare the means of the ratings by participants from states with and without a WDQS. RESULTS: Overall, 41/43 states (95%) make health data available over the internet, while 65% (28/43) employ a WDQS. States with a WDQS reported greater challenges (P=.01) related to the cost of hardware and software (mean score 3.44/4, 95% CI 3.09-3.78) than states without a WDQS (mean score 2.63/4, 95% CI 2.25-3.00).

We hypothesise that the social restrictions placed on the public by the government will reduce the amount of trauma presentations and operations performed. METHODS: A database of all trauma patients at the MTC was retrospectively reviewed from start of social restrictions on 16(th) March 2020, to 22(nd) April 2020 inclusive. Referrals to the orthopaedic team were identified and included; these were sub‐classified into major trauma patients, fragility hip fractures and paediatric trauma. All patients undergoing surgical intervention were identified. The outcome measures were the total number of referrals and trauma operations performed in the time period. This was compared to the corresponding dates of the 2019. RESULTS: There was an overall decrease in the number of referrals to the orthopaedic team from 537 in 2019 to 265 in 2020 (50.7% reduction). The number of trauma operations carried out at the trust decreased from 227 in 2019 to 129 in 2020 (43.2% reduction). The number of paediatric referrals decreased from 56 in 2019 to 26 in 2020 (53.6% reduction), and the number of major trauma patients reduced from 147 in 2019 to 95 in 2020 (35.4%). Fragility hip fracture referrals remained similar, with 52 in 2019 compared to 49 in 2020. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic has had a profound effect of the provision of trauma and orthopaedic surgery. We report a significant decrease in all orthopaedic referrals during the pandemic, leading to a greatly reduced number of trauma operations performed. This has allowed for reallocation of staff and resources. We must plan for the lifting of social restrictions, which may lead to an increase in patients presenting with trauma requiring operative intervention.","Greenhalgh, Michael; Dupley, Leanne; Unsworth, Richard; Boden, Richard",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32852851/,57

CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 77‐year‐old man who developed bulbar myasthenia gravis (MG) eight weeks after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The search for serum antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, the muscle‐specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK), and the low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 4 antibodies, performed by radioimmunoassay (RIA), resulted negative, while anti‐MuSK antibodies were detected by cell‐based assay (CBA). The patient was treated with pyridostigmine (60 mg four times a day) with unsatisfactory clinical response, followed by immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine 1.5 mg/kg/day) with improvement of MG symptoms after two months of treatment. DISCUSSION: Several viral diseases have been described as associated with the onset of MG, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Similarly, a growing number of scientific reports suggest a correlation between SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and autoimmune diseases. The interest of our case lies in the timing of the MG onset (after two months from infection), together with the unusual late onset of anti‐MuSK MG. These elements suggest that coronavirus infection may act as a trigger of the disease. We confirm the importance of CBA in the serological diagnosis of RIA‐negative MG.","Assini, Andrea; Gandoglia, Ilaria; Damato, Valentina; Rikani, Klaudio; Evoli, Amelia; Del Sette, Massimo",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33421278/,57

The closure of governmental and nongovernmental centers as well as social, cultural, and economic activities are other major negative impacts of the virus. The present paper aimed to develop a model of economic and health-related factors which affect the reopening of businesses and the proper management of the effect of virus on different aspects, particularly on people’s health and economy. Methods: In order to facilitate decision-making and model risk analysis of guilds and occupations, an expert panel, including eight 8 experts, was convened by the Ministry of Health in Iran to prepare a strategic framework for the national taskforce of COVID-19 management. The panel spent many hours to prepare a simple model of reopening businesses and prioritize them from low to high risks. Results: The experts identified and weighed seven health and three economic-related factors. The businesses and jobs were classified into 69 categories based on their similarities; they were also graded according to a predefined five- point Likert scale and categorized into three levels of low, medium, and high risk. The policymakers recommended to reopen businesses stratified by risk levels at least two weeks’ intervals. Conclusion: The relaunch strategy in Iran put health and safety first while gradually reopening businesses, resuming activities, and getting people back to work. At the same time, attempts were made to slow the spread of the virus through following public health measures, social distancing, good hygiene, and continued acting responsibly. As many countries may have to deal with the same issue, this model can help them adopt appropriate policies and strategies for disease containment.","Seyedin, Hesam; Zanganeh, Ali-Mohamad; Mojtabaei, Mohammadbagher; Bagherzadeh, Rafat; Faghihi, Hushyar",Med J Islam Repub Iran,https://doi.org/10.34171/mjiri.34.97; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315970/,57

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. PARTICIPANTS: The participants in this study are cases identified by epidemiological investigation in Hubei Province, as of February 27, 2020, and were followed until March 7, 2020. In total, 1,989 HCWs and 41,137 other occupational cases were included for analysis. METHODS: We used descriptive statistics to summarize patient characteristics. RESULTS: Of 1,989 laboratory-confirmed HCWs, 297 (14.93%) had severe or critical cases, 73 (3.67%) had asymptomatic infections, and 18 died of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The case fatality rate was 0.9%. The proportion of severe or critical cases decreased from the beginning to the end of the outbreak (from 21.29% to 3.52%), and the proportion of asymptomatic cases increased from 0.0% to 47.18%. Nearly half of HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 reported no known contact with COVID-19 patients (969, 48.72%). Fever and cough were the most common symptoms at disease onset in both HCWs and other occupational cases; however, HCWs had higher rates of fatigue (30.90% vs 25.02%; P < .001) and myalgia (19.15% vs 13.43%; P < .001). Additionally, compared with other occupational groups, HCWs were associated with a lower risk of death after adjustment for potential confounders (odd ratio [OR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30–0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with COVID-19 cases in other occupational groups, HCWs with COVID-19 have half the risk of death, although they have been shown to have higher rates of fatigue and myalgia.","Wu, Mingyang; Xie, Cong; Wu, Ran; Shu, Yanling; Wang, Lulin; Li, Mingyan; Wang, Youjie",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203485/; https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.1321,57

One key aspect to transition safely out of lockdown is to continuously test the population for infected subjects. Currently, detection is performed at points of care using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and requires dedicated professionals and equipment. Here, we developed a protocol based on Reverse Transcribed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for detection of SARS-CoV-2, directly from crude nose and throat swabs. We applied this protocol to over 180 suspected patients, and determined its specificity and sensitivity by comparison to their RT-qPCR results. In addition, we further succeeded to apply the protocol on self-sampled saliva from confirmed cases. Since the proposed protocol provides results on-the-spot, and can detect SARS-CoV-2 from saliva, it can allow simple and continuous surveillance of the community.","Ben-Assa, N.; Naddaf, R.; Gefen, T.; Capucha, T.; Hajjo, H.; Mandelbaum, N.; Elbaum, L.; Rogov, P.; King, D.

They are associated with various systemic side effects that are immune-mediated and clinically coined as “immune-related adverse effects” (irAE). Hyponatremia is a possible side effect in patients receiving ICIs. Fever is another side effect that is mostly non-infectious. There are different mechanisms leading to hyponatremia in patients on ICIs, which could be (1) hypovolemic hyponatremia due to hemodynamic disturbance secondary to volume depletion (eg, from irAE like colitis and enteritis) or hypervolemia due to congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis; (2) syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion (especially from underlying lung cancer or neurological irAE like encephalitis and meningitis) with elevated urine sodium and urine osmolarity; and (3) irAE-related endocrinopathies such as hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism leading to euvolemic hyponatremia.

We show one potential mechanism for COVID‐19 responses to increase inequality by examining the intersection of business restrictions and business political connections. METHODS: We fielded an online survey of 2735 business employees and managers in Ukraine, Egypt, and Venezuela over the summer of 2020 to collect data on companies' closures due to COVID‐19 and nuanced information about their political connections. FINDINGS: We show that businesses with political connections to government officials were significantly less likely to shut down as a result of COVID‐19 policies. This finding suggests that measures designed to mitigate COVID‐19 are ineffective in countries with a weak rule of law if politically connected firms are able to circumvent restrictions by leveraging political connections to receive preferential treatment. In addition, politically connected firms are no more likely—and sometimes even less likely—to engage in social‐distancing policies to mitigate the pandemic despite the fact that they are more likely to remain open.","Kubinec, Robert; Lee, Haillie Na‐Kyung; Tomashevskiy, Andrey",Soc Sci Q,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548705/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.13040,57

628063,Evolutionary and genetic analysis of the VP2 gene of canine parvovirus,2017-07-17,"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan in December 2019 and has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, this deadly pandemic has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to detect positive cases as early as possible to prevent the further spread of this outbreak. Currently, the most widely used COVID-19 detection technique is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR is time-consuming to confirm infection in the patient. Because RT-PCR is less sensitive, it provides high false-negative results. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended as a solution to this problem by healthcare professionals because of its higher sensitivity for early and rapid diagnosis. In addition, radiation used in CT poses a serious threat to patients. In this study, we propose a CNN-based method to distinguish COVID- 19 pneumonia from other types of viral and bacterial pneumonia using low-dose CT images to reduce the radiation dose used in CT. In our study, we used a data set consisting of 7717 CT images of 350 patients that we collected from Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University Research Hospital. We used a CNN-based network that suppresses noise to remove interference from low-dose CT images. In the image preprocessing phase, we provided lung segmentation from CT images and applied quantum Fourier transform. By evaluating all possible variations of local knowledge at the same time with quantum Fourier transformation, the most informative spatial information was extracted. In CNN-based architecture, we used pre-trained ResNet50v2 as a feature extractor and fine-tune by training with our dataset. We visualized the efficiency of the ResNet50v2 network using the t-SNE method. We performed the classification process with a fully connected layer. We created a heat map using the GradCam technique to see where the model focuses on the images while classifying. In this experimental study, the results of 99.5%, 99.2%, 99.0%, 99.7%, and 99.1%, were obtained in the context of performance criteria such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and f1 score, respectively.

628608,In vitro and in vivo studies of the Interferon-alpha action on distinct Orthobunyavirus,2007-02-28,"BACKGROUND: Most people with dementia (PwD) are cared for at home, with general practitioners (GPs) playing a key part in the treatment. However, primary dementia care suffers from a number of shortcomings: Often, diagnoses are made too late and therapies by GPs do not follow the guidelines. In cases of acute crises, PwD are too often admitted to hospital with adverse effects on the further course of the disease. The aim of this study is to implement and evaluate a new GP-based, complex dementia care model, DemStepCare. DemStepCare aims to ensure demand-oriented, stepped care for PwD and their caregivers. METHODS/DESIGN: In a cluster randomized controlled trial, the care of PwD receiving a complex intervention, where the GP is supported by a multi-professional team, is compared to (slightly expanded) usual care. GPs are clustered by GP practice, with 120 GP practices participating in total. GP practices are randomized to an intervention or a control group. 800 PwD are to be included per group. Recruitment takes place in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. In addition, a second control group with at least 800 PwD will be formed using aggregated routine data from German health insurance companies. The intervention comprises the training of GPs, case management including repeated risk assessment of the patients’ care situation, the demand-oriented service of an outpatient clinic, an electronic case record, external medication analyses and a link to regional support services. The primary aims of the intervention are to positively influence the quality of life for PwD, to reduce the caregivers’ burden, and to reduce the days spent in hospital. Secondary endpoints address medication adequacy and GPs’ attitudes and sensitivity towards dementia, among others. DISCUSSION: The GP-based dementia care model DemStepCare is intended to combine a number of promising interventions to provide a complex, stepped intervention that follows the individual needs of PwD and their caregivers. Its effectiveness and feasibility will be assessed in a formative and a summative evaluation.

628834,Protein-Protein Interactions of Viroporins in Coronaviruses and Paramyxoviruses: New Targets for Antivirals?,2015-06-04,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an extensively studied signaling molecule that contributes to cell proliferation, survival, migration and other functions through binding to specific S1P receptors. The cycle of S1P(1) internalization upon S1P binding and recycling to the cell surface when local S1P concentrations are low drives T cell trafficking. S1P(1) modulators, such as fingolimod, disrupt this recycling by inducing persistent S1P(1) internalization and receptor degradation, which results in blocked egress of T cells from the secondary lymphoid tissues. The approval of these compounds for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has placed the development of S1PR modulators in the focus of pharmacological research, mostly for autoimmune indications. Here, we report on a novel anellated bismorpholino derivative of oxy-fingolimod, named ST-2191, which exerts selective S1P(1) agonist and functional antagonist potency. ST-2191 is also effective in reducing the lymphocyte number in mice, and this effect is not dependent on phosphorylation by sphingosine kinase 2 for activity. These data show that ST-2191 is a novel S1P(1) modulator, but further experiments are needed to analyze the therapeutic impact of ST-2191 in animal models of autoimmune diseases.","Stepanovska Tanturovska, Bisera; Zivkovic, Aleksandra; Imeri, Faik; Homann, Thomas; Kleuser, Burkhard; Stark, Holger; Huwiler, Andrea",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34500564/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26175134,57
629069,Studies of enteric coronaviruses in a feline cell line,1982-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has been prescribed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. To assist in clinician decision-making, several clinical laboratories have developed and validated measurement procedures in-house based on HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS to measure the mass concentration of hydroxychloroquine in different biological fluids. In these cases, laboratories produce their calibration materials but rarely estimate the measurement uncertainty of their assigned values. Thus, we aimed to show how this uncertainty can be calculated, using the preparation of hydroxychloroquine calibrators in blood-hemolysate-based matrix as an example. METHODS: A bottom-up approach was used to estimate the uncertainty related to the values assigned to end-user calibration materials prepared in-house. First, a specification of the measurand and a measurement equation were proposed. Then, different sources of uncertainty related to the preparation of hydroxychloroquine calibration materials were identified and quantified. Afterwards, the combined uncertainty was calculated using the law for the propagation of uncertainty resulting in the final expanded uncertainty. RESULTS: In this study, the most significant source of uncertainty was that associated with the hydroxychloroquine’s reference material mass obtained via balance, while the smallest contribution was from the uncertainty associated with the hydroxychloroquine reference material purity. CONCLUSIONS: A simple procedure to estimate the measurement uncertainty of values assigned to calibration materials is presented here, which would be easy to implement in clinical laboratories. Also, it could be put into practice for other pharmacological quantities measured by in-house HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS procedures commonly used in clinical laboratories.","Rigo-Bonnin, Raúl; Canalias, Francesca",Clin Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33453194/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2021.01.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009912021000199; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009912021000199,57

629774,Full-length three-dimensional structure of the influenza A virus M1 protein and its organization into a matrix layer,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Quercetin, a well-known naturally occurring polyphenol, has recently been shown by molecular docking, in vitro and in vivo studies to be a possible anti-COVID-19 candidate. Quercetin has strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties, and it is characterized by a very high safety profile, exerted in animals and in humans. Like most other polyphenols, quercetin shows a very low rate of oral absorption and its clinical use is considered by most of modest utility. Quercetin in a delivery-food grade system with sunflower phospholipids (Quercetin Phytosome(®), QP) increases its oral absorption up to 20-fold. METHODS: In the present prospective, randomized, controlled, and open-label study, a daily dose of 1000 mg of QP was investigated for 30 days in 152 COVID-19 outpatients to disclose its adjuvant effect in treating the early symptoms and in preventing the severe outcomes of the disease. RESULTS: The results revealed a reduction in frequency and length of hospitalization, in need of non-invasive oxygen therapy, in progression to intensive care units and in number of deaths. The results also confirmed the very high safety profile of quercetin and suggested possible anti-fatigue and pro-appetite properties. CONCLUSION: QP is a safe agent and in combination with standard care, when used in early stage of viral infection, could aid in improving the early symptoms and help in preventing the severity of COVID-19 disease. It is suggested that a double-blind, placebo-controlled study should be urgently carried out to confirm the results of our study.","Di Pierro, Francesco; Derosa, Giuseppe; Maffioli, Pamela; Bertuccioli, Alexander; Togni, Stefano; Riva, Antonella; Allegrini, Pietro; Khan, Amjad; Khan, Saeed; Khan, Bilal Ahmad; Altaf, Naireen; Zahid, Maria; Ujjan, Ikram Din; Nigar, Roohi; Khushk, Mehwish Imam; Phulpoto, Maryam; Lail, Amanullah; Devrajani, Bikha Ram; Ahmed, Sagheer",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s318720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135619/,57

Despite improved understanding of the pathophysiology, management, and the great efforts worldwide to produce effective drugs, death rates of COVID-19 patients remain unacceptably high, and effective treatment is unfortunately lacking. Pharmacological strategies aimed at modulating inflammation in COVID-19 are being evaluated worldwide. Several drug therapies targeting this excessive inflammation, such as tocilizumab, an interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor, corticosteroids, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, cytokine-adsorption devices, and intravenous immunoglobulin have been identified as potentially useful and reliable approaches to counteract the cytokine storm. However, little attention is currently paid for non-drug therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory and immunological processes that may be useful for reducing COVID-19-induced complications and improving patient outcome. Vagus nerve stimulation attenuates inflammation both in experimental models and preliminary data in human. Modulating the activity of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways (CAPs) described by the group of KJ Tracey has indeed become an important target of therapeutic research strategies for inflammatory diseases and sepsis. Non-invasive transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (t-VNS), as a non-pharmacological adjuvant, may help reduce the burden of COVID-19 and deserve to be investigated. VNS as an adjunct therapy in COVID-19 patients should be investigated in clinical trials. Two clinical trials on this topic are currently underway (NCT04382391 and NCT04368156).

630733,"Cameroonian fruit bats harbor divergent viruses, including rotavirus H, bastroviruses, and picobirnaviruses using an alternative genetic code",2018-03-30,"The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still spreading worldwide. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and replicates within the cells of the nasal cavity, then spreads along the airway tracts, causing mild clinical manifestations, and, in a majority of patients, a persisting loss of smell. In some individuals, SARS-CoV-2 reaches and infects several organs, including the lung, leading to severe pulmonary disease. SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological symptoms, likely contributing to morbidity and mortality through unknown mechanisms. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid with pleiotropic properties and functions in many tissues, including the nervous system. S1P regulates neurogenesis and inflammation and it is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS). Notably, Fingolimod (FTY720), a modulator of S1P receptors, has been approved for the treatment of MS and is being tested for COVID-19. Here, we discuss the putative role of S1P on viral infection and in the modulation of inflammation and survival in the stem cell niche of the olfactory epithelium. This could help to design therapeutic strategies based on S1P-mediated signaling to limit or overcome the host–virus interaction, virus propagation and the pathogenesis and complications involving the nervous system.","Meacci, Elisabetta; Garcia-Gil, Mercedes; Pierucci, Federica",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942748/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21186773,57

Cabin crew members share in a sense of unity when spending time with team members outside of work hours. Cabin crews must be able to resolve unexpected issues—fires, aircraft defects, medical emergencies, and sudden airflow changes—quickly and accurately. As unexpected issues may result in major accidents, it is crucial that cabin crew members can take responsibility for passenger safety and offer satisfactory services to customers. Furthermore, most cabin duties require cooperation and are highly interdependent; thus, respect and teamwork are essential. This empirical study aims to identify and examine the positive factors of the team system used to evaluate causalities in job satisfaction, team potency, and mental health. The research model is developed based on a theoretical review, focusing on five positive factors—sense of belonging, mutual support, communication, motivation, and work flexibility—and dependent variables: job satisfaction, team potency, and mental health. Sense of belonging, communication, and work flexibility significantly affected team potency along with job satisfaction.

Universities are deliberating whether, when, and how they should resume in-person instruction in Fall 2020. In this essay, we discuss some practical considerations for the use of 2 potentially useful control strategies based on testing: (1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing followed by case-patient isolation and quarantine of close contacts, and (2) serological testing followed by an “immune shield” approach, that is, low social distancing requirements for seropositive persons. The isolation of case-patients and quarantine of close contacts may be especially challenging, and perhaps prohibitively difficult, on many university campuses. The “immune shield” strategy might be hobbled by a low positive predictive value of the tests used in populations with low seroprevalence. Both strategies carry logistical, ethical, and financial implications. The main nonpharmaceutical interventions will remain methods based on social distancing (eg, capping class size) and personal protective behaviors (eg, universal facemask wearing in public space) until vaccines become available, or unless the issues discussed herein can be resolved in such a way that using mass testing as main control strategies becomes viable.","Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai; Cheung, Chi-Ngai; Handel, Andreas",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32713384/,57

According to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of China, negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the key criterion for discharging COVID-19 patients. However, repeated RT-PCR tests lead to medical waste and prolonged hospital stays for COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. Our purpose is to assess a model based on chest computed tomography (CT) radiomic features and clinical characteristics to predict RT-PCR negativity during clinical treatment. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, 203 mild COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital were retrospectively included (training: n = 141; testing: n = 62), and clinical characteristics were collected. Lung abnormalities on chest CT images were segmented with a deep learning algorithm. CT quantitative features and radiomic features were automatically extracted. Clinical characteristics and CT quantitative features were compared between RT-PCR-negative and RT-PCR-positive groups. Univariate logistic regression and Spearman correlation analyses identified the strongest features associated with RT-PCR negativity, and a multivariate logistic regression model was established. The diagnostic performance was evaluated for both cohorts. RESULTS: The RT-PCR-negative group had a longer time interval from symptom onset to CT exams than the RT-PCR-positive group (median 23 vs. 16 days, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the other clinical characteristics or CT quantitative features. In addition to the time interval from symptom onset to CT exams, nine CT radiomic features were selected for the model. ROC curve analysis revealed AUCs of 0.811 and 0.812 for differentiating the RT-PCR-negative group, with sensitivity/specificity of 0.765/0.625 and 0.784/0.600 in the training and testing datasets, respectively. CONCLUSION: The model combining CT radiomic features and clinical data helped predict RT-PCR negativity during clinical treatment, indicating the proper time for RT-PCR retesting.","Cai, Quan; Du, Si-Yao; Gao, Si; Huang, Guo-Liang; Zhang, Zheng; Li, Shu; Wang, Xin; Li, Pei-Ling; Lv, Peng; Hou, Gang; Zhang, Li-Na",BMC Med Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081700/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-020-00521-z,57

This feat is accomplished in part through the release of a diverse set of molecules that contribute to pathogenicity and immune suppression. Many of these molecules have been characterized in terms of their ability to influence the infectious capabilities of helminths across the tree of life. These include nematodes that infect insects, known as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) and plants with applications in agriculture and medicine. In this review we will first discuss the nematode virulence factors, which aid parasite colonization or tissue invasion, and cause many of the negative symptoms associated with infection. These include enzymes involved in detoxification, factors essential for parasite development and growth, and highly immunogenic ES proteins. We also explore how these parasites use several classes of molecules (proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids) to evade the host’s immune defenses. For example, helminths release immunomodulatory molecules in extracellular vesicles that may be protective in allergy and inflammatory disease. Collectively, these nematode-derived molecules allow parasites to persist for months or even years in a host, avoiding being killed or expelled by the immune system. Here, we evaluate these molecules, for their individual and combined potential as vaccine candidates, targets for anthelminthic drugs, and therapeutics for allergy and inflammatory disease. Last, we evaluate shared virulence and immunomodulatory mechanisms between mammalian and non-mammalian plant parasitic nematodes and EPNs, and discuss the utility of EPNs as a cost-effective model for studying nematode-derived molecules. Better knowledge of the virulence and immunomodulatory molecules from both entomopathogenic nematodes and soil-based helminths will allow for their use as beneficial agents in fighting disease and pests, divorced from their pathogenic consequences.","Bobardt, Sarah D.; Dillman, Adler R.; Nair, Meera G.",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.577846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343521/,57

We analyzed its effect on the cytopathology subspecialty practice and resident education at our institution. Design Specimen volumes were analyzed for the cytology practice for 2019 and 2020. Patient registration and elective and scheduled surgery volumes were also included in the analysis for 2020. The impact of innovative concepts, such as virtual teaching, on resident teaching was evaluated using a survey consisting of five multiple choice questions with four possible responses each. Results The total number of specimens decreased by 28% in March 2020 (p<0.00001), with a continuing decline in April (66% decrease YoY, p<0.00001), followed by recovery in May and return to baseline within June 2020. Specimen volumes continued to show an upward trend thereafter. Improved specimen volumes correlated with patient registration and surgical volumes. The majority of residents considered virtual teaching conferences (75%) and self-study sets (58%) as beneficial and did not view absence of one-on-one microscope learning (58%) as significantly affecting their education. Conclusion The recovery curve for our cytopathology service was V-shaped, essentially the most ideal response to an economic downturn. The majority of residents viewed virtual teaching conferences and self-study sets favorably and did not regard absence of one-on-one microscope learning as adversely affecting their education.","Mirchia, Kanish; Khurana, Kamal",J Am Soc Cytopathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213294521002209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548250/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213294521002209?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasc.2021.08.006,57
633235,Easy Synthesis of Complex Biomolecular Assemblies: Wheat Germ Cell-Free Protein Expression in Structural Biology,2021-03-25,"Background: Adolescent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is becoming a serious public health concern worldwide. In recent years, there has seen a significant increase in both the growth rate and cases of NSSI in Eastern countries, such as Japan, India, and China. In China, most schools have a mental health office that comprises mental health professionals (MHPs), who are the first to respond to student mental health problems, which include NSSI. MHPs possess comprehensive knowledge as well as unique insight into adolescent NSSI. However, very few studies on NSSI have incorporated their perspectives. In this work, we seek to add novel insight by conducting a study focusing on adolescent NSSI from the perspective of MHPs. Methods: We recruited a total of 24 MHPs from different schools using purposive sampling and conducted a semi-structured interview on NSSI-related issues. Each interview was voice recorded and lasted ~30 min. A thematic analysis was performed for the responses to study the most common and concerning issues underlying NSSI. Results: We extracted three major themes and eight sub-themes from the interview records, which included (1) the impact of Chinese culture on NSSI (sex-bias discrimination, overly high expectations, and inappropriate parenting style); (2) life events in school (internet use, academic pressure, and romantic relationships); and (3) opinions on the status quo of NSSI in China (ignorance and stigma). Conclusion: Results showed that culturally sensitive influential factors, such as sex-bias discrimination, the imposing of unrealistic expectations for personal achievement, and inappropriate parenting style, should be given more attention to prevent, assess, and intervene in NSSI. Emerging factors of modern society and adolescent lifestyles, such as academic pressure, internet use, and romantic relationships, should also be considered for treatments.","Chen, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Ying; Li, Li; Hou, Yanfei; Liu, Ding; Yang, Xueling; Zhang, Xiaoyuan",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650451/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.681985,57

634652,SARS CORONAVIRUS AND INNATE IMMUNITY,2008-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Since pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, tremendous infected cases has risen all over the world attributed to its high transmissibility. We aimed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from China. METHODS: Data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and the World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) were extracted as the training set and the data from Mar 6 to 9 as the validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death were collected and analyzed. We analyzed the data above through the State Transition Matrix model. RESULTS: The optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of − 3.87%), the cautiously optimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of − 2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of − 1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. The IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6 to 12, Italy Mar 10 to 24, and Iran Mar 10 to 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20 k in South Korea, 209 k in Italy, and 226 k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be earlier than predicted above. CONCLUSION: The end of the pandemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to curb the development of COVID-19.","Zheng, Zhong; Wu, Ke; Yao, Zhixian; Zheng, Xinyi; Zheng, Junhua; Chen, Jian",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32993524/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05417-5,57

Materials were light-cured for either 10 s or 80 s, then finished using a standard clinical procedure. They were characterized by surface morphology (SEM), surface elemental composition (EDS), surface roughness (SR), and surface free energy (SFE). Microbiological behavior was assessed as S. mutans adherence (2 h) and biofilm formation (24 h) using a continuous-flow bioreactor. Statistical analysis included a two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p < 0.05). Materials differed substantially as filler shape, dimension, elemental composition and resin matrix composition. Significant differences between materials were found for SR, SFE, and microbiological behavior. Such differences were less pronounced or disappeared after prolonged photocuring. The latter yielded significantly lower adherence and biofilm formation on all tested materials, similar to conventional RBCs. Improved photoinitiators and UDMA-based resin matrix composition may explain these results. No correlation between surface characteristics and microbiological behavior can explain the similar microbiological behavior of bulk-fill materials after prolonged photocuring. This different performance of bulk-fill materials compared with conventional RBCs, where surface characteristics, especially surface chemistry, influence microbiological behavior, may have important implications for secondary caries occurrence and restoration longevity.","Ionescu, Andrei C.; Comba, Allegra; Brambilla, Eugenio; Ilie, Nicoleta; Breschi, Lorenzo; Cadenaro, Milena; Scotti, Nicola",Polymers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13172948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502989/,57

Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were inoculated with SARS coronavirus for 3, 7, 24, 48, and 72 hr, respectively, and were observed under electron microscope. It was found that the SARS coronavirus entered the cells through membrane fusion instead of endocytosis, and then the nucleocapsids assembled in the RER and matured by budding into the smooth vesicles, which were derived from the Golgi apparatus. The smooth vesicles fused with the cell membrane, and the mature particles were released. A special phenomenon was that some virus‐like particles appeared in the nucleus.

DESIGN: : A cross section design using a non-random sample of 206 women completed the questionnaire during the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown from April to June 2020 in Spain. Psychological, sociodemographic and obstetric factors and the new PREPS were collected. RESULTS: : Bartlett's test of sphericity (χ(2)(105) = 580.36, p < .001), and KMO = .79 confirmed appropriateness for factor analysis of the PREPS. Confirmatory factor analyses based on the factor structure of the original USA English version of this instrument confirmed three factors - Preparedness Stress (7 items), Perinatal Infection Stress (5 items), and Positive Appraisal (3 items). The 15-item version of the PREPS demonstrates internal consistency and reliability are adequate (α > .77), and for F1 - Preparedness (α > .65), for F2 - Infection (α > 0.60) and for F3 - Positive appraisal (α > .55). The three factors exhibited good inter-item correlations, (F1 – Preparedness: .21; F2 – Infection: .23, and F3 – Positive Appraisal: .29). Convergent validity was examined through the Pearson's correlation coefficients of the PREPS with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (PDQ).

637883,Virus- and Interferon Alpha-Induced Transcriptomes of Cells from the Microbat Myotis daubentonii,2019-08-10,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis is caused by a coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Infectious bronchitis is an acute and highly contagious disease of economic importance due to the reduction in weight gain observed with infected broilers and the drop in egg quality and production associated with infected laying hens. The presence of deep pectoral myopathy has been associated with IBV variants. This lesion is detected at slaughterhouses and is characterized by paleness and atrophy of the deep pectoral muscle, including necrosis of the region, leading to condemnations of the breast muscle, a valuable meat cut in the market. This work aimed to study the relationship between deep pectoral myopathy and IBV by describing tracheal and muscle lesions and comparing the frequency of IBV detection via reverse-transcription (RT) PCR in muscle, tracheal, and cecal tonsil samples from broilers with and without myopathy. A case-control study was conducted in 40 broiler flocks vaccinated with the Massachusetts strain. The case group consisted of 23 flocks that presented myopathic lesions under sanitary inspection and a control group of 17 flocks without myopathic lesions. The tracheal, cecal tonsil, and supracoracoid muscle (with and without lesions) samples from the 40 broiler flocks were screened by RT-PCR to detect IBV. Histopathology of muscle and tracheal tissue was carried out. Upon microscopic examination, the muscle samples from the case group presented extensive necrosis, intense mononuclear inflammatory infiltration, muscle fiber fragmentation, and fibrotic tissue, confirming myopathy, whereas muscles from the control group showed no alterations. The tracheal samples presented a large number of infiltrated mononuclear inflammatory cells that in some areas formed submucosal nodules. A total of 25 flocks tested IBV positive by RT-PCR: 14 from the case group and 11 from the control group. The IBV was detected by RT-PCR directly in muscle samples. Despite that, the relationship between deep pectoral myopathy and IBV was not established. The higher positive IBV RT-PCR percentage noted in the cecal tonsil samples demonstrates how important the choice of organs is for diagnostic purposes.","Almeida, D. O.; Tortelly, R.; Nascimento, E.

637957,Stepwise Evolution and Exceptional Conservation of ORF1a/b Overlap in Coronaviruses,2021-09-10,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among transplant patients. The CDC's influenza‐like illness (ILI) criteria (fever ≥100°F with cough and/or sore throat) are a screening tool for influenza with unknown applicability to the transplant population. METHODS: We reviewed all respiratory virus PCR tests performed on adult patients with a history of solid organ (SOT) or stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during the 2012–2013 influenza season. The positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of ILI criteria were calculated. RESULTS: Of 126 transplant patients (66 HSCT, 60 SOT), 54 (42.8%) tested positive for an RVI by PCR: 24 influenza and 30 non‐influenza. Of 30 patients who met ILI criteria, 12 (40%) were positive for influenza. The PPV and NPV of ILI for influenza were 50% and 82.4%, respectively. Mortality was low (3.7%), but morbidity was high (14.8% required ICU stay) among transplant patients diagnosed with RVI. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza and non‐influenza RVIs are associated with significant morbidity among transplant patients. CDC ILI criteria correlate poorly with PCR‐positive cases of influenza in transplant patients, but may be useful in excluding the diagnosis. Routine RVI PCR testing is recommended for better diagnosis and improved antiviral use in transplant patients with suspected RVI.","Claus, Jonathan A.; Hodowanec, Aimee C.; Singh, Kamaljit",Clin Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.12600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26338182/,57

The published data are particularly relevant at present, during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, to define a treatment strategy and to prioritize essential therapy. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMED were systematically researched from outset through April 2020 using Mesh terms. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT), with one arm without adjuvant whole-breast irradiation (WBI), were included in the analysis. Recent literature regarding the COVID pandemic and BC RT was assessed. The reported RCTs identified a group of BC patients (pT1-2N0M0 R0, grade 1–2, estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative tumours) in which the absolute risk of local recurrence (LR) was considered low enough to omit RT. The most common risk factors were tumor diameter, nodal and receptor status. Adjuvant RT had a significant impact on LR but not on distant metastasis (DM) or death. During the COVID 19 pandemic, results from RTCs were re-considered to define treatment recommendations for BC patients. International scientific societies and radiation oncology experts suggested RT omission, whenever possible, in older adult early-stage BC patients. Adjuvant RT might be omitted in a highly selected group of older adult early-stage BC patients with favourable prognostic factors. Hypofractionated regimens should be the standard. RT omission, partial breast irradiation (PBI), and ultra- hypofractionated regimens could be considered in selected cases due to the pandemic.","Palumbo, Isabella; Borghesi, Simona; Gregucci, Fabiana; Falivene, Sara; Fontana, Antonella; Aristei, Cynthia; Ciabattoni, Antonella",J Geriatr Oncol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879406821001168; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879406821001168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020908/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2021.05.008,57

The infectious process in athymic rats inoculated with JHM virus,1987-02-28,"The biomedical community is producing increasingly high dimensional datasets, integrated from hundreds of patient samples, which current computational techniques struggle to explore. To uncover biological meaning from these complex datasets, we present an approach called Multiscale PHATE, which learns abstracted biological features from data that can be directly predictive of disease. Built on a continuous coarse graining process called diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE creates a tree of data granularities that can be cut at coarse levels for high level summarizations of data, as well as at fine levels for detailed representations on subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to study the immune response to COVID-19 in 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients. Through our analysis of patient samples, we identify CD16hi CD66blo neutrophil and IFNγ+GranzymeB+ Th17 cell responses enriched in patients who die. Further, we show that population groupings Multiscale PHATE discovers can be directly fed into a classifier to predict disease outcome. We also use Multiscale PHATE-derived features to construct two different manifolds of patients, one from abstracted flow cytometry features and another directly on patient clinical features, both associating immune subsets and clinical markers with outcome.","Kuchroo, Manik; Huang, Jessie; Wong, Patrick; Grenier, Jean-Christophe; Shung, Dennis; Tong, Alexander; Lucas, Carolina; Klein, Jon; Burkhardt, Daniel; Gigante, Scott; Godavarthi, Abhinav; Israelow, Benjamin; Mao, Tianyang; Oh, Ji Eun; Silva, Julio; Takahashi, Takehiro; Odio, Camila D.; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Fournier, John; Farhadian, Shelli; Dela Cruz, Charles S.; Ko, Albert I.; Wilson, F.

638824,Antiviral activity of natural humic substances and shilajit materials against HIV-1: relation to structure,2020-10-14,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have introduced early evening curfews. Several studies try measure the effectiveness of such measures across different countries, but clear identification of effects is elusive. Objective: We examined the impact of an early evening curfew on mobility by studying a shift in curfews from 9pm to 6pm in Greece. Data and Methods: We took advantage of a natural experiment in Greece, where curfews shifted from 9pm to 6pm in one Region, but not in another. We followed a difference-in-difference econometric approach, where we compared trends in mobility in groceries and pharmacies as well as residential spaces before and after the introduction of the 6pm curfew, in the two regions. Results: The relative difference in the time spent in groceries and pharmacies between the two regions before and after the intervention, is statistically insignificant [coeff: -9.95; 95%CI -44.358 to 24.458]. The relative increase in time spent in groceries and pharmacies after the 6pm curfew was only 4.625 percentage points [coeff: 4.625; 95%CI 1.412 to 7.838]. Conclusions: We found that the 6pm instead of 9pm curfew in Athens led to a 4.63 percentage point relative increase in time spent at home and had no effect on time spent in groceries and pharmacies. Considering that this was a result of a 18.75% reduction in hours where people were allowed to leave home, it seems that the early evening curfew led to more crowding in indoor spaces; which may facilitate the spread of disease. Lockdowns and other measures are necessary to tackle Covid-19, but it is important to avoid substitution by activities that contribute further to spreading the virus. Interventions should therefore be based on a thorough analysis of human behaviour.","Vandoros, S.; Velias, A.; Georganas, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255091; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.13.21255091v1?rss=1,57
638929,Bridging protein local structures and protein functions,2008-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Viruses are the main infectious agents of acute respiratory infections in children. We aim to describe the epidemiological characteristics of viral pathogens of acute respiratory tract infections in outpatient children. METHODS: From April 2018 to March 2019, the results of viral detection using oral pharyngeal swabs from 103,210 children with acute respiratory tract infection in the outpatient department of the Children’s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, were retrospectively analyzed. Viral antigens, including adenovirus (ADV), influenza A (FLUA), influenza B (FLUB) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), were detected by the colloidal gold method. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 38,355 cases; the positivity rate was 37.2%. A total of 1910 cases of mixed infection with two or more viruses were detected, and the positivity rate of multiple infection was 1.9%. The ADV positivity rate was highest in the 3–6-year-old group (18.7%), the FLUA positivity rate was highest in the > 6-year-old group (21.6%), the FLUB positivity rate was highest in the > 6-year-old group (6.6%), and the RSV positivity rate was highest in the < 1-year-old group (10.6%). There was a significant difference in the positivity rate of viral infection among different age groups (χ(2) = 1280.7, P < 0.001). The rate of positive viral infection was highest in winter (47.1%). The ADV infection rate was highest in spring (18.2%). The rates of FLUA and FLUB positivity were highest in winter (28.8% and 3.6%, respectively). The rate of RSV positivity was highest in autumn (17.4%). The rate of positive viral infection in different seasons was significantly different (χ(2) = 6459.1, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Viral infection rates in children differ for different ages and seasons. The positivity rate of ADV is highest in the preschool period and that of RSV is highest in infants; that of FLU increases with age. The total positive rate of viral infection in different seasons is highest in winter, as is the rate of FLU positivity.","Zhu, Guohong; Xu, Dan; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Wang, Tianlin; Zhang, Lingyan; Gu, Weizhong; Shen, Meiping",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33407659/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01475-y,57

Apart from its effects on economies, education systems and societies, the pandemic has also influenced climate change research. This paper examines the extent to which COVID-19 has influenced climate change research worldwide during the first wave at the beginning of 2020 and how it is perceived to exploit it in the future. This study utilised an international survey involving those dedicated to climate change science and management research from Academia, Government, NGOs, and international agencies in 83 countries. The analysis of responses encompasses four independent variables: Institutions, Regions, Scientific Areas, and the level of economic development represented by the Human Development Index (HDI). Results show that: (1) COVID-19 modified the way the surveyed researchers work, (2) there are indicators that COVID-19 has already influenced the direction of climate change and adaptation policy implementation, and (3) respondents perceived (explicitly concerning the COVID-19 lockdowns of March-April 2020), that the pandemic has drawn attention away from climate policy. COVID- 19 has influenced the agenda of climate change research for more than half of the respondents and is likely to continue in the future, suggesting that the impacts on their research will still be felt for many years.

Moreover, the transport conditions of samples are inadequate, therefore leading to unreliable results. OBJECTIVES: The development of a rapid, inexpensive, and simple test would allow mobile detection of viruses. STUDY DESIGN: A suitcase laboratory “Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase” (56 cm × 45.5 cm × 26.5 cm) containing all reagents and devices necessary for performing a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. As an example, two RT-RPA assays were established for the detection of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes of the novel avian influenza (H7N9) virus. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the H7 and the N9 RT-RPA assays were 10 and 100 RNA molecules, respectively. The assays were performed at a single temperature (42 °C). The results were obtained within 2–7 min. The H7N9 RT-RPA assays did not show a cross-detection either of any other respiratory viruses affecting humans and/or birds or of the human or chicken genomes. All reagents were used, stored, and transported at ambient temperature, that is, cold chain independent. In addition, the Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase was operated by a solar-powered battery. CONCLUSIONS: The developed assay protocol and mobile setup performed well. Moreover, it can be easily implemented to perform diagnoses at airports, quarantine stations, or farms for rapid on-site viral nucleic acid detection.","Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Weidmann, Manfred; Hufert, Frank T.",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215001493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209370/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215001493; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.05.004,57

This study aimed to compare the composite preterm (PT) or low birth weight (LBW) birth rates during the COVID-19 pandemic period in South Korea to those during the prior decade, and to find out the associations of childbirth during the pandemic period with PT or LBW births. Over a ten-year period, this retrospective cohort study was performed in a single hospital in the Seoul metropolitan city. The COVID-19 period was defined as running from 22 March 2020, to 31 October 2020, and the pre-COVID-19 period as the sum of parallel periods from 2011 to 2019. Trends in composite birth rates were investigated, and logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate independent factors associated with composite births. There were 246 and 2765 singleton deliveries during the COVID-19 period and the pre-COVID-19 period, respectively. The composite birth rate decreased from 16.5% to 9.8%. Childbirth during the pandemic was independently associated with a decreased composite birth rate (adjusted odds ratio, 0.563; 95% confidence interval, 0.355−0.844, p = 0.015). These findings suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic might provide an opportunity to find out preventive factors for PT or LBW births.","Kim, Sae-Yun; Kim, So-Young; Kil, Kicheol; Lee, Young",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8050332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922899/,57
640346,Are trans‐complementation systems suitable for hepatitis C virus life cycle studies?,2013-02-14,"Nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a major pathological determinant in the host that may cause host cell apoptosis, upregulate the proinflammatory cytokine production, and block innate immune responses. Therefore, N gene has long been thought an ideal target for the design of small interference RNA (siRNA). siRNA is a class of small non-coding RNAs with a size of 21-25nt that functions post-transcriptionally to block targeted gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the N gene coding sequences derived from 16 different isolates, and found that nucleotide deletions and substitutions are mainly located at the first 440nt sequence. Combining previous reports and the above sequence information, we create three novel siRNAs that specifically target the conserved and unexploited regions in the N gene. We show that these siRNAs could effectively and specifically block the isolated N gene expression in mammal cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence to show that N gene can effectively up-regulate M gene mediated interferon β (IFNβ) production, while blocking N gene expression by specific siRNA significantly reduces IFNβ gene expression. Our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of siRNA on the isolated N gene expression might be influenced by the sequence context around the targeted sites.","Cao, Ying-Li; Wang, Ying; Guo, Rong; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Yun; Wang, Shu-Hui; Liu, Li",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21317844/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules16021544,57

This study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on routine vaccinations by country, antigen, and sector (public or private), up to 1 June 2020, and to identify the reasons for disruption and possible solutions. METHODS: Sanofi Pasteur teams from 19 countries in SEAR/WPR completed a structured questionnaire reporting on COVID-19 disruptions for 13–19 routinely delivered antigens per country, based on sales data, government reports, and regular physician interactions. Data were analysed descriptively, disruption causes ranked, and solutions evaluated using a modified public health best practices framework. FINDINGS: 95% (18/19) of countries reported vaccination disruption. When stratified by country, a median of 91% (interquartile range 77–94) of antigens were impacted. Infancy and school-entry age vaccinations were most impacted. Both public and private sector healthcare providers experienced disruptions. Vaccination rates had not recovered for 39% of impacted antigens by 1 June 2020. Fear of infection, movement/travel restrictions, and limited healthcare access were the highest-ranked reasons for disruption. Highest-scoring solutions were separating vaccination groups from unwell patients, non-traditional vaccination venues, virtual engagement, and social media campaigns. Many of these solutions were under-utilised. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19-induced disruption of routine vaccination was more widespread than previously reported. Adaptable solutions were identified which could be implemented in SEAR/WPR and elsewhere. Governments and private providers need to act urgently to improve coverage rates and plan for future waves of the pandemic, to avoid a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Although there are studies about this novel virus, our knowledge is still limited. There is limited information about its diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. We aimed to investigate the effect of methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin levels on the prognosis of COVID-19. In this observational study, patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during March 1–April 31, 2020 in a secondary-level state hospital in Turkey were included in the study. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method, with nasal, oral or sputum specimens. During the period this study was performed, 3075 patients were tested for COVID-19 and 573 of them were hospitalized. Among the hospitalised patients, 23.2% (133) of them had a positive polymerase chain reaction result for COVID-19. A total of 125 patients, 66 (52.8%) males and 59 (47.2%) females, with an average age of 50.2 ± 19.8 years, were included in the study. The most common findings in chest radiogram were ground-glass areas and consolidations, while one-third of the patients had a normal chest radiogram. Computed thorax tomography was performed for 77.6% (97/125) of the patients. The 24.7% of computed tomographies (24/97) did not reveal any pathological findings, and the most common findings were ground-glass appearance and consolidation.

No statistically significant difference was found in carboxyhemoglobin (P = 0.395) and methemoglobin (P = 1.000) levels. We found that carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin levels had no effect on COVID-19 prognosis, but low platelet level played a role in predicting COVID-19 prognosis.

Toenail concentration of 24 metals was measured in 366 children (6–10 years), who live and attend school in a city hosting a cement plant. Living addresses and schools were geocoded and attributed to exposed or control areas, according to modeled ground concentrations of PM(10) generated by the cement plant. Air levels of PM(10) and NO(2) were monitored. PM(10) levels were higher in the exposed, than in the control area. The highest mean PM(10) concentration was recorded close to the cement plant. Conversely, the highest NO(2) concentration was in the control area, where vehicular traffic and home heating were the prevalent sources of pollutants. Exposed children had higher concentrations of Nickel (Ni), Cadmium (Cd), Mercury (Hg), and Arsenic (As) than controls. These concentrations correlated each other, indicating a common source. Toenail Barium (Ba) concentration was higher in the control- than in the exposed area. The location of the attended school was a predictor of Cd, Hg, Ni, Ba concentrations, after adjusting for confounders. In conclusion, children living and attending school in an urban area exposed to cement plant emissions show a chronic bioaccumulation of toxic metals, and a significant exposure to PM(10) pollution. Cement plants located in populous urban areas seem therefore harmful, and primary prevention policies to protect children health are needed.","Di Ciaula, Agostino",Expo Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189342/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12403-021-00412-w,57

OBJECTIVES: In this article, we focus on disability that has occurred with the overall lengthening of LE in many populations and the implications this has for decreased HRQoL. METHODS: We utilize the concept of rectangularization of population survival to depict the rising prevalence of disability associated with increased LE, especially among racial and ethnic minorities and people of low socioeconomic status (SES) and relate this to HRQoL. RESULTS: Disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE) are defined in terms of HRQoL. Specific attention is focused on disability experienced by disparate populations around the globe. By focusing on disparities in DFLE, and the need to expand LE to include HLE as a central component of HRQoL, this work provides an important counterpoint to the attention that has been paid to LE disparities according to race, gender, ethnicity, education, and SES. DISCUSSION: By calling attention to those factors that appear to be the most important drivers of the differences in quality and length of DFLE between different groups (i.e., the components of the social gradient, exposure to chronic stress, systemic inflammation, and the psychological and biological mechanisms associated with the gut–brain axis) and, by logical extension, HRQoL, we hope to promote research in this arena with the ultimate goal of improving DFLE, HLE, and overall HRQoL, especially in disparate populations around the globe.","Galvin, Ashley E.; Friedman, Daniela B.; Hébert, James R.",Qual Life Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-021-02809-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733432/,57
641748,Investigation of the stability and risks of fomite transmission of human coronavirus OC43 on leather,2021-08-30,"Maternal stress has debilitating implications for both mother and child, including increased risk for anxiety. The current COVID-19 pandemic escalates these phenomena, thus, urging the need to further explore and validate feasible therapeutic options. Unlike the protracted nature of clinical studies, animal models could offer swift evidence. Prominent candidates for treatment are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to the mother, that putatively accommodate maternal functioning, and, thereby, also protect the child. However, SSRIs might have deleterious effects. It is important to assess whether SSRIs and other pharmacotherapies can moderate the transference of anxiety by soothing maternal anxiety and to examine the extent of offspring’s exposure to the drugs via lactation. To our knowledge, the possibility that antenatal stress exacerbates lactation-driven exposure to SSRIs has not been tested yet. Thirty ICR-outbred female mice were exposed to stress during gestation and subsequently administered with either the SSRI, escitalopram, or the novel herbal candidate, shan-zha, during lactation. Upon weaning, both dams’ and pups’ anxiety-like behavior and serum escitalopram levels were assessed. The major findings of the current study show that both agents moderated the antenatal stress-induced transgenerational transference of anxiety by ameliorating dams’ anxiety. Interestingly though, pups’ exposure to escitalopram via lactation was exacerbated by antenatal stress. The latter finding provides a significant insight into the mechanism of lactation-driven exposure to xenobiotics and calls for a further consideration vis-à-vis the administration of other drugs during breastfeeding.","Burstein, Or; Simon, Noam; Simchon-Tenenbaum, Yaarit; Rehavi, Moshe; Franko, Motty; Shamir, Alon; Doron, Ravid",Transl Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947833/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01383-x,57

Currently there are few treatment options and very few long-lasting disinfectants available to prevent the spread. While masks and protective clothing and ""social distancing"" may offer some protection, their use has not always halted or slowed the spread. Several vaccines are currently undergoing testing; however there is still a critical need to provide new methods for inactivating the virus before it can spread and infect humans. In the present study we examined the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by synthetic conjugated polymers and oligomers developed in our laboratories as antimicrobials for bacteria, fungi and non-enveloped viruses. Our results show that we can obtain highly effective light induced inactivation with several of these oligomers and polymers including irradiation with near-UV and visible light. With both the oligomers and polymers, we can reach several logs of inactivation with relatively short irradiation times.

Here we analyze the impact of this triage plan on the only academic neurosurgery center in San Diego County, California, USA. Methods We conducted a de-identified retrospective review of all operative cases and procedures performed by UCSD Department of Neurosurgery faculty from November 24, 2019, through July 6, 2020, a 226-day period. Statistical analysis involved two-sample z-tests assessing daily case totals over the 113-day periods prior to and after implementation of the OR triage plan on March 16, 2020. Results A total of 1429 surgical and interventional radiologic procedures were performed by the neurosurgical service over the study period. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of daily total cases in the pre- versus post-triage plan periods (6.9 versus 5.8 mean daily cases, respectively; 1-tail p = 0.050, 2-tail p = 0.101), a trend reflected by nearly every category of neurosurgical cases.

This systematic review evaluates the prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in patients admitted to ICUs with SARS-CoV-2 infection using PRISMA guidelines. We searched and scrutinized results from PubMed and ScienceDirect databases for published literature restricted to the English language up to 11 May 2021. In addition, we included observational studies of humans with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical characteristics, and antibiotics prescribed for ICU patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. A total of 361 studies were identified, but only 38 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic prescribing data were available from 2715 patients, of which prevalence of 71% was reported in old age patients with a mean age of 62.7 years. From the reported studies, third generation cephalosporin had the highest frequency amongst reviewed studies (36.8%) followed by azithromycin (34.2%). The estimated bacterial infection in 12 reported studies was 30.8% produced by 15 different bacterial species, and S. aureus recorded the highest bacterial infection (75%). The fundamental outcomes were the prevalence of ICU COVID-19 patients prescribed antibiotics stratified by age, type of antibiotics prescribed, and the presence of co-infections and comorbidities. In conclusion, more than half of ICU patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection received antibiotics, and prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated frequency of identified bacterial co-infection.","Abu-Rub, Lubna I.; Abdelrahman, Hana A.; Johar, Al-Reem A.; Alhussain, Hashim A.; Hadi, Hamad Abdel; Eltai, Nahla O.",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10080935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438985/,57

Self-collection of capillary blood at home can facilitate the monitoring of patients with chronic disease to support virtual clinics while mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely used biochemical analytes and to develop and pilot a user-friendly home-collection kit to support virtual outpatient clinical services. METHODS: To investigate the comparability of whole blood capillary and plasma venous samples for 15 routinely requested biochemical analytes, simultaneous samples of venous and capillary blood were collected in EDTA and lithium-heparin plasma separation tubes that were of 4–6 mL and 400–600 µL draw volume, respectively. Venous samples were analysed within 4 h of collection while capillary samples were kept at ambient temperature for three days until centrifugation and analysis. Analyte results that were comparable between the matrices were then piloted in a feasibility study in three outpatient clinical services. RESULTS: HbA1c, lipid profile and liver function tests were considered comparable and piloted in the patient feasibility study. The home-collect kit demonstrated good patient usability. CONCLUSION: Home collection of capillary blood could be a clinically-useful tool to deliver virtual care to patients with chronic disease.","Ansari, Saleem; Abdel-Malek, Mariana; Kenkre, Julia; Choudhury, Sirazum M; Barnes, Sophie; Misra, Shivani; Tan, Tricia; Cegla, Jaimini",Ann Clin Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1177/00045632211004995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715443/,57

We sought to quantify the effect of testing and vaccine strategies on the attack rate, length of the epidemic, and hospitalization. Methods: We developed an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a nursing home with resident and staff agents. Interactions between 172 residents and 170 staff were assumed based on data from a nursing home in Los Angeles, CA. We simulated scenarios assuming different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions, testing frequencies, and vaccine efficacy to block transmission. Results: Under the hypothetical scenario of widespread SARS-CoV-2 in the community, 3-day testing frequency minimized the attack rate and the time to eradicate an outbreak. Prioritization of vaccine among staff or staff and residents minimized the cumulative number of infections and hospitalization, particularly in the scenario of high probability of an introduction. Reducing the probability of a virus introduction reduced the demand on testing and vaccine to reduce infections and hospitalizations. Conclusions: Improving frequency of testing from 7-days to 3-days minimized the number of infections and hospitalizations, despite widespread community transmission. Vaccine prioritization of staff provides the best protection strategy, despite high risk of a virus introduction.","Gomez-Vazquez, J. P.; Garcia, y.; Schmidt, A.

Furthermore it has a major role in the development of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which is highly involved in a severe COVID-19 development and its serious outcomes. Even though obese OSA patients had an increased pulmonary embolism (PE) risk, there is no enough evidence to support the interaction between obesity and OSA regarding PE development in the setting of COVID-19. Our patient is a 45-year-old obese male with COVID-19, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure requiring high-flow nasal oxygenation. Clinical, laboratory and diagnostic findings pointed on severe COVID-19 form, complicated with PE. After recovery, the diagnosis of OSA was established.

The structured method of developing consensus among panel members using Delphi methodology has gained acceptance in diverse fields of medicine. The Delphi methods assumed a pivotal role in the last few decades to develop best practice guidance using collective intelligence where research is limited, ethically/logistically difficult or evidence is conflicting. However, the attempts to assess the quality standard of Delphi studies have reported significant variance, and details of the process followed are usually unclear. We recommend systematic quality tools for evaluation of Delphi methodology; identification of problem area of research, selection of panel, anonymity of panelists, controlled feedback, iterative Delphi rounds, consensus criteria, analysis of consensus, closing criteria, and stability of the results. Based on these nine qualitative evaluation points, we assessed the quality of Delphi studies in the medical field related to coronavirus disease 2019. There was inconsistency in reporting vital elements of Delphi methods such as identification of panel members, defining consensus, closing criteria for rounds, and presenting the results.

646450,Cell culture propagation of bovine coronavirus,1988,"Background Mortality in acute respiratory failure remains high despite the use of lung-protective ventilation. Recent studies have shown an association between baseline ventilation parameters (driving pressure or mechanical power) and outcomes for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Strategies focused on limiting these parameters have been proposed to further improve outcomes. However, it remains unknown whether driving pressure and mechanical power should be limited over the entire duration of mechanical ventilation and in all patients with acute respiratory failure. We aimed to estimate the association between exposure to different intensities of mechanical ventilation over time and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure. METHODS: In this registry-based, prospective cohort study, we obtained data from the Toronto Intensive Care Observational Registry, which includes all patients receiving mechanical ventilation for 4 h or more in nine ICUs that are affiliated with the University of Toronto (Toronto, ON, Canada). We included all adult (≥18 years) patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation between April 11, 2014, and June 5, 2019. Patients were excluded if they received treatment with extracorporeal life support. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Bayesian joint models were used to estimate the strength of associations, accounting for informative censoring due to death during follow-up. FINDINGS: Of 13 939 patients recorded in the registry, 13 408 (96·2%) were eligible for descriptive analysis. The primary analysis comprised 7876 (58·7%) patients with complete baseline characteristics, and a secondary analysis included all 13 408 patients after multiple imputation in the joint model analysis. 2409 (18·0%) of 13 408 patients died in the ICU. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including age and severity of illness, a significant increase in the hazard of death was found to be associated with each daily increment in driving pressure (hazard ratio 1·064, 95% credible interval 1·057–1·071) or mechanical power (hazard ratio 1·060, 95% credible interval 1·053–1·066). These associations persisted over the duration of mechanical ventilation. INTERPRETATION: Cumulative exposure to higher intensities of mechanical ventilation was harmful, even for short durations. Limiting exposure to driving pressure or mechanical power should be evaluated in further studies as promising ventilation strategies to reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure.

METHODS: 97 patients (45 males, 52 females, mean age, 66.2 ± 5.0) with chest CT examination and positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) from January 17, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were retrospectively studied. The patients were divided into four age groups (children [0–17 years], young adults [18–44 years], middle age [45–59 years], and senior [≥ 60 years]) according to their age after the diagnosis was made based on PCR test and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are more common in the senior group. Cluster onset (two or more confirmed cases in a small area) is more common in the children group and senior group. Older patients were found to have a higher incidence of the highest clinical classification (severe or critical) in these four groups. Senior patients have a higher incidence of large/multiple ground-glass opacity (GGO). Child patients are mostly negative for chest CT or with involvement of only one lobe of the lung; while in older patients, there was a higher incidence of involvement of four or five lung lobes. The frequency of lobe involvement was also found to have significant differences in the four age groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical and imaging features of patients in different age groups were found to be significantly different. A better understanding of the age differences in comorbidities, cluster onset, highest clinical classification, large/multiple GGO, numbers of lobes affected, and frequency of lobe involvement can be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients of different ages.","Li, Wei; Fang, Yijie; Liao, Jianwei; Yu, Wenjun; Yao, Lin; Cui, Huaqian; Zeng, Xiang; Li, Shaolin; Huang, Chuan",Eur Geriatr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662041/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41999-020-00356-5,57

Premature vascular aging such as elevated arterial stiffness appears to be a major risk factor for CVD. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are one of the essential parts of arterial pathology and prone to stress-induced senescence. The pervasiveness of senescent VSMCs in the vasculature increases with age and can be further expedited by various stressing events such as oxidative stress, mitochondria dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chronic inflammation. Angiotensin II (AngII) can induce many of these responses in VSMCs and is thus considered a key regulator of VSMC senescence associated with CVD. Understanding the precise mechanisms and consequences of senescent cell accumulation may uncover a new generation of therapies including senolytic and senomorphic compounds against CVD. Accordingly, in this review article, we discuss potential molecular mechanisms of VSMC senescence such as those induced by AngII and the therapeutic manipulations of senescence to control age-related CVD and associated conditions such as by senolytic.","Okuno, Keisuke; Cicalese, Stephanie; Elliott, Katherine J.; Kawai, Tatsuo; Hashimoto, Tomoki; Eguchi, Satoru",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916794/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21186579,57

We used a discrete choice experiment to explore these preferences. METHODS YBMSM ages 16-35 in Birmingham, Alabama and Jackson, Mississippi completed online surveys evaluating their preferences (best/worst) for HIV/STI testing locations, staffing, hours, method of results notification, and cost. They also selected preferred combinations of these variables through choice tasks. Results were analyzed using joint best/worst and discrete choice experiment models. RESULTS Between June 2018-December 2019, participants in Alabama (n = 54) and Mississippi (n = 159) completed online surveys. Both groups preferred stationary testing locations over mobile testing vans, with the most significant difference favoring STI testing-only clinics in Mississippi and local health departments in Alabama (p < 0.001). Technician-performed tests or self-testing were significantly less preferred compared to clinician-performed testing for both groups (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Free testing and phone results notification (versus text) were preferred by both groups. The most desirable combination among all participants was weekday clinician-performed testing at the health department for $5. CONCLUSION YBMSM in the Southeastern U.S. prefer traditional testing locations staffed by experienced personnel. Combination choices are influenced by services that are low- or no-cost. More research is needed to inform the best way(s) to provide affordable, high-quality HIV/STI testing services for YBMSM, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era when sexual healthcare delivery models are evolving toward home-based and remote-health focused strategies.","Van Gerwen, Olivia T; Talluri, Rajesh; Camino, Andres F; Mena, Leandro A; Chamberlain, Nicholas; Ford, Eric W; Eaton, Ellen F; Muzny, Christina A",Sexually transmitted diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535613/,57

648907,Decorated and Encapsulated: Virus-Like Particles Against Viral Infections,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronic pulmonary heart disease (CPHD), a common disease, has over recent years been studied using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) due to many high-profile benefits. These can be evaluated by the measurement and analysis of related outcomes. Because of selective reporting bias and the heterogeneity of study outcomes, it is not possible to combine similar studies in a meta-analysis. Consequently, not only does the low quality of original studies fails to support evidence-based decision-making, but also the value of those clinical studies cannot be evaluated. To solve these problems, the development of a core outcome set for traditional Chinese medicines for the treatment of chronic pulmonary heart disease (COS-TCM-CPHD) is required. METHODS: The development is conducted in five steps: (1) a library of outcomes through systematic review, the retrieval of libraries from two clinical trials registries, and semistructured interviews is established; (2) following data extraction and analysis of the library of outcomes, each outcome can be classified into seven outcome domains, including TCM disease, symptoms/signs, physical and chemical testing, quality of life, long-term prognosis, economic evaluation, and adverse events to form a preliminary list of outcomes; (3) stakeholder groups for participation are selected; (4) stakeholder groups are invited to participate in two rounds of Delphi surveys to score outcomes and provide additional outcomes; (5) a consensus meeting is organized to produce the final COS-TCM-CPHD. Discussion. The protocol is consistent with the guidelines defined by the Core Outcome Set-STAndardised Protocol (COS-STAP) statement and formulated with reference to Core Outcome Set-STAndards for development (COS-STAD). The COS-TCM-CPHD will improve the consistency of study reports and reduce publication bias, thereby improving the quality of TCM clinical trials and decision-making for evidence-based medicine.

However, the mechanism underlying has not been systematically evaluated, which limited their application in disease treatment. Nuclear factor erythroid 2−related factor 2 (Nrf2), a central transcription factor in oxidative stress response related to numerous diseases, is activated after dissociating from the cytoskeleton−anchored Kelch−like ECH−associated protein 1 (Keap1). The Keap1–Nrf2 protein–protein interaction has become an important drug target. This study was designed to clarify whether antioxidantive phytochemicals inhibit the Keap1–Nrf2 protein–protein interaction and activate the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway efficiently. Molecular docking and 3D−QSAR were applied to evaluate the interaction effects between 178 antioxidant phytochemicals and the Nrf2 binding site in Keap1. The Nrf2 activation effect was tested on a H(2)O(2)−induced oxidative−injured cell model. Results showed that the 178 phytochemicals could be divided into high−, medium−, and low−total−score groups depending on their binding affinity with Keap1, and the high−total−score group consisted of 24 compounds with abundant oxygen or glycosides. Meanwhile, these compounds could bind with key amino acids in the structure of the Keap1−Nrf2 interface. Compounds from high−total−score group show effective activation effects on Nrf2. In conclusion, phytochemicals showed high binding affinity with Keap1 are promising new Nrf2 activators.","Li, Maiquan; Huang, Weisu; Jie, Fan; Wang, Mengmeng; Zhong, Yongheng; Chen, Qi; Lu, Baiyi",Food Chem Toxicol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278691519305484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412289/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691519305484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.110758,57

Thus, the purpose of this review was to summarize the response of various hormonal changes involved in these physiologic functions to dehydration. A comprehensive literature search for peer-reviewed research in the databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and SportDiscus was conducted. Studies were included if they contained samples of adults (>18 years) and experimentally induced dehydration as measured by acute body mass loss. Twenty-one articles were eligible for inclusion. Findings suggested cortisol is significantly elevated with hypohydration (standard mean difference [SMD] = 1.12, 95% CI [0.583, 1.67], p < 0.0001). Testosterone was significantly lower in studies where hypohydration was accompanied by caloric restriction (SMD= −1.04, 95% CI [−1.93, −0.14], p = 0.02), however, there were no changes in testosterone in studies examining hypohydration alone (SMD = −0.17, 95% CI [−0.51 0.16], p = 0.30). Insulin and ghrelin were unaffected by acute total body water losses. Acute hypohydration increases markers of catabolism but has a negligible effect on markers of glycemic regulation, appetite, anabolism and stress. Given the brevity of existing research, further research is needed to determine the impact of hydration on glucagon, leptin, peptide YY and the subsequent outcomes relevant to both health and performance.","Zaplatosch, Mitchell E.; Adams, William M.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32825404/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12092526,57

Depressive state must be measured with culturally adapted and population-validated instruments specially in times of COVID19 pandemics in undergraduate health students to avoid future health damages. The European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ5-D-3L) is validated but the ‘9-Item Patient Health Questionaire’ (PHQ-9) still needed validation for university population, which this study intended to do. METHODS: With original authors authorization and after cross-cultural adaptation, a cross sectional, observational study, applying the PHQ-9 and EQ-5D-3L to Faculty of Medicine and Faculty Pharmacy of the University of Coimbra (FMUC and FFUC) students, along with an epidemiological survey in a convenience sample using student’s social networks in november 2020. Descriptive, inferential and correlational statistics were performed. RESULTS: A size representative sample of 126 participants was studied, of which 72 from FMUC (57.1%) and 54 from FFUC (42.9%). For PHQ-9 (reliability cronbach’s alfa of 0.815, and F test = 38 786, P < 0.001) were found and global score FFUC students and females was higher, P = 0.014 and P = 0.034, respectively.

The vertical variation in wind directions, or the twist effect, significantly influences the Pedestrian Level Wind (PLW) field in urban areas of Hong Kong, thus it is a topic demanding systematic investigations. In this study, a new set of inflow boundary conditions are proposed to model twisted wind flows in Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. The new inflow boundary condition derived based on the horizontal homogeneous assumption, specifies a vertical profile of lateral wind speeds at the inlet boundary to sustain the twist effect in the empty computational domain. The proposed boundary conditions are used to simulate the PLW fields near three isolated buildings with different Height-to-Width ratio using two CFD codes; OpenFOAM, and FLUENT. The results reveal that OpenFOAM is more reliable in simulating PLW fields in twisted wind flows using the new set of boundary conditions. The three-dimensional flow field provided by the OpenFOAM simulation shows sparse streamlines downstream the buildings, indicating lack of organized eddies in the building far wake, which negatively affects the dispersion of air pollutants in twisted winds.","Weerasuriya, A.U.; Hu, Z.Z.; Zhang, X.L.; Tse, K.T.; Li, S.; Chan, P.W.",Build Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.01.047; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132318300659; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318300659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287982/,57

Recently, our research group observed the promising performance of an anionic phthalocyanine derivative (APD) used in a mouthwash protocol without photoexcitation; this protocol improved the general clinical condition of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The present two-arm study evaluated in vitro the antiviral activity and cytotoxicity of APD. Additionally, a triple-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 41 hospitalized patients who tested positive for COVID-19. All the included patients received World Health Organization standard care hospital treatment (non-intensive care) plus active mouthwash (experimental group AM/n = 20) or nonactive mouthwash (control group NAM/n = 21). The adjunct mouthwash intervention protocol used in both groups consisted one-minute gargling/rinsing / 5 times/day until hospital discharge. Groups were compared considering age, number of comorbidities, duration of symptoms prior admission and length of hospital stay (LOS). The associations between group and sex, age range, presence of comorbidities, admission to Intensive care unit (ICU) and death were also evaluated. The in vitro evaluation demonstrated that APD compound was highly effective for reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the 1.0 mg/mL (99.96%) to 0.125 mg/mL (92.65%) range without causing cytotoxicity. Regarding the clinical trial, the median LOS of the AM group was significantly shortened (4 days) compared with that of the NAM group (7 days) (p = 0.0314). Additionally, gargling/rinsing with APD was very helpful in reducing the severity of symptoms (no ICU care was needed) compared to not gargling/rinsing with APD (28.6% of the patients in the NAM group needed ICU care, and 50% of this ICU subgroup passed way, p = 0.0207). This study indicated that the mechanical action of the protocol involving mouthwash containing a compound with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 may reduce the symptoms of the patients and the spread of infection. The use of APD in a mouthwash as an adjuvant the hospital COVID-19 treatment presented no contraindication and reduced the hospital stay period.

RESULTS: For both macaque species, we uncovered thousands of novel isoforms for annotated genes and thousands of un-annotated intergenic transcripts enriched with non-coding RNAs. We also identified thousands of transcript sequences which are partially or completely ‘missing’ from current macaque genome assemblies. We showed that many newly identified transcripts were differentially expressed during SIV infection of rhesus macaques or during Ebola virus infection of cynomolgus macaques.

653566,Glycosylation of viral surface proteins probed by mass spectrometry,2019-06-13,"Since December 2019, the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread and overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide, urging physicians to understand how to manage this novel infection. Early in the pandemic, more severe forms of COVID-19 have been observed in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, who are often treated with renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockers, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but whether these are indeed independent risk factors is unknown. The cellular receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as for SARS-CoV(-1). Experimental data suggest that expression of ACE2 may be increased by RAAS-blockers, raising concerns that these drugs may facilitate viral cell entry. On the other hand, ACE2 is a key counter-regulator of the RAAS, by degrading angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7), and may thereby mediate beneficial effects in COVID-19. These considerations have raised concerns about the management of these drugs, and early comments shed vivid controversy among physicians. This review will describe the homeostatic balance between ACE-angiotensin II and ACE2-angiotensin (1-7) and summarize the pathophysiological rationale underlying the debated role of the RAAS and its modulators in the context of the pandemic. In addition, we will review available evidence investigating the impact of RAAS blockers on the course and prognosis of COVID-19 and discuss why retrospective observational studies should be interpreted with caution. These considerations highlight the importance of solid evidence-based data in order to guide physicians in the management of RAAS-interfering drugs in the general population as well as in patients with more or less severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gressens, Simon B.; Leftheriotis, Georges; Dussaule, Jean-Claude; Flamant, Martin; Levy, Bernard I.; Vidal-Petiot, Emmanuelle",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.624052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692701/,57

The critical focus in our case study is to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy on intubated COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A multicentric prospective observational study of 1890 COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy across 120 hospitals was conducted over 7 weeks in Spain (March 28 to May 15, 2020). Data were collected with an innovative approach: instant messaging via WhatsApp. Outcome measurements: complications, achieved weaning and decannulation and survival. RESULTS: We performed 1,461 surgical (81.3%) and 429 percutaneous tracheostomies. Median timing of tracheostomy was 12 days (4–42 days) since orotracheal intubation. A close follow-up of 1616/1890 (85.5%) patients at the cut-off time of 1-month follow-up showed that in 842 (52.1%) patients, weaning was achieved, while 391 (24.2%) were still under mechanical ventilation and 383 (23.7%) patients had died from COVID-19. Decannulation among those in whom weaning was successful (n = 842) was achieved in 683 (81%) patients. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy. The critical focus is the unprecedented amount of tracheostomies: 1890 in 7 weeks.

Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%，68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge.

655548,MARCH8 targets cytoplasmic lysine residues of various viral envelope glycoproteins,2021-04-21,"Chilblain‐like acral lesions have been identified in some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients. It has been suggested that these pseudo‐chilblains could be a specific marker of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. Most patients with these lesions have had negative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), but some authors believe serology tests are likely to give positive results. We designed a prospective study including all patients with pseudo‐chilblains treated in outpatient department in April and May 2020 and then performed SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR and serology tests on all available patients. We evaluated 59 patients, of whom 17 had undergone PCR before the study period, all with negative results. For the present study, we performed 20 additional PCRs, serology tests in 25 patients, and a parvovirus B19 antibody test in 15 patients. All results were negative. Our findings counter the hypothesis that serology is likely to reveal SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in patients with pseudo‐chilblains. One hypothesis for our negative results is that the time period between symptom onset and antibody production is longer in these patients; another is that the lesions are caused by behavioral changes during lockdown rather than SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We nevertheless maintain that COVID‐19 should be ruled out in people presenting with chilblain‐like lesions.","Docampo‐Simón, Alexandre; Sánchez‐Pujol, María José; Gimeno‐Gascon, Adelina; Palazón‐Cabanes, Juan Carlos; Juan‐Carpena, Gloria; Vergara‐De Caso, Eduardo; González‐Villanueva, Iris; Blanes‐Martínez, Mar; Betlloch‐Mas, Isabel",Dermatol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975345/; https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.14332,57

Whether rapid point-of-care antigen lateral flow devices (LFDs) detect most potential transmission sources despite imperfect clinical sensitivity is unknown. METHODS: We combined SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing data from England between 01-September-2020 and 28-February-2021. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate relationships between PCR-confirmed infection in contacts of community-diagnosed cases and index case viral load, S gene target failure (proxy for B.1.1.7 infection), demographics, SARS-CoV-2 incidence, social deprivation, and contact event type. We used LFD performance to simulate the proportion of cases with a PCR-positive contact expected to be detected using one of four LFDs. RESULTS: 231,498/2,474,066(9%) contacts of 1,064,004 index cases tested PCR-positive. PCR-positive results in contacts independently increased with higher case viral loads (lower Ct values) e.g., 11.7%(95%CI 11.5-12.0%) at Ct=15 and 4.5%(4.4-4.6%) at Ct=30. B.1.1.7 infection increased PCR-positive results by ~50%, (e.g. 1.55-fold, 95%CI 1.49-1.61, at Ct=20). PCR-positive results were most common in household contacts (at Ct=20.1, 8.7%[95%CI 8.6-8.9%]), followed by household visitors (7.1%[6.8-7.3%]), contacts at events/activities (5.2%[4.9-5.4%]), work/education (4.6%[4.4-4.8%]), and least common after outdoor contact (2.9%[2.3-3.8%]). Contacts of children were the least likely to test positive, particularly following contact outdoors or at work/education. The most and least sensitive LFDs would detect 89.5%(89.4-89.6%) and 83.0%(82.8-83.1%) of cases with PCR-positive contacts respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infectivity varies by case viral load, contact event type, and age. Those with high viral loads are the most infectious. B.1.1.7 increased transmission by ~50%. The best performing LFDs detect most infectious cases.","Lee, Lennard Y W; Rozmanowski, Stefan; Pang, Matthew; Charlett, Andre; Anderson, Charlotte; Hughes, Gareth J; Barnard, Matthew; Peto, Leon; Vipond, Richard; Sienkiewicz, Alex; Hopkins, Susan; Bell, John; Crook, Derrick W; Gent, Nick; Walker, A Sarah; Peto, Tim E A; Eyre, David W",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972994/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab421,57

Numerous ecological studies, plagued by methodological deficiencies, revealed a country-level association between BCG use and lower COVID-19 incidence and mortality. We aimed to determine whether BCG administered in early life decreased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adulthood and the severity of COVID-19. Methods This case-control study was conducted in Quebec, Canada. Cases were patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assay performed at two hospitals between March−October 2020. Controls were identified among patients with non-COVID-19 samples processed by the same microbiology laboratories during the same period. Enrolment was limited to individuals born in Quebec between 1956 and 1976, whose vaccine status was accessible in a computerized registry of 4.2 million BCG vaccinations. Results We recruited 920 cases and 2123 controls. Fifty-four percent of cases (n=424) and 53% of controls (n=1127) had received BCG during childhood (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.89−1.21), while 12% of cases (n=114) and 11% of controls (n=235) had received two or more BCG doses (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.88−1.46). After adjusting for age, sex, material deprivation, recruiting hospital and occupation there was no evidence of protection conferred by BCG against SARS-CoV-2 (AOR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.84−1.21). Among cases, 77 (8.4%) needed hospitalization and 18 (2.0%) died. The vaccinated were as likely as the unvaccinated to require hospitalization (AOR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.62−1.67) or to die (AOR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.32−2.39). Conclusions BCG does not provide long-term protection against symptomatic COVID-19 or severe forms of the disease.","Pépin, Jacques; Labbé, Annie-Claude; Carignan, Alex; Parent, Marie-Elise; Yu, Jennifer; Grenier, Cynthia; Beauchemin, Stéphanie; De Wals, Philippe; Valiquette, Louis; Rousseau, Marie-Claude",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21010392?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493410/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21010392; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.019,57

656843,QSAR Models for Predicting Cathepsin B Inhibition by Small Molecules: Continuous and Binary QSAR Models to Classify Cathepsin B Inhibition Activities of Small Molecules,2010-06-01,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility. IMPORTANCE Reporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, Felix; Neufeldt, Christoper J; Cerikan, Berati; Prasad, Vibhu; Pape, Costantin; Laketa, Vibor; Ruggieri, Alessia; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Cortese, Mirko",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276683,57

We reviewed original research on occupational health and safety of animal workers published from January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019, with a targeted focus on infectious disease studies published in these populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies focused on occupational exposures to infectious agents, dust and allergens, pesticides, and occupational injury. Research on zoonotic MRSA used whole genome–sequencing technologies to evaluate transmission in Africa and Asia. Swine worker exposure to porcine coronavirus and emerging influenza A viruses was documented in China. 16s RNA amplicon sequencing identified distinct microbiota compositions in households with active animal farmers. Multiple bioaerosol exposures were assessed for industrial dairy workers. Occupational injury studies highlighted the struggles of Latino animal workers in the USA. SUMMARY: These studies highlighted the global expansion of zoonotic antibiotic resistance and identified novel occupational zoonoses of concern. The integration of microbiome assessment and compound mixtures into the evaluation of dust and endotoxin exposures for animal workers marks a new direction for this work.","Dignard, Caroline; Leibler, Jessica H.",Curr Environ Health Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31823248/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40572-019-00253-5,57

RSA59 induced neuropathology is partially caused by activation of CNS resident microglia, as demonstrated by changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of a microglia/macrophage specific calcium ion binding factor, Iba1. Affymetrix Microarray analysis for mRNA expression data reveals expression of inflammatory mediators that are known to be released by activated microglia. Microglia-specific cell surface molecules, including CD11b, CD74, CD52 and CD68, are significantly upregulated in contrast to CD4, CD8 and CD19. Protein analysis of spinal cord extracts taken from mice 6 days post-inoculation, the time of peak inflammation, reveals robust expression of IFN-γ, IL-12 and mKC. Data suggest that activated microglia and inflammatory mediators contribute to a local CNS microenvironment that regulates viral replication and IFN-γ production during the acute phase of infection, which in turn can cause phagolysosome maturation and phagocytosis of the myelin sheath, leading to demyelination.","Chatterjee, Dhriti; Addya, Sankar; Khan, Reas S.; Kenyon, Lawrence C.; Choe, Alexander; Cohrs, Randall J.; Shindler, Kenneth S.; Sarma, Jayasri Das",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25360880/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111351,57
657352,"Ecosystem simplification, biodiversity loss and plant virus emergence",2015-01-29,"PURPOSE: The aim of this work was to evaluate the dosimetric impact of high-resolution thorax CT during COVID-19 outbreak in the University Hospital of Parma. In two months we have performed a huge number of thorax CT scans collecting effective and equivalent organ doses and evaluating also the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of lung and other major cancers. MATERIALS AND METHOD: From February 24(th) to April 28(th), 3224 high-resolution thorax CT were acquired. For all patients we have examined the volumetric computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol), the dose length product (DLP), the size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) and effective dose (E(103)) using a dose tracking software (Radimetrics Bayer HealthCare). From the equivalent dose to organs for each patient, LAR for lung and major cancers were estimated following the method proposed in BEIR VII which considers age and sex differences. RESULTS: Study population included 3224 patients, 1843 male and 1381 female, with an average age of 67 years. The average CTDIvol, SSDE and DLP, and E(103) were 6.8 mGy, 8.7 mGy, 239 mGy·cm and 4.4 mSv respectively. The average LAR of all solid cancers was 2.1 cases per 10000 patients, while the average LAR of leukemia was 0.2 cases per 10000 patients. For both male and female the organ with a major cancer risk was lung. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impressive increment in thoracic CT examinations due to COVID-19 outbreak, the high resolution low dose protocol used in our hospital guaranteed low doses and very low risk estimation in terms of LAR.","Ghetti, C.; Ortenzia, O.; Maddalo, M.; Altabella, L.; Sverzellati, N.",Phys Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1120179720302611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33171381/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.10.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1120179720302611?v=s5,57

For this purpose, the accuracy of the existing tests had to be improved and suitable means for removal of extraneous molecules had to be established. Six radioactive probes were used to obtain adequate detection signals. These probes, containing the complete N and E1 gene sequences and other sequences, hybridized to about 1 4 of the total length of the viral RNA. Genomic RNA could be detected after direct spotting of samples, but prior Freo-nextraction or centrifugation of specimens on a cushion of sucrose improved considerably the positive identification of virus containing samples. RNA detection in positive clinical specimens was significantly better by hybridization than immunological detection of BCV by ELISA, although differences were slight after two passages of the virus on HRT-18 cell monolayers. Consequently, the reliability of positive and negative test results in hybridization tests on Freon extracted specimens was better than in ELISA. However, results after extraction with other organic solvents were inferior. The accuracy of ELISA was surpassed by hybridization assays. Background signals, due to vector homology were found to be negligible in all the samples analyzed.","Verbeek, Arnold; Dea, Serge; Tijssen, Peter",Molecular and Cellular Probes,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/089085089090012O; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2366761/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089085089090012O,57

Although a variety of locating devices are commercially available, their adoption has remained low in the past years. Several studies have explored barriers to the adoption of assistive technologies from the perspective of professional stakeholders, but in-depth explorations for locating technologies are sparse. Additionally, the inputs of business professionals are lacking. The aim of this study was to expand knowledge on barriers to the adoption of locating technologies from a multi-stakeholder professional perspective, and to explore strategies to optimize adoption. METHODS: In total, 22 professionals working in business (n = 7), healthcare (n = 6) and research (n = 9) fields related to gerontology and gerontechnology participated in our focus group study. Perceptions on the value of using locating technologies for dementia care, barriers to their adoption, as well as salient services and information dissemination strategies were explored. After verbatim transcription, transcripts were analysed following an inductive data-driven content analysis approach in MAXQDA. RESULTS: Six key adoption barriers centering on: (1) awareness-, (2) technological-, (3) product characteristic- and (4) capital investment-based limitations, (5) unclear benefits, as well as (6) ethical concerns emerged. The interplay between barriers was high. Five core themes on services and information dissemination strategies centering on: (1) digital autonomy support, (2) emergency support, (3) information dissemination actors, (4) product acquisition, and (5) product advertising were extracted. CONCLUSIONS: Our study with interdisciplinary stakeholders expands knowledge on barriers to the adoption of locating technologies for dementia care, and reinforces recommendations that an interdisciplinary strategy is needed to optimize adoption. Also, our findings show that focusing on services to increase digital autonomy and on information dissemination strategies has been largely overlooked and may be particularly effective.

However, meta-analyses show unclear results leading to uncertainty regarding the safety of PPI use during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a nationwide observational study including all SARS-CoV-2 cases (n=83,224) in Denmark as of December 1, 2020. The association of current PPI use with risk of infection was examined in a case-control design. We investigated the risk of severe outcomes, including mechanical ventilation, ICU admission or death, in current PPI users (n=4,473) compared to never users. Propensity score matching was applied to control for confounding. Finally, we performed an updated meta-analysis on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality attributable to PPI use. Results Current PPI use was associated with increased risk of infection; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13). Among SARS-CoV-2 cases, PPI use was associated with increased risk of hospital admission; adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.13 (1.03-1.24), but not with other severe outcomes. The updated meta-analysis showed no association between PPI use and risk of infection or mortality; pooled OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.75-1.32) and RR 1.33 (95% CI 0.71-2.48). Conclusion Current PPI use may be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission, but these results with minimally elevated estimates are most likely subject to residual confounding. No association was found for severe outcomes. The results from the meta-analysis indicated no impact of current PPI use on COVID-19 outcomes.","Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Ernst, Martin Thomsen; Lundh, Andreas; Lundbo, Lene Fogt; Sandholdt, Håkon; Hallas, Jesper; Benfield, Thomas",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356521005140?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2021.05.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1542356521005140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989790/,57

In this article, we used the human protein–protein interactions (PPIs), disease genes with their classifications and embryo development genes and reconstructed a human disease-embryo development network to investigate the relationship between disease genes and embryo development genes. We found that disease genes and embryo development genes are prone to connect with each other. Furthermore, diseases can be categorized into three groups according to the closeness with embryo development in gene overlapping, interacting pattern in PPI network and co-regulated by microRNAs or transcription factors. Embryo development high-related disease genes show their closeness with embryo development at least in three biological levels. But it is not for embryo development medium-related disease genes and embryo development low-related disease genes. We also found that embryo development high-related disease genes are more central than other disease genes in the human PPI network. In addition, the results show that embryo development high-related disease genes tend to be essential genes compared with other diseases’ genes. This network-based approach could provide evidence for the intricate correlation between disease process and embryo development, and help to uncover potential mechanisms of human complex diseases.","Gong, Binsheng; Liu, Tao; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Chen, Xi; Li, Jiang; Lv, Hongchao; Zou, Yi; Li, Xia; Rao, Shaoqi",J Theor Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.07.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311003687; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519311003687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21824480/,57

Methods: We implement a three-step approach for SARS-CoV-2 detection and quantification that employs reverse transcription, targeted cDNA preamplification and nano-scale qPCR based on the Fluidigm 192.24 microfluidic chip. We validate the method using both positive controls and nasopharyngeal swab samples. Results: Using SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA and plasmid controls, we demonstrate that the addition of a preamplification step enhances the LoD of the Fluidigm method by 1,000-fold, enabling detection below 1 copy/l. We applied this method to analyze 182 clinical NP swab samples previously diagnosed using a standard RT-qPCR protocol (91 positive, 91 negative) and demonstrate reproducible detection of SARS-CoV-2 over five orders of magnitude (< 1 to 106 viral copies/l). Crucially, we detect SARS-CoV-2 with relatively low viral load estimates (<1 to 40 viral copies/l) in 17 samples with negative clinical diagnosis, indicating a potential false negative rate of 18.7% by clinical diagnostic procedures. Conclusion: The three-step nano-scale RT-qPCR method can robustly detect SARS-CoV-2 in samples with relatively low viral loads (< 1 viral copy/l) and has the potential to reduce the false negative rate of standard RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.","Xie, X.; Gjorgjieva, T.; Attieh, Z.; Dieng, M.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, retrospective, and observational study. All cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-qPCR of patients seen at the hospital (emergency room, first-aid room, and ICU) were analyzed. The severity of the cases was classified according to the Chinese Consensus. RESULTS: Among the 115 children included, a predominance of boys (57%) was verified, and the median age was two years. A total of 22 children were hospitalized, 12 in the ICU. Of the total, 26% had comorbidities with a predominance of asthma (13%). Fever, cough, and nasal discharge were the most frequent symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 58% of children and gastrointestinal symptoms, by 34%. Three children were asymptomatic, 81 (70%) had upper airway symptoms, 15 (13%) had mild pneumonia, and 16 (14%) had severe pneumonia. Hospitalized children were younger than non-hospitalized children (7 months vs. 36 months). In hospitalized patients, a higher frequency of irritability, dyspnea, drowsiness, respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation, and hepatomegaly was observed. Chest radiography was performed in 69 children with 45% of abnormal exams. No child required mechanical ventilation and there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Most of children and adolescents affected by COVID-19 had mild upper airway symptoms. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 were more severe among younger children who exhibited gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms more frequently.","Rabha, Anna Clara; de Oliveira, Francisco Ivanildo; de Oliveira, Thales Araújo; Cesar, Regina Grigolli; Fongaro, Giuliana; Mariano, Roberta Ferreira; Camargo, Clarice Neves; Fernandes, Fátima Rodrigues; Wandalsen, Gustavo Falbo",Rev Paul Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263697/; https://doi.org/10.1590/1984-0462/2021/39/2020305,57

While there is an abundance of literature documenting corticosteroid related osteonecrosis, there is no consensus as to the relative risk of osteonecrosis after administration of steroids via parenteral, oral, topical, inhaled and other routes. This risk is an important prognostic indicator because identification and conservative intervention can potentially reduce morbidity associated with aggressive surgical treatment of osteonecrosis. This paper provides insight into establishing guidelines related to the risk of developing osteonecrosis as a result of corticosteroid use. Case studies, retrospective studies and prospective studies in humans on different corticosteroids and varied dosages were assessed. Most cases of osteonecrosis are secondary to systemically administered corticosteroids and/or high dose daily therapy, particularly in patients with underlying comorbidities including connective tissue diseases, hyperlipidemia, or previous trauma. Previous case reports of osteonecrosis related to inhaled or topical use of steroids are complicated by the fact that in the great majority of cases, the patients are also treated with systemic steroids prior to the development of osteonecrosis. Based on the literature, a set of recommendations regarding the risk of osteonecrosis in patients on steroids was formulated.","Powell, Christian; Chang, Christopher; Naguwa, Stanley M.; Cheema, Gurtej; Gershwin, M.

Methods We used a retrospective, cross-sectional, multicenter design to analyze the medical records of patients who visited six training hospitals in Daegu (August 21-September 8, 2020). For comparison, control period 1 was set as the same period in the previous year (August 21-September 8, 2019) and control period 2 was set as July 1-19, 2020. Patient characteristics including age, sex, and time of ED visit were investigated along with mode of arrival, length of ED stay, and in-hospital mortality. The experimental and control groups were compared using t-tests, and Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square test, and Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Univariate logistic regression was performed to identify significant factors, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results During the study period, 31,357 patients visited the ED, of which 7,749 belonged to the experimental group. Control periods 1 and 2 included 13,100 and 10,243 patients, respectively. No significant in-hospital mortality differences were found between study periods; however, the results showed statistically significant differences in the length of ED stay. Conclusion The ED resident strike did not influence the mortality rate of patients who visited the EDs of six training hospitals in Daegu. Furthermore, the number of patients admitted and the length of ED stay decreased during the strike period.","Cho, Yo Han; Cho, Jae Wan; Ryoo, Hyun Wook; Moon, Sungbae; Kim, Jung Ho; Lee, Sang-Hun; Jang, Tae Chang; Lee, Dong Eun",Yeungnam University journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411473/; https://doi.org/10.12701/yujm.2021.01130,57
662219,Molecular identification and transcriptional regulation of porcine IFIT2 gene,2018-04-06,"Abstract The 5′-ends of the genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs of murine coronavirus (MHV) have a stretch of approximately 70 nucleotides of leader sequences. The 3'-region of this leader sequence contains several repeats of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA), whose number varies among different MHV strains. It has been demonstrated that this UCUAA repeat plays crucial roles in the discontinuous transcription of MHV mRNAs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the number of UCUAA repeats in the leader sequence of MHV genome rapidly decreases during serial passages of viruses on susceptible cells. The downward evolution of the number of UCUAA repeats was not due to a higher growth rate of the viruses with fewer repeats, but seemed to be due to homologous interference between viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeat. The ease with which these variant viruses arose suggests the high frequency of the occurrence of this deletion during RNA replication. This finding is in agreement with the proposed discontinuous and nonprocessive mode of coronavirus RNA synthesis. Analysis of the intracellular subgenomic mRNA species of viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeats and of MHV recombinant viruses suggests that the number of this pentanucleotide repeat at the 3′-end of the leader sequence may regulate the synthesis of certain mRNA species, in agreement with the leader-primed transcription mechanism.","Makino, Shinji; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289900603; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289900603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2538033/,57

662571,"Gene expression analyses in Atlantic salmon challenged with infectious salmon anemia virus reveal differences between individuals with early, intermediate and late mortality",2008-04-18,"Since the discovery of HIV-1, the viral capsid has been recognized to have an important role as a structural protein that holds the viral genome, together with viral proteins essential for viral life cycle, such as the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the integrase (IN). The reverse transcription process takes place between the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the host cell, thus the Reverse Transcription Complexes (RTCs)/Pre-integration Complexes (PICs) are hosted in intact or partial cores. Early biochemical assays failed to identify the viral CA associated to the RTC/PIC, possibly due to the stringent detergent conditions used to fractionate the cells or to isolate the viral complexes. More recently, it has been observed that some host partners of capsid, such as Nup153 and CPSF6, can only bind multimeric CA proteins organized in hexamers. Those host factors are mainly located in the nuclear compartment, suggesting the entrance of the viral CA as multimeric structure inside the nucleus. Recent data show CA complexes within the nucleus having a different morphology from the cytoplasmic ones, clearly highlighting the remodeling of the viral cores during nuclear translocation. Thus, the multimeric CA complexes lead the viral genome into the host nuclear compartment, piloting the intranuclear journey of HIV-1 in order to successfully replicate. The aim of this review is to discuss and analyze the main discoveries to date that uncover the viral capsid as a key player in the reverse transcription and PIC maturation until the viral DNA integration into the host genome.","Scoca, Viviana; Di Nunzio, Francesca",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578999/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020273,57

Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey conducted in Brazil between June and September, 2020, during which time social distancing measures were in place. Results: Participants (n = 629) were aged 34.0 years and mostly within normal weight according to BMI (60.4%). “Snacking” and “liking” associated with increased energy (β = 164.27 and β = 110.24) and carbohydrate intake (β = 1.97 and β = 1.80), and with reduced protein intake (β = −1.54 and β = −1.18). In contrast, “dieting” and “weight control” associated with reduced energy (β = −162.57 and β = −111.49) and carbohydrate intake (β = −2.78 and β = −2.07), and with increased protein intake (β = 3.78 and β = 1.65). “Dieting” (β = 7.27), “need and hunger” (β = 3.34), and “health” (β = 4.94) associated with an increased consumption of unprocessed and minimally processed foods, whereas “replacing main meals with snacks” (β = −8.98), “snacking” (β = −6.92) and binge eating symptoms (β = −0.34) associated with reduced consumption of foods within this processing level.

The Young Group of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) developed the first international survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in nuclear medicine (NM). The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary report of the ongoing survey. METHODS: A questionnaire of thirty questions was prepared for all NM professionals addressing three main issues: (1) new scheduling praxes for NM diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, (2) assistance of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and (3) prevention of COVID-19 spreading in the departments. An invitation to the survey was sent to the corresponding authors of NM scientific papers indexed in SCOPUS in 2019. Personal data were analysed per individual responder. Organisation data were evaluated per single department. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ninety-six individual responders from 220 departments were evaluated. Most of the responders were from Europe (199/296, 67%). Approximately, all departments already changed their scheduling praxes due to the pandemic (213/220, 97%). In most departments, scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were allowed but quantitatively reduced (112/220, 51%). A significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (more than 20%) affected 198/220 (90%) and 158/220 (72%) departments, respectively. Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%). Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%). Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%). CONCLUSIONS: According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals. New praxes for NM procedures, assistance, and prevention of COVID-19 have been applied during the pandemic.","Annunziata, Salvatore; Bauckneht, Matteo; Albano, Domenico; Argiroffi, Giovanni; Calabrò, Diletta; Abenavoli, Elisabetta; Linguanti, Flavia; Laudicella, Riccardo",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-04874-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32462398/,57

However, it is unknown if coronaviruses evolve to escape such immunity, and if so, how rapidly. Here we address this question by characterizing the historical evolution of human coronavirus 229E. We identify human sera from the 1980s and 1990s that have neutralizing titers against contemporaneous 229E that are comparable to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We test these sera against 229E strains isolated after sera collection, and find that neutralizing titers are lower against these “future” viruses. In some cases, sera that neutralize contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers >1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains isolated 8–17 years later. The decreased neutralization of “future” viruses is due to antigenic evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain. If these results extrapolate to other coronaviruses, then it may be advisable to periodically update SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Eguia, Rachel; Crawford, Katharine H.

METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative historical data analysis. Total Risk Assessment (TRA) evaluation tool was used to assess the pre-pandemic stage risks, pandemic threshold fast responsiveness, and the ongoing performance until plateau. The Infected Patient Ratio (IPR) tool was developed to measure the number of patients resulting from 1 infector during the incubation period. Both IPR and TRA were used together to forecast inflection points, plateau phases, intensive care units’ and ventilators’ breakpoints, and the Total Fatality Ratio. RESULTS: In Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the United States, an inflection point is predicted within the first 15 d of April, to arrive at a plateau after another 30 to 80 d. Variations in IPR drop are expected due to variations in lockdown timing by each country, the extent of adherence to it, and the number of performed tests in each.

IBV E, a viral envelope protein, plays a role in virus budding, possibly by altering membrane morphology at the virus assembly site. In addition to this role, IBV E may also function as a viroporin, although no data from infected cells have confirmed this possibility definitively. Conversely, the IBV 3a and IBV 3b proteins are nonstructural proteins. These proteins are dispensable for replication in cell culture, but are thought to be important for infection of the natural host.

Our research aimed to investigate the relationship between perceived stress and emotional distress during the initial outbreak. Furthermore, potential risk and protective factors, i.e., coping and boredom proneness, of stress-related emotional distress were also explored. Data from 3233 participants in China were collected through an online survey platform during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 from January 31 to February 9 in 2020. The results showed that higher perceived stress was associated with more emotional distress including depression, fear, compulsion-anxiety, neurasthenia, and hypochondria.

Moreover, coping style moderated the stress-emotional distress relationship, i.e., individuals who mainly adopted positive coping strategies suffered fewer symptoms of depression, compulsion-anxiety, and neurasthenia under stress, while negative coping strategies aggravated emotional distress.

To disrupt the widespread of COVID-19, a mechanism for social distancing is indispensable. Also, to predict the effectiveness and quantity of social distancing for a particular social network, with a certain contagion, a generalized model is needed. In this manuscript, we propose a social distancing mediated generalized model to predict the pandemic spread of COVID-19. By considering growth rate as a temporal harmonic function damped with social distancing in generalized Richard model and by using the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, USA and India, we find that, with time, the cumulative spread grows more rapidly due to weak social distancing as compared to the stronger social distancing, where it is explicitly decreasing. Furthermore, we predict the possible outcomes with various social distancing scenarios by considering highest growth rate as an initial state, and illustrate that the increase in social distancing tremendously decreases growth rate, even it tends to reach zero in lockdown regimes. Our findings not only provide epidemic growth scenarios as a function of social distancing but also provide a modified growth model to predict controlled information flow in any network.","Yasir, Kashif Ammar; Liu, Wu-Ming",Nonlinear Dyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06424-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33867677/,57

The widespread use of antifungals in both modern medicine and agriculture has resulted in concomitant resistance in species, where zoonotic transfer poses a risk to public health. Studies described herein assess the resistance of pathogenic species isolated from companion animals to a battery of conventional antimicrobial agents. Levels of resistance were detected using recognised in vitro methods, where additional novel therapeutic and biocide options were also extensively investigated. Results show high levels of resistance to the three main families of antifungal agents, namely caspofungin, Amp B and fluconazole. Resistance in Candida, Cryptococcal, Aspergillus and Trichophyton species is described herein, highlighting the need for defined species-specific antifungal breakpoints, and for Malassezia and Wickerhamomyces anomalus species which also have zoonotic potential.

665613,Nanopore Assay Reveals Cell-Type-Dependent Gene Expression of Vesicular Stomatitis Indiana Virus and Differential Host Cell Response,2021-09-15,"Entrepreneurial failure is prevalent, and particularly when the COVID−19 crisis exacerbates the economic recession, it becomes even more prevalent. Entrepreneurs experience an intensive emotional crisis when their ventures fail, and this deleterious impact, including stress and emotional pain, may prevent failed entrepreneurs (FEs) from restarting; hence, how they cope with failure has received increased attention in recent years. However, most of the extant literature focuses on success rather than failure, and there is very limited literature on how FEs cope with the psychological and emotional crisis caused by failure. This study focuses on FEs’ use of optimism and defensive pessimism as coping strategies within the mental simulation theory with respect to their re-entry intentions. It examines the impact of career ambition and public self-awareness on optimism, of the fear of failure (FoF) and self-doubt, on defensive pessimism, and of coping humor as a moderator. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the data of 277 Korean FEs who have actual entrepreneurial failure experiences and actively prepared for their re-entry. The results show that career ambitions and public self-awareness have an impact on optimism, and FoF and self-doubt lead to defensive pessimism. Coping humor also has a moderating effect on the path from defensive pessimism to the intention to re-enter. This study advances the literature on coping mechanisms that FEs employ to manage the negative impact of failure and prepare for their subsequent re-entry. Its theoretical model, based on the mental simulation theory combined with social comparison theory, provides a possible integrative framework that includes both the pervasively held view of entrepreneurs’ optimism related to overconfidence and their defensive pessimism related to their vulnerability due to their ventures’ failure. Thus, this study makes theoretical contributions to the literature of entrepreneurial failure, as well as practical implications for policymakers and educators who assist FEs in successfully coping with entrepreneurial failure and re-entry.","Hwang, Kumju; Choi, Jinsook",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209218/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137021,57

So far, various technical, formal, and organizational challenges help back the development of digitally automated real-time systems with scientific quality standards. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed sustainable system developments since it began in early 2020. This article describes how a real-time data system should be structured so that automated data processing is possible.

668311,Evolutionary Signatures Governing the Codon Usage Bias in Coronaviruses and Their Implications for Viruses Infecting Various Bat Species,2021-09-16,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 currently poses a global public health threat. Although Tokyo, Japan, is no exception to this, it was initially affected by only a small-level epidemic. Nevertheless, medical collapse nearly happened since no predictive methods were available to assess infection counts. A standard susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemiological model has been widely used, but its applicability is limited often to the early phase of an epidemic in the case of a large collective population. A full numerical simulation of the entire period from beginning until end would be helpful for understanding COVID-19 trends in (separate) counts of inpatient and infectious cases and can also aid the preparation of hospital beds and development of quarantine strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an epidemiological model that considers the isolation period to simulate a comprehensive trend of the initial epidemic in Tokyo that yields separate counts of inpatient and infectious cases. It was also intended to induce important corollaries of governing equations (ie, effective reproductive number) and equations for the final count. METHODS: Time-series data related to SARS-CoV-2 from February 28 to May 23, 2020, from Tokyo and antibody testing conducted by the Japanese government were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on a discrete delay differential equation (apparent time-lag model [ATLM]) was introduced. The model can predict trends in inpatient and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new confirmed cases, cumulative infections, inpatients, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test positivity ratios were used to verify the model. This approach also derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model. RESULTS: In a typical parameter setting, the present ATLM provided 20% less infectious cases in the field compared to the standard SIR model prediction owing to isolation. The basic reproductive number was inferred as 2.30 under the condition that the time lag T from infection to detection and isolation is 14 days. Based on this, an adequate vaccine ratio to avoid an outbreak was evaluated for 57% of the population. We assessed the date (May 23) that the government declared a rescission of the state of emergency. Taking into consideration the number of infectious cases in the field, a date of 1 week later (May 30) would have been most effective. Furthermore, simulation results with a shorter time lag of T=7 and a larger transmission rate of α=1.43α0 suggest that infections at large should reduce by half and inpatient numbers should be similar to those of the first wave of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using SARS-CoV-2 data for Tokyo. The simulation agreed with data from the beginning of the pandemic. Shortening the period from infection to hospitalization is effective against outbreaks without rigorous public health interventions and control.","Utamura, Motoaki; Koizumi, Makoto; Kirikami, Seiichi",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/23624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259325/,57

By contrast, the role of rotavirus as a pathogen in adults has long been underappreciated. Spread by faecal-oral transmission, rotavirus infection in adults typically manifests with nausea, malaise, headache, abdominal cramping, diarrhoea, and fever. Infection can also be symptomless. Rotavirus infection in immuno-compromised adults can have a variable course from symptomless to severe and sustained infection. Common epidemiological settings for rotavirus infection among adults include endemic disease, epidemic outbreak, travel-related infection, and disease resulting from child-to-adult transmission. Limited diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives are available for adults with suspected rotavirus infection. Because symptoms are generally self-limiting, supportive care is the rule. Clinicians caring for adults with gastroenteritis should consider rotavirus in the differential diagnosis. In this review we intend to familiarise clinicians who primarily provide care for adult patients with the salient features of rotavirus pathophysiology, clinical presentation, epidemiology, treatment, and prevention.","Anderson, Evan J; Weber, Stephen G",Lancet Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309904009284; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309904009284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14871633/,57
669685,Coronavirus Genome Structure and Replication,2005,"Novel mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been authorized for emergency use. Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, data on mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses are mostly limited to serological analyses. Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses. These findings also highlight the utility of defining cellular responses in addition to serologies and may inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.","Goel, Rishi R.; Apostolidis, Sokratis A.; Painter, Mark M.; Mathew, Divij; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Kuthuru, Oliva; Gouma, Sigrid; Hicks, Philip; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M.; Dysinger, Sarah; Lundgreen, Kendall A.; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Adamski, Sharon; Hicks, Amanda; Korte, Scott; Oldridge, Derek A.; Baxter, Amy E.; Giles, Josephine R.; Weirick, Madison E.; McAllister, Christopher M.; Dougherty, Jeanette; Long, Sherea; D’Andrea, Kurt; Hamilton, Jacob T.; Betts, Michael R.; Luning Prak, Eline T.; Bates, Paul; Hensley, Scott E.; Greenplate, Allison R.; Wherry, E.

669704,Virion-Liposome Interactions Identify a Cholesterol-Independent Coronavirus Entry Stage,2006,"Changeux et al. recently suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein may interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Such interactions may be involved in pathology and infectivity. Here, we use molecular simulations of validated atomically detailed structures of nAChRs, and of the S protein, to investigate this ‘nicotinic hypothesis’. We examine the binding of the Y674-R685 loop of the S protein to three nAChRs, namely the human α4β2 and α7 subtypes and the muscle-like αβγδ receptor from Tetronarce californica. Our results indicate that Y674-R685 has affinity for nAChRs and the region responsible for binding contains the PRRA motif, a four-residue insertion not found in other SARS-like coronaviruses. In particular, R682 has a key role in the stabilisation of the complexes as it forms interactions with loops A, B and C in the receptor’s binding pocket. The conformational behaviour of the bound Y674-R685 region is highly dependent on the receptor subtype, adopting extended conformations in the α4β2 and α7 complexes and more compact ones when bound to the muscle-like receptor. In the α4β2 and αβγδ complexes, the interaction of Y674-R685 with the receptors forces the loop C region to adopt an open conformation similar to other known nAChR antagonists. In contrast, in the α7 complex, Y674-R685 penetrates deeply into the binding pocket where it forms interactions with the residues lining the aromatic box, namely with TrpB, TyrC1 and TyrC2. Estimates of binding energy suggest that Y674-R685, forms stable complexes with all three nAChR subtypes, but has highest affinity for the muscle-type receptor. Analyses of the simulations of the full-length S protein show that the Y674-R685 region is accessible for binding, and suggest a potential binding orientation of the S protein with nAChRs.","Oliveira, A.

The HCWs were asked to report adverse reactions through a mobile self-report questionnaire for three days after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 7,625 HCWs received the first dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine during the study period. Of them, 5,866 (76.9%) HCWs (ChAdOx1, n = 5,589 [95.3%]; BNT162b2, n = 277 [4.7%]) participated at least once in the survey, of whom 77% were female and 86% were younger than 50 years. The overall adverse reaction rate was 93% in the ChAdOx1 group and 80% in the BNT162b2 group (P < 0.001).

Then, a multi-period, multi-product, multi-objective, and multi-echelon mixed-integer linear programming model for the current network is formulated and designed. Formulating a new MILP model to design a sustainable-resilience healthcare network during the COVID-19 pandemic and developing three hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms are among the most important contributions of this research. In order to estimate the values of the required demand for medicines, the simulation approach is employed. To cope with uncertain parameters, stochastic chance-constraint programming is proposed. This paper also proposed three meta-heuristic methods including Multi-Objective Teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find Pareto solutions. Since heuristic approaches are sensitive to input parameters, the Taguchi approach is suggested to control and tune the parameters. A comparison is performed by using eight assessment metrics to validate the quality of the obtained Pareto frontier by the heuristic methods on the experiment problems. To validate the current model, a set of sensitivity analysis on important parameters and a real case study in the United States are provided. Based on the empirical experimental results, computational time and eight assessment metrics proposed methodology seems to work well for the considered problems. The results show that by raising the transportation costs, the total cost and the environmental impacts of sustainability increased steadily and the trend of the social responsibility of staff rose gradually between − 20 and 0%, but, dropped suddenly from 0 to + 20%. Also in terms of the on-resiliency of the proposed network, the trends climbed slightly and steadily.

669944,Development of a robust Escherichia coli-based cell-free protein synthesis application platform,2020-10-17,"Introduction Nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion is essential for enteral feeding but can potentially cause significant injury to the lungs (1). Following a critical incident, we audited our practice of NGT insertion and the consequences of injury in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 caused by the (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Methods NGT insertion followed a local standard safety protocol and were inserted by consultants or senior registrars in anaesthesia and critical care medicine, or advanced critical care practitioners. Individual practitioners were able to choose their technique of insertion. All patients had their post-NGT insertion chest x-ray reviewed and those with misplaced NGTs had their case notes reviewed. Early in the outbreak, blind insertion was recommended in our institution to reduce aerosolisation, this was rapidly changed to direct visualisation with laryngoscopy as our experience managing SARS-CoV-2 patients increased. Results During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a total of 135 NGTs were inserted into ventilated and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients. All of NGTs positioned were confirmed by a chest radiograph. Eleven (8.1%) were inadvertently endobronchial, of which four developed pneumothoraces (figure 1). Three patients (including both who had received ECMO) died and a fourth is currently undergoing a prolonged respiratory wean. No patients were fed or received drugs via a misplaced NGT. Chest radiograph of patient with inadvertent NGT placement in right lower lobe. Note the path of the tube suggests breech of the bronchial tree and direct injury to the lung parenchyma (arrowhead). A CT the following day showed a large pneumothorax (arrowhead), some haemothorax (black arrow) and severe ground glass changes consistent with SARS-CoV-2 (white arrow). Discussion Our inadvertent endobronchial NGT rate is relatively high, compared to our previous clinical experience, which we believe may be related to the challenges of working with cumbersome personal protective equipment and/or changed practice to attempt to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (2). We suspect the lung parenchyma is particularly fragile in acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to the high rate of pleural breech and subsequent poor outcome (3). We recommend experienced operators place NGTs and do so using direct or videolaryngoscopy to minimise the risk of incorrect placement.

Because COVID-19 infection is associated with a devastating mortality rate and myriad complications, it is critical that clinicians better understand its pathophysiology to develop effective treatment. Cumulative evidence is suggestive of cerebral aneurysms being intertwined with the hyperinflammatory state and hypercytokinemia observed in severe COVID-19 infections.

The patient develops high-grade fever of 39.8° C, decreased oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and an extensive spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the basal cisterns from a ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm. In case example 2, the patient presents with a positive PCR test for COVID-19 2 weeks prior with spontaneous SAH and found to have a large multilobulated bulbous ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. Both patients’ symptoms and high-grade fever are consistent with hypercytokinemia and a hyperinflammatory state, with elevated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, M1P1A, and tumor necrosis factor-α inflammatory mediators found to be elevated in COVID-19 intensive care unit admissions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 effect on cerebral aneurysms requires future studies to clearly delineate correlation, however, hypercytokinemia and a hyperinflammatory state are strongly implicated to cause degenerative vascular changes that may predispose patients to cerebral aneurysm formation, change in size or morphology, and resultant aneurysm rupture.","Fiani, Brian; Fowler, James B.; Figueras, Ryan Arthur; Hessamian, Keon; Mercado, Nathan; Vukcevich, Olivia; Singh, Manpreet Kaur",Surg Neurol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084615/; https://doi.org/10.25259/sni_214_2021,57
670384,Structural insights into SARS coronavirus proteins,2005-11-02,"Bone remodeling is tightly controlled by osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Fine tuning of the osteoclast–osteoblast balance results in strict synchronization of bone resorption and formation, which maintains structural integrity and bone tissue homeostasis; in contrast, dysregulated bone remodeling may cause pathological osteolysis, in which inflammation plays a vital role in promoting bone destruction. The alveolar bone presents high turnover rate, complex associations with the tooth and periodontium, and susceptibility to oral pathogenic insults and mechanical stress, which enhance its complexity in host defense and bone remodeling. Alveolar bone loss is also involved in systemic bone destruction and is affected by medication or systemic pathological factors. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the osteoimmunological mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of alveolar bone remodeling. The inflammasome is a supramolecular protein complex assembled in response to pattern recognition receptors and damage-associated molecular patterns, leading to the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of inflammatory responses. Pyroptosis downstream of inflammasome activation also facilitates the clearance of intracellular pathogens and irritants. However, inadequate or excessive activity of the inflammasome may allow for persistent infection and infection spreading or uncontrolled destruction of the alveolar bone, as commonly observed in periodontitis, periapical periodontitis, peri-implantitis, orthodontic tooth movement, medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, nonsterile or sterile osteomyelitis of the jaw, and osteoporosis. In this review, we present a framework for understanding the role and mechanism of canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes in the pathogenesis and development of etiologically diverse diseases associated with alveolar bone loss. Inappropriate inflammasome activation may drive alveolar osteolysis by regulating cellular players, including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, periodontal ligament cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and adaptive immune cells, such as T helper 17 cells, causing increased osteoclast activity, decreased osteoblast activity, and enhanced periodontium inflammation by creating a pro-inflammatory milieu in a context- and cell type-dependent manner. We also discuss promising therapeutic strategies targeting inappropriate inflammasome activity in the treatment of alveolar bone loss. Novel strategies for inhibiting inflammasome signaling may facilitate the development of versatile drugs that carefully balance the beneficial contributions of inflammasomes to host defense.","Li, Yang; Ling, Junqi; Jiang, Qianzhou",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177950/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.691013,57

670971,Viral modulation of stress granules,2012-06-14,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Performance of diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopic procedures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients can be challenging during a viral pandemic; the main concerns being the safety and protection of patients and health care providers (HCP). The aim of this study is to identify endoscopic practice patterns and outcomes of IBD and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) with a worldwide survey of HCP. METHODS: The 20-item survey questionnaire was sent to physician members of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Special Interest Group in Interventional IBD, Chinese IBD Society Endoscopy Interest Group, and the China Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation. RESULTS: A total of 141 respondents submitted valid responses. Nighty-five respondents (67.9%) reported that at least 25% of their scheduled emergent endoscopic procedures were canceled or postponed during the pandemic. Fifty-six respondents (40.0%) have performed emergent endoscopy during the pandemic. A few respondents (9/140, 6.4%) estimated that more than 25% of their patients had worsened disease due to delayed or canceled emergent endoscopy procedures. More than 80% of respondents believed that personal protective equipment (PPE) for the endoscopy team, room sterilization, and pre-procedure screening of patients for COVID-19 were necessary. Out of 140 respondents, 16 (11.4%) reported that several of their patients had COVID-19. Eight clinicians (5.7%) reported that they or their endoscopy colleagues developed work-related COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Cancellation of elective and emergent endoscopy in IBD care during the pandemic was common. Few respondents reported that their patients’ disease conditions worsened due to the cancellation of the endoscopy procedure. Most respondents voiced the need for proper PPE during the procedure regardless of patients’ COVID-19 status and screening the patients for COVID-19.","Chen, Yan; Yu, Qiao; Farraye, Francis A.; Kochhar, Gursimran S.; Bernstein, Charles N.; Navaneethan, Udayakumar; Wu, Kaicun; Zhong, Jie; Schwartz, David A.; Wu, Hao; Zheng, Jing-Jing; Iacucci, Marietta; Kiran, Ravi P.; Shen, Bo",Intest Res,https://doi.org/10.5217/ir.2020.00037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475088/,57
670978,Lipidation increases antiviral activities of coronavirus fusion-inhibiting peptides,2017-08-10,"The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused widespread infection and significant mortality across the globe. Combined virology perspective of SARS-CoV-2 with a deep-rooted understanding of pathophysiological and immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is of prime importance. The characteristic symptom of COVID-19 is respiratory distress with diffused alveolar damage, but emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 might also have neurologic consequences. Dysregulated homeostasis in the lungs has proven to be fatal, but one cannot ignore that the inability to breathe might be due to defects in the respiratory control center of the brainstem. While the mechanism of pulmonary distress has been documented in the literature, awareness of neurological features and their pathophysiology is still in the nascent state. This review makes references to the neuro-immune axis and neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, as well as the prototypic H-CoV strains in human brains. Simultaneously, considerable discussion on relevant experimental evidence of mild to severe neurological manifestations of fellow neurotropic murine-β-CoVs (m-CoVs) in the mouse model will help understand the underpinning mechanisms of Neuro-COVID. In this review, we have highlighted the neuroimmunopathological processes in murine CoVs. While MHV infection in mice and SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans share numerous parallels, there are critical differences in viral recognition and viral entry. These similarities are highlighted in this review, while differences have also been emphasized. Though CoV-2 Spike does not favorably interact with murine ACE2 receptor, modification of murine SARS-CoV2 binding domain or development of transgenic ACE-2 knock-in mice might help in mediating consequential infection and understanding human CoV2 pathogenesis in murine models. While a global animal model that can replicate all aspects of the human disease remains elusive, prior insights and further experiments with fellow m-β-CoV-induced cause-effect experimental models and current human COVID-19 patients data may help to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-induced multifactorial multi-organ failure","Chakravarty, Debanjana; Das Sarma, Jayasri",J Neurovirol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-021-00945-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547593/,57

We propose an AI-augmented forecast modeling framework that provides daily predictions of the expected number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths, cases, and hospitalizations during the following 4 weeks. We present an international, prospective evaluation of our models' performance across all states and counties in the USA and prefectures in Japan. Nationally, incident mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for predicting COVID-19 associated deaths during prospective deployment remained consistently <8% (US) and <29% (Japan), while cumulative MAPE remained <2% (US) and <10% (Japan). We show that our models perform well even during periods of considerable change in population behavior, and are robust to demographic differences across different geographic locations. We further demonstrate that our framework provides meaningful explanatory insights with the models accurately adapting to local and national policy interventions. Our framework enables counterfactual simulations, which indicate continuing Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions alongside vaccinations is essential for faster recovery from the pandemic, delaying the application of interventions has a detrimental effect, and allow exploration of the consequences of different vaccination strategies.

Still, the idea of social justice is intimately connected with the idea of sociology. It arises along with scientific understandings of the social world and draws from these understandings to reshape society. The problem is that in practice, social justice activists often draw from only one type of sociological theory, conflict theory, and from a particular form of conflict theory known as critical theory. In doing so, they may ignore potential problems with the theories they are drawing from, and they may overlook many possibilities for effective reform. Conflict theory orients activists toward fighting oppression, but other theoretical approaches could help societies to achieve other possible moral goals, such as promoting understanding, increasing virtue, incentivizing virtue, making virtue easier, and strengthening solidarity.","Campbell, Bradley",Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465929/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12115-021-00625-4,57

N-dealkylation of N,N-dialkylamino moieties has been associated with retaining, attenuation or loss of pharmacologic activities of metabolites compared to their parent drugs. Further, N-dealkylation has resulted in clinically used drugs, activation of prodrugs, change of receptor selectivity, and providing potential for developing fully-fledged drugs. While both secondary and tertiary alkylamino moieties (open chain aliphatic or heterocyclic) are metabolized by CYP450 isozymes oxidative N-dealkylation, only tertiary alkylamino moieties are subject to metabolic N-oxidation by Flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) to give N-oxide products. In this review, two aspects will be examined after surveying the metabolism of representative alkylamino-moieties-containing drugs that act at various receptors (i) the pharmacologic activities and relevant physicochemical properties (basicity and polarity) of the metabolites with respect to their parent drugs and (ii) the role of alkylamino moieties on the molecular docking of drugs in receptors.

672000,How to bring peer review ghostwriters out of the dark,2021-03-15,"Stem cells hold indefinite self-renewable capability that can be differentiated into all desired cell types. Based on their plasticity potential, they are divided into totipotent (morula stage cells), pluripotent (embryonic stem cells), multipotent (hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent adult progenitor stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs]), and unipotent (progenitor cells that differentiate into a single lineage) cells. Though bone marrow is the primary source of multipotent stem cells in adults, other tissues such as adipose tissues, placenta, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, periodontal ligament, and dental pulp also harbor stem cells that can be used for regenerative therapy. In addition, induced pluripotent stem cells also exhibit fundamental properties of self-renewal and differentiation into specialized cells, and thus could be another source for regenerative medicine. Several diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, virus infection (also coronavirus disease 2019) have limited success with conventional medicine, and stem cell transplantation is assumed to be the best therapy to treat these disorders. Importantly, MSCs, are by far the best for regenerative medicine due to their limited immune modulation and adequate tissue repair. Moreover, MSCs have the potential to migrate towards the damaged area, which is regulated by various factors and signaling processes. Recent studies have shown that extracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) promotes the proliferation of MSCs, and thus can assist in transplantation therapy. Ca(2+ )signaling is a highly adaptable intracellular signal that contains several components such as cell-surface receptors, Ca(2+) channels/pumps/exchangers, Ca(2+) buffers, and Ca(2+) sensors, which together are essential for the appropriate functioning of stem cells and thus modulate their proliferative and regenerative capacity, which will be discussed in this review.","Ahamad, Nassem; Singh, Brij B",World J Stem Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33959218/; https://doi.org/10.4252/wjsc.v13.i4.260,57

We determined whether early changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with dysregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the specific functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7 the latter having cardioprotective and vasorelaxation effects. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of plasma samples for circulating miRNAs showed upregulation of miR-200c and miR-let-7b in otherwise healthy individuals with obesity. This was associated with significant downregulation of ACE2, a direct target for both miRNAs, in individuals with obesity. Correlation analysis confirmed a significant negative correlation between ACE2 and both the miRNAs. Studies showed that despite being the functional receptor, inhibition/downregulation of ACE2 did not reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, increased angiotensin II following inhibition of ACE2 may increase the severity of the disease. Taken together, our novel results identify that upregulation of miR-200c may increase the susceptibility of individuals with obesity to COVID-19. Considering miRNA are the earliest molecular regulators, the level of circulating miR-200c could be a potential biomarker in the early identification of those at the risk of severe COVID-19.","Bellae Papannarao, Jayanthi; Schwenke, Daryl O.; Manning, Patrick; Katare, Rajesh",Int J Obes (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-021-00984-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625660/,57

This paper argues that there are also in principle obstacles to the application of AI in clinical medicine and care where empathy is important, and that these problems cannot be solved with any of the technical and theoretical approaches that shape the current application of AI in specific areas of clinical medicine in which care for patients is fundamental. This is important, because it generates specific risks that may be overlooked otherwise, and it justifies the necessity of human monitoring and emotional intervention in clinical medicine.

Little work has been done to understand vaccine willingness among older adolescents and young adults. This is important since this age group may be less likely to adhere to public health guidelines. Objective To understand willingness of getting a vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among a sample of older adolescents and young adults. Design Data were from the Well-Being and Experiences study (The WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample of older adolescents and young adults collected from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 2017 to 2020 (n = 664). Setting The study setting was a community-based observational longitudinal study. Participants Participants for the study were aged 14 to 17 years old at baseline in 2016-17 (n = 1000). Data were also collected on one parent/caregiver. Waves 2 (n = 747) and 3 (n = 664) were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Exposures The main exposures were sociodemographic factors, health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, and adversity history. Main Outcomes The main outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine willingness, hesitancy, and reasons for hesitancy. Results Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was 65.4%. Willingness did not differ by age, sex, or mental health conditions, but did differ for other sociodemographic characteristics, physical health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, practicing social/physical distancing, and adversity history. The most common reasons for not wanting a vaccine were related to safety, knowledge, and effectiveness. Sex differences were noted. Conclusions and Relevance Increasing uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among older adolescents and young adults may rely on targeting individuals from households with lower income, financial burden, and adversity history, and generating public health messaging specifically aimed at vaccine safety, how it works to protect against infection, and why it is important to protect oneself against a COVID-19 infection.","Afifi, Tracie O.; Salmon, Samantha; Taillieu, Tamara; Stewart-Tufescu, Ashley; Fortier, Janique; Michelle Driedger, S.",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21005909; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21005909?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023134/,57

This study analyzes state-level geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases and age distribution of Obstetricians and gynecologists (OB/GYNs) to project which US regions will experience a more significant COVID-19 patient burden and provides a guide for vaccine distribution in the OB/GYN workforce. Methods The Association of American Medical Colleges' state-level workforce data is combined with COVID-19 case data reported by Johns Hopkins University. All data and code are available at https://github.com/cxr244/covid-obgyn. Results Our findings illustrate that OB/GYNs in the Midwestern region of the US experience the highest number of COVID-19 patients per OB/GYN over 60 years of age: North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Idaho have the highest burden of COVID-19 patients per OB/GYN, warranting vaccine distribution priority. Additionally, states with the highest proportion of OB/GYNs over the age of 60 like Florida (38%), New Mexico (37%), Alabama (36%), California (36%), and New Jersey (34%), should be strongly considered for priority vaccine allocation, to mitigate predicted OB/GYN workforce shortages. Conclusion When planning and executing vaccine allocation, especially in the early stages of distribution, it is critical to evaluate which communities can benefit the greatest from the limited number of vaccines. A strategy of distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to older physicians with a more significant COVID-19 burden can minimize shortages of providers within these states and ensure adequate access to women’s healthcare within the communities they serve.","Shastri, Toral; Rasendran, Chandruganesh; Markwei, Metabel; Hur, Christine; Goje, Oluwatosin",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017660/,57

We aimed to evaluate the effect of combining chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) and zinc in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at three major University hospitals in Egypt. One hundred ninety-one patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were randomized into two groups: group I (96) patients received both HCQ and zinc, and group II (95) received HCQ only. The primary endpoints were the recovery within 28 days, the need for mechanical ventilation, and death. The two groups were matched for age and gender. They had no significant difference regarding any of the baseline laboratory parameters or clinical severity grading. Clinical recovery after 28 days was achieved by 79.2% in the zinc group and 77.9% in zinc-free treatment group, without any significant difference (p = 0.969). The need for mechanical ventilation and the overall mortality rates did not show any significant difference between the 2 groups either (p = 0.537 and 0.986, respectively). The age of the patient and the need for mechanical ventilation were the only risk factors associated with the patients’ mortality by the univariate regression analysis (p = 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively).

Utilizing the 2018 Typhoon Mangkhut as an example, the spatial and temporal variations of urban human flow patterns in Shenzhen are examined using GIS and spatial flow analysis. In addition, the variation of human flow by different urban functions (e.g. transport, recreational, institutional, commercial and residential related facilities) is also examined through an integration of flow data and point-of-interest (POI) data. The study reveals that urban flow patterns varied substantially before, during, and after the typhoon. Specifically, urban flows were found to have reduced by 39% during the disruption. Conversely, 56% of flows increased immediately after the disruption. In terms of functional variation, the assessment reveals that fundamental urban functions, such as industrial (work) and institutional - (education) related trips experienced less disruption, whereas the typhoon event appears to have a relatively larger negative influence on recreational related trips. Overall, the study provides implications for planners and policy makers to enhance urban resilience to disasters through a better understanding of the urban vulnerability to disruptive events.","Chen, Zhenhua; Gong, Zhaoya; Yang, Shan; Ma, Qiwei; Kan, Changcheng",Comput Environ Urban Syst,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198971520302532; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971520302532; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834303/,57

The novel coronavirus pandemic has resulted in an increased workload for nurses and heightened stress. AIMS To assess the psychological health over time of nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the factors associated with stress, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing. METHODS Nurses enrolled in the study between 2 July and 26 August 2020 andcompleted questionnaires about stress, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing at baseline and at a second time point T2 12 weeks later. A paired sample t-test was used to examine whether changes in stress, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing were significantly different between baseline and T2. Linear regression models examined factors associated with psychological health outcomes. RESULTS Of the 600 nurses initially enrolled, 484 (80.7%) completed psychological health measures at T2. Stress, anxiety, and poor psychological wellbeing scores were high at baseline. Unexpectedly, stress and psychological wellbeing significantly improved between baseline and T2, while anxiety levels increased. Younger nurses had higher baseline stress and anxiety scores. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the potential beneficial effect of effective public health management of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses' stress and psychological wellbeing and highlights the importance of longitudinal research to understand psychological health in nurses.","Slykerman, Rebecca F; Li, Eileen; Booth, Roger J",Nursing forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34601731/; https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12660,57
678660,Structure-Based Modeling of Complement C4 Mediated Neutralization of Adenovirus,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental effect on the health and well-being of health care workers (HCWs). The extent to which HCWs may differ in their experience of depression and anxiety is unclear, and longitudinal studies are lacking. The present study examined theorized differences in distress between resilient and non-resilient HCWs over time, as reported in a national online survey. We also examined possible differences in distress as a function of sex and doctoral-level status. METHODS: A national sample responded to an online survey data that included the study measures. Of the HCWs who responded, 666 had useable data at the two time points. A longitudinal structural equation model tested an a priori model that specified the relationship of a resilient personality prototype to self-reported resilience, coping, depression and anxiety at both measurement occasions. Additional invariance models examined possible differences by sex and doctoral-level status. RESULTS: The final model explained 46.4% of the variance in psychological distress at Time 1 and 69.1% at Time 2. A non-resilient personality prototype predicted greater depression and anxiety. A resilient personality prototype was predictive of and operated through self-reported resilience and less disengaged coping to effect lower distress. No effects were found for active coping, however. The final model was generally invariant by sex and HCWs status. Additional analyses revealed that non-doctoral level HCWs had significantly higher depression and anxiety than doctoral-level HCWs on both occasions. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs differ in their susceptibility to distress imposed by COVID-19. Those who are particularly vulnerable may have characteristics that contribute to a lower sense of confidence and efficacy in stressful situations, and more likely to rely on ineffective, disengaged coping behaviors that can exacerbate stress levels. Individual interventions and institutional policies may be implemented to support HCWs at risk.","Elliott, Timothy R.; Perrin, Paul B.; Bell, Anne-Stuart; Powers, Mark B.; Warren, Ann Marie",BMC Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34615501/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03506-6,57

METHODS: This study was conducted online between April and May 2020. Data were collected from 468 men and women from the Spanish general population. Sociodemographic and COVID-19-related data, health anxiety, PTSS, fear of becoming infected, social support, sleep problems and past/current psychological/psychiatric history were assessed. The mediating effect of HA when predicting PTSS was explored with mediational analyses. Moderated mediational analyses were also performed to test if receiving psychological treatment during pandemic changes the mediating effect of HA. RESULTS: Prevalence of PTSS was higher in high-scorers in HA (p<.01). High HA was also more likely to be reported by women, individuals with sleep problems, frequently fear of getting infected, and those who have previously received psychological treatment (p<.01). HA mediates the relationship between PTSS and the following predictors of PTSS: sleep problems, psychiatric history and fear of getting infected. Being under psychological treatment did not moderate the mediating effect of health anxiety. LIMITATIONS: Further longitudinal studies with bigger sample sizes are needed to examine the causal relationship between HA and PTSS after COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HA could influence the psychological consequences of the pandemic. Screening of HA could be useful to identify people with heightened risk of developing PTSS during pandemic.","Coloma-Carmona, Ainhoa; Carballo, José Luis",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34311333/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032721007114; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721007114,57

Although the symptoms remain mild in most patients, the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with liver cirrhosis, especially after decompensation, may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to systemic immune dysfunction. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 51-year-old man who was hypertensive, an ex-alcoholic abstinent for 6 months, and a smoker. He was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in July 2019, and was using norfloxacin at home for secondary prophylaxis of bacterial peritonitis. He was also using furosemide and spironolactone to control ascites and propranolol for primary prophylaxis of esophageal varices. The patient entered our hospital in July 2020 with cough, dyspnea, runny nose, diarrhea, and fever. During hospitalization, we confirmed infection by COVID-19 and secondary nosocomial pulmonary infection. Chest tomography compatible with ground-glass standard was performed. The patient developed the need for auxiliary oxygen but without invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient received dexamethasone 6 mg/day and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (he was started on cefepime but switched to meropenem). At the end of the 14-day isolation period, he was discharged with improved respiratory status. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high mortality rates in patients with advanced cirrhosis who become infected with COVID-19, we report a case with a favorable outcome. Success has been achieved with the use of medications in studies of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the rapid detection of complications caused by the virus. Further studies in SARS-CoV-2 patients with chronic liver disease are needed.","Beraldo, Rodrigo Fedatto; Marcondes, Mariana Barros; dos Santos, Maria Natália Marques; Grillo, Thais Gagno; Pires, Gabriel Barros Tambelli; de Oliveira, Cássio Vieira",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686051/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.929948,57

Patients in conservative management for chronic kidney disease (CKD) have received attention only recently, therefore less is known about how COVID-19 affects this population. The aim of this study was to provide evidence on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in CKD patients followed up in an integrated healthcare program and in the population living in the same catchment area. The study population included CKD patients recruited in the Emilia-Romagna Prevention of Progressive Renal Insufficiency (PIRP) project, followed up in the 4 nephrology units (Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena and Rimini) of the Romagna Local Health Authority (Italy) and alive at 1.01.2020. We estimated the incidence of COVID-19, its related mortality and the excess mortality within this PIRP cohort as of 31.07.2020. COVID-19 incidence in CKD patients was 4.09% (193/4,716 patients), while in the general population it was 0.46% (5,195/1,125,574). The crude mortality rate among CKD patients with COVID-19 was 44.6% (86/193), compared to 4.7% (215/4,523) in CKD patients without COVID-19. The excess mortality of March-April 2020 was +69.8% than the average mortality of March-April 2015–19 in the PIRP cohort. In a cohort mostly including regularly followed up CKD patients, the incidence of COVID-19 among CKD patients was strongly related to the spread of the infection in the community, while its lethality is associated with the underlying kidney condition and comorbidities. COVID-19 related mortality was about ten times higher than that of CKD patients without COVID. For this reason, it is urgent to offer a direct protection to CKD patients by prioritizing their vaccination.","Gibertoni, Dino; Reno, Chiara; Rucci, Paola; Fantini, Maria Pia; Buscaroli, Andrea; Mosconi, Giovanni; Rigotti, Angelo; Giudicissi, Antonio; Mambelli, Emanuele; Righini, Matteo; Zambianchi, Loretta; Santoro, Antonio; Bravi, Francesca; Altini, Mattia",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242368/,57

In this modelling study, we use a Bayesian compartmental model to project possible spread of the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa under various levels of lockdown restrictions. Our model suggests that strict lockdown restrictions will have to be in place up to the end of March 2021 before cases can drop to levels observed, in September to early November 2020, after the first wave. On the one hand, extended lockdown restrictions have negative consequences -- albeit effective, they are not sustainable over extended periods. On the other hand, short lockdown restrictions over a few weeks will not have a lasting effect on the spread of the disease. Lockdown restrictions need to be supplemented with increased rapid testing, palliative support for the vulnerable, and implementations of other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mask mandate.

The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Drayman, Nir; Jones, Krysten A.; Azizi, Saara-Anne; Froggatt, Heather M.; Tan, Kemin; Maltseva, Natalia Ivanovna; Chen, Siquan; Nicolaescu, Vlad; Dvorkin, Steve; Furlong, Kevin; Kathayat, Rahul S.; Firpo, Mason R.; Mastrodomenico, Vincent; Bruce, Emily A.; Schmidt, Madaline M.; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Muñoz-Alía, Miguel Á.; Schuster, Brooke; Nair, Vishnu; Botten, Jason W.; Brooke, Christopher B.; Baker, Susan C.; Mounce, Bryan C.; Heaton, Nicholas S.; Dickinson, Bryan C.; Jaochimiak, Andrzej; Randall, Glenn; Tay, Savaş",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908976/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.274639,57

While a growing body of research has focused on understanding the role of macro-level factors on responses to COVID-19, we have a limited understanding of what drives countries’ responses to COVID-19. We lean on organizational learning theory and the extant literature on rare events to propose that governance structure, investment in healthcare infrastructure, and learning from past pandemics influence a country’s response regarding reactive and proactive strategies.

Successful replication was achieved as evident from continuous expression of eGFP detected by both fluorescence and Western blot. Treatment with antiviral drugs demonstrated that the replication could be significantly inhibited by 0.4 mg/ml of cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64D, but not by ribavirin.

Due to its cost‐effectiveness, safety and efficacy, HCQ is especially used in rheumatic autoimmune disorders (RADs), such as systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjögren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite this widespread use in the clinic, HCQ molecular modes of action are still not completely understood. By influencing several cellular pathways through different mechanisms, CQ and HCQ inhibit multiple endolysosomal functions, including autophagy, as well as endosomal Toll‐like receptor activation and calcium signalling. These effects alter several aspects of the immune system with the synergistic consequence of reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokine production and release, one of the most marked symptoms of RADs. Here, we review the current knowledge on the molecular modes of action of these drugs and the circumstances under which they trigger side effects.

682382,RNA interference: An emerging generation of biologicals,2008-03-04,"Evolutionary biology is an essential basic science for medicine, but few doctors and medical researchers are familiar with its most relevant principles. Most medical schools have geneticists who understand evolution, but few have even one evolutionary biologist to suggest other possible applications. The canyon between evolutionary biology and medicine is wide. The question is whether they offer each other enough to make bridge building worthwhile. What benefits could be expected if evolution were brought fully to bear on the problems of medicine? How would studying medical problems advance evolutionary research? Do doctors need to learn evolution, or is it valuable mainly for researchers? What practical steps will promote the application of evolutionary biology in the areas of medicine where it offers the most? To address these questions, we review current and potential applications of evolutionary biology to medicine and public health. Some evolutionary technologies, such as population genetics, serial transfer production of live vaccines, and phylogenetic analysis, have been widely applied. Other areas, such as infectious disease and aging research, illustrate the dramatic recent progress made possible by evolutionary insights. In still other areas, such as epidemiology, psychiatry, and understanding the regulation of bodily defenses, applying evolutionary principles remains an open opportunity. In addition to the utility of specific applications, an evolutionary perspective fundamentally challenges the prevalent but fundamentally incorrect metaphor of the body as a machine designed by an engineer. Bodies are vulnerable to disease – and remarkably resilient – precisely because they are not machines built from a plan. They are, instead, bundles of compromises shaped by natural selection in small increments to maximize reproduction, not health. Understanding the body as a product of natural selection, not design, offers new research questions and a framework for making medical education more coherent. We conclude with recommendations for actions that would better connect evolutionary biology and medicine in ways that will benefit public health. It is our hope that faculty and students will send this article to their undergraduate and medical school Deans, and that this will initiate discussions about the gap, the great opportunity, and action plans to bring the full power of evolutionary biology to bear on human health problems.","Nesse, Randolph M; Stearns, Stephen C",Evol Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567489/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2007.00006.x,57

Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ED were included in this prospective study. The patients were divided into two groups. The surviving patients were included in Group 1 (survivors), and the patients who died were included in Group 2 (non-survivors). The electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory results and chest computerized tomography (CCT) findings of the two groups were compared. The CCT images were classified according to the findings as normal, mild, moderate and severe. Results: Of the 419 patients included in the study, 347 (83%) survived (survivor) and 72 (17%) died (non-survivor). The heart rate and respiratory rate were found to be higher, and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were found to be lower in the non-survivor patients. QRS and corrected QT interval (QTc) were measured as longer in the non-survivor patients. In the CCT images, 79.2% of the non-survivor patients had severe findings, while 11.5% of the survivor patients had severe findings. WBC, neutrophil, NLR, lactate, D-dimer, fibrinogen, C- Reactive Protein (CRP), urea, creatinine, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and hs-Troponin I levels were found to be higher and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO(2)), base excess (BE), bicarbonate (HCO(3)), lymphocyte eosinophil levels were found to be lower in non-survivor patients. The highest AUC was calculated at the SpO(2) level and the eosinophil level. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a fatal disease whose mortality risk can be estimated when the clinical, laboratory and imaging studies of the patients are evaluated together in the ED. SpO(2) that is measured before starting oxygen therapy, the eosinophil levels and the CT findings are all important predictors of mortality risk.","Türkay Kunt, Aslı; Kozaci, Nalan; Torun, Ebru",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204209/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57060629,57

Data in the pediatric population are practically absent. We aimed to describe the prevalence of patients with RD and their complications among children admitted with COVID-19 in the Spanish national cohort EPICO-AEP; a multicenter prospective national study. Methods: Children <18 years old with RD and COVID-19 enrolled in EPICO-AEP were included in this study. Results: By June 30th 2020, 350 children were admitted in secondary and tertiary hospitals of Spain with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 8 patients presented RD (2.2% of those hospitalized). All were female. The median age was 12.1 years (IQR 8.3-14.5). The diagnosis related with COVID-19 were febrile syndrome and/or upper respiratory infection (4 cases) and pneumonia (4 cases). One of the 8 (12.5%) patients with a severe juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) with interstitial lung disease died. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was the most frequent diagnosis in 3/8 (37.5%) patients. In 5/8 (62.5%) cases, the RD was not fully controlled, and all patients except one received corticosteroid treatment. Conclusions: Children with RD have accounted for 2.2% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our series. The evolution has been moderately favorable, with one deceased. In case of active disease and use of corticosteroids patients should be managed with caution.

684346,Design of a set of probes with high potential for influenza virus epidemiological surveillance,2013-04-30,"The marketing authorization granted to SARS-Cov-2 vaccines was accompanied by reinforced safety monitoring plans. These plans’ implementation was part of the usual logic of post-marketing surveillance of new and innovative health products. It was especially adapted to the context of post-marketing monitoring of drugs developed according to the usual scientific quality standards but in an accelerated schedule. In Europe, the reinforced surveillance system relies on the complementary strengths of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. If the performances of pharmacovigilance monitoring are incomparable for the detection of safety signals relating to rare events of atypical presentation, it needs to be completed with pharmacoepidemiology activities for more common events, either multifactorial or frequently classified as idiopathic. The pharmacoepidemiological monitoring developed in Europe was elaborated before the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccines where marketed, taking into account the lessons learned from the vaccination campaign against 2009 A (H1N1) influenza. It includes numerous academic studies as well as studies performed within vaccines risk management plans. In terms of safety, those defined a priori mostly concerns a list of pre-established health events of specific interest. Aside of these planned activities, ad-hoc studies will be latter developed on purpose to investigate safety signals or potential signals that could be identified as the result of pharmacovigilance activities. Aside of these regulated activities, as for today, very few studies have been published regarding SARS-Cov-2 vaccines; most of the existing consist in preprints that should be considered with caution. Pharmacoepidemiology of vaccines is thought to allow near-real time monitoring that needs sufficient time to provide with valid results. In the constant urge for information that accompanies COVID-related science, it is important not to make haste the enemy of speed and to let pharmacoepidemiology provides with what it is expected to do: rock-solid scientific information contributing to evidence-based decision-making.","Pariente, Antoine; Bezin, Julien",Therapie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2021.05.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595721001165; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595721001165?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34119319/,57

Across two epidemic phases differentiated by varying levels of community transmission, the proportion of patients admitted with WHO-defined severe COVID-19 ranged from 5% (7/146; 95% CI: 2-10) to 33% (41/124; 95% CI: 25-42); 21% (26/124; 95% CI: 14-29%) of patients admitted during the peak phase received oxygen therapy. Severe COVID-19 was associated with older age, male sex, and longer duration of illness before admission. Coinfection with HIV was not associated with illness severity; malaria or tuberculosis coinfection was rare. No patients died during admission. Despite low mortality, hospital incidence of severe COVID-19 during the first epidemic peak in Uganda was substantial. Improvements in vaccine deployment and acute care capacity, including oxygen delivery, are urgently needed to prevent and manage severe COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa.","Bakamutumaho, Barnabas; Cummings, Matthew J; Owor, Nicholas; Kayiwa, John; Namulondo, Joyce; Byaruhanga, Timothy; Muwanga, Moses; Nsereko, Christopher; Rwamutwe, Emmanuel; Mutonyi, Roselyn; Achan, Josephine; Wanyenze, Lucy; Ndazarwe, Alice; Nakanjako, Ruth; Natuhwera, Richard; Nsangi, Annet; Bosa, Henry Kyobe; Ocom, Felix; O'Donnell, Max R; Kikaire, Bernard; Lutwama, Julius J",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.21-0551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370701/,57

685034,Virus Structure and Classification,2016-05-06,"Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of nosocomial and community-associated infection worldwide; however, there is no licensed vaccine available. S. aureus initiates infection via the mucosa; therefore, a mucosal vaccine is likely to be a promising approach against S. aureus infection. Lactobacilli, a non-pathogenic bacterium, has gained increasing interest as a mucosal delivery vehicle. Hence, we attempted to develop an oral S. aureus vaccine based on lactobacilli to cushion the stress of drug resistance and vaccine needs. In this study, we designed, constructed, and evaluated recombinant Lactobacillus strains synthesizing S. aureus nontoxic mutated α-hemolysins (Hla(H35L)). The results from animal clinical trials showed that recombinant Lactobacillus can persist for at least 72 h and can stably express heterologous protein in vivo. Recombinant L. plantarum WXD234 (pNZ8148-Hla) could induce robust mucosal immunity in the GALT, as evidenced by a significant increase in IgA and IL-17 production and the strong proliferation of T-lymphocytes derived from Peyer’s patches. WXD234 (pNZ8148-Hla) conferred up to 83% protection against S. aureus pulmonary infection and significantly reduced the abscess size in a S. aureus skin infection model. Of particular interest is the sharp reduction of the protective effect offered by WXD234 (pNZ8148-Hla) vaccination in γδ T cell-deficient or IL-17-deficient mice. In conclusion, for the first time, genetically engineered Lactobacillus WXD234 (pNZ8148-Hla) as an oral vaccine induced superior mucosal immunity, which was associated with high protection against pulmonary and skin infections caused by S. aureus. Taken together, our findings suggest the great potential for a delivery system based on lactobacilli and provide experimental data for the development of mucosal vaccines for S. aureus.","Pan, Na; Liu, Bohui; Bao, Xuemei; Zhang, Haochi; Sheng, Shouxin; Liang, Yanchen; Pan, Haiting; Wang, Xiao",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579221/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090984,57

Here we describe a renal-transplant recipient who developed recurrent, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 months after primary infection. To elucidate the immunological mechanisms responsible for reinfection, we performed longitudinal profiling of cellular and humoral responses during both primary and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that the patient responded to the primary infection with transient, poor-quality adaptive immune responses that was further compromised by intervening treatment for acute rejection of the renal allograft prior to reinfection. Importantly, we identified the development of neutralizing antibodies and humoral memory responses prior to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, these neutralizing antibodies failed to confer protection against reinfection, suggesting that additional factors are required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Further, we found no evidence supporting viral evasion of primary adaptive immune responses, suggesting that susceptibility to reinfection may be determined by host factors rather than pathogen adaptation.","Klein, Jon; Brito, Anderson; Trubin, Paul; Lu, Peiwen; Wong, Patrick; Alpert, Tara; Pena-Hernandez, Mario; Haynes, Winston; Kamath, Kathy; Liu, Feimei; Vogels, Chantal; Fauver, Joseph; Lucas, Carolina; Oh, Ji Eun; Mao, Tianyang; Silva, Julio; Wyllie, Anne; Muenker, M.

685433,Mechanism and Function of Antiviral RNA Interference in Mice,2020-08-04,"BACKGROUND: In 2015, the stillbirth rate after 28 weeks (late gestation) in Australia was 35% higher than countries with the lowest rates globally. Reductions in late gestation stillbirth rates have steadily improved in Australia. However, to amplify and sustain reductions, more needs to be done to reduce practice variation and address sub-optimal care. Implementing bundles for maternity care improvement in the UK have been associated with a 20% reduction in stillbirth rates. A similar approach is underway in Australia; the Safer Baby Bundle (SBB) with five elements: 1) supporting women to stop smoking in pregnancy, 2) improving detection and management of fetal growth restriction, 3) raising awareness and improving care for women with decreased fetal movements, 4) improving awareness of maternal safe going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy, 5) improving decision making about the timing of birth for women with risk factors for stillbirth. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods study of maternity services across three Australian states; Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. The study includes evaluation of ‘targeted’ implementer sites (combined total approximately 113,000 births annually, 50% of births in these states) and monitoring of key outcomes state-wide across all maternity services. Progressive implementation over 2.5 years, managed by state Departments of Health, commenced from mid-2019. This study will determine the impact of implementing the SBB on maternity services and perinatal outcomes, specifically for reducing late gestation stillbirth. Comprehensive process, impact, and outcome evaluations will be conducted using routinely collected perinatal data, pre- and post- implementation surveys, clinical audits, focus group discussions and interviews. Evaluations explore the views and experiences of clinicians embedding the SBB into routine practice as well as women’s experience with care and the acceptability of the initiative. DISCUSSION: This protocol describes the evaluation of the SBB initiative and will provide evidence for the value of a systematic, but pragmatic, approach to strategies to reduce the evidence-practice gaps across maternity services. We hypothesise successful implementation and uptake across three Australian states (amplified nationally) will be effective in reducing late gestation stillbirths to that of the best performing countries globally, equating to at least 150 lives saved annually.

685550,An “Old” protein with a new story: Coronavirus endoribonuclease is important for evading host antiviral defenses,2018-04-30,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 generally affects the lungs by causing pneumonic infiltration. Typical computed tomography (CT) findings are bilateral, multifocal, peripheral, and patchy ground-glass opacities. These CT findings can also be seen in drug toxicities. Rapid and accurate differential diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia from chemotherapy-induced pulmonary toxicity (CPT) is essential because the treatment strategies are different. In this case report, we define the clinical and lung CT findings of two cases of CPT mimicking COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE REPORTS The first patient was a 39-year-old male under a 5-fluorouracil + folinicacid + oxaliplatin + panitumumab (FOLFOX) treatment regimen due to metastatic rectal cancer. The second patient was a 53-year-old male with testicular seminoma who was treated with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) protocol. Both patients were presented to the emergency department with increased dyspnea after chemotherapy. Thorax CT showed similar findings to COVID-19 pneumonia. On follow-up CTs, these findings disappeared with steroid treatment as well as withdrawal of the chemotherapeutic agents, which enabled us to make a differential diagnosis. Also, two consecutive COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were negative in both patients. CONCLUSION When lung CT findings of the oncologic patients are similar to COVID-19 pneumonia, chemotherapy-induced pulmonary toxicity should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.","Karasu, Sebnem; Sinci, Kazim Ayberk; Yildiz, Yasar; Gumus, Cesur; Tosun, Ozgur",Current medical imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182912/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405617666210628161017,57

Objective: To determine which county-level features best predict COVID-19 morbidity and mortality for a given county in the U.S. Design: A Machine-Learning model that predicts COVID-19 mortality and morbidity using county-level features, followed by a SHAP-values-based importance analysis of the predictive features. Setting: Publicly available data from various American government and news websites. Participants: 3,071 U.S. counties, from which 53 county-level features, as well as morbidity and mortality numbers, were collected. Measurements: For each county: Ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, educational attainment, mask usage, population density, age distribution, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, air quality indicators, presidential election results, ICU beds. Results: A Random Forest classifier produced an AUROC of 0.863 for morbidity prediction and an AUROC of 0.812 for mortality prediction. A SHAP-values-based analysis indicated that poverty rate, obesity rate, mean commute time to work, and proportion of people that wear masks significantly affected morbidity rates, while ethnicity, median income, poverty rate, and education levels, heavily influenced mortality rates. The correlation between several of these factors and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, from 4/2020 to 11/2020 shifted, probably due to COVID-19 being initially associated with more urbanized areas, then with less urbanized ones. Limitations: Data are still coming in. Conclusions: Ethnicity, education, and economic disparity measures are major factors in predicting the COVID-19 mortality rate in a county. Between-counties low-variance factors (e.g., age), are not meaningful predictors. Differing correlations can be explained by the COVID-19 spread from metropolitan to less metropolitan areas.","Itzhak, N.; Shahar, T.; Moskovitch, R.; Shahar, Y.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.21250092; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250092v1?rss=1,57

There is a need for long term studies that are also population based. We describe the epidemiology of severe influenza in a defined population 1998–2014. METHOD: Retrospective study of annually collected data of virologically confirmed influenza in hospitalized children 0–17 years living in the catchment area (230,000 children). We gathered information about comorbidity and complications from case records, and compared Influenza A, B and A(H1N1)pdm09 with respect to these factors. RESULTS: A total of 922 children with influenza were hospitalized. The mean rate remained unchanged at 22.5–24.2 per 100,000 children per year. There were two major outbreaks: influenza A(H3N2) in 2003–2004 and the A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009–2010. The proportion of children with influenza B increased from 8% during the first half of the study period to 28% during the second half. The highest admission rate was found in children <3 months of age, 169 per 100,000. Children with influenza B were older than those with influenza A. Comorbidity was found in 34%, complications in 41%, and 11% needed intensive care management. The mortality rate was 0.17/100,000 children. CONCLUSION: Influenza remains an important reason for the hospitalization of children, especially during the first years of life.

We aimed to describe the overall burden of these complications in survivors of severe COVID-19. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England we used data from the OpenSAFELY platform linking primary care records to death certificate and hospital data. We constructed two cohorts: a COVID-19 cohort consisting of patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, and a comparison population of patients discharged following hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019. Outcomes included DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, MI, heart failure, AKI and new type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Outcome rates from hospital discharge were measured in each cohort, stratified by patient demographics and 30-day period. We fitted Cox regression models to estimate crude and age/sex adjusted hazard ratios comparing outcome rates between the two cohorts. Results Amongst the population of 31,569 patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, the highest rates were observed for heart failure (199.3; 95% CI: 191.8 - 207.1) and AKI (154.5; 95% CI: 147.9 - 161.4). Rates of DVT, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, MI, PE and diabetes were high over the four months post discharge, especially in the first month. Patterns were broadly similar to those seen in patients discharged with pneumonia but somewhat higher in the COVID-19 population for stroke (adj-HR 1.78; 95% CI: 1.53 - 2.08), PE (adj-HR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.21 - 1.58), MI (adj-HR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.20 - 1.76), AKI (adj-HR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.19 - 1.36) and T2DM (adj-HR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.50). Conclusions In this descriptive study of survivors of severe COVID-19, rates of the measured outcomes are at least as high, though in some cases slightly higher, than in patients discharged after hospitalisation with pneumonia. Further work is needed to identify what characteristics of COVID-19 patients put them at highest risk of adverse events.","Tazare, J.; Walker, A. J.; Tomlinson, L.; Hickman, G.; Rentsch, C.

Crystallography has provided excellent insight into the mechanism by which DC-SIGNR interacts with small glycans, such as (GlcNAc)(2)Man(3); however, direct observation of complexes with larger, physiological oligosaccharides, such as Man(9)GlcNAc(2), remains elusive. We have utilized solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate DC-SIGNR binding and herein report the first backbone assignment of its active, calcium-bound carbohydrate recognition domain. Direct interactions with the small sugar fragments Man(3), Man(5), and (GlcNAc)(2)Man(3) were investigated alongside Man(9)GlcNAc derived from recombinant gp120 (present on the HIV viral envelope), providing the first structural data for DC-SIGNR in complex with a virus-associated ligand, and unique binding modes were observed for each glycan. In particular, our data show that DC-SIGNR has a different binding mode for glycans on the HIV viral envelope compared with the smaller glycans previously observed in the crystalline state. This suggests that using the binding mode of Man(9)GlcNAc, instead of those of small glycans, may provide a platform for the design of DC-SIGNR inhibitors selective for high mannose glycans (like those on HIV). (15)N relaxation measurements provided the first information on the dynamics of the carbohydrate recognition domain, demonstrating that it is a highly flexible domain that undergoes ligand-induced conformational and dynamic changes that may explain the ability of DC-SIGNR to accommodate a range of glycans on viral surfaces.","Probert, Fay; Whittaker, Sara B.-M.; Crispin, Max; Mitchell, Daniel A.; Dixon, Ann M.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23788638/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820454353; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m113.458299; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820454353,57
