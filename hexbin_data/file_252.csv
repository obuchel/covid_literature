976,A Single Residue Substitution in the Receptor-Binding Domain of H5N1 Hemagglutinin Is Critical for Packaging into Pseudotyped Lentiviral Particles,2012-11-02,"BACKGROUND: Serological studies for influenza infection and vaccine response often involve microneutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assays to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against human and avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. We have previously characterized lentiviral particles pseudotyped with H5-HA (H5pp) and validated an H5pp-based assay as a safe alternative for high-throughput serological studies in BSL-2 facilities. Here we show that H5-HAs from different clades do not always give rise to efficient production of H5pp and the underlying mechanisms are addressed. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We have carried out mutational analysis to delineate the molecular determinants responsible for efficient packaging of HA from A/Cambodia/40808/2005 (H5Cam) and A/Anhui/1/2005 (H5Anh) into H5pp. Our results demonstrate that a single A134V mutation in the 130-loop of the receptor binding domain is sufficient to render H5Anh the ability to generate H5Anh-pp efficiently, whereas the reverse V134A mutation greatly hampers production of H5Cam-pp. Although protein expression in total cell lysates is similar for H5Anh and H5Cam, cell surface expression of H5Cam is detected at a significantly higher level than that of H5Anh. We further demonstrate by several independent lines of evidence that the behaviour of H5Anh can be explained by a stronger binding to sialic acid receptors implicating residue 134. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a single A134V mutation as the molecular determinant in H5-HA for efficient incorporation into H5pp envelope and delineated the underlying mechanism. The reduced binding to sialic acid receptors as a result of the A134V mutation not only exerts a critical influence in pseudotyping efficiency of H5-HA, but has also an impact at the whole virus level. Because A134V substitution has been reported as a naturally occurring mutation in human host, our results may have implications for the understanding of human host adaptation of avian influenza H5N1 viruses.","Tang, Dong-Jiang; Lam, Yuen-Man; Siu, Yu-Lam; Lam, Chi-Hong; Chu, Shui-Ling; Peiris, J.

1940,Development of a Rapid Detection Method for Potato virus X by Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,2015-09-30,"The primary step for efficient control of viral diseases is the development of simple, rapid, and sensitive virus detection. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has been used to detect viral RNA molecules because of its simplicity and high sensitivity for a number of viruses. RT-LAMP for the detection of Potato virus X (PVX) was developed and compared with conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate its advantages over RT-PCR. RT-LAMP reactions were conducted with or without a set of loop primers since one out of six primers showed PVX specificity. Based on real-time monitoring, RT-LAMP detected PVX around 30 min, compared to 120 min for RT-PCR. By adding a fluorescent reagent during the reaction, the extra step of visualization by gel electrophoresis was not necessary. RT-LAMP was conducted using simple inexpensive instruments and a regular incubator to evaluate whether RNA could be amplified at a constant temperature instead of using an expensive thermal cycler. This study shows the potential of RT-LAMP for the diagnosis of viral diseases and PVX epidemiology because of its simplicity and rapidness compared to RT-PCR.","Jeong, Joojin; Cho, Sang-Yun; Lee, Wang-Hyu; Lee, Kui-jae; Ju, Ho-Jong",Plant Pathol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564147/,252
2526,Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP): Emergence As an Alternative Technology for Herbal Medicine Identification,2016-12-26,"Correct identification of medicinal plant ingredients is essential for their safe use and for the regulation of herbal drug supply chain. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a recently developed approach to identify herbal medicine species. This novel molecular biology technique enables timely and accurate testing, especially in settings where infrastructures to support polymerase chain reaction facilities are lacking. Studies that used this method have altered our view on the extent and complexity of herbal medicine identification. In this review, we give an introduction into LAMP analysis, covers the basic principles and important aspects in the development of LAMP analysis method. Then we presented a critical review of the application of LAMP-based methods in detecting and identifying raw medicinal plant materials and their processed products. We also provide a practical standard operating procedure (SOP) for the utilization of the LAMP protocol in herbal authentication, and consider the prospects of LAMP technology in the future developments of herbal medicine identification and the challenges associated with its application.","Li, Jing-jian; Xiong, Chao; Liu, Yue; Liang, Jun-song; Zhou, Xing-wen",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183589/,252
3101,Chromogenic detection of yam mosaic virus by closed-tube reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (CT-RT-LAMP),2018-01-08,"A closed-tube reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (CT-RT-LAMP) assay was developed for the detection of yam mosaic virus (YMV, genus Potyvirus) infecting yam (Dioscorea spp.). The assay uses a set of six oligonucleotide primers targeting the YMV coat protein region, and the amplification products in YMV-positive samples are visualized by chromogenic detection with SYBR Green I dye. The CT-RT-LAMP assay detected YMV in leaf and tuber tissues of infected plants. The assay is 100 times more sensitive in detecting YMV than standard RT-PCR, while maintaining the same specificity.

3514,Two Methods for Increased Specificity and Sensitivity in Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,2015-04-07,"The technique of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) utilizes four (or six) primers targeting six (or eight) regions within a fairly small segment of a genome for amplification, with concentration higher than that used in traditional PCR methods. The high concentrations of primers used leads to an increased likelihood of non-specific amplification induced by primer dimers. In this study, a set of LAMP primers were designed targeting the prfA gene sequence of Listeria monocytogenes, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as well as Touchdown LAMP were employed to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP reactions. The results indicate that the detection limit of this novel LAMP assay with the newly designed primers and additives was 10 fg per reaction, which is ten-fold more sensitive than a commercial Isothermal Amplification Kit and hundred-fold more sensitive than previously reported LAMP assays. This highly sensitive LAMP assay has been shown to detect 11 strains of Listeria monocytogenes, and does not detect other Listeria species (including Listeria innocua and Listeria invanovii), providing some advantages in specificity over commercial Isothermal Amplification Kits and previously reported LAMP assay.","Wang, De-Guo; Brewster, Jeffrey D.; Paul, Moushumi; Tomasula, Peggy M.",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6272222/,252
3675,Phylogeographic investigation of 2014 porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) transmission in Taiwan,2019-03-06,"The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that emerged and spread throughout Taiwan in 2014 triggered significant concern in the country’s swine industry. Acknowledging the absence of a thorough investigation at the geographic level, we used 2014 outbreak sequence information from the Taiwan government’s open access databases plus GenBank records to analyze PEDV dissemination among Taiwanese pig farms. Genetic sequences, locations, and dates of identified PEDV-positive cases were used to assess spatial, temporal, clustering, GIS, and phylogeographic factors affecting PEDV dissemination. Our conclusion is that S gene sequences from 2014 PEDV-positive clinical samples collected in Taiwan were part of the same Genogroup 2 identified in the US in 2013. According to phylogenetic and phylogeographic data, viral strains collected in different areas were generally independent of each other, with certain clusters identified across different communities. Data from GIS and multiple potential infection factors were used to pinpoint cluster dissemination in areas with large numbers of swine farms in southern Taiwan. The data indicate that the 2014 Taiwan PEDV epidemic resulted from the spread of multiple strains, with strong correlations identified with pig farm numbers and sizes (measured as animal concentrations), feed mill numbers, and the number of slaughterhouses in a specifically defined geographic area.","Sung, Ming-Hua; Lin, Chao-Nan; Chiou, Ming-Tang; Cheng, I-Ju; Thanh, Quang-Hien; Chao, Day-Yu; Lan, Yu-Ching",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6402684/,252
4474,A novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for efficient and robust detection of EGFR mutations,2020-01-14,"Gene transcription profiles across tissues are largely defined by the activity of regulatory elements, most of which correspond to regions of accessible chromatin. Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissues—liver, lung, and kidney—in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.","Keele, Gregory R.; Quach, Bryan C.; Israel, Jennifer W.; Chappell, Grace A.; Lewis, Lauren; Safi, Alexias; Simon, Jeremy M.; Cotney, Paul; Crawford, Gregory E.; Valdar, William; Rusyn, Ivan; Furey, Terrence S.",PLoS Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010298/,252
5283,"A disposable, integrated loop-mediated isothermal amplification cassette with thermally actuated valves",2011-03-18,"Contrasting results have been reported concerning the association of a splice-site polymorphism (rs10774671) in OAS1 with multiple sclerosis (MS). We analysed two OAS1 regions encompassing alternatively spliced exons. While the region carrying the splice-site variant is neutrally evolving, a signature of long-standing balancing selection was observed across an alternative exon 7. Analysis of variants in this exon identified an insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs11352835, A/−) that originates predicted products with distinct C termini. This variant is located along the major branch of the haplotype genealogy, suggesting that it may represent the selection target. A case/control study for MS indicated that rs11352835 is associated with disease susceptibility (for an allelic model with the deleted allele predisposing to MS, OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.072–1.513, p = 0.010). No association was found between rs10774671 and MS. As the two SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium in Europeans, the previously reported association between rs10774671 and MS susceptibility might be driven by rs11352835, possibly explaining the contrasting results previously observed for the splice-site polymorphism. Thus, we describe a novel susceptibility variant for MS in OAS1 and show that population genetic analyses can be instrumental to the identification of selection targets and, consequently, of functional polymorphisms with an effect on phenotypic traits.

11343,Evaluation of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Technique for the Rapid Visual Detection of Hepatozoon canis Infection,2019-11-15,"BACKGROUND: While institution-sponsored wellness programs may be effective, little is known about their availability and utilization in pediatric subspecialists, and about programs physicians wish were available. METHODS: A survey of perceptions about, and availability and utilization of institutional wellness activities, was distributed electronically to pediatric subspecialists nationally. Bivariate analyses were performed using χ(2) tests or independent t tests. Multivariable logistic regression models for categories of institution-sponsored programming as a function of potential predictors of program utilization were performed. Qualitative content analysis was performed for free-text survey answers. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of respondents participated in institution-sponsored wellness opportunities. Debriefs, Schwartz Center Rounds, mental health services, and team building events were the most available institution-sponsored wellness activities, whereas debriefs, team building, Schwartz Center Rounds, and pet therapy were most frequently utilized. Respondents desired greater social/emotional support, improved leadership, enhanced organizational support, and modifications to the physical work environment, with no significant differences across subspecialties for “wish list” items. CONCLUSIONS: Physician wellness requires more than a “one-size-fits-all” initiative. Our data highlight the importance of encouraging and normalizing self-care practices, and of listening to what physicians articulate about their needs. Pre-implementation needs assessment allows a “bottom-up” approach where physician voices can be heard.","Kase, Samuel M.; Gribben, Jeanie L.; Waldman, Elisha D.; Weintraub, Andrea S.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223747/,252

The precise role of robot-assisted laparoscopic esophagectomy (RALE) is still evolving. Single center retrospective analysis of TLE and RALE performed for carcinoma esophagus between January 2015 and September 2018. Propensity score matching was done between the groups for age, gender, BMI, ASA grade, tumor location, neoadjuvant therapy, the extent of surgical resection (Ivor Lewis or McKeown’s), histopathological type (squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma), clinical T and N stages. The primary outcome parameter was lymph node yield. Secondary outcome parameters were resection margin status, duration of surgery, blood loss, conversion to open procedure, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, complications, 90-day mortality and cost. There were 90 patients in TLE and 25 patients in RALE group. After propensity matching, there were 22 patients in each group. The lymph node yield was similar in both the groups (23.95 ± 8.23 vs 22.73 ± 11.63; p = 0.688). There were no conversions or positive resection margins in either group. RALE was associated with longer operating duration (513.18 ± 91.23 min vs 444.77 ± 64.91 min; p = 0.006) and higher cost ($5271.75 ± 456.46 vs $4243.01 ± 474.64; p < 0.001) than TLE.

Infodemia looks at excessive amount of information circulating, which makes it difficult to orientate communities on a given topic due to the difficulty of identifying reliable sources. Using text mining analysis it is possible to identify what drives public conversation and impact of Covid-19. METHODS: Public perceptions in emergencies is traditionally measured with surveys. However, to have a global sight of the pandemia, Twitter represents a powerful tool which gives real-time monitoring of public perception. The study aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms “Covid-19” or “Coronarivus” over time; and 2) to conduct a specific text and sentiment analysis. RESULTS: Between January 10 and May 8, 2020, over 600 million tweets were retrieved. Of those 600.000 tweets were randomly selected, coded, and analyzed. About 10% of cases were identified as misinformation. Public figures, experts in public health, and virologists represent the most popular sources in comparison to the official government and health agencies. There is a positive correlation between Twitter activity peaks and COVID-19 infection peaks. Text mining analysis was carried out, as well as a content analysis, also in order to identify changing emotions and sentiments during time. This analysis, particularly during the lockdown, clearly shows that participation on social media can potentially have an effect on building social capital and social support. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that using social media to conduct infodemic studies is an important area of development in public health arena. COVID-19 tweets were primarily used to disseminate information from credible sources, but were also a source of opinions, emotion and experiences. Tweets can be used for real-time content analysis and knowledge translation research, allowing health authorities to respond to public concerns.

Drawing upon original research findings from two types of internal migrants in Cambodia, we make a twin contention: first, that excessive levels of microfinance borrowing by garment workers are part-outcome of the failings of the DW programme to engender ‘decent enough work’, and second, that microfinance borrowing is actually eroding rather than contributing to the prospect of decent work for debt-bonded brickmakers in the country. The data presented on two of the largest sectors contributing to Cambodia’s growth in recent decades, enable the paper to show how microfinance and labour precarity are intertwined through the over-indebtedness of workers in both cases. The paper ultimately looks to caution the ILO on its current promotion of financial inclusion and microfinance in particular, stressing the need for significant sectoral reforms before this form of credit can be considered to align with the core principles of the DW programme.","Natarajan, Nithya; Brickell, Katherine; Guermond, Vincent; Lawreniuk, Sabina; Parsons, Laurie",GPPG,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490844/,252

The purpose of this article is to describe a synchronous telehealth exercise intervention in older PWH, delivered from one medical center to two other centers. Eighty older PWH (≥50 years) on antiretroviral therapy will be randomized to exercise or delayed entry control groups. Functional circuit exercise training, which does not entail stationary equipment, will be provided by real-time videoconferencing, 3 times weekly for 12 weeks, to small groups. Continuous remote telemonitoring of heart rate will ensure high exercise intensity. We hypothesize that telehealth exercise will be feasible and increase cardiorespiratory fitness and reduce sarcopenia and frailty.

79920,Evaluation of a Direct Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Method without RNA Extraction (direct RT-LAMP) for the Detection of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer.,2021-04-26,"BACKGROUND Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder that often occurs in people over 65 years old. As advanced AD is difficult to manage, accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical. Previous studies have revealed effective deep learning methods of classification. However, deep learning methods require a large number of image datasets. Moreover, medical images are affected by various environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). RESULTS The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed network were 86.09%, 80.00%, and 92.96% (respectively) using our dataset, and 91.02%, 87.93%, and 93.57% (respectively) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We observed that our model classified AD and normal cognitive (NC) cases based on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological changes occur in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered statistically significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition, performance comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed no statistically significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The proposed model demonstrated the effectiveness of AD classification using the GAP layer. Our model learned the AD features from PCC in both the ADNI and Severance datasets, which can be seen in the heatmap. Furthermore, we showed that there were no significant differences in performance using statistical analysis.","Kim, Han Woong; Lee, Ha Eun; Oh, KyeongTaek; Lee, Sangwon; Yun, Mijin; Yoo, Sun K",Biomedical engineering online,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-020-00813-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894137/,252

98289,Ivermectin Docks to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-binding Domain Attached to ACE2.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Previous studies have suggested that high volume hemofiltration (HVHF) may contribute to revert hypotension in severe hyperdynamic septic shock patients. However, arterial pressure stabilization occurs due to an increase in systemic vascular resistance, which could eventually compromise microcirculatory blood flow and perfusion. The goal of this study was to determine if HVHF deteriorates sublingual microcirculation in severe hyperdynamic septic shock patients. METHODS This was a prospective, non-randomized study at a 16-bed, medical-surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. We included 12 severe hyperdynamic septic shock patients (norepinephrine requirements > 0.3 μg/kg/min and cardiac index > 3.0 L/min/m2) who underwent a 12-hour HVHF as a rescue therapy according to a predefined algorithm. Sublingual microcirculation (Microscan for NTSC, Microvision Medical), systemic hemodynamics and perfusion parameters were assessed at baseline, at 12 hours of HVHF, and 6 hours after stopping HVHF. RESULTS Microcirculatory flow index increased after 12 hours of HVHF and this increase persisted 6 hours after stopping HVHF. A similar trend was observed for the proportion of perfused microvessels. The increase in microcirculatory blood flow was inversely correlated with baseline levels. There was no significant change in microvascular density or heterogeneity during or after HVHF. Mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance increased while lactate levels decreased after the 12-hour HVHF. CONCLUSIONS The use of HVHF as a rescue therapy in patients with severe hyperdynamic septic shock does not deteriorate sublingual microcirculatory blood flow despite the increase in systemic vascular resistance.","Ruiz, Carolina; Hernandez, Glenn; Godoy, Cristian; Downey, Patricio; Andresen, Max; Bruhn, Alejandro",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc9271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875109/,252

RESULTS The published results of SARS-CoV-2 structures and interactomics have been used to identify potential therapeutic candidates. We illustrate recent publications on SARS-CoV-2, concerning its molecular, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics, and focus oninnovative diagnostics technologies in the production pipeline. This objective of this review is to enhance the comprehension of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2and strengthen future control measures.","Aljabali, Alaa A A; Bakshi, Hamid A; Satija, Saurabh; Metha, Meenu; Prasher, Parteek; Ennab, Raed M; Chellapan, Dinesh Kumar; Gupta, Gaurav; Negi, Poonam; Goyal, Rohit; Sharma, Ashish; Mishra, Vijay; Dureja, Harish; Dua, Kamal; Tambuwala, Murtaza M",Pharmaceutical nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.2174/2211738508999200817163335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811406/,252
116656,Repurposing drugs against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2: mechanism-based insights supported by available laboratory and clinical data.,2020-07-22,"BACKGROUND Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is an alternative modality for treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) with its less invasiveness and acceptable surgical outcomes. However, a few reports have been introduced for wound management to achieve better cosmetic wound healing and for placement of the chest tube in uniportal VATS. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of our novel method for wound closure and concomitant tube placement using continuous barbed suture material in uniportal VATS for PSP. METHODS Between July 2012 and December 2015, consecutive 31 patients (22 males) underwent uniportal VATS to treat PSP. Bilateral approaches were performed in four patients, thus total 35 cases were enrolled. We divided them into two groups with one group of 17 (48.5%) cases (group A), using barbed absorbable wound closure device for knotless continuous wound closure and subsequent chest tube anchoring, and the other group of 18 (51.4%) cases (group B), using conventional suture anchoring after skin closure using absorbable suture device. Postoperative surgical outcomes were compared to assess the feasibility of this technique. RESULTS Demographic data demonstrate no significant difference in both groups. There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay (3.7±1.2 vs. 4.1±1.2 days, P=0.267) and in median chest tube indwelling time (2.4±0.9 vs. 3.1±1.2 days, P=0.066), respectively. Operation time in group A was shorter than in group B but there was no significant difference (41.7±11.8 vs. 45.6±16.0 minutes, P=0.415). There was neither conversion to two or three port VATS in all cases. In group A, all chest tubes were removed with concomitant sealing the tube removal site by pulling the thread. Residual knots do not exist that stitch out procedure is not required. There was no wound complication in both groups during the median follow-up period of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS Knotless, barbed suture material technique for continuous wound closure with concomitant chest tube placement achieved equivocal outcomes in comparison to the conventional suture anchoring method. We suggest this simple technique for wound closure and easy tube removal with cosmetic wound healing in uniportal VATS for PSP.","Kim, Kyung Soo",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2017.03.163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616277/,252
117776,"Simple, Rapid and Sensitive Portable Molecular Diagnosis of SFTS Virus Using Reverse Transcriptional Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP).",2018,"OBJECTIVES Watertight dural closure is imperative after neurosurgical procedures because inadequately treated leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can have serious consequences. In this study, the authors test the use of a new gelatin glue as a dural sealant in in vitro and in vivo canine models of transdural CSF leakage. METHODS The in vitro model was sutured semicircles of canine dura mater and artificial dural substitute. The sutures were sealed with gelatin glue (n = 20), fibrin glue (n = 20), or a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogel sealant (n = 20). Each sample was set in a device to measure water pressure, and pressure was increased until leakage occurred. Bonding strength was subjectively evaluated. The in vivo model was dogs who underwent dural excision and received either no sealant (control group; n = 5) or gelatin glue sealant (n = 5) before dural closure. Twenty-eight days post-surgery, the maximum intracranial pressure was measured at the cisterna magna using Valsalva maneuver and tissue adhesion was evaluated. RESULTS The water pressure at which leakage occurred in the in vitro model was higher with gelatin glue (76·5 ± 39·8 mmHg) than with fibrin glue (38·3 ± 27·4 mmHg, P < 0·001) or the PEG-based hydrogel sealant (46·3 ± 20·9 mmHg, P = 0·007). Bonding strength was higher for the gelatin glue than fibrin glue (P < 0·001) or PEG-based hydrogel sealant (P = 0·001). The maximum intracranial pressure in the in vivo model was higher for the gelatin glue group (59·0 ± 2·2 mmHg) than the control group (13·8 ± 4·0 mmHg, P < 0·001). Tissue adhesion was lower for the gelatin glue group than the control group (P = 0·005). DISCUSSION The new gelatin glue provides an effective watertight closure when used as an adjunct to sutured dural repair.","Kawai, Hisashi; Nakagawa, Ichiro; Nishimura, Fumihiko; Motoyama, Yasushi; Park, Young-Su; Nakamura, Mitsutoshi; Nakase, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Shuko; Ikada, Yoshito",Neurological research,https://doi.org/10.1179/1743132814y.0000000342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601724/,252

This study aimed to identify its effects on sports medicine physicians during the early phase of this pandemic. DESIGN Survey study. SETTING Sports medicine providers. PARTICIPANTS Physician members of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine were surveyed between March 25 and April 4, 2020. A total of 810 responses were obtained from 2437 physicians who viewed the survey. INTERVENTIONS The survey consisted of questions examining demographics, prepandemic practice patterns, anxiety and depression screening, and new beliefs and behaviors following government-based medical policy changes resulting from the pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Changes in clinical volume and treatment practices, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). RESULTS The mean in-person clinic visits reduced to 17.9%, telephone visits to 24.4%, telemedicine (video) visits to 21.8%, and procedural visits to 13.8% of prepandemic practice volume. The mean PHQ-4 scores for physicians were 2.38 ± 2.40. Clinic and procedural volumes were reduced less by male physicians, as well as more experienced physicians, nonphysical medicine and rehabilitation training background, in government or private practice, and in the Southern region of the United States (P < 0.05). Physicians were more likely to reduce their anti-inflammatory (37.8% decreasing vs 6.8% increasing, P < 0.001) and opioid (10.5% vs 6.8%, P = 0.003) prescriptions rather than increase. CONCLUSIONS During the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic sports medicine physicians reported reducing in-person evaluation, management, and procedure volume by over 80%. Multiple demographic and geographic factors were associated with practice volume changes.","Cushman, Daniel M; Teramoto, Masaru; Babu, Ashwin; Olafsen, Nathan; Onishi, Kentaro; Asay, Alexandra; McCormick, Zachary L",Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jsm.0000000000000905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33675623/,252

Abundant scientific evidence showed that dromedary camels are the primary host of the virus. Majority of human cases (i.e., 75% or 88%) are due to human-to-human transmission, while the others are due to camel-to-human transmission. Mathematical modeling of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus camel-to-camel transmission was lacking. Using the plug-and-play likelihood-based inference framework, we fitted a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible model of camels to the reported human cases with a constant proportion of human cases from camels (i.e., either 25% or 12%). We considered two scenarios: (i) the transmission rate among camels is time-varying with a constant spill-over rate from camels to human or (ii) the spill-over rate is time-varying with a constant transmission rate among camels. Our estimated loss-of-immunity rate and prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections among camels largely matched with previous serological or virological studies, shedding light on this issue. We recommended including dromedary camels in animal surveillance and control of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia which could help reduce their sporadic introductions to humans.","Lin, Qianying; Chiu, Alice Py; Zhao, Shi; He, Daihai",Statistical methods in medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280217746442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29846148/,252
134895,A Combination of Receptor-Binding Domain and N-Terminal Domain Neutralizing Antibodies Limits the Generation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Neutralization-Escape Mutants.,2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetically inherited, life-limiting condition, affecting ~90,000 people globally. Physical activity (PA) and exercise form an integral component of CF management, and have been highlighted by the CF community as an area of interest for future research. Previous reviews have solely focused on PA or structured exercise regimens independent of one another, and thus a comprehensive assessment of the physical health benefits of all PA, including exercise, interventions, is subsequently warranted. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to evaluate the effects of both PA and exercise upon outcomes of physical health and healthcare utilisation in people with CF. METHODS A systematic review has been registered and reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-P guidelines. This will include randomised control trials on the effects of PA and exercise, relative to usual treatment, upon people with CF. Primary outcomes will include variables associated with fitness, PA, lung health, inflammation, body composition, glycaemic control and patient-reported outcomes. Secondary outcomes will include adverse events and healthcare utilisation. Searches will be undertaken in Ovid MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, PsychINFO, ERIC, SPORTDiscus, ASSIA, CCTR, CINHAL and Web of Science databases, and will be searched from date of inception onwards. Two reviewers will independently screen citations and abstracts, and full-texts, for inclusion and data extraction, respectively. Methodological quality will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 tool. If feasible, random-effects meta-analyses will be conducted where appropriate. Additional analyses will explore potential sources of heterogeneity, such as age, sex, and disease severity. DISCUSSION This systematic review will build on previous research, by comprehensively assessing the impact of both PA and exercise upon physical health and healthcare utilisation in people with CF. Results of this review will be utilised to inform discussions that will ultimately result in a consensus document on the impact of physical activity and exercise for people with CF.

136621,Computational screening for potential drug candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.,2020,"Objectives. To identify spatiotemporal patterns of epidemic spread at the community level.Methods. We extracted influenza cases reported between 2016 and 2019 and COVID-19 cases reported in March and April 2020 from a hospital network in Rhode Island. We performed a spatiotemporal hotspot analysis to simulate a real-time surveillance scenario.Results. We analyzed 6527 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and identified microepidemics in more than 1100 neighborhoods, and more than half of the neighborhoods that had hotspots in a season became hotspots in the next season. We used data from 731 COVID-19 cases, and we found that a neighborhood was 1.90 times more likely to become a COVID-19 hotspot if it had been an influenza hotspot in 2018 to 2019.Conclusions. The use of readily available hospital data allows the real-time identification of spatiotemporal trends and hotspots of microepidemics.Public Health Implications. As local governments move to reopen the economy and ease physical distancing, the use of historic influenza hotspots could guide early prevention interventions, while the real-time identification of hotspots would enable the implementation of interventions that focus on small-area containment and mitigation.

METHODS between May 2009 and March 2010, nine nephrectomies and one cyst decortication were performed in nine patients. Eight of the procedures were done with three 5mm trocars inserted through a unique peri-umbilical incision. In two cases, a specific single-port device was used. All operations were achieved with a 5-mm 30° lens and conventional laparoscopic instruments. The specimens were entrapped in a 10mm endoscopic bag and extracted through the umbilical incision. RESULTS mean age was 56 years old. Mean BMI was 23.5 [19-34]. Mean operative time was 149min [80-240], and estimated blood loss was 90ml [20-250]. None of the patients required blood transfusion. Mean length of stay was 4.1 days [3-5]. Only one major complication occurred (functional occlusion). One conversion to conventional laparoscopy was necessary in a case of inflammatory kidney. Histologic exam showed benign lesions (cyst and non functional kidney) in seven cases, and papillary carcinoma in three cases. CONCLUSION LESS surgery is feasible. Its advantages over conventional laparoscopy are not clear. LESS is a new procedure that should benefit from the improvement of technical instrumentation.","Verhoest, G; Patard, J-J; Delreux, A; Crepel, M; Manunta, A; Vincendeau, S; Guille, F; Bensalah, K",Progres en urologie : journal de l'Association francaise d'urologie et de la Societe francaise d'urologie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.purol.2010.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21193142/,252

As the N-terminal macro domain can bind poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), and PAR polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is activated and autoribosylated during Sindbis virus (SINV) infection, it was hypothesized that PARP-1 and nsP3 may interact. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that PARP-1 interacted with nsP3 during SINV infection of NSC34 neuronal cells and was most abundantly present in replication complexes that contained plus- and minus-strand SINV RNAs 10-14 h after infection, prior to PARP-1 activation or automodification with PAR. Treatment with an inhibitor of PARP enzymic activity did not affect the interaction between nsP3 and PARP-1 or SINV replication. Co-expression of individual domains of nsP3 with PARP-1 showed that nsP3 interacted with PARP-1 through the C-terminal domain, not the N-terminal macro domain, and that phosphorylation was not required. It was concluded that PARP-1 interacts with the C-terminal domain of nsP3, is present in replication complexes during virus amplification and may play a role in regulating virus RNA synthesis in neuronal cells.","Park, Eunhye; Griffin, Diane E",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.012682-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19515826/,252

In the current study, we screened the transcriptional profile of human lung epithelial A549 cells infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) by microarray assay. Seventy-nine long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 140 mRNAs were differentially expressed (DE). The bioinformatics analysis revealed that the mRNAs adjacent to the DE lncRNAs were closely related to the host responses to viral infection. We selected 7 lncRNAs from the top 50 hits for validation. The quantitative real-time PCR data confirmed that expression of selected lncRNAs was induced by ZIKV infection. Moreover, the expression of 7 lncRNAs was induced by infection of dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, or vesicular stomatitis virus, or by treatment of poly(I:C) and IFN-β. Furthermore, loss of innate immune adaptor IPS-1 or receptor IFNAR1 resulted in lower induction levels of several lncRNAs by ZIKV. Overexpression of 3 lncRNAs (RPL27-OT1, OASL-IT1, and REC8-OT3) reduced the virus yields of ZIKV. Knockout of OASL-IT1 significantly enhanced ZIKV replication. In OASL-IT1 knockout cells, the levels of interferons (IFNs) and the activation of 3 innate immune signaling pathways triggered by ZIKV were dramatically reduced. Collectively, our work found a positive feedback loop in the IFN system, in which IFNs and OASL-IT1 regulate each other, thereby promoting establishment of antiviral defense.","Wang, Yi; Huo, Zhiting; Lin, Quanshi; Lin, Yuxia; Chen, Cancan; Huang, Yanxia; Huang, Changbai; Zhang, Junsong; He, Junfang; Liu, Chao; Zhang, Ping",Journal of innate immunity,https://doi.org/10.1159/000513606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33626545/,252

The first-quarter financial statements are reported with weak monitoring of accounting information, resulting in managers' opportunistic attitudes. We used discretionary asset impairment losses not the actual asset impairment amount, and the two-way fixed effect panel regression model was used to control the unique characteristics of individual companies. We investigated whether asset impairment losses were underreported in 2020 compared to the other year during the period 2015 through 2020. In addition, we identified under what conditions these effects would be enhanced or weakened. The analysis showed that managers underreported discretionary asset impairment losses in the first quarter of 2020 (hypothesis 1). This result indicates that manager's discretionary propensity to delay impairment loss recognition as much as possible until annual profit is finalized and to report quarterly profit as high has increased due to Covid19. Such a tendency was more pronounced among the firms with higher proportion of overseas assets (hypothesis 2) and was weakened among the firms with larger difference in earnings response coefficient measured by the operating profit and that measured by non-operating profit (hypothesis 3). Finally, firms with income-increasing earnings management in the previous year were insignificantly less inclined to underreport discretionary asset impairment loss during the first quarter of 2020 (hypothesis 4). © 2021, Korean Accounting Association.

178440,Discovery of Antiviral Cyclic Peptides Targeting the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2 via mRNA Display,2021-08-24,"Background: Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, protective measures including alcohol-based hand rub, received unexampled popularity in Iran. Alcohol hand rub is effective, inexpensive and simple to use, but it is a flammable liquid, which might cause burn injuries. In this study, we investigated burn injuries due to alcohol hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 disease outbreak in Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on burn patients referred to Motahari Burns and Reconstruction Center from February 20th, 2020 (official announcement of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Iran) up to April 19th, 2020. All outpatients and hospitalized burn injuries caused by alcohol during the abovementioned period were included. Results: There were 76 burn injuries due to the use of alcohol hand sanitizer. Sixty patients were treated outpatient, and 16 were hospitalized. The mean ± SD age of patients was 33.2±17.9 years and most were males (57 individuals, 75%). Also, the mean ± SD of TBSA was 6.1±6.5%. In hospitalized ones, the mean ± SD hospital stay was 11.7±8.6 days. The most burnt area was the head (39.5%) followed by the right upper limb (35.5%) and the left upper limb (23.7%). Patients were actively engaged in burn injury in 61.8% of cases, while they were passively burnt in 34.2% of cases and in 3.9% the mechanism was unknown. Burn injuries mostly happened in the yard (22.4%) followed by the rooftop (21.1%) and outdoors (18.4%). Conclusion: Appropriate general education, especially through mass media, can reduce burns caused by alcohol-based sanitation during the COVID-19 outbreak. Most of these burn injuries involved face and hands, which are cosmetically and functionally important. © 2021. Iran University of Medical Sciences.","Dahmardehei, M.; Rezaiyan, M.

185898,Tannic acid suppresses SARS-CoV-2 as a dual inhibitor of the viral main protease and the cellular TMPRSS2 protease.,2020,"Purpose: As of January 1, 2020, the upper limit of sulfur emissions outside emission control areas decreased from 3.5% to 0.5%. This paper aims to present some of the challenges associated with the implementation of the sulfur cap and investigates its possible side effects as regard the drive of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Even though it would appear that the two issues (desulfurization and decarbonization) are unrelated, it turns out that there are important cross-linkages between them, which have not been examined, at least by the regulators. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and a qualitative risk assessment of possible CO2 contributors are presented first. A cost-benefit analysis is then conducted on a specific case study, so as to assess the financial, as well as the environmental impact of two main compliance choices, in terms of CO2 and sulfur oxide. Findings: From a financial perspective, the choice of a scrubber ranks better comparing to a marine gas oil (MGO) choice because of the price difference between MGO and heavy fuel oil. However, and under different price scenarios, the scrubber choice remains sustainable only for big vessels. It is noticed that small containerships cannot outweigh the capital cost of a scrubber investment and are more sensitive in different fuel price scenarios. From an environmental perspective, scrubber ranks better than MGO in the assessment of overall emissions. Research limitations/implications: Fuel price data in this paper was based on 2019 data. As this paper was being written, the COVID-19 pandemic created a significant upheaval in global trade flows, cargo demand and fuel prices. This made any attempt to perform even a rudimentary ex-post evaluation of the 2020 sulfur cap virtually impossible. Due to limited data, such an evaluation would be extremely difficult even under normal circumstances. This paper nevertheless made a brief analysis to investigate possible COVID-19 impacts. Practical implications: The main implication is that the global sulfur cap will increase CO2 emissions. In that sense, this should be factored in the IMO greenhouse gas discussion. Originality/value: According to the knowledge of the authors, no analysis examining the impact of the 2020 sulfur cap on CO2 emissions has yet been conducted in the scientific literature. © 2021, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.","Zisi, V.; Psaraftis, H.

These cells were almost completely restricted to the CD4-CD8- IEL population, and unlike peripheral NK cells in the rat, they were CD2-. We now report that rat intraepithelial NK (IENK) and peripheral NK cells are similar in morphology, in their ability to lyse NK-sensitive targets, and in their ability to suppress a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture. In contrast, however, intraepithelial and splenic NK cells differ markedly in two respects. First, IENK cells express high levels of ADP-ribosyltransferase 2 (a marker of regulatory T cells in the rat) and CD25, whereas peripheral NK cells do not. Second, unlike splenic NK cells, a substantial fraction of IENK cells appear to spontaneously secrete IL-4 and/or IFN-gamma. We conclude that the rat IEL compartment harbors a large population of NKR-P1A+CD3- cells that function as NK cells but display an activated phenotype and unusual cytokine profile that clearly distinguish them from splenic NK cells. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics suggest that these distinctive IENK cells may participate in the regulation of mucosal immunity.","Todd, D J; Greiner, D L; Rossini, A A; Mordes, J P; Bortell, R",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11564772/,252

207385,Virtual screening of approved clinic drugs with main protease (3CLpro) reveals potential inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Dental academic institutions are affected by COVID-19. We assessed the perceived COVID-19 preparedness of these institutions and the characteristics of institutions with greater perceived preparedness. An international cross-sectional survey of dental academics was conducted from March to August 2020 to assess academics' and institutional attributes, perceived preparedness, and availability of infection prevention and control (IPC) equipment. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified perceived preparedness components. Multilevel linear regression analysis assessed the association between perceived preparedness and fixed effect factors (academics' and institutions' attributes) with countries as random effect variable. Of the 1820 dental academics from 28 countries, 78.4% worked in public institutions and 75.2% reported temporary closure. PCA showed five components: clinic apparel, measures before and after patient care, institutional policies, and availability of IPC equipment. Significantly less perceived preparedness was reported in lower-middle income (LMICs) (B = -1.31, p = 0.006) and upper-middle income (UMICs) (B = -0.98, p = 0.02) countries than in high-income countries (HICs), in teaching only (B = -0.55, p < 0.0001) and in research only (B = -1.22, p = 0.003) than teaching and research institutions and in institutions receiving &#8804;100 patients daily than those receiving >100 patients (B = -0.38, p < 0.0001). More perceived preparedness was reported by academics with administrative roles (B = 0.59, p < 0.0001). Academics from low-income countries (LICs) and LMICs reported less availability of clinic apparel, IPC equipment, measures before patient care, and institutional policies but more measures during patient care. There was greater perceived preparedness in HICs and institutions with greater involvement in teaching, research, and patient care.","Ammar, Nour; Aly, Nourhan M; Folayan, Morenike Oluwatoyin; Khader, Yousef; Mohebbi, Simin Z; Attia, Sameh; Howaldt, Hans-Peter; Boettger, Sebastian; Virtanen, Jorma; Madi, Marwa; Maharani, Diah A; Rahardjo, Anton; Khan, Imran; Al-Batayneh, Ola B; Rashwan, Maher; Pavlic, Verica; Cicmil, Smiljka; Noritake, Kanako; Galluccio, Gabriella; Polimeni, Antonella; Shamala, Anas A; Aarheiam, Arheiam; Mancino, Davide; Phantumvanit, Prathip; Kim, Jin-Bom; Choi, Youn-Hee; Dama, Mai A; Abdelsalam, Maha M; Castillo, Jorge L; Nyan, Myat; Hussein, Iyad; Joury, Easter; Vukovic, Ana P; Iandolo, Alfredo; Kemoli, Arthur M; El Tantawi, Maha",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,252

We study two prominent examples, via secondary data: Japan and the USA. We then analyze digital consumption behaviors and patterns in Portugal. For this, a questionnaire was created - using Google Forms - where both quantitative and qualitative perspectives were gathered. The research sample was a convenience sample, popular in business research, and it included 185 responses from Portuguese citizens. Through a cautious analysis of the primary data obtained, it was possible to compare the consumption levels in an ante- and post-COVID-19 context;what type of products are the most pursued;by whom they are most sought after;what are the most used platforms;and, additionally, the satisfaction levels regarding the use of these platforms. No statistically significant association (chi-square statistic) was found between gender or age and the preference for physical versus online stores. The data also uncovers that there is still a general preference for a more secure, traditional way of life in Portugal due to the fact that people still reveal some insecurities and fears regarding shopping through the Internet and a preference to buy in physical stores, which clearly leads people, in general, to buy online not so regularly as in other countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Plácido, B.; Proença, S.; Moreira, D.; Boução, L.; Branco, F.; Au-Yong-Oliveira, M.","World Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, WorldCIST 2021",,252

218637,High-resolution mining of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease conformational space: supercomputer-driven unsupervised adaptive sampling,2021,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 8-15% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery develop symptomatic gallstone disease within 24 months after surgery. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) seems to effectively prevent the formation of gallstones detectable by ultrasound after bariatric surgery. The aim of the UPGRADE trial is to provide evidence on the prophylactic use of UDCA in preventing symptomatic gallstone disease postoperatively. METHODS: The UPGRADE trial is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicentre trial in patients with morbid obesity undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Patients are randomly assigned to either UDCA 900 mg daily for 6 months or placebo treatment. This paper details the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of this trial and was submitted before outcome data were available. RESULTS: The primary endpoint of this trial is symptomatic gallstone disease within 24 months after bariatric surgery, defined as admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Secondary outcomes consist of the development of gallstones/sludge on ultrasound at 24 months in the gallstone-negative group at baseline, presence of gallstones/sludge on ultrasound at 24 months, number of cholecystectomies, side effects of UDCA, therapy compliance, quality of life, costs and revenues. Analyses will be completed according to this pre-specified SAP. The main analysis will be performed as a standard ITT analysis using the chi-squared test. DISCUSSION: The UPGRADE trial will show if prophylactic use of UDCA reduces the incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery. Unforeseen deviations from the SAP at the time of analysis will be motivated and discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Netherlands Trial Register NL5954 .

The major challenges in drug delivery are cytotoxicity, poor biodistribution, insufficient functionality, ineffective drug incorporation in delivery devices, and subsequent drug release. Clay minerals are a class of nanolayered silicates that have good biocompatibility, high specific surface area, chemical inertness, colloid, and thixotropy, and are attractive practical and potential nanomaterials in medicine. These properties enable the usage of nanoclays as drug carriers for the delivery of antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs, anti-psychotic, and anticancer drugs. The review examines the latest advances in nanoclay-based drug delivery systems and related applications in gene therapy and tissue engineering. Clay minerals, particularly montmorillonite, kaolinite, and halloysite are used to delay and/or target drug release or even improve drug dissolution due to their surface charge. Chemical modification of clay minerals such as intercalation of ions into the interlayer space of clay minerals or surface modification of clay minerals is a strategy to tune the properties of nanoclays for the loading and release of a drug. The modified nanoclay can take up drugs by encapsulation, immobilization, ion exchange reaction, or electrostatic interactions. Controlled drug release from the drug-clay originates from the incorporation and interactions between the drug and inorganic layers, including electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Montmorillonite has proven non-toxic through hematological, biochemical, and histopathological analyses in rat. Montmorillonite can also act as a potent detoxifier. Halloysite nanotubes can bind synthetic and biological components such as chitosan, gelatin, and alginate innate nanocarriers for the improved loading and controlled release of drugs, proteins, and DNA. The peculiar properties of clay nanoparticles lead to promising applications in drug delivery, gene delivery, tissue engineering, cancer and stem cell isolation, and bioimaging.","Khatoon, Nafeesa; Chu, Mao Quan; Zhou, Chun Hui",J Mater Chem B,,252

Within the RNA genome of infections is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is an essential enzyme that helps in RNA synthesis by catalysing the RNA template-dependent development of phosphodiester bonds. Therefore, RdRp is an important therapeutic target in RNA virus-caused diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we describe the promising RdRp inhibitors that have been launched or are currently in clinical studies for the treatment of RNA virus infections. Structurally, nucleoside inhibitors (NIs) bind to the RdRp protein at the enzyme active site, and nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) bind to the RdRp protein at allosteric sites. By reviewing these inhibitors, more precise guidelines for the development of more promising anti-RNA virus drugs should be set, and due to the current health emergency, they will eventually be used for COVID-19 treatment.","Tian, Lei; Qiang, Taotao; Liang, Chengyuan; Ren, Xiaodong; Jia, Minyi; Zhang, Jiayun; Li, Jingyi; Wan, Minge; YuWen, Xin; Li, Han; Cao, Wenqiang; Liu, Hong",Eur J Med Chem,,252

Yet, not all people are being affected by this crisis equally. In the United States, this pandemic has exacerbated long-standing inequities and entrenched structural racism. At the onset of the crisis, few data were available detailing the demographic characteristics of individuals with COVID-19. However, as data emerged, it became apparent that communities of color were disproportionately affected. To illustrate these inequities, we analyzed publicly available race and ethnicity data on COVID-19 cases and deaths and were one of the first groups to compile these findings. We launched a social media campaign to highlight these racial and ethnic inequities and raise awareness among public and elected officials. Given the tremendous amount of missing data, we demanded transparency in state reporting of race and ethnicity data. Using both messaging and mapping tools, we publicized state and city efforts to address these inequities, focusing on the creation of task forces tackling the racial inequities of COVID-19. As racial and ethnic data on COVID-19 cases and mortality became more widely reported, statistics emerged about the downstream effects of these inequities. Despite initial false reassurance that COVID-19 largely spared children, the pandemic has exacerbated many social needs, leading to significant negative impacts on children. For example, as pediatricians, we saw how worsening food insecurity was affecting children. Using social media and infographics, we launched an additional stage of the campaign to illustrate these inequities and highlight advocacy opportunities.","Jain, Rohini; Kelly, Colleen A; Mehta, Sagar; Tolliver, Destiny; Stewart, Amanda; Perdomo, Joanna",Pediatrics,,252

Especially, large numbers of agents render the sampling infeasible. Model reduction to a metapopulation model leads to a significant gain in computational efficiency, while preserving important dynamical properties. Based on a precise mathematical description of spatio-temporal ABMs, we present two different metapopulation approaches (stochastic and piecewise deterministic) and discuss the approximation steps between the different models within this framework. Especially, we show how the stochastic metapopulation model results from a Galerkin projection of the underlying ABM onto a finite-dimensional ansatz space. Finally, we utilize our modeling framework to provide a conceptual model for the spreading of COVID-19 that can be scaled to real-world scenarios.","Winkelmann, Stefanie; Zonker, Johannes; Schütte, Christof; Conrad, Natasa Djurdjevac",Math Biosci,,252
235302,Using integrated computational approaches to identify safe and rapid treatment for SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Fixed orthodontic treatment has been compromised at many levels during the pandemic period, as clinics underwent a prolonged lockdown and patients could not be treated regularly. With the end of the pandemic nowhere in sight, may be it is time to put newer tools, such as clear aligner therapy, for better use. Fixed orthodontic appliances by nature are not always self-limiting, which, if left unmonitored over a long period may cause undesirable side effects, pain, and discomfort. The undesired tooth movements that may occur with arch wire-guided mechanics in addition to problems with cut wires or removed brackets may be minimized with the use of aligners. While the benefits of using aligners are for all to see, they do require extensive planning and careful evaluation of the progress. This article reviews the advantages of using aligners during the pandemic period and how it can be beneficial in helping orthodontists resume their practice.","Marya, Anand; Venugopal, Adith; Vaid, Nikhilesh; Alam, Mohammad Khursheed; Karobari, Mohmed Isaqali",Pain Res Manag,,252
236460,A computational prediction of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein inhibitors from Azadirachta indica (Neem),2020,"Under the prevailing circumstances of the global pandemic of COVID-19, early diagnosis and accurate detection of COVID-19 through tests/screening and, subsequently, isolation of the infected people would be a proactive measure. Artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions, using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and exploiting the Deep Learning model's diagnostic capabilities, have been studied in this paper. Transfer Learning approach, based on VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures, has been used to develop an algorithm to detect COVID-19 from CT scan images consisting of Healthy (Normal), COVID-19, and Pneumonia categories. This paper adopts data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques to improve and optimize the VGG16 and ResNet50 model. Further, stratified 5-fold cross-validation has been conducted to test the robustness and effectiveness of the model. The proposed model performs exceptionally well in case of binary classification (COVID-19 vs. Normal) with an average classification accuracy of more than 99% in both VGG16 and ResNet50 based models. In multiclass classification (COVID-19 vs. Normal vs. Pneumonia), the proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 86.74% and 88.52% using VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures as baseline, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves superior performance and can be used for automated detection of COVID-19 from CT scans.","Mishra, Narendra Kumar; Singh, Pushpendra; Joshi, Shiv Dutt",,,252
237522,Exploring the genomic and proteomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein: A computational biology approach,2020,"Presently, approved medicines do not exist to treat enterocutaneous fistulas. Somatostatin and its synthetic analogue octreotide are the more widely used with this purpose. However, the evidence supporting its use is still insufficient. Objective: The therapeutic effects of octreotide was investigated in an experimental model of enterocutaneous fistula. Methods: In twenty male Wistar rats weighing 210±17g a jejunocutaneous fistula was surgically done. After that, the animals had been randomly divided into three groups. In the group A (n=10) octreotide was administered once a day (4 m g/kg/body wt/s.c) while in the group B (n=10) the rats were injected with saline solution in similar amount to the used to dilute octreotide. The group C (n=10) had no fistula. The rodents had been inspected regarding the daily volume of the fistula output, the necessary time for its spontaneous healing, clinical and biochemical evaluation, RBC count, and nutritional state. Results: There was a fourfold faster spontaneous fistula healing in the rats treated with octreotide and they had not had significant clinical, biochemical, hematologic, or body weight reduction during the experiment. On the other hand, in the group B there was a sixty percent of body weight loss, with forty percent of the rats showing cachexia. Other important findings in this group was marked anemia, hypoglobulinemia, and profound hypoalbuminemia. Conclusion: The octreotide is better then placebo and they allow to say that, according to the strict conditions of the experiment, the drug was effective in the healing of uncomplicated enterocutaneous fistulas in rats.","da Cunha Medeiros, Aldo; Medeiros Cunha de Melo, Nara; Maria de Brito Macedo, Lidiane; Coutinho de Medeiros, Ivanildo; Medeiros Dantas Filho, Antônio; Aires Neto, Tertuliano",Acta cir. bras.,,252

In response, alcohol industry representatives encouraged the WA Government to remove the restrictions and replace them with a voluntary alcohol industry initiative. We looked at alcohol industry representatives' comments in media and online publications during this period. We found that the industry framed alcohol as an essential product, focused on the impact of the restrictions on WA businesses and framed the restrictions as complex and ineffective. The themes and arguments we identified are commonly used by the alcohol industry and are not unique to the pandemic. The alcohol industry's response to the COVID-19 restrictions in Australia provides a unique case study of how the alcohol industry attempts to interfere in public health policy.","Keric, Danica; Stafford, Julia",Drug alcohol rev,,252

DESIGN: Pooled cross-sectional survey data. SETTING: Health Information National Trends Survey. PARTICIPATION: Data included 6 iterations of U.S. adults (Pooled: N = 19,496; 2007: N = 3,593; 2011: N = 3,959; 2013: N = 3,185; FDA 2015: N = 3,738; 2017: N = 3,285; and FDA 2017: N = 1,736). MEASURES: Outcome variables were health information seeking, high confidence, and high trust of health information from several sources. Independent variables were education and income group, controlling for other sociodemographic variables. ANALYSIS: Weighted descriptive and multivariate logistic regression for the pooled sample assessed associations by education and income. Fully interacted models with education/income-survey year interactions compared differences in outcomes between years. RESULTS: We found information seeking, confidence, and trust were associated with income and education, which supported previously reported findings. Additionally, our findings indicated low-and medium-income groups had significantly lower odds of seeking health information compared to those in a high-income group. Regarding trust of information, a high school education was associated with higher odds of trust in family and friends. We also found that, over time, information seeking, confidence, and trust behavior differed by income and education, with some differences persisting. CONCLUSION: Disparities by income and education in trust of information sources remained across time. Understanding optimal information sources, their reach, and their credibility among groups could enable more targeted interventions and health messaging. We also describe the implications for our findings in the context of COVID-19.","Fareed, Naleef; Jonnalagadda, Pallavi; Swoboda, Christine M; Samineni, Pranav; Griesenbrock, Tyler; Huerta, Timothy",Am J Health Promot,,252

Design/methodology/approach: Primary data from six Islamic banks (Al Baraka Bank Ltd, BankIslami Pakistan Ltd, Burj Bank Ltd, Dubai Islamic Bank Ltd, Meezan Bank Ltd and MCB-Islamic Bank Ltd) were analysed using a binary logit method. Findings: The results showed that internal factors such as hand sanitisation facilities, strict compliance with wearing a mask before entering the bank, the distance between customers and dealing officers, an organised network of branches (in terms of health safety protocols), the behaviour of dealing officers and extended banking hours contributed significantly to enhancing the satisfaction of Islamic banking customers during the pandemic in Pakistan. The results showed that high service charges on loans have a significant adverse impact on CS. Concerning external factors, the results showed that mass media platforms that can update customers about new services and customer transactions’ processing timing, the number of operational branches in the pandemic period, available parking space in front of a bank and recommendations from family and friends to open an account with a particular bank increase CS levels. Practical implications: The study’s results will be helpful for the policymakers and practitioners to design such policies that can promote the Islamic banking system in developing countries such as Pakistan. Originality/value: Under the pandemic situation, the present study highlights the internal and external determinants of Islamic banking customers’ satisfaction in Pakistan. The study provides a foundation for Islamic Banks to revise their policy frameworks and marketing strategies to attract customer interest and improve their satisfaction levels. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Alharthi, M.; Hanif, I.; Ur Rehman, H.; Alamoudi, H.",Journal of Islamic Marketing,,252

249862,Therapeutic effect of CT-P59 against SARS-CoV-2 South African variant,2021,"We consider a node where packets of fixed size are generated at arbitrary intervals. The node is required to maintain the peak age of information (AoI) at the monitor below a threshold by transmitting potentially a subset of the generated packets. At any time, depending on packet availability and current AoI, the node can choose the packet to transmit, and its transmission speed. We consider a power function (rate of energy consumption) that is increasing and convex in transmission speed, and the objective is to minimize the energy consumption under the peak AoI constraint at all times. For this problem, we propose a (customized) greedy policy, and analyze its competitive ratio (CR) by comparing it against an optimal offline policy by deriving some structural results. We show that for polynomial power functions, the CR upper bound for the greedy policy is independent of the system parameters, such as the peak AoI, packet size, time horizon, or the number of packets generated. Also, we derive a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any causal policy, and show that for exponential power functions (e.g., Shannon rate function), the competitive ratio of any causal policy grows exponentially with increase in the ratio of packet size to peak AoI.","Saurav, Kumar; Vaze, Rahul",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16425v1.pdf,252

In December 2020, we performed an online cross-sectional survey of PWE and their caregivers in Lithuania before the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to the public. The study sample consisted of 111 respondents (44 (39.6%) male, median age 25 years (range 1 to 70)). From 58 PWE who personally responded to the survey, 27 (46.6%) would be willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Among the 53 caregivers, 18 (34.0%) would accept the person they care for to be vaccinated. Willingness to be vaccinated was associated with receiving an influenza shot in 2020 (odds ratio (OR) = 9.17, 95% confidence interval (CI = 1.15-73.47), the beliefs that vaccines are generally safe (OR = 7.90, 95% CI = 2.43-25.74) and that they are the only convenient way to gain immunity (OR = 3.91, 95% CI = 1.02-15.05). Respondents were hesitant to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if they thought it could cause the infection (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.04-0.49). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is frequent among PWE and their caregivers. It is probably related to erroneous beliefs about their safety and mechanism of action.","Puteikis, K.; Mameniskiene, R.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,252
251004,Fisetin 8-C-glucoside as entry inhibitor in SARS CoV-2 infection: molecular modelling study,2020,"The most fundamental function of an epithelial tissue is to act as a barrier, regulating interactions between the external environment and the body. This barrier function typically requires a contiguous cell layer but since teeth penetrate the oral epithelium, a modified barrier has evolved, called the junctional epithelium (JE). In health, the JE attaches to the tooth, sealing the inside of the body against oral micro-organisms. Breakdown of the JE barrier results in periodontal ligament (PDL) disintegration, alveolar bone resorption, and ultimately tooth loss. Using lineage tracing and DNA pulse-chase analyses, we identified an anatomical location in the JE that supported both fast- and slow-cycling Wnt-responsive stem cells that contributed to self-renewal of the tissue. Stem cells produced daughter cells with an extraordinarily high rate of turnover that maintained JE integrity for 1.4 y in mice. Blocking cell proliferation via a chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) eliminated fast-cycling stem cells, which caused JE degeneration, PDL destruction, and bone resorption. Upon removal of 5-Fu, slow-cycling stem cells regenerated both the structure and barrier function of the JE. Taken together, our studies identified a stem cell population in the JE and have potential clinical implications for prevention and treatment of periodontitis.","Yuan, X; Chen, J; Gauer, J; Xu, Q; Van Brunt, L A; Helms, J A",J Dent Res,,252

Collecting data over time is essential for the understanding of the disease spread, the incidence of COVID19-like symptoms, the level and dynamics of immunity, as well as the long-term impact of the pandemic. ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to set up a longitudinal follow-up of adult participants of serosurveys carried out in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsSerosurvey participants were invited to create an account on the dedicated digital platform Specchio-COVID19 (https://www.specchio-covid19.ch/). Upon registration, an initial questionnaire assessed socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics (including housing conditions, physical activity, diet, alcohol and tobacco consumption), anthropometry, general health, and experience related to COVID-19 (symptoms, COVID-19 test results, quarantines, hospitalizations). Weekly, participants were invited to fill in a short questionnaire with updates on self-reported COVID-19-compatible symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection testing and vaccination. A more detailed questionnaire about mental health, well-being, risk perception, and changes in working conditions was proposed monthly. Supplementary questionnaires were proposed at regular intervals to assess more in depth the impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health, vaccination adherence, health care consumption and changes in health behaviors. At baseline, serology testing allowed to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general population and subgroups of workers. Additionally, seropositive participants and a sample of randomly selected participants were invited for serologic testing at regular intervals in order to monitor both the seropersistance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of the Canton of Geneva. Ethics and disseminationThe study was approved by the Cantonal Research Ethics Commission of Geneva, Switzerland (CCER Project ID 2020-00881). Results will be disseminated in a variety of ways, via the Specchio-COVID19 platform, social media posts, press releases, and through regular scientific dissemination methods (open-access articles, conferences).

It will contribute to obtain a clearer picture of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, for both the general population and targeted subpopulations. C_LIO_LIA major strength of the study is the combined use of serological testing and questionnaires. While regular serological testing will help us to model evolution of the pandemic, self-reported data on socioeconomic characteristics, COVID-19-compatible symptoms, and general and mental health will allow us to monitor the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to thoroughly analyze its effects on several dimensions of health.

256361,Targeting SARS-CoV-2: a systematic drug repurposing approach to identify promising inhibitors against 3C-like proteinase and 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase,2021,"BACKGROUND: Many studies on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients affected by Coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) were recently published. However, the small sample size of infected patients enrolled in most studies did not allow to draw robust conclusions on the COVID-19 impact in PD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in PD patients are different from those observed in the general population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting data on PD patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (PD-COVID+). We extracted prevalence, clinical-demographic data, outcome, and mortality. We also analyzed risk or protective factors based on comparisons between PD-COVID+ and control populations with PD without COVID-19 or without PD with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 16 studies reporting on a total of 11,325 PD patients, 1,061 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median infection prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 8.5%. PD-COVID+ patients had a median age of 74 and a disease duration of 9.4 years. Pooling all PD-COVID+ patients from included studies, 28.6% required hospitalization, 37.1% required levodopa dose increasing, and 18.9% died. The case fatality was higher in PD-COVID+ patients than the general population, with longer PD duration as a possible risk factor for worse outcome. Amantadine and vitamin D were proposed as potential protective factors. CONCLUSION: Available studies indicate a higher case fatality in PD patients affected by COVID-19 than the general population. Conversely, current literature does not definitively clarify whether PD patients are more susceptible to get infected. The potential protective role of vitamin D and amantadine is intriguing but deserves further investigation.","Artusi, Carlo Alberto; Romagnolo, Alberto; Ledda, Claudia; Zibetti, Maurizio; Rizzone, Mario Giorgio; Montanaro, Elisa; Bozzali, Marco; Lopiano, Leonardo",J Parkinsons Dis,,252

The aim was to study subjective well-being in the situation of the pandemic and its relationship to coping and anxiety about coronavirus. 409 people filled Satisfaction With Life Scale, Scale of Positive And Negative Experiences, situational version of COPE, checklists assessing anxiety of infection and anxiety of the negative consequences of the pandemic. The comparison groups were three samples of 98, 66 and 293 people who filled Satisfaction With Life Scale and Scale of Positive And Negative Experiences in 2017 and 2019. There was a lower level of positive emotions among respondents in a situation of self-isolation, but the same level of satisfaction with life and negative emotions. Anxiety about the pandemic is related to higher negative emotions only. Emotionally oriented coping strategies and mental disengagement are associated with a higher level of pandemic anxiety. Problem-oriented and active coping strategies are weakly associated with lower anxiety that could be explained by the lack of ready effective methods of resolving this new and uncertain situation. Anxiety associated with current, acute and imminent risk (such as risk of infection), concentration on emotions and acceptance may not be dysfunctional strategies, as they are not associated with deterioration in overall well-being. On the contrary, attempts to cope with anxiety regarding negative consequences of a pandemic by mental disengagement, substance use and denial are associated with a lower level of satisfaction with life.","Rasskazova, Elena I.; Leontiev, Dmitry A.; Lebedeva, Anna A.",Counsel.

267055,Target SARS-CoV-2: theoretical exploration on clinical suitability of certain drugs,2021,"Over the last year, SARS-CoV-2 caused the infection of more than 80 million people and about 1.8 million deaths. Since the emergence of the first cases in China, this virus has been the focal point of the scientific community and represented the main subject of a large number of research publications. It has been observed that the symptomatology is broad, varying from asymptomatic/mild manifestations to more severe stages of illness, in some cases leading to multi-organ failure and death. Although WHO announced PHEIC since January 30, and invited the researchers to quickly find solutions for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment, there are currently no COVID-19 specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines clinically approved. This led to losses on multiple levels, such as: high number of deaths, health/financial crisis, job loss, school closures, etc. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to properly understand all aspects regarding this virus in order to successfully develop strategies to manage and stop this pandemic. Hence, this paper analysis the current knowledge and provides a comprehensive overview on this novel coronavirus.","Teodorescu, Mirela",Electronic Journal of General Medicine,,252
268659,In silico identification of potential inhibitors from Cinnamon against main protease and spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV-2,2020,"Over the past years, short anti-microbial peptides have drawn growing attention in the research and trade literature because they are usually capable of killing a broad spectrum of pathogens by employing unique mechanisms of action. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of a previously designed peptide named PVP towards the clinical strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro. Secondary structure, cytotoxicity, and membrane-permeabilizing effects of the peptide were also assessed. PVP had a tendency to adopt alpha-helical conformation based upon structural predictions and circular dichroism spectroscopy (in 50% trifluoroethanol). The peptide showed MIC values ranging from 1 to 16 µg/mL against 10 strains of MRSA. In contrast to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, PVP at sub-lethal concentration (1 µg/mL) did not provoke the development of peptide resistance after 14 serial passages. Remarkably, 1 h of exposure to 4 × MBC of PVP (8 µg/mL) was sufficient for total bacterial clearance, whereas 4 × MBC of vancomycin (8 µg/mL) failed to totally eradicate bacterial cells, even after 8 h. PVP showed negligible cytotoxicity against human dermal fibroblasts at concentrations required to kill the MRSA strains. The results of flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy revealed that PVP caused bacterial membrane permeabilization, eventually culminating in cell death. Owing to the potent anti-bacterial activity, fast bactericidal kinetics, and negligible cytotoxicity, PVP has the potential to be used as a candidate antibiotic for the topical treatment of MRSA infections.","Memariani, Hamed; Memariani, Mojtaba; Robati, Reza Mahmoud; Nasiri, Soheila; Abdollahimajd, Fahimeh; Baseri, Zohre; Moravvej, Hamideh",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,,252

The purpose was to explore the impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on children with intellectual disability and their families. The review aimed to explore if the disruption to the systems involved in their care would impact their wellbeing and behavioural presentations. We also measured if there had been an increase in the use of medication. Our focus was on the distress calls, which are requests for urgent clinical review to prevent a crisis.A service review of specialist child and adolescent intellectual disability provision in South Wales was conducted between March and May 2020. The purpose was to explore the impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on children with intellectual disability and their families. The review aimed to explore if the disruption to the systems involved in their care would impact their wellbeing and behavioural presentations. We also measured if there had been an increase in the use of medication. Our focus was on the distress calls, which are requests for urgent clinical review to prevent a crisis.MethodSix clinical areas across three Welsh health boards under the same specialist team were surveyed. Case notes and email correspondence were reviewed to obtain the number and content of crisis calls made to specialist CAMHS across an eight week period during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. Data were gathered on frequency, purpose, and outcome of calls. Comparison data were also collected for the period October 2019 to March 2020.ResultPre-COVID-19: Two crisis calls were identified in two different areas during the pre-COVID period surveyed. Increases in medication and increases in respite care packages were made as a result.During COVID-19 restrictions: 20 different initial distress calls made (children age 9 and 17 years old (M = 13.2);75% were boys) across five of the six clinical areas. Of these 20 calls, 17 were active cases and 3 were new referrals. 95% of calls resulted in medication increases and there were few other interventions used due to COVID-19 constraints. Changes to the child's support system were discussed across all cases and return to school was highlighted as a key protective factor in improved well-being. Differences between clinical areas were also identified.ConclusionThere was a clear increase in distress calls and requests to prescribe or increase psychotropic medication to calm the distress during the ‘lockdown’. Changes in behavioural presentation may have occurred partly due to the disruption to the complex systems that typically support a child and the shift away from community support. Children with intellectual disability and their families are unique and embedded in complex systems comprising schools, respite, and healthcare provision which work together to deliver optimal mental healthcare with psychosocial interventions with medication for higher-risk situations. Any shifts in these systems may lead to an imbalance and a higher likelihood of medication use.","Minhas, Omer Mundy Pippa Stewart Jessica",BJPsych Open,,252

The research group of this cross-sectional study conducted in July-August 2020 was formed by the law enforcement officers. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Burnout Measure-Short Version (BM-SV) and a personal data form prepared by the researchers were used in the study. Data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 16.0 software package program. The PSS scores were higher and significant in the group whose working hours were not increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and they thought that there was a decrease in crime rates and did not need psychological support (p &#8804; .05). The PSS scores were higher and significant in the group who took the warnings about COVID-19 into consideration, were afraid of contracting the virus, did not care about the progress of the epidemic and used the mask correctly. Additionally, the BM-SV scores were higher and significant in the group who stated that they were not afraid of contracting the virus (p &#8804;.05). A comprehensive crisis prevention and intervention system including epidemiological monitoring/observing, screening, referral and targeted interventions should be established to reduce the perceived level of stress and burnout in law enforcement and prevent further mental health problems.","Sener, Harun; Arikan, Inci; Gündüz, Nermin; Gülekci, Yakup",Soc Work Public Health,,252

285362,Identification of potential natural inhibitors of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using a computational docking approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: If left untreated, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) can cause significant distress and impact on functioning throughout the lifespan. Despite the severity of the disorder, there is often a significant delay between the onset of symptoms and successful treatment. This is in part due to delays in recognising OCD symptoms in young people, particularly if the symptom forms are less common. Once OCD is accurately diagnosed, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is known to be an efficacious treatment, sometimes in combination with medication, producing good long-term prognosis. It is therefore important to accurately detect OCD in children and young people so that they can be offered timely intervention. Use of the best tools in clinical and research settings improves detection and diagnosis, as well as enabling the tracking of progress through treatment. The aim of this current paper was to review measurement tools for OCD in young people with a focus on the practicalities of using tools in busy child mental health clinical settings. METHOD: To discover what measurement tools are available for OCD in young people, we conducted a pragmatic literature of measurement tools for OCD in young people. We searched PsycINFO, Med-Line and the Cochrane databases for reports relating to the measurement of OCD. Additionally, we sought information from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance, the Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC) website and the Children and Young People's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (CYP IAPT) Programme. We also reviewed large trials and meta-analyses of the treatment of OCD in young people and communicated with relevant researchers/clinicians. RESULTS: Seventeen questionnaire measurement tools, with variable psychometric properties, and four commonly used semistructured clinician administered interview measures were identified. CONCLUSIONS: There are several measurement tools with good psychometric properties that are useful for initial screening/identification of OCD, as well as formal diagnosis, symptom tracking and treatment evaluation. With the availability of brief screens, as well as online diagnostic measures, such tools should not be a burden on clinical practice, but rather a helpful aid to support clinicians' assessment and treatment of OCD.","Bennett, Sophie D; Coughtrey, Anna E; Shafran, Roz; Heyman, Isobel",Child Adolesc Ment Health,,252

Methods: This is a single-arm study for a preliminary assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of LEP in patients who experienced progression from prior systemic treatments. Pre-treatment tumor tissues were collected to retrospectively evaluate the expression status of PDL1. Results: Thirty-two patients received second-line and above treatment with LEP. Overall, the objective response rate (ORR) was 25%, the disease control rate (DCR) was 78.1%, and the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 40.5%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.9 months (95% CI: 4.7-5.2 months), and the median overall survival (OS) was 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.6-12.3 months). For tolerability, no grade 5 serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. All patients had any-grade AEs, and 59.3% of the patients experienced grade 3 AEs, while only 1 patient experienced a grade 4 AE of stomach bleeding. Fatigue was the most common AE, followed by hypertension and elevated aminotransferase levels. Retrospective analysis for PDL1 expression revealed that PDL1 positive tumor cells were associated with improved clinical benefits and survival outcomes. Conclusions: LEP is a promising alternative as a non-first-line therapeutic regimen for patients with refractory BTC. Furthermore, well-designed prospective clinical trials with a control arm are still needed to obtain more evidences to confirm the efficacy and safety of this particular regimen as well as the role of PDL1 expression.","Lin, Jianzhen; Yang, Xu; Long, Junyu; Zhao, Songhui; Mao, Jinzhu; Wang, Dongxu; Bai, Yi; Bian, Jin; Zhang, Lei; Yang, Xiaobo; Wang, Anqiang; Xie, Fucun; Shi, Weiwei; Yang, Huayu; Pan, Jie; Hu, Ke; Guan, Mei; Zhao, Lin; Huo, Li; Mao, Yilei; Sang, Xinting; Wang, Kai; Zhao, Haitao",Hepatobiliary Surg Nutr,,252

The Fc moiety is designed to enhance immunogenicity by increasing uptake via Fc-receptors (FcγR) on Ag-presenting cells (APCs) and prolonging exposure due to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling. AKS-452 induced approximately 20-fold greater neutralizing IgG titers in mice relative to those induced by SP/RBD without the Fc moiety and induced comparable long-term neutralizing titers with a single dose vs. two doses. To further enhance immunogenicity, AKS-452 was evaluated in formulations containing a panel of adjuvants in which the water-in-oil adjuvant, Montanide™ ISA 720, enhanced neutralizing IgG titers by approximately 7-fold after one and two doses in mice, including the neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of VERO-E6 cells. Furthermore, ISA 720-adjuvanted AKS-452 was immunogenic in rabbits and non-human primates (NHPs) and protected from infection and clinical symptoms with live SARS-CoV-2 virus in NHPs (USA-WA1/2020 viral strain) and the K18 human ACE2-trangenic (K18-huACE2-Tg) mouse (South African B.1.351 viral variant).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included cases of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in a public hospital in South Korea. The worsening oxygenation group was defined as that with SpO2 &#8804;94% or received oxygen or mechanical ventilation (MV) throughout the clinical course versus the non-worsening oxygenation group that did not experience any respiratory event. Parameters were compared, and the extent of viral pneumonia from an initial chest computed tomography (CT) was calculated using artificial intelligence (AI) and measured visually by a radiologist. RESULTS: We included 136 patients, with 32 (23.5%) patients in the worsening oxygenation group; of whom, two needed MV and one died. Initial vital signs and duration of symptoms showed no difference between the two groups; however, univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a variety of parameters on admission were associated with an increased risk of a desaturation event. A subset of patients was studied to eliminate potential bias, that ferritin &#8805;280 µg/L (p=0.029), lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;240 U/L (p=0.029), pneumonia volume (p=0.021), and extent (p=0.030) by AI, and visual severity scores (p=0.042) were the predictive parameters for worsening oxygenation in a sex-, age-, and comorbid illness-matched case-control study using propensity score (n=52). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that initial CT evaluated by AI or visual severity scoring as well as serum markers of inflammation on admission are significantly associated with worsening oxygenation in this COVID-19 pneumonia cohort.","Hahm, Cho Rom; Lee, Young Kyung; Oh, Dong Hyun; Ahn, Mi Young; Choi, Jae-Phil; Kang, Na Ree; Oh, Jungkyun; Choi, Hanzo; Kim, Suhyun",Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul),,252

While the healthcare community is very aware that the global pandemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has its origins in our Western ultraprocessed food diet, society has been slow to initiate any interventions other than public education, which has been ineffective, in part due to food industry interference. This article provides the rationale for such public health interventions, by compiling the evidence that added sugar, and by proxy the ultraprocessed food category, meets the four criteria set by the public health community as necessary and sufficient for regulation-abuse, toxicity, ubiquity, and externalities (How does your consumption affect me?). To their credit, some countries have recently heeded this science and have instituted sugar taxation policies to help ameliorate NCDs within their borders. This article also supplies scientific counters to food industry talking points, and sample intervention strategies, in order to guide both scientists and policy makers in instituting further appropriate public health measures to quell this pandemic.","Lustig, Robert H",Nutrients,,252

298683,Computational simulations reveal the binding dynamics between human ACE2 and the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,2021,"RATIONALE: Patient transfers from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the hospital ward are a vulnerable time for patients recovering from critical illness. Our prior work showed that ICU-ward transfers vary widely across sites. Previously, we used Human-Centered Design-an iterative, collaborative process for user-focused solutions-to develop a prototype structured ICU-ward transfer communication tool for clinicians at three academic Internal Medicine residency programs. We describe here an iterative approach to rapid prototyping and updating of this novel tool for integration into the electronic health record (EHR), based on structured focus groups using Design Thinking methodology. METHODS: In spring 2020, we conducted voluntary focus groups of PGY-2 and PGY-3 Internal Medicine Residents to co-create new iterations of an ICUward transfer tool created through prior focus groups. Each site conducted 2 focus groups with 4-10 participants per session. All focus groups were conducted via videoconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We used participant feedback to iteratively modify the ICU-ward transfer tool towards an ideal state. With participants' consent, we recorded and anonymously transcribed the focus group discussions conducted over the Zoom platform. We performed qualitative inquiry on transcripts for coding and thematic content analysis. Coding was performed independently by two coders (LS, BG) using both a theory-driven (deductive) and data-driven (inductive) approach;disparate coding was reconciled via in-depth discussion between coders. RESULTS: Focus groups identified several main themes around the role, content, and workflows related to an ideal ICU-wards handoff tool: (1) how the tool can best serve the needs of ICU and wards teams;(2) that the ICU-ward handoff process must balance thoroughness and usability;and (3) that design and implementation must consider user experience and training in best practices. Under these themes, participants identified specific attributes of an ideal handoff tool (Table 1), which coalesced around 3 main goals: (1) to synthesize key details and communicate the ICU team's thought process (summarized in Table 1A);(2) to integrate the new tool into the EHR within a customizable note template that minimizes click burden and redundancy (1B);and (3) to serve as a standardized outline to reduce errors of omission in written and verbal handoffs processes (1C). CONCLUSIONS: Participants valued organization of handoff information, EHR integration and user experience, and standardization and adaptability of workflows when modifying a framework based on prior resident user input to create a more user-friendly ICU-ward transfer tool using a Design Thinking Methodology.","Garcia, B.

300143,Detection of binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain by molecular dynamics simulations in mixed solvents,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus with high infectivity and has caused dramatic pressure on health systems all over the world. Appropriate personal protection for medical staffs is critical. For ocular protection, there is ongoing hot debate and concern for potential ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Ocular manifestations and positive detection of viral RNA in ocular samples were only reported in very small number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, health care workers need to face patients more closely and have higher risk of aerosol contamination. Thus, appropriate ocular protection for medical workers is still recommended by organizations such as WHO and American Academy of Ophthalmology. Although eye goggles provide excellent protection and are mandatory for medical practitioners with high risk of exposure, they are not ideal for common clinical practice, because they can disturb vision due to extensive formation of water droplets and frequently cause moderate to severe discomfort after longtime wearing, which have been reported to interfere with working status. For the majority of medical workers who don't deal with high risk patients, they are not advised to wear goggles in daily practice. However, they also face the risk of infection due to the presence of asymptomatic carriers. Especially in situations with high risk of ocular exposure, such as close physical examination, eye surgery, dental clinics and surgery, ocular protection may be needed. Griffithsin has been shown to directly bind to spike proteins and has anti-viral activity against a broad spectrum of viruses, including coronavirus. Griffithsin is found to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV at relatively low concentration and is stable and non-toxic. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share the same entry receptors and their spike proteins are similar in conformation. We hypothesize that contact lenses containing nanoparticles loaded with griffithsin may provide sufficient ocular protection for medical staffs without high risk of exposure during the outbreak period of SARS-CoV-2. If proven effective, griffithsin-loaded contact lens can be considered as a supplementary ocular protective equipment for medical workers who can tolerate well. The daily disposable contact lens should be applied as needed and refrain from extended wearing in order to reduce potential side effects.","Wang, Lixiang; Deng, Yingping",Front Public Health,,252

304991,Potential chimeric peptides to block the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain,2020,"The reported number of cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is continually increasing. Molecular diagnosis has become the first choice of ophthalmologists for identifying and confirming this clinically problematic diagnosis. However, in-house molecular procedures are time-consuming and may not be compatible with the urgency of the situation. In this study, we adapted a previous in-house AK-PCR, on the BDMAX, a full-integrated automated platform for molecular biology (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), for the rapid routine diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis. We compared different protocols to optimize DNA extraction from Acanthamoeba cysts. We evaluated the analytical parameters of the AK-BDMAX-PCR. Thirty-two samples were simultaneously tested with the AK-BDMAX PCR and the original AK-PCR from which it was developed. A thermal-shock pretreatment protocol was validated. The analytical parameters were similar to those obtained with the previous in-house AK-PCR method. We then assessed the performance of the AK-BDMAX PCR for routine testing on 40 clinical samples, mostly corneal scrapings. Frozen ready-to-use in-house PCR premixes were stable over eight months. Overall, 34 (85%) of the 40 clinical samples were considered to be true negatives, four (10%) were considered to correspond to probable AK and two (5%) were considered to correspond to possible AK.","Maubon, Danièle; Richarme, Claire; Post, Lucie; Robert, Marie Gladys; Bernheim, Diane; Garnaud, Cécile",J. mol. diagn,,252

To perform a preliminary assessment of the incidence of COVID-19 in IMD patients and the impact of the coronavirus emergency on the rare metabolic community between March and April 2020, the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Diseases (MetabERN) has performed two surveys: one directed to patients' organizations (PO) and one directed to healthcare providers (HCPs). The COVID-19 incidence in the population of rare metabolic patients was lower than that of the general European population (72.9 × 100,000 vs. 117 × 100,000). However, patients experienced extensive disruption of care, with the majority of appointments and treatments cancelled, reduced, or postponed. Almost all HCPs (90%) were able to substitute face-to-face visits with telemedicine, about half of patients facing treatment changes switched from hospital to home therapy, and a quarter reported difficulties in getting their medicines. During the first weeks of emergency, when patients and families lacked relevant information, most HCPs contacted their patients to provide them with support and information. Since IMD patients require constant follow-up and treatment adjustments to control their disease and avoid degradation of their condition, the results of our surveys are relevant for national health systems in order to ensure appropriate care for IMD patients. They highlight strong links in an interconnected community of HCPs and PO, who are able to work quickly and effectively together to support and protect fragile persons during crisis. However, additional studies are needed to better appreciate the actual impact of COVID-19 on IMD patients' health and the mid- and long-term effects of the pandemic on their wellbeing.","Lampe, C; Dionisi-Vici, C; Bellettato, C M; Paneghetti, L; van Lingen, C; Bond, S; Brown, C; Finglas, A; Francisco, R; Sestini, S; Heard, J M; Scarpa, M",Orphanet J Rare Dis,,252

Methods: Clinical data of 580 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 20 December 2019, to 8 March 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. The relation of lymphocyte subsets and severity or prognosis of disease were analyzed. Results: At 2-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, lymphocyte subsets decreased to the lowest levels. The levels of lymphocyte subsets in asymptomatic patients were close to healthy persons, except for CD8+ T lymphocyte cells. The levels of lymphocyte subsets in patients with severe illness were lower than that in patients with mild-to-moderate illness (P < 0.01). Similarly, among patients with severe illness, lower levels of lymphocyte subsets were found in dead patients compared to survivors (P < 0.001). Moreover, by comparing the results of the same patients at different stages of the disease, we found levels of lymphocyte subsets were lower in the acute phase compared to that in convalescent-phase (P < 0.001). However, the levels of lymphocyte subsets in patients who had SARS-CoV-2 viral load >5000 copies/ml and 500-5000 copies/ml were at similar levels. Conclusions: Lymphocyte subsets are a good biomarker to assess the severity and prognosis of the disease at 2-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms.","Yu, Xingxia; Yang, Rongrong",Expert Rev Respir Med,,252

However, evidence for the association between fear of COVID-19 and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine if fear of negative events affects Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in the context of a COVID-19-fear-invoking environment. METHODS: All participants were medical university students and voluntarily completed three surveys via smartphone or computer. Survey 1 was conducted on February 8, 2020, following a 2-week-long quarantine period without classes; survey 2 was conducted on March 25, 2020, when participants had been taking online courses for 2 weeks; and survey 3 was conducted on April 28, 2020, when no new cases had been reported for 2 weeks. The surveys comprised the Y-BOCS and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); additional items included questions on demographics (age, gender, only child vs siblings, enrollment year, major), knowledge of COVID-19, and level of fear pertaining to COVID-19. RESULTS: In survey 1, 11.3% of participants (1519/13,478) scored &#8805;16 on the Y-BOCS (defined as possible OCD). In surveys 2 and 3, 3.6% (305/8162) and 3.5% (305/8511) of participants had scores indicative of possible OCD, respectively. The Y-BOCS score, anxiety level, quarantine level, and intensity of fear were significantly lower at surveys 2 and 3 than at survey 1 (P<.001 for all). Compared to those with a lower Y-BOCS score (<16), participants with possible OCD expressed greater intensity of fear and had higher SAS standard scores (P<.001). The regression linear analysis indicated that intensity of fear was positively correlated to the rate of possible OCD and the average total scores for the Y-BOCS in each survey (P<.001 for all). Multiple regressions showed that those with a higher intensity of fear, a higher anxiety level, of male gender, with sibling(s), and majoring in a nonmedicine discipline had a greater chance of having a higher Y-BOCS score in all surveys. These results were redemonstrated in the 5827 participants who completed both surveys 1 and 2 and in the 4006 participants who completed all three surveys. Furthermore, in matched participants, the Y-BOCS score was negatively correlated to changes in intensity of fear (r=0.74 for survey 2, P<.001; r=0.63 for survey 3, P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that fear of COVID-19 was associated with a greater Y-BOCS score, suggesting that an environment (COVID-19 pandemic) × psychology (fear and/or anxiety) interaction might be involved in OCD and that a fear of negative events might play a role in the etiology of OCD.","Ji, Guangjun; Wei, Wenjun; Yue, Kai-Chen; Li, Heng; Shi, Li-Jing; Ma, Jian-Dong; He, Chen-Yang; Zhou, Sheng-Sheng; Zhao, Zongya; Lou, Tao; Cheng, Jie; Yang, Shi-Chang; Hu, Xian-Zhang",J Med Internet Res,,252

Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Setting: The study site was Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) located at Bantama in Kumasi, the capital town of the Ashanti Region. It is the second largest hospital in the country and the major referral site for Ashanti region and the northern part of the country. The hospital hosts a highly infectious isolation unit (HIIU) for COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe infections and receives referred cases from the region and within the hospital. Participants: The study involved 27 patients admitted to the HIIU at KATH with COVID-19 infection who underwent chest X-ray as part of their investigations. Results: The study enrolled 12 males and 15 females. The common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes. Chest x-ray findings in most of the patients (81.5%) revealed ground-glass opacities while a few of them (18.5%) had lung consolidations without ground-glass opacities. For those with ground-glass opacities, eight (29.6%) had superimposed consolidation. All the participants had positive chest x-ray findings. Conclusion: The chest x-ray findings in the 27 COVID-19 positive patients with moderate to severe disease on admission at the KATH HIIU enrolled in this study showed significant pulmonary abnormalities.

But it remains unclear how individual contact patterns interact with the infectious and non-infectious stages through which a disease progresses over time. Here, we investigate this interplay of contact patterns and disease progression using real-world physical proximity data from the Copenhagen Networks Study. We find from the data that the number of encounters following a potential infection event varies significantly over time -- with clear daily and weekly variations of encounter probability. These variations can accelerate or slow down the spread of infectious diseases, depending on how they are aligned with the infectious periods. Remarkably, the resulting resonance strongly depends on the latent period, which, although non-infectious and often neglected, is key to the degree of alignment of the infectious period with the weekly modulation. We demonstrate that the resonance effect can be reproduced by a generative process with a time-dependent encounter rate that reflects the daily and weekly modulation found in the data. Including this non-Markovian generative process into a well-mixed, mean-field spreading model, we show that resonances between contact patterns and disease progression can change the basic reproduction number considerably -- in our case by up to 20%. Surprisingly, a change in latent period can thereby make epidemic spread stronger even if the individual infectiousness is unaltered.","Zierenberg, Johannes; Spitzner, F.

As of April 03, 2020, public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 was potentially under control. We compiled a daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 2020. Understanding the characteristics of spatial clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R0 is critical in effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. Considering this, the prefectures were grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning techniques. Subsequently, we performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to estimate the revised R0 among different regions. Finally, our overall research indicates that the impact of temperature and demographic factors on virus transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions will help in prevention planning in an ongoing global pandemic, prioritizing segments of a given community/region for action and providing a visual aid in designing prevention strategies for a specific geographic region. Furthermore, revised estimation and our methodology will aid in improving the human health consequences of COVID-19 elsewhere.","Khan, Irtesam Mahmud; Haque, Ubydul; Zhang, Wenyi; Zafar, Sumaira; Wang, Yong; He, Junyu; Sun, Hailong; Lubinda, Jailos; Rahman, M Sohel",Acta Trop,,252

Students being an important cohort of a country, their mental health during this pandemic has been recognized as a concerning issue. Therefore, the prevalence and associated risk factors of Bangladeshi students' mental health sufferings (ie, depression, anxiety, and stress) are systematically reviewed herein for the first time. Methods: Adhering to the PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was performed from 1 to 5 April, 2021 in several databases including PubMed;and finally, a total of 7 articles were included to this review. Results: The prevalence rates of mild to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress ranged from 46.92% to 82.4%, 26.6% to 96.82%, and 28.5% to 70.1%, respectively. The risk factors concerning mental health problems included the factors related to (i) socio-demographic (younger age, gender, lower educational grade, urban residence, family size, currently living with family/parents, and having children in the family), (ii) behavior and health (smoking status, lack of physical exercise, more internet browsing time, and dissatisfaction with sleep), (iii) COVID-19 pandemic- (COVID-19 related symptoms, COVID-19 related perceptions, and fear of COVID-19 infection), (iv) miscellaneous (losing part-time teaching job, lack of study concentration, agitation, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to the hospital or home, financial problems, academic dissatisfaction, inadequate food supply, higher exposure to COVID-19 social and mass media, engaging with more recreational activities, and performing more household chores). Conclusion: The overall assumption of mental disorders' prevalence rates can be regarded as problematic to this cohort. Thus, the authorities should consider setting up possible strategies to diminish the pandemic effect on students' mental health.","Al Mamun, F.; Hosen, I.; Misti, J. M.; Kaggwa, M. M.; Mamun, M.

341996,SARS-CoV-2 mutations and where to find them: an in silico perspective of structural changes and antigenicity of the spike protein,2020,"Mobile robots are often tasked with repeatedly navigating through an environment whose traversability changes over time. These changes may exhibit some hidden structure, which can be learned. Many studies consider reactive algorithms for online planning, however, these algorithms do not take advantage of the past executions of the navigation task for future tasks. In this paper, we formalize the problem of minimizing the total expected cost to perform multiple start-to-goal navigation tasks on a roadmap by introducing the Learned Reactive Planning Problem. We propose a method that captures information from past executions to learn a motion policy to handle obstacles that the robot has seen before. We propose the LAMP framework, which integrates the generated motion policy with an existing navigation stack. Finally, an extensive set of experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by 10% to 40% in terms of expected time to travel from start to goal. We also evaluate the robustness of the proposed method in the presence of localization and mapping errors on a real robot.","Tsang, Florence; Walker, Tristan; MacDonald, Ryan A.; Sadeghi, Armin; Smith, Stephen L.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02271v1.pdf,252

The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), an essential enzyme for viral replication, is a valid target to combat SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In this work, we present a structure-based study to identify potential covalent inhibitors containing a variety of chemical warheads. The targeted Asinex Focused Covalent (AFCL) library was screened based on different reaction types and potential covalent inhibitors were identified. In addition, we screened FDA-approved protease inhibitors to find candidates to be repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. A number of compounds with significant covalent docking scores were identified. These compounds were able to establish a covalent bond (C-S) with the reactive thiol group of Cys145 and to form favorable interactions with residues lining the substrate-binding site. Moreover, paritaprevir and simeprevir from FDA-approved protease inhibitors were identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The mechanism and dynamic stability of binding between the identified compounds and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were characterized by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The identified compounds are potential inhibitors worthy of further development as COVID-19 drugs.

349833,Conformational Changes of the Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Prediction of a B-Cell Antigenic Epitope Using Structural Data,2021,"The repurposing of FDA approved drugs is presently receiving attention for COVID-19 drug discovery. Previous studies revealed the binding potential of several FDA-approved drugs towards specific targets of SARS-CoV-2; however, limited studies are focused on the structural and molecular basis of interaction of these drugs towards multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2. The present study aimed to predict the binding potential of six FDA drugs towards fifteen protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 and propose the structural and molecular basis of the interaction by molecular docking and dynamic simulation. Based on the literature survey, fifteen potential targets of SARS-CoV-2, and six FDA drugs (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, and Ritonavir) were selected. The binding potential of individual drug towards the selected targets was predicted by molecular docking in comparison with the binding of the same drugs with their usual targets. The stabilities of the best-docked conformations were confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation and energy calculations. Among the selected drugs, Ritonavir and Lopinavir showed better binding towards the prioritized targets with minimum binding energy (kcal/mol), cluster-RMS, number of interacting residues, and stabilizing forces when compared with the binding of Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, later drugs demonstrated better binding when compared to the binding with their usual targets. Remdesvir showed better binding to the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, but showed lesser binding potential when compared to the interaction between Ritonavir and Lopinavir and the prioritized targets. The structural and molecular basis of interactions suggest that the FDA drugs can be repurposed towards multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2, and the present computational models provide insights on the scope of repurposed drugs against COVID-19.","Skariyachan, Sinosh; Gopal, Dharshini; Chakrabarti, Shweta; Kempanna, Priya; Uttarkar, Akshay; Muddebihalkar, Aditi G; Niranjan, Vidya",Comput Biol Med,,252

This review did not consider studies of non-uterine tissue morcellation, studies involving uterine procedures other than hysterectomy or myomectomy, studies involving morcellation of known malignancies, nor studies concerning hysteroscopic myomectomy. A total of 695 studies were reviewed, with 185 studies included for analysis. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: The following variables were extracted: patient demographics, study type, morcellation technique and adverse outcome category. Adverse outcomes included: prolonged operative time, morcellation time, blood loss, direct injury from a morcellator, dissemination of tissue (benign or malignant) and disruption of the pathologic specimen. CONCLUSION: Complications related to morcellation are rare, however there is a great need for higher-quality studies to evaluate associated adverse outcomes.","Pepin, Kristen; Cope, Adela; Einarsson, Jon I; Cellini, Jacqueline; Cohen, Sarah L",J. minim. invasive gynecol,,252
350485,Efficient production of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the baculovirus-silkworm system,2020,"In Switzerland, the COVID-19 epidemic is progressively slowing down owing to &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo; measures introduced by the Federal Council on 16 March 2020. However, the gradual ease of these measures may initiate a second epidemic wave, the length and intensity of which are difficult to anticipate. In this context, hospitals must prepare for a potential increase in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here, we introduce icumonitoring.ch, a platform providing hospital-level projections for ICU occupancy. We combined current data on the number of beds and ventilators with canton-level projections of COVID-19 cases from two S-E-I-R models. We disaggregated epidemic projection in each hospital in Switzerland for the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, hospitalisations in ICU, and ventilators in use. The platform is updated every 3-4 days and can incorporate projections from other modelling teams to inform decision makers with a range of epidemic scenarios for future hospital occupancy.","Zhao, Cheng; Tepekule, Burcu; Criscuolo, Nicola G; Wendel Garcia, Pedro D; Hilty, Matthias P; Fumeaux, Thierry; Van Boeckel, Thomas",Swiss Med Wkly,,252
352486,Molecular dynamics analysis predicts ritonavir and naloxegol strongly block the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-hACE2 binding,2020,"Introduction: Loneliness and low social support can be detrimental to the health of individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias (ADRD) and family care partners. Restrictions on gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 create an even greater risk for social isolation. Memory Cafés are a highly replicated program that provide individuals living with ADRD and care partners an opportunity to socialize in an inclusive and supportive environment without fear of judgment, pressure, or stigma. Following restrictions on in-person gatherings, virtual Memory Cafés offer regular social engagement opportunities in an online format. While the Memory Café model has been replicated globally, their effects on loneliness and perceived social support are generally unknown. Even less is known about their impact when operating in a virtual environment. Methods: Semi-structured interviews in Spanish and English were conducted with individuals living with dementia and family care partners who regularly attend Memory Cafés hosted by partners in a Texas Memory Café Network. Interviews took place online using video conferencing software, were transcribed, then analyzed for common themes using a combined inductive and deductive approach. Results: A total of 17 interviews were conducted with persons living with dementia (n = 5) and family care partners (n = 12) who attend Memory Cafés to learn about their perceived experiences of social connectedness since COVID-19. Care partners included spouses (n = 8) and adult children (n = 4). Interviews included attendees of different Memory Café models, including in-person only (n = 2), virtual only (n = 9), and those who attend both models (n = 6). Five key themes were identified: (1) Reprieve; (2) What is still possible; (3) Connectedness; (4) Inclusivity; and (5) Value added, with ten sub-themes supporting these main themes. Discussion: Findings substantiate evidence that Memory Cafés offer important benefits for families living with dementia, providing vital new insight into the potential for virtual Memory Cafés to offer similar benefits. Findings have implications beyond the context of COVID-19, where virtual models may support the social connectedness of those living in geographically marginalized and underserved areas. Virtual models may not address the needs of all families experiencing dementia due to lack of access to technology and limitations for virtual engagement with those experiencing later stage dementia.","Masoud, Sara S; Meyer, Kylie N; Martin Sweet, Lauryn; Prado, Patricia J; White, Carole L",Front Public Health,,252
352600,"Protein Footprinting, Conformational Dynamics, and Core Interface-Adjacent Neutralization ""Hotspots"" in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domain/Human ACE2 Interaction",2021,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the characteristics of the visits attended to in an ENT Emergency Department (ENT-ED) during the first wave of COVID-19, comparing them with the emergencies attended to during the same period of time in 2019. METHODS: Descriptive and analytical observational retrospective study of all emergency consultations between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020, carried out by the Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Department of a tertiary university hospital. The adequacy of consultations was assessed with the Hospital Emergency Suitability Protocol (HESP). The correlation between the emergencies and the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases was assessed with a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Although there was a decrease of almost 50% in ENT-ED visits during the first wave of COVID-19, the pattern of most cases remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 era: non-urgent consultations, not previously assessed by Primary Care (PC), being considered inadequate by the HESP. The three main reasons for consultation were otalgia, odynophagia, and epistaxis. The number of ENT-ED visits and the total number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the health area were correlated. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was a challenge for the Spanish health system. The critical epidemiological situation experienced during March, April, and May explains the reduction in the number of visits to the ENT-ED. However, this condition did not affect the predominant pattern of visits with respect to the pre-COVID-19 era, which were mostly inadequate. A strengthening of PC and an improvement in the population's health education is essential.","Herranz-Larrañeta, Jesús; Klein-Rodríguez, Alejandro; Menéndez-Riera, María; Mejuto-Torreiro, Lara; López-Eiroa, Aldán; Vázquez-Barro, Juan Carlos; Herranz González-Botas, Jesús; Mayo-Yáñez, Miguel",Am J Otolaryngol,,252

Less is known about youths. METHODS: We surveyed a sample of Italian adolescents during the strictest quarantine period and assessed the effects of socio-demographic and psychological factors on current emotional symptoms. A convenient sample of 326 adolescents (age range 14-19 years) participated in a web-based survey. We collected data on several socio-demographic and psychological variables (summarized into three indexes: environmental context, changes in lifestyle, and worries about infection) and psychopathological symptoms (previous psychopathological status, current anxiety and depressive symptoms). RESULTS: Descriptive analysis showed that adolescents have experienced quarantine under very different conditions; they reported 47.5 and 14.1% of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Regression analyses indicated that previous psychopathological status and worries about infection are linked to anxiety and that female gender, previous psychopathological status (moderated by change in lifestyle), worse environmental context are linked to depression. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that, facing the COVID-19 pandemic and its related safety measures, adolescents show relevant emotional symptoms and therefore should be monitored, assessed and supported.","Pisano, Simone; Catone, Gennaro; Gritti, Antonella; Almerico, Luisa; Pezzella, Anna; Santangelo, Pia; Bravaccio, Carmela; Iuliano, Raffaella; Senese, Vincenzo Paolo",Ital J Pediatr,,252
357617,SARS-CoV-2 E protein is a potential ion channel that can be inhibited by Gliclazide and Memantine,2020,"Testing representative populations to determine the prevalence or percent of the population with active SARS-Cov-2 infection and/or antibodies to infection is being recommended as essential for making public policy decisions to open-up or to continue enforcing national, state and local government rules to ""shelter-in-place"". However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100% - in some cases considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and world-wide. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions. However, adjustment will not improve the accuracy of an individual test.","Sempos, Christopher T; Tian, Lu",Am. j. epidemiol,,252

We aimed to compare the differences in clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive adult patients hospitalised in a COVID-19 unit at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France (NCT04320017). RESULTS: Among the 262 patients hospitalised in a medical ward during the pandemics with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 62 patients had cancer. Clinical presentation, comorbidities, and outcomes were similar between cancer and non-cancer patients. However, cancer patients were more likely to have been contaminated while being hospitalised. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologic and non-oncologic patients hospitalised for COVID-19 shared similar outcomes in terms of death, admission in intensive care, or thrombosis/bleeding. They should benefit from the same therapeutic strategy as the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fenioux, Charlotte; Allenbach, Yves; Vozy, Aurore; Salem, Joe-Élie; Maalouf, Georgina; Vieira, Matheus; Le Joncour, Alexandre; Benveniste, Olivier; Saadoun, David; Frère, Corinne; Campedel, Luca; Salem, Pierre; Gligorov, Joseph; Funck-Brentano, Christian; Cacoub, Patrice; Gougis, Paul",Bull. cancer,,252

And although the demand for vitamin D testing has increased dramatically in recent years, finding new methods for efficient rapid testing remain at the forefront for clinical diagnosis and public health prevention. Herein, we are introducing an electrochemical aptasensor for the detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), comparing two aptamers platforms. The oligonucleotide aptamers were immobilized on gold surfaces using a disulfide linker, followed by monitoring the electrochemical response by cyclic voltammetry (CV), square wave voltammetry (SWV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Our studies revealed that the aptamer VDBA14 possessing a 5′-terminal disulfide recognizes the vitamin target. This electrochemical aptasensor exhibited a wide linear range of 1–1000 nM and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.085 nM for the detection of 25(OH)D3. The aptasensor also allows the detection of 25(OH)D3 in human serum sample with high sensitivity and selectivity, indicating that the proposed electrochemical aptasensor may have potential applications in clinical diagnosis.","Yin, Shuo Li Yongxin Hossain M.

Here we report the clinical features of 66 hemodialysis patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 1 January to 5 March 2020; the final date of follow-up was 25 March 2020. RESULTS: The clinical data were collected from 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 in our center was 11.0% (66/602), of which 18 patients died. According to different prognosis, hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were divided into the survival and death group. A higher incidence of fever and dyspnea was found in the death group compared with the survival group. Meanwhile, patients in the death group were often accompanied by higher white blood cell count, prolonged PT time, increased D-dimer (p < .05). More patients in the death group showed hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes damage. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis suggested that fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer were independent risk factors for death in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.439; p = .044; OR, 1.146; 95% CI, 1.026 to 1.875; p = .034, OR, 4.974; 95% CI, 3.315 to 6.263; p = .007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The potential risk factors of fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer could help clinicians to identify hemodialysis patients with poor prognosis at an early stage of COVID-19 infection.","Zou, Rong; Chen, Fang; Chen, Dan; Xu, Cui-Ling; Xiong, Fei",Ren Fail,,252

The magnitude of this shift and the factors that have accompanied this new unplanned work setting go beyond what the software engineering community has previously understood to be remote work. To find out how developers and their productivity were affected, we distributed two surveys (with a combined total of 3,634 responses that answered all required questions) -- weeks apart to understand the presence and prevalence of the benefits, challenges, and opportunities to improve this special circumstance of remote work. From our thematic qualitative analysis and statistical quantitative analysis, we find that there is a dichotomy of developer experiences influenced by many different factors (that for some are a benefit, while for others a challenge). For example, a benefit for some was being close to family members but for others having family members share their working space and interrupting their focus, was a challenge. Our surveys led to powerful narratives from respondents and revealed the scale at which these experiences exist to provide insights as to how the future of (pandemic) remote work can evolve.","Ford, Denae; Storey, Margaret-Anne; Zimmermann, Thomas; Bird, Christian; Jaffe, Sonia; Maddila, Chandra; Butler, Jenna L.; Houck, Brian; Nagappan, Nachiappan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11147v3.pdf,252

METHODS: GeneChip® screening is used for elucidating various chemoresistance-related gene expression in the adriamycin-resistant leukaemia cells K562/ADR. We constructed K562/CD44 cells by transfection of an EGFP-SV40-CD44 plasmid, and adriamycin-resistant ability was confirmed by detecting migration and apoptosis-related proteins and mRNA expression using Western blotting and Real-time PCR respectively. RESULTS: K562/CD44 cells were generated by the transfection of an EGFP-SV40-CD44 plasmid with high CD44 expression. mRNA expression levels of CD44 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), along with the proliferation rate, were increased, while the apoptosis rate of K562/CD44 cells was decreased. Migration-associated proteins such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 were upregulated, whereas apoptosis-related protein Bax was downregulated and Bcl-2 protein was not significantly altered in the K562/CD44 cells. CONCLUSIONS: CD44 might be involved in adriamycin resistance via regulation of P-gp, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Bcl-2/Bax.","Li, Juan; Zhang, Yanfang; Cui, Yubo; Jin, Honghua; Lin, Zhenhua; Piao, Yingshi; Jin, Jingchun",Int. j. lab. hematol,,252

MethodsOvid MEDLINE and Compendex were searched from inception to January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and full text of potentially relevant reviews, using a priori inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews examining effects of HVAC design features on virus transmission. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR2. ResultsSearching identified 361 citations, 45 were potentially relevant, and 7 were included. Reviews were published between 2007 and 2021, and included 47 virus studies. Two earlier reviews (2007, 2016) of 21 studies found sufficient evidence that mechanical ventilation (airflow patterns, ventilation rates) plays a role in airborne transmission; however, both found insufficient evidence to quantify minimum mechanical ventilation requirements. One review (2017) of 9 studies examining humidity and indoor air quality found that influenza virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% relative humidity; authors noted that ventilation rates were a confounding variable. Two reviews (2021) examined mitigation strategies for coronavirus transmission, finding droplet transmission decreased with increasing temperature and relative humidity. One review (2020) identified 14 studies examining coronavirus transmission in air-conditioning systems, finding HVAC systems played a role in virus spread during previous coronavirus outbreaks. One review (2020) examined virus transmission interventions on public ground transportation, finding ventilation and filtration to be effective. DiscussionSeven reviews synthesizing 47 studies demonstrate a role of HVAC in mitigating airborne virus transmission. Ventilation, humidity, temperature, and filtration can play a role in viability and transmission of viruses, including coronaviruses. Recommendations for minimum standards were not possible due to few studies investigating a given HVAC parameter. Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis overview synthesized seven previous reviews that included 47 studies examining HVAC design features and their effects on airborne transmission of viruses, serving as a starting point for future systematic reviews and identifying priorities for primary research. C_LIO_LIThe strengths of this study include its comprehensiveness and use of methods to avoid bias, such as pre-specification of inclusion/exclusion criteria and involvement of at least two reviewers at all stages. C_LIO_LIThe main limitation stems from the limits of the included reviews because many reviews did not meet the internationally recognized definitions and methodological expectations of systematic reviews.

412831,"Frontispiz: Molecular Simulations suggest Vitamins, Retinoids and Steroids as Ligands of the Free Fatty Acid Pocket of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike Protein",2021,"AIMS: Patients with severe respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 undergo cardiac complications due to hyper-inflammatory conditions. Although the presence of the virus has been detected in the myocardium of infected patients, and infection of induced pluripotent cell-derived cardiomyocytes has been demonstrated, the reported expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) in cardiac stromal cells suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may determine cardiac injury by sustaining productive infection and increasing inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed expression of ACE2 receptor in primary human cardiac stromal cells derived from cardiospheres, using proteomics and transcriptomics before exposing them to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Using conventional and high sensitivity PCR methods, we measured virus release in the cellular supernatants and monitored the intracellular viral bioprocessing. We performed high-resolution imaging to show the sites of intracellular viral production and demonstrated the presence of viral particles in the cells with electron microscopy. We finally used RT-qPCR assays to detect genes linked to innate immunity and fibrotic pathways coherently regulated in cells after exposure to the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that cardiac stromal cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and produce variable viral yields depending on the extent of cellular ACE2 receptor expression. Interestingly, these cells also evolved towards hyper-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic phenotypes independently of ACE2 levels. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection of myocardial stromal cells could be involved in cardiac injury and explain the high number of complications observed in severe cases of COVID-19.","Amendola, Alessandra; Garoffolo, Gloria; Songia, Paola; Nardacci, Roberta; Ferrari, Silvia; Bernava, Giacomo; Canzano, Paola; Myasoedova, Veronika; Colavita, Francesca; Castilletti, Concetta; Sberna, Giuseppe; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Piacentini, Mauro; Agrifoglio, Marco; Colombo, Gualtiero Ivanoe; Poggio, Paolo; Pesce, Maurizio",Cardiovasc Res,,252

417417,Cyanobacterial metabolites as promising drug leads against the Mpro and PLpro of SARS-CoV-2: an in silico analysis,2020,"AIM: New treatment regimens for COVID-19, which threatened the world recently, continue to be investigated. Although some of the treatments are promising, it is thought to be early to clearly state that there is definitive treatment. Experiences and treatment protocols studies coming from the centers are still very important. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors affecting the treatment process in the first cases followed in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this retrospective and cross-sectional study. Datas were recorded from the electronic and written files of patients. RESULTS: Eighty three patients were evaluated. The median age was 50±15 years. Fourty eight (57.8%) patients had one or more comorbidities. The most common comorbidity was hypertension. The most common symptom was cough in 58 patients (70%). The overall mortality was 15% and 85% of the patients were discharged. The time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization was statistically significantly longer in deceased patients (p=0,039). Age, D-Dimer, troponin, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, ferritin, procalcitonin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were statistically significantly higher in deceased patients than survivor patients. Performed subgroup analysis, in the patients receiving azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine and other antibiotics plus hydroxychloroquine, the duration of hospitalization was shorter in azithromycin group (p=0,027). CONCLUSION: Early treatment and early admission to the hospital can be crucial for the better treatment process. Combination therapy with azithromycin may be preferred in the first treatment choice because it can shorten the length of hospital stay.","TanriverdI, ElIf; ÇÖrtÜk, Mustafa; Yildirim, BInnaz Zeynep; UGur Chousein, Efsun Gonca; Turan, Demet; Çinarka, HalIt; ÖzgÜl, Mehmet AkIf; ÇetInkaya, ErdoGan",,,252

The aim of this study was to assess gender differences in the impact of lockdown on physical activity and lifestyle habits. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in April 2020 on a general population sample residing in Italy. Participants completed validated questionnaires. Gender differences were assessed using a multivariable adjusted logistic regression model using gender as independent and exposures as dependent variables. Metabolic equivalents-hour/week was used to evaluate physical activity. A total of 2218 participants (761 men and 1457 women) agreed to participate in the study and completed the questionnaire. The survey found that women compared to men showed 1) a lower level of physical activity before the institution of lockdown, 2) a lower tendency to reduce physical activity levels during the lockdown, when gender differences in compliance with guideline recommendations for physical activity disappeared, 3) and a worsening of sleep and stool passage; men experienced an increase in alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Women, who previously had a lower level of physical activity than men, showed a lower tendency to reduce it during lockdown, revealing greater resilience than men. However, the worsening in sleep, in stool passage, and a trend to weight increase revealed signs of psychological suffering after a protracted lockdown period.","Orlandi, Melissa; Rosselli, Martina; Pellegrino, Alessio; Boddi, Maria; Stefani, Laura; Toncelli, Loira; Modesti, Pietro Amedeo",Nutr. metab. cardiovasc. dis,,252
420500,Development and Validation of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for Rapid Detection of Glaesserella (Haemophilus) parasuis,2021,"When we consider a probability distribution about how many COVID-19-infected people will transmit the disease, two points become important. First, there could be super-spreaders in these distributions/networks and second, the Pareto principle could be valid in these distributions/networks regarding estimation that 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of local transmission. When we accept that these two points are valid, the distribution of transmission becomes a discrete Pareto distribution, which is a kind of power law. Having such a transmission distribution, then we can simulate COVID-19 networks and find super-spreaders using the centricity measurements in these networks. In this research, in the first we transformed a transmission distribution of statistics and epidemiology into a transmission network of network science and second we try to determine who the super-spreaders are by using this network and eigenvalue centrality measure. We underline that determination of transmission probability distribution is a very important point in the analysis of the epidemic and determining the precautions to be taken.","Gürsakal, N; Batmaz, B; Aktuna, G",Epidemiol Infect,,252
420689,Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease,2021,"Fangcang hospitals, as tentative hospitals built to treat a huge turnover of patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections, have played a pivotal role to slow down the pandemic spread in China in 2020. However, anxiety and sleep disorders remain tough to address during the treatments. In this study, group psychological intervention in combination with pulmonary rehabilitation exercises were conducted in the trial group for the patients with mild COVID-19 infections in a Fangcang Hospital to mitigate the patients' anxiety and sleep disorders, while conventional nursing methods were done in the control group, with 70 randomly picked patients in each group. Effects were assessed through questionnaire method using state anxiety questionnaire (SAI) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index scale (PQSI) rating investigation. Results showed that both SAI and PSQI scores of the trial group were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The SAI scores of the trial group and the control group were 38.5 ± 13.2 and 45.8 ± 10.4 points (t = 3.600, P < 0.001), respectively, and the PSQI scores were 5.6 ± 3.0 and 7.1 ± 3.0 points (t = 2.982, P < 0.01), respectively.

424598,Deep Mutational Scanning of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Reveals Constraints on Folding and ACE2 Binding,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy is significantly important to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread. One of the interventions implemented by the government is a school closure. The Ministry of Education decided to postpone the school opening from March 2 to April 6 to minimize epidemic size. We aimed to quantify the school closure effect on the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: The potential effects of school opening were measured using a mathematical model considering two age groups: children (aged 19 years and younger) and adults (aged over 19). Based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, isolation and behavior-changed susceptible individuals are additionally considered. The transmission parameters were estimated from the laboratory confirmed data reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from February 16 to March 22. The model was extended with estimated parameters and estimated the expected number of confirmed cases as the transmission rate increased after school opening. RESULTS: Assuming the transmission rate between children group would be increasing 10 fold after the schools open, approximately additional 60 cases are expected to occur from March 2 to March 9, and approximately additional 100 children cases are expected from March 9 to March 23. After March 23, the number of expected cases for children is 28.4 for 7 days and 33.6 for 14 days. CONCLUSION: The simulation results show that the government could reduce at least 200 cases, with two announcements by the Ministry of education. After March 23, although the possibility of massive transmission in the children's age group is lower, group transmission is possible to occur.","Kim, Soyoung; Kim, Yae Jean; Peck, Kyong Ran; Jung, Eunok",J Korean Med Sci,,252
425595,Predictive medicinal metabolites from Momordica dioica against comorbidity related proteins of SARS-CoV-2 infections,2021,"Corticosteroid therapy is now recommended as a treatment in patients with severe COVID-19. But one key question is how to objectively identify severely ill patients who may benefit from such therapy. Here, we assigned 12,862 COVID-19 cases from 21 hospitals in Hubei Province equally to a training and a validation cohort. We found that a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 6.11 at admission discriminated a higher risk for mortality. Importantly, however, corticosteroid treatment in such individuals was associated with a lower risk of 60-day all-cause mortality. Conversely, in individuals with an NLR &#8804; 6.11 or with type 2 diabetes, corticosteroid treatment was not associated with reduced mortality, but rather increased risks of hyperglycemia and infections. These results show that in the studied cohort corticosteroid treatment is associated with beneficial outcomes in a subset of COVID-19 patients who are non-diabetic and with severe symptoms as defined by NLR.","Cai, Jingjing; Li, Haomiao; Zhang, Changjiang; Chen, Ze; Liu, Hui; Lei, Fang; Qin, Juan-Juan; Liu, Ye-Mao; Zhou, Feng; Song, Xiaohui; Zhou, Jianghua; Zhao, Yan-Ci; Wu, Bin; He, Meiling; Yang, Huilin; Zhu, Lihua; Zhang, Peng; Ji, Yan-Xiao; Zhao, Guang-Nian; Lu, Zhigang; Liu, Liming; Mao, Weiming; Liao, Xiaofeng; Lu, Haofeng; Wang, Daihong; Xia, Xigang; Huang, Xiaodong; Wei, Xiang; Xia, Jiahong; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Yuan, Yufeng; She, Zhi-Gang; Xu, Qingbo; Ma, Xinliang; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Juan; Zhang, Xin; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Li, Hongliang",Cell Metab,,252

428450,In Silico Screening of Phytochemicals of Ocimum Sanctum Against Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Aim: The economic burden caused by death and disease in the world is credited mainly to tobacco use-currently linked to approximately 8,000,000 deaths per year with approximately 80% of these faralities reported in low and middle income economies. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 7,000,000 deaths are attributed to direct tobacco use, while approximately 1,200,000 non-smokers exposed to second hand cigarette smoke die every year. Accordingly, tobacco use is a major threat to the public health infrastructure; therefore, proper cessation interventions must be put in place to curb tobacco abuse and ease economic and social burdens caused by the tobacco epidemic. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to investigate how scientific efforts have been advanced towards harm reduction among smokers and non-smokers. Relevant articles published during the period 2010-2020 in PubMed, Crossref, Google scholar, and Web of Science were used in this study. The articles were selected based on health impacts of cigarette smoking, tobacco cessation and emerging diseases, including Covid-19. Various cessation strategies have been identified although their efficiency is yet to match the desired results. Results: A series of carcinogenic chemicals are generated during cigarette smoking resulting in serious health complications such as cancer and mutagenesis. The precursors for tobacco induced diseases are toxic and carcinogenic chemicals of the nitrosamine type, aldehydes, polonium-210 and benzo[a]pyrene, which bio-accumulate in the body system during cigarette smoking to cause disease. Rehabilitation facilities, use of drugs to diminish the desire to smoke, heavy taxation of tobacco products and warning labels on cigarettes are some of the cessation strategies employed towards curbing tobacco abuse. Conclusion: The need for further research to develop better methods and research based policies for safe cigarette smoking and workable cessation strategies must be a priority in order to deal with the tobacco epidemic. Campaigns to promote tobacco cessation and abstinence are recommended in this review as a sure measure to mitigate against the deleterious impacts caused by cigarette smoking and tobacco abuse.","Omare, Micah O; Kibet, Joshua K; Cherutoi, Jackson K; Kengara, Fredrick O",Z Gesundh Wiss,,252

432193,Combined use of the hepatitis C drugs and amentoflavone could interfere with binding of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2: the results of a molecular simulation study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Systemic antimicrobials can be used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing (SRP)) as a non-surgical treatment approach to manage periodontitis. A range of antibiotics with different dosage and combinations are documented in the literature. The review follows the previous classification of periodontitis as all included studies used this classification. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP for the non-surgical treatment of patients with periodontitis. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 9 March 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which involved individuals with clinically diagnosed untreated periodontitis. Trials compared SRP with systemic antibiotics versus SRP alone/placebo, or with other systemic antibiotics. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 45 trials conducted worldwide involving 2664 adult participants. 14 studies were at low, 8 at high, and the remaining 23 at unclear overall risk of bias. Seven trials did not contribute data to the analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the 10 comparisons which reported long-term follow-up (&#8805; 1 year). None of the studies reported data on antimicrobial resistance and patient-reported quality of life changes. Amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD -16.20%, 95% CI -25.87 to -6.53; 1 study, 44 participants); clinical attachment level (CAL) (MD -0.47 mm, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.05; 2 studies, 389 participants); probing pocket depth (PD) (MD -0.30 mm, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.18; 2 studies, 389 participants); and percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) (MD -8.06%, 95% CI -14.26 to -1.85; 2 studies, 389 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for closed pockets and BOP showed a minimally important clinical difference (MICD) favouring amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP. Metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD -12.20%, 95% CI -29.23 to 4.83; 1 study, 22 participants); CAL (MD -1.12 mm, 95% CI -2.24 to 0; 3 studies, 71 participants); PD (MD -1.11 mm, 95% CI -2.84 to 0.61; 2 studies, 47 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD -6.90%, 95% CI -22.10 to 8.30; 1 study, 22 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for CAL and PD showed an MICD favouring the MTZ + SRP group. Azithromycin + SRP versus SRP for chronic/aggressive periodontitis: we found no evidence of a difference in percentage of closed pockets (MD 2.50%, 95% CI -10.19 to 15.19; 1 study, 40 participants); CAL (MD -0.59 mm, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.08; 2 studies, 110 participants); PD (MD -0.77 mm, 95% CI -2.33 to 0.79; 2 studies, 110 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD -1.28%, 95% CI -4.32 to 1.76; 2 studies, 110 participants) (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Amoxicillin + clavulanate + SRP versus SRP for chronic periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 21 participants for CAL (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.71); PD (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.37); and BOP (MD 0%, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.09) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Doxycycline + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 22 participants for CAL (MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.11); and PD (MD -1.00 mm, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.22) was of very low certainty, with the doxycycline + SRP group showing an MICD in PD only. Tetracycline + SRP versus SRP for aggressive periodontitis: we found very low-certainty evidence of a difference in long-term improvement in CAL for the tetracycline group (MD -2.30 mm, 95% CI -2.50 to -2.10; 1 study, 26 participants). Clindamycin + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: we found very low-certainty evidence from 1 study, 21 participants of a difference in long-term improvement in CAL (MD -1.70 mm, 95% CI -2.40 to -1.00); and PD (MD -1.80 mm, 95% CI -2.47 to -1.13) favouring clindamycin + SRP. Doxycycline + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: there was very low-certainty evidence from 1 study, 27 participants of a difference in long-term CAL (MD 1.10 mm, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84); and PD (MD 1.00 mm, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.70) favouring metronidazole + SRP. Clindamycin + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 26 participants for CAL (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.95); and PD (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.78) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Clindamycin + SRP versus doxycycline + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 23 participants for CAL (MD -0.90 mm, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.18); and PD (MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.58 to -0.02) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Most trials testing amoxicillin, metronidazole, and azithromycin reported adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mild gastrointestinal disturbances, and metallic taste. No serious adverse events were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very low-certainty evidence (for long-term follow-up) to inform clinicians and patients if adjunctive systemic antimicrobials are of any help for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis. There is insufficient evidence to decide whether some antibiotics are better than others when used alongside SRP. None of the trials reported serious adverse events but patients should be made aware of the common adverse events related to these drugs. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted clearly defining the minimally important clinical difference for the outcomes closed pockets, CAL, PD, and BOP.","Khattri, Shivi; Kumbargere Nagraj, Sumanth; Arora, Ankita; Eachempati, Prashanti; Kusum, Chandan Kumar; Bhat, Kishore G; Johnson, Trevor M; Lodi, Giovanni",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,252
434310,Site-specific characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Previous pandemics have resulted in significant consequences for mental health. Here, we report the mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK cohort and examine modifiable and non-modifiable explanatory factors associated with mental health outcomes. We focus on the first wave of data collection, which examined short-term consequences for mental health, as reported during the first 4-6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING: Community cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: N=3097 adults aged &#8805;18 years were recruited through a mainstream and social media campaign between 3 April 2020 and 30 April 2020. The cohort was predominantly female (n=2618); mean age 44 years; 10% (n=296) from minority ethnic groups; 50% (n=1559) described themselves as key workers and 20% (n=649) identified as having clinical risk factors putting them at increased risk of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety and stress scores. RESULTS: Mean scores for depression ([Formula: see text] =7.69, SD=6.0), stress ([Formula: see text] =6.48, SD=3.3) and anxiety ([Formula: see text] = 6.48, SD=3.3) significantly exceeded population norms (all p<0.0001). Analysis of non-modifiable factors hypothesised to be associated with mental health outcomes indicated that being younger, female and in a recognised COVID-19 risk group were associated with increased stress, anxiety and depression, with the final multivariable models accounting for 7%-14% of variance. When adding modifiable factors, significant independent effects emerged for positive mood, perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 for all outcomes, with the final multivariable models accounting for 54%-57% of total variance. CONCLUSIONS: Increased psychological morbidity was evident in this UK sample and found to be more common in younger people, women and in individuals who identified as being in recognised COVID-19 risk groups. Public health and mental health interventions able to ameliorate perceptions of risk of COVID-19, worry about COVID-19 loneliness and boost positive mood may be effective.","Jia, Ru; Ayling, Kieran; Chalder, Trudie; Massey, Adam; Broadbent, Elizabeth; Coupland, Carol; Vedhara, Kavita",BMJ Open,,252
434700,Computational investigation on Andrographis paniculata phytochemicals to evaluate their potency against SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to known antiviral compounds in drug trials,2020,"Recent literature strongly supports the hypothesis that mobility restriction and social distancing play a crucial role in limiting the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it was shown that mobility restriction reduced transmission significantly. This study found that, in the period between the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was high positive correlation between trends in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and mobility. These two trends oscillated simultaneously, and increased mobility following the relaxation of lockdown rules was significantly associated with increased transmission. From a public health perspective, these results highlight the importance of tracking changes in mobility when relaxing mitigation measures in order to anticipate future changes in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Cazelles, Bernard; Comiskey, Catherine; Nguyen-Van-Yen, Benjamin; Champagne, Clara; Roche, Benjamin",Int J Infect Dis,,252

This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on EC educators' wellbeing and educator-child relationships, as growing evidence shows the influence of these factors on children's developmental outcomes. In July 2020, members of a Research Network of EC Professionals-who previously identified educator wellbeing as a priority issue-were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey included two published, validated scales: the Early Childhood Professional Wellbeing scale (ECPW) and the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (modified). Survey items about educators' experiences during the pandemic were also included. Two hundred and thirty-two EC educators from across Australia completed the survey, mostly from Victoria where lockdowns were most severe. Linear regression analysis demonstrated stronger professional wellbeing was associated with less conflict in educator-child relationships and lower risk of staff turnover. This was more likely to be experienced by senior or more experienced staff. Although a negative impact of COVID-19 was reported, ECPW scores were relatively high, and organizational structures supporting professional wellbeing were most strongly associated with lower risk of turnover (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). Findings highlight that supporting EC educators' wellbeing is essential for workforce retention, and for promoting quality educator-child relationships which are central to young children's learning and development.","Eadie, Patricia; Levickis, Penny; Murray, Lisa; Page, Jane; Elek, Catriona; Church, Amelia",Early Child Educ J,,252

Future decision-making policies require consistent data on the management and prognosis of the older patients (> 70 years old) with COVID-19 admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Characteristics, management, and prognosis of critically ill old patients (> 70 years) were extracted from the international prospective COVID-ICU database. A propensity score weighted-comparison evaluated the impact of intubation upon admission on Day-90 mortality. RESULTS: The analysis included 1199 (28% of the COVID-ICU cohort) patients (median [interquartile] age 74 [72-78] years). Fifty-three percent, 31%, and 16% were 70-74, 75-79, and over 80 years old, respectively. The most frequent comorbidities were chronic hypertension (62%), diabetes (30%), and chronic respiratory disease (25%). Median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3 (2-3). Upon admission, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 154 (105-222). 740 (62%) patients were intubated on Day-1 and eventually 938 (78%) during their ICU stay. Overall Day-90 mortality was 46% and reached 67% among the 193 patients over 80 years old. Mortality was higher in older patients, diabetics, and those with a lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio upon admission, cardiovascular dysfunction, and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission. In propensity analysis, early intubation at ICU admission was associated with a significantly higher Day-90 mortality (42% vs 28%; hazard ratio 1.68; 95% CI 1.24-2.27; p < 0·001). CONCLUSION: Patients over 70 years old represented more than a quarter of the COVID-19 population admitted in the participating ICUs during the first wave. Day-90 mortality was 46%, with dismal outcomes reported for patients older than 80 years or those intubated upon ICU admission.","Dres, Martin; Hajage, David; Lebbah, Said; Kimmoun, Antoine; Pham, Tai; Béduneau, Gaëtan; Combes, Alain; Mercat, Alain; Guidet, Bertrand; Demoule, Alexandre; Schmidt, Matthieu",Ann Intensive Care,,252

Design: A hospital-based case-control study. Setting: This case-control investigation was done in 2011. Usual dietary intakes of participants during the preceding year were examined using a food frequency questionnaire. Data on dietary TAC from foods was gathered from published databases that provided the antioxidant capacity for each food item, measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power. Participants: Cases were individuals with pathologically confirmed glioma that were diagnosed during the last month (n = 128). Controls were individuals, aged between 20 and 75 years, who were hospitalized or were outpatients referred to other wards of the same hospitals (n = 256). Results: Compared with participants in the lowest quartile, those in the highest quartile of dietary TAC had a lower odds of glioma (OR: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.15-0.45). This association was strengthened when potential confounders were taken into account (OR: 0.13; 95%CI: 0.05-0.35). Such inverse association was also seen for men (OR: 0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.19), but not for women. Furthermore, significant inverse associations were seen between dietary intakes of vitamin C (OR for Q 4 vs. Q 1: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.05-0.36; P-trend < 0.01), vitamin B6 (OR for Q 4 vs. Q 1: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.13-0.97; P-trend = 0.02) and ß-carotene (OR for Q 3 vs. Q 1: 0.43, 95%CI: 0.19-0.98; P-trend = 0.57) and glioma, after controlling for potential covariates. Conclusions: We found that dietary TAC as well as dietary intake of vitamin C, vitamin B6, and ß-carotene was inversely associated with odds of glioma in adults.","Heydari, Marzieh; Shayanfar, Mehdi; Sharifi, Giuve; Saneei, Parvane; Sadeghi, Omid; Esmaillzadeh, Ahmad",Nutr Cancer,,252

460721,Virus-receptor interactions of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and human neuropilin-1 b1 domain,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of remdesivir, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been repeatedly questioned during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Most of the recently reported studies were randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials. Our goal was to test the efficiency of remdesivir in reducing nasopharyngeal viral load and hospitalization length in a real-life setting in admitted patients in a large tertiary center in Israel. METHODS: A total of 142 COVID-19 patients found to have at least three reported SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests during hospitalization were selected for this study. Of these, 29 patients received remdesivir, while the remaining non-treated 113 patients served as controls. RESULTS: Among the tested parameters, the control and remdesivir groups differed significantly only in the intubation rates. Remdesivir treatment did not significantly affect nasopharyngeal viral load, as determined by comparing the differences between the first and last cycle threshold values of the SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests performed during hospitalization (Ct 7.07±6.85 vs. 7.08±7.27, p=0.977 in the control and treated groups, respectively). Remdesivir treatment shortened hospitalization length by less than a day compared to non-treated controls and by 3.1 days when non-intubated patients from both groups were compared. These differences, however, were not statistically significant, possibly because of the small size of the remdesivir group. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir was not associated with nasopharyngeal viral load changes, but our study had a significant disease severity baseline imbalance and was not powered to detect viral load or clinical differences.","Goldberg, Elad; Ben Zvi, Haim; Sheena, Liron; Sofer, Summer; Krause, Ilan; Sklan, Ella H; Shlomai, Amir",Clin. microbiol. infect,,252

463631,Repurposing drugs and identification of inhibitors of integral proteins (spike protein and main protease) of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Sarcoma treatment during the covid-19 pandemic is a new challenge. This patient population is often immunocompromised and potentially more susceptible to viral complications. Government guidelines highlight the need to minimize patient exposure to unnecessary hospital visits. However, those guidelines lack practical recommendations on ways to manage triage and diagnosis expressly for new cancer patients. Furthermore, there are no reports on the efficiency of the guidelines. One of the main issues in treating musculoskeletal tumours is the complexity and variability of presentation. We offer a triage model, used in a quaternary-referral musculoskeletal oncology centre, that allows us to maintain an open pathway for referral of new patients while minimizing exposure risks. A multidisciplinary approach and analysis of existing investigations allow for a pre-clinic evaluation. The model identifies 3 groups of patients: â Patients with suspected high-grade malignancy, or benign cases with aggressive features, both in need of further evaluation in the clinic and prompt treatmentâ Patients with low-grade malignancy, and benign cases whose treatment is not urgent, that are managed during the pandemic by telemedicine, with reassurance and information about their illnessâ Patients who can be managed by their local medical professionals In comparison to a pre-pandemic period, that approach resulted in a higher ratio of malignant-to-benign conditions for new patients seen in the clinic (3:4 vs. 1:3 respectively), thus using available resources more efficiently and prioritizing patients with suspected high-grade malignancy. We believe that this triage system could be applied in other surgical oncology fields during a pandemic.","Olshinka, N; Mottard, S",Curr Oncol,,252
464288,Elucidation of the inhibitory activity of ivermectin with host nuclear importin α and several SARS-CoV-2 targets,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over 70 million people worldwide, including those with neurodegenerative disease (NDD), have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to date. We review outcomes in patients with NDD and COVID-19 and discuss the hypothesis that due to putative commonalities of neuropathogenesis, COVID-19 may unmask or trigger NDD in vulnerable individuals. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on a systematic review of published literature, patients with NDD, including dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) make up a significant portion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Such patients are likely to present with altered mental status or worsening of their preexisting neurological symptoms. Patients with NDD and poor outcomes often have high-risk comorbid conditions, including advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart/lung disease. Patients with dementia including Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death, whereas those with preexisting Parkinson's disease are not. MS patients have good outcomes and disease modifying therapies do not increase the risk for severe disease. Viral infections and attendant neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and MS, suggesting that COVID-19 may have the potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration. SUMMARY: Since patients with Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death in the setting of COVID-19, additional precautions and protective measures should be put in place to prevent infections and optimize management of comorbidities in this vulnerable population. Further studies are needed to determine whether COVID-19 may lead to an increased risk of developing NDD in susceptible individuals.","McAlpine, Lindsay S; Fesharaki-Zadeh, Arman; Spudich, Serena",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,252

We aim in this work to explore how general practitioners (GPs) perceived the use of telemedicine, recently recognized and reimbursed by the Public Health Insurance House (PHIH) for primary care (PC) provision. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 2020 in one county of Romania using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed physicians' perceptions regarding teleconsultation, reliability in tele-decision, remote pathology management, pregnant women's surveillance, patients' satisfaction with telemedicine, the need for its further reimbursement. Bivariate correlation was used to measure associations between the investigated issues. Results: More than a quarter of GPs (28.6%) found it easier to address patients' healthcare needs remotely, while 60.7% considered time-consuming teleconsultations compared to face-to-face visits. Tele-diagnostic uncertainty was expressed by 64.3% of physicians, and a quarter were confident in tele-decisions. Almost half of GPs (43%) observed patients' satisfaction with tele-visits, while half said patients encountered difficulties using technology. A large percentage of doctors (62.5%) perceived that patients felt as well treated by virtual as in-person visit and 91.1% suggested post-pandemic reimbursement. The results of the bivariate correlation showed that physicians who perceived positive patient feedback on telemedicine were more supportive of subsequent reimbursement. Conclusion: This study showed the GPs' positive perception of the use of telemedicine. Its adoption in PC has shed light on the shadows of the pandemic. The time-consuming nature of teleconsultations, uncertainty in tele-decisions, patients' difficulties in using technology were seen as shadows of telecare. However, most of the GPs surveyed agreed with the need for further reimbursement. Future work should focus on innovative solutions for integrating telemedicine as complementary form of PC, the need for telemedicine-based training for GPs to improve capacity building, and patients' perceptions of virtual care, helping to build trust and satisfaction.","Florea, M.; Lazea, C.; Gaga, R.; Sur, G.; Lotrean, L.; Puia, A.; Stanescu, A.

AIM: To systematically review the literature relating to men versus women on SARS-CoV-2 in order to seek differences in disease characteristics (e.g. infectivity, severity) and outcomes (e.g. mortality). METHODS: We searched 3 electronic databases up or observational studies reporting differences between men and women in the SARS-CoV-2 disease characteristics stated. We identified and included 47 studies, reporting data for 21,454 patients mainly from China. RESULTS: The unadjusted mortality rates of men were higher than those of women, with a mortality OR 0.51 [0.42, 0.61] (p<0.001) for women. The proportion of men presenting with severe disease and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was also higher than that of women (OR 0.75 [0.60-0.93] p<0.001 and OR 0.45 [0.40-0.52] p<0.001 respectively).

We sought to determine whether differences in instruction types at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year were related to differences in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Illinois counties during the first 3 weeks of the school year. METHODS: We divided Illinois counties into 3 groups based on the instruction type used for a majority of K-12 students at the start of the school year: in-person, hybrid, or online-only. We used synthetic control analysis to match counties between the 3 groups. RESULTS: Both majority hybrid and majority online-only counties had significantly fewer new cases than majority in-person counties. There were no significant differences in new cases between majority hybrid counties and majority online-only counties or in new hospital admissions or deaths between any of the 3 county groups. CONCLUSIONS: This paper adds to the growing scientific consensus that at least some forms of in-person K-12 instruction have not contributed significantly to the spread of the pandemic. However, our results suggest that there may be an important difference between fully in-person instruction and hybrid instruction.","Reinbold, Gary W",Am. j. infect. control,,252

475591,Discovery of Antiviral Cyclic Peptides Targeting the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2 via mRNA Display,2021,"Heterochromatin remodeling is critical for various cell processes. In particular, the ""loss of heterochromatin"" phenotype in cellular senescence is associated with the process of aging and age-related disorders. Although biological processes of senescent cells, including senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) formation, chromosome compaction, and redistribution of key proteins, have been closely associated with high-order chromatin structure, the relationship between the high-order chromatin reorganization and the loss of heterochromatin phenotype during senescence has not been fully understood. By using senescent and deep senescent fibroblasts induced by DNA damage harboring the ""loss of heterochromatin"" phenotype, we observed progressive 3D reorganization of heterochromatin during senescence. Facultative and constitutive heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, respectively, show different alterations. Facultative heterochromatin tends to switch from the repressive B-compartment to the active A-compartment, whereas constitutive heterochromatin shows no significant changes at the compartment level but enhanced interactions between themselves. Both types of heterochromatin show increased chromatin accessibility and gene expression leakage during senescence. Furthermore, increased chromatin accessibility in potential CTCF binding sites accompanies the establishment of novel loops in constitutive heterochromatin. Finally, we also observed aberrant expression of repetitive elements, including LTR (long terminal repeat) and satellite classes. Overall, facultative and constitutive heterochromatin show both similar and distinct multiscale alterations in the 3D map, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression leakage. This study provides an epigenomic map of heterochromatin reorganization during senescence.","Zhang, Xianglin; Liu, Xuehui; Du, Zhenhai; Wei, Lei; Fang, Huan; Dong, Qiongye; Niu, Jing; Li, Yanda; Gao, Juntao; Zhang, Michael Q; Xie, Wei; Wang, Xiaowo",Genome res,,252

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of consecutive patients with COVID-19 evaluated by a consulting neurology team from March 30, 2020 through May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included, 43 of whom showed encephalopathy, and were further divided into mild, moderate, and severe encephalopathy groups. Nineteen patients (44%) had undergone mechanical ventilation and received intravenous sedatives. Eleven (26%) patients were on dialysis. Laboratory markers of COVID-19 severity were very common in encephalopathy patients, but did not correlate with the severity of encephalopathy. Thirty-nine patients underwent neuroimaging studies, which showed mostly non-specific changes. One patient showed lesions possibly related to CNS demyelination. Four had suffered an acute stroke. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR in only one of 21 CSF samples. Two CSF samples showed elevated white blood cell count and all were negative for oligoclonal bands. In our case series, the severity of encephalopathy correlated with higher probability of death during hospitalization (OR = 5.5 for each increment in the degree of encephalopathy, from absent (0) to mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3), p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In our consecutive series with 43 encephalopathy cases, neuroimaging and CSF analysis did not support the role of direct viral CNS invasion or CNS inflammation as the cause of encephalopathy.","Tuma, Raphael L; Guedes, Bruno F; Carra, Rafael; Iepsen, Bruno; Rodrigues, Júlia; Camelo-Filho, Antonio Edvan; Kubota, Gabriel; Ferrari, Maíra; Studart-Neto, Adalberto; Oku, Mariana Hiromi; Terrim, Sara; Lopes, Cesar C B; Passos Neto, Carlos E B; Fiorentino, Matheus D; Souza, Julia C C; Baima, José Pedro S; Silva, Tomás; Perissinotti, Iago; Martin, Maria da Graça M; Gonçalves, Marcia; Fortini, Ida; Smid, Jerusa; Adoni, Tarso; Lucato, Leandro; Nitrini, Ricardo; Gomes, Hélio; Castro, Luiz H",Neurol Sci,,252

DESIGN, SETTINGS, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOMES: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 8 April 2020 to 17 April 2020 using an online survey across varied healthcare settings in Oman accruing 1139 HCWs.The primary and secondary outcomes were mental health status and sociodemographic data, respectively. Mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and insomnia was evaluated by the Insomnia Severity Index. Samples were categorised into the frontline and non-frontline groups. &#967;2 and t-tests were used to compare groups by demographic data. The Mantel-Haenszel OR was used to compare groups by mental health outcomes adjusted by all sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: This study included 1139 HCWs working in Oman. While working during the pandemic period, a total of 368 (32.3%), 388 (34.1%), 271 (23.8%) and 211 (18.5%) respondents were reported to have depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia, respectively. HCWs in the frontline group were 1.5 times more likely to report anxiety (OR=1.557, p=0.004), stress (OR=1.506, p=0.016) and insomnia (OR=1.586, p=0.013) as compared with those in the non-frontline group. No significant differences in depression status were found between the frontline and non-frontline groups (p=0.201). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different grades of HCWs. This study suggests that frontline HCWs are disproportionally affected compared to non-frontline HCWs, with managing sleep-wake cycles and anxiety symptoms being highly endorsed among frontline HCWs. As psychosocial interventions are likely to be constrained owing to the pandemic, mental healthcare must first be directed to frontline HCWs.","Alshekaili, Muna; Hassan, Walid; Al Said, Nazik; Al Sulaimani, Fatima; Jayapal, Sathish Kumar; Al-Mawali, Adhra; Chan, Moon Fai; Mahadevan, Sangeetha; Al-Adawi, Samir",BMJ Open,,252

We conducted a retrospective evaluation of hospitalized patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical signs of COVID-19 and computed tomography (CT) scan-proven pulmonary involvement, in order to identify relationships between clinical, serological, imaging data and disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Clinical and serological records of patients admitted to two COVID-19 Units of the Abruzzo region in Italy with proven SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary involvement investigated with CT scan, assessed at the time of admission to the hospital, were retrospectively evaluated. Sixty-one patients (22 females and 39 males) of median age 65 years were enrolled. Fifty-six patients were discharged while death occurred in 5 patients. None of the lung abnormalities detected by CT was different between discharged and deceased patients. No differences were observed in the features and extent of pulmonary involvement according to age and gender. Logistic regression analysis with age and gender as covariates demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile were associated with the involvement of all 5 pulmonary lobes (OR = 14.5, 95% CI 2.3-90.9, p = 0.004), the presence of septal thickening (OR = 8.2, 95% CI 1.6-40.9, p = 0.011) and the presence of mediastinal lymph node enlargement (OR = 12.0, 95% CI 1.1-127.5, p = 0.039) independently of age and gender. We demonstrated that ferritin levels over the 25th percentile are associated with a more severe pulmonary involvement, independently of age and gender and not associated with disease outcomes. The identification of reliable biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 may help guiding clinical decision, tailoring therapeutic approaches and ultimately improving the care and prognosis of patients with this disease.","Carubbi, Francesco; Salvati, Lia; Alunno, Alessia; Maggi, Fabio; Borghi, Erika; Mariani, Rinalda; Mai, Francesca; Paoloni, Maurizio; Ferri, Claudio; Desideri, Giovambattista; Cicogna, Sabrina; Grassi, Davide",Sci Rep,,252

Three hundred and forty-four individuals (&#8805;18 years and 67% women) answered a self-reported online survey that included questions related to the physical exercise practice (e.g., supervised and remote) during social distancing and questions about perceptions of depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated [MADRS-S] scores) and metabolic equivalent task minutes per week (METs minâ¢wk-1) of moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and total PA scores (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form) before and during social distancing. The RSE group (n=45) showed higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA than the SGE (n=146) and NE (n=109) groups. The RSE and FFE (n=44) groups showed higher METs of the total PA scores than the SGE and NE groups. The NE group showed higher MADRS-S scores than the other groups. Lower MADRS-S scores depend on the exercise practice and higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA depend on the supervised exercise practice. Thus, telehealth interventions can be implemented during the pandemic to enhance vigorous PA.","Moreira-Neto, Acácio; Martins, Bruce; Miliatto, Angelo; Nucci, Mariana Penteado; Silva-Batista, Carla",Psychiatry Res,,252
490749,In silico characterization of mutations circulating in SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins,2021,"During epidemics and pandemics healthcare personnel (HCP) are on the front line of disease containment and mitigation. Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), serve an important role in minimizing HCP risks and are in high demand during public health emergencies. Because PPE demand can exceed supply, various public health strategies have been developed to reduce the rate of PPE consumption as supply dwindles. Extended use and limited reuse of N95 FFRs are strategies advocated by many governmental agencies used to increase the number of times a device can be used. Increased use of respirators designed for reuse-such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) and elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air-purifying respirators- is another option designed to reduce the continuous need for new devices as the daily need for respirator use increases. Together, these strategies are designed to reduce the number of PPE units that must be discarded daily and, therefore, extend the longevity of available supply. The purpose of this paper is to theoretically estimate the impact of extended use and limited reuse strategies for N95 FFRs and the increased use of reusable respirator options on PPE consumed. The results suggest that a considerable reduction in PPE consumption would result from extended use and limited reuse of N95 FFRs and the increased use of respirators designed for reuse; however, the practical benefits must be balanced with the risks and economic costs. In addition, extended use and reuse strategies must be accompanied by proper procedures to reduce risk. The study is designed to support epidemic and pandemic PPE supply and demand planning efforts.","Yorio, Patrick L; Fisher, Edward M; Kilinc-Balci, F Selcen; Rottach, Dana; Harney, Joshua; Seaton, Melissa; Dahm, Matthew M; Niemeier, Todd",J Int Soc Respir Prot,,252

Effective contact tracing of potentially exposed health care workers is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the health care setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic through the real-time locating system (RTLS) and review of the electronic medical record (EMR) at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore. METHODS: Over a 2-day study period, all admitted patients with COVID-19, their ward locations, and the health care workers rostered to each ward were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between patients with COVID-19 and health care workers. The numbers of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers. RESULTS: Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method. Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%). CONCLUSIONS: RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review. Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary.","Ho, Hanley J; Zhang, Zoe Xiaozhu; Huang, Zhilian; Aung, Aung Hein; Lim, Wei-Yen; Chow, Angela",J Med Internet Res,,252

However, little is known about the disease course in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). METHODS: Data for patients with AIH and SARS-CoV-2 infection were combined from 3 international reporting registries and outcomes were compared to those in patients with chronic liver disease of other aetiology (non-AIH CLD) and to patients without liver disease (non-CLD). RESULTS: Between 25th March and 24th October 2020, data were collected for 932 patients with CLD and SARS-CoV-2 infection including 70 with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Fifty-eight (83%) patients with AIH were taking &#8805;1 immunosuppressive drug. There were no differences in rates of major outcomes between patients with AIH and non-AIH CLD, including hospitalization (76% vs. 85%; p = 0.06), intensive care unit admission (29% vs. 23%; p = 0.240), and death (23% vs. 20%; p = 0.643). Factors associated with death within the AIH cohort included age (odds ratio [OR] 2.16/10 years; 1.07-3.81), and Child-Pugh class B (OR 42.48; 4.40-409.53), and C (OR 69.30; 2.83-1694.50) cirrhosis, but not use of immunosuppression. Propensity score matched (PSM) analysis comparing patients with AIH with non-AIH CLD demonstrated no increased risk of adverse outcomes including death (+3.2%; -9.2%-15.7%). PSM analysis of patients with AIH vs. non-CLD (n = 769) demonstrated increased risk of hospitalization with AIH (+18.4%; 5.6-31.2%), but equivalent risk of all other outcomes including death (+3.2%; -9.1%-15.6%). CONCLUSION: Patients with AIH were not at increased risk of adverse outcomes despite immunosuppressive treatment compared to other causes of CLD and to matched cases without liver disease. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), a rare chronic inflammatory liver disease. This study combines data from 3 large registries to describe the course of COVID-19 in this patient group. We show that AIH patients do not appear to have an increased risk of death from COVID-19 compared to patients with other forms of liver disease and compared to patients without liver disease, despite the use of medications which suppress the immune system.","Marjot, Thomas; Buescher, Gustav; Sebode, Marcial; Barnes, Eleanor; Barritt, A Sidney; Armstrong, Matthew J; Baldelli, Luke; Kennedy, James; Mercer, Carolyn; Ozga, Ann-Kathrin; Casar, Christian; Schramm, Christoph; Moon, Andrew M; Webb, Gwilym J; Lohse, Ansgar W",J. hepatol,,252
505422,SARS-Cov-2 spike protein fragment 674-685 protects mitochondria from releasing cytochrome c in response to apoptogenic influence,2021,"BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis, nonapoptotic cell death mediated by free radical reactions and driven by the oxidative degradation of lipids, is a therapeutic target because of its role in organ damage, including AKI. Ferroptosis-causing radicals that are targeted by ferroptosis suppressors have not been unequivocally identified. Because certain cytochrome P450 substrate drugs can prevent lipid peroxidation via obscure mechanisms, we evaluated their antiferroptotic potential and used them to identify ferroptosis-causing radicals. METHODS: Using a cell-based assay, we screened cytochrome P450 substrate compounds to identify drugs with antiferroptotic activity and investigated the underlying mechanism. To evaluate radical-scavenging activity, we used electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping methods and a fluorescence probe for lipid radicals, NBD-Pen, that we had developed. We then assessed the therapeutic potency of these drugs in mouse models of cisplatin-induced AKI and LPS/galactosamine-induced liver injury. RESULTS: We identified various US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and hormones that have antiferroptotic properties, including rifampicin, promethazine, omeprazole, indole-3-carbinol, carvedilol, propranolol, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. The antiferroptotic drug effects were closely associated with the scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals but not significantly related to interactions with other radicals. The elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels were associated with ferroptosis onset, and known ferroptosis suppressors, such as ferrostatin-1, also functioned as lipid peroxyl radical scavengers. The drugs exerted antiferroptotic activities in various cell types, including tubules, podocytes, and renal fibroblasts. Moreover, in mice, the drugs ameliorated AKI and liver injury, with suppression of tissue lipid peroxidation and decreased cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Although elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels can trigger ferroptosis onset, some drugs that scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals can help control ferroptosis-related disorders, including AKI.","Mishima, Eikan; Sato, Emiko; Ito, Junya; Yamada, Ken-Ichi; Suzuki, Chitose; Oikawa, Yoshitsugu; Matsuhashi, Tetsuro; Kikuchi, Koichi; Toyohara, Takafumi; Suzuki, Takehiro; Ito, Sadayoshi; Nakagawa, Kiyotaka; Abe, Takaaki",J Am Soc Nephrol,,252

To minimize data misinterpretation, robustness reference values for biomarkers were important in biomonitoring programs. Specific three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, immune reference ranges for field studies had been determined based on laboratory data and one reference station (Contentieuse river at Houdancourt). In this study, data obtained in one uncontaminated and three contaminated sites were compared to these reference ranges as a validation step before considering them for larger scale biomonitoring programs. When the field reference range were compared to data from the uncontaminated station (Béronelle), only few deviations were shown. In this way, data coming from uncontaminated station (Béronelle) was integrated in the field reference ranges to improve the evaluation of site variability. The new field reference ranges provided better discrimination of sites and spanned a larger range of fish lengths than the initial reference ranges. Furthermore, the results suggest lysosomal presence during several months and phagocytosis capacity in autumn may be the most relevant immunomarkers towards identifying contaminated sites. In the future, combining this reference value approach with active biomonitoring could facilitate the obtention of data in multiple stream conditions.","Marchand, Adrien; Tebby, Cleo; Catteau, Audrey; Turiès, Cyril; Porcher, Jean-Marc; Bado-Nilles, Anne",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,252
510678,Author Correction: Neutralizing nanobodies bind SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and block interaction with ACE2,2021,"The spread of Coronavirus is very fast through effective human-to-human transmission through close contact and respiratory droplets such as coughing or sneezing. Various studies have been conducted to deal with COVID-19, but until now it has not been found how to stop the spread of this virus. Based on data obtained from the COVID19.go.id page accessed on January 1, 2021 which was updated by the Ministry of Health, the overall number of confirmed cases was 1,078,314 active cases reaching 175,095 or 16.2% of confirmed cases, recovered 873,221 or 81.0% of cases confirmed, died 29,998 or 2.8% of the confirmed cases. In this study, comparing the two algorithms in the dataset which aims to analyze grouping patterns and determine the best method of data processing. The data used comes from the Ministry of Health, there are 4 attributes including confirmed cases, treatment, recovery and death, in this study only 2 attributes are used, namely confirmed cases and death. From the results of data analysis and processing through a comparison between the K-Means method and the K-Medoids for grouping the spread of the corona 19 virus in Indonesia, with the Davies Boulden index value from the K2 to K9 values, it turns out that the K-Means method gets the smallest value at the K-value. 5 is 0.064, while K-Medoids at the k-2 value is 0.411. Thus, from the two methods used, it can be found that the best method for clustering the spread of the corona 19 virus outbreak in Indonesia is the K-Means method.","Utomo, Wargijono; en,",Ilkom Jurnal Ilmiah,,252

Of them, 84.5% self-reported epidemic concern (middle or above), and 60.2%, 66.3% and 66.8% self-reported impact (middle or above) on psychology, life, work respectively. 31.9%, 46.0% and 41.0% of respondents reported their willingness to reduce their dietary intakes of salt, fried foods, and sugary foods, respectively. The stratified analysis of multinomial logistic regression models showed that, respondents with higher psychological impact were more likely to increase their dietary intake of salt, fried foods, sugary foods. Except as aforesaid, most respondents with higher epidemic concerns and higher impacts on psychology, life, work were more likely to reduce eating salt, fried foods, sugary foods. After the epidemic, early stage of positive improvement to a proper diet was observed, whereas the opposite tendency was also found in some respondents with higher impact on psychology. Thus, there is an urgent need for health care and lifestyle intervention policies for different subgroups.","Xu, Ying; Li, Zhixue; Yu, Weijun; He, Xiangyang; Ma, Yan; Cai, Fengmin; Liu, Zheng; Zhao, Rencheng; Wang, Dewang; Guo, Yan-Fang; Chen, Jialong",Aging (Albany NY),,252

It enables the effects of uncertainties in device geometry, due to manufacturing tolerances, on the competing objectives of minimising the temperature deviations within the CFPCR thermal zones, together with minimising the pressure drop across the device, to be explored. We first validate that our training data from conjugate heat transfer simulations of the CFPCR thermal flow problems is noise free and then combine a deterministic surrogate model, based on the mean of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) simulator, with Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) to propagate the manufacturing uncertainties in the geometry design variables into the optimisation outputs. The resultant probabilistic model is used to solve a series of robust optimisation problems. The influence of the robust problem formulation and constraints on the design conservatism of the robust optima in comparison with the corresponding deterministic cases is explored briefly.","Wang, Yongxing; Hamad, Hazim A.; Voss, Jochen; Thompson, Harvey M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00570v1.pdf,252

Primary diagnosis by whole-slide imaging (WSI) is a key component that would aid departments in providing uninterrupted histopathology diagnosis and maintaining revenue streams from disruption. We sought to perform rapid validation of the use of WSI in primary diagnosis meeting recommendations of the College of American Pathologists guidelines. METHODS: Glass slides from clinically reported cases from 5 participating pathologists with a preset washout period were digitally scanned and reviewed in settings identical to typical reporting. Cases were classified as concordant or with minor or major disagreement with the original diagnosis. Randomized subsampling was performed, and mean concordance rates were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 171 cases were included and distributed equally among participants. For the group as a whole, the mean concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 90) was 83.6% counting all discrepancies and 94.6% counting only major disagreements. The mean pathologist concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 18) ranged from 90.49% to 97%. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel double-blinded method for rapid validation of WSI for primary diagnosis. Our findings highlight the occurrence of a range of diagnostic reproducibility when deploying digital methods.","Samuelson, Megan I; Chen, Stephanie J; Boukhar, Sarag A; Schnieders, Eric M; Walhof, Mackenzie L; Bellizzi, Andrew M; Robinson, Robert A; Rajan KD, Anand",Am J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511392/,252

Methods SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence cross-sectional study in risk-stratified HCWs randomly selected from 3 main district hospitals in Oman. Results 1,078 HCWs included with an overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 21%. The seropositivity in low, variable, and high risk groups were 29%, 18%, and 17%, respectively (P-value <0.001). The study found higher positivity in males [crude odds ratio (COR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28–2.3], and workers residing in high prevalence areas (COR 2.09, 95% CI 1.42–3.07). Compared to doctors, workers from supporting services, administration and nurses were more likely to have positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (COR 9.81, 95% CI 5.26–18.27; 2.37, 95% CI 1.23–4.58; 2.08 95% CI 1.14–3.81). The overall rate of previously undetected infection was 12% with higher values in low-risk HCWs. High district prevalence is a driving factor for seropositivity in the low-risk group [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.36 (95% CI 1.0–5.59)]. Conclusion The low risk supporting services workers can drive SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospitals. More attention and innovation within this opportunity will enhance the safety of health care during epidemics/pandemics.","Al-Maani, Amal; Al Wahaibi, Adil; Al-Sooti, Jabir; Al Abri, Bader; Al Shukri, Intisar; AlRisi, Elham; AL Abri, Laila; AlDaghari, Khalid; AL Subhi, Mahmood; AlMaqbali, Salima; AlBurtamani, Salim; AlAbri, Asma; AL Salami, Ahmed; Al-Beloushi, Iman; Al-Zadjali, Najla; Alqayoudhi, Abdullah; Al-Kindi, Hanan; Al Shaqsi, Khalifa; Al-Jardani, Amina; Al-Abri, Seif",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221003830?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221003830; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.04.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930541/,252

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is not only an enzyme but also a functional receptor on cell surfaces through which SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells and is highly expressed in the heart, kidneys, and lungs and shed into the plasma. ACE2 is a key regulator of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). SARS-CoV-2 causes ACE/ACE2 balance disruption and RAAS activation, which leads ultimately to COVID-19 progression, especially in patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, ACE2 expression may have paradoxical effects, aiding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, yet conversely limiting viral infection. This article reviews the existing literature and knowledge of ACE2 in COVID-19 setting and focuses on its pathophysiologic involvement in disease progression, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic potential.","Beyerstedt, Stephany; Casaro, Expedito Barbosa; Rangel, Érika Bevilaqua",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389262/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-020-04138-6,252

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MedRxiv from inception to November 2020 were searched to identify documents. STUDY SELECTION: Publications investigating the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on lung function (forced vital capacity [FVC]), exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance [6MWD]), health related quality of life (HRQOL), and dyspnea were searched. DATA EXTRACTION: The data were extracted into predesigned data extraction tables. Risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0). DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 11 RCTs with 637 interstitial lung disease patients were eligible for analyses. The pooled effect sizes of the association for pulmonary rehabilitation were 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.71) for FVC, 44.55 (95% CI, 32.46-56.64) for 6MWD, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.22-0.82) for HRQOL, and 0.39 (95% CI, –0.08 to 0.87) for dyspnea. After translating these findings considering clinical improvements, pulmonary rehabilitation intervention increased predicted FVC by 5.5%, the 6MWD test improved by 44.55 m, and HRQOL improved by 3.9 points compared with baseline values. Results remained similar in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Although specific evidence for pulmonary rehabilitation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients has emerged, our data support that interstitial lung disease rehabilitation could be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy to improve the functional capacity and quality of life in this group of patients.","Reina-Gutiérrez, Sara; Torres-Costoso, Ana; Martínez-Vizcaíno, Vicente; Núñez de Arenas-Arroyo, Sergio; Fernández-Rodríguez, Rubén; Pozuelo-Carrascosa, Diana P.",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932361/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2021.03.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003999321003269; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003999321003269,252

The problem of the correct placement of sensors on the body is considered, a simplified architecture of the wearable clothing is described, an experimental set-up is developed and tests are performed. The system has been tested by performing several physical exercises and comparing the performance with the commercially available BTS Bioengineering SMART DX motion capture system. The results show that our solution is more suitable for complex exercises as the system based on digital cameras tends to lose some markers.

RESULTS In post-hoc analyses, higher baseline viral load, measured by both RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) and log10 copies/mL, was associated with greater supplemental oxygenation requirements and disease severity at study entry. Higher baseline viral load was associated with higher mortality, lower likelihood of improvement in clinical status and supplemental oxygenation requirements, and lower rates of hospital discharge. Viral load was not impacted by sarilumab treatment over time versus placebo.

As pregnant and reproductive-aged women account for a large proportion of the population with particular concerns regarding vaccination against COVID-19, this survey aims at investigating their current attitudes and beliefs within our own institution. OBJECTIVE: To understand vaccine acceptability among pregnant, non-pregnant and breastfeeding respondents and elucidate factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. METHODS: We administered an anonymous online survey to all women (including patients, providers and staff) at our institution assessing rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Respondents were contacted in one of three ways: by email, advertisement flyers and distribution of QR codes at virtual townhalls regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on their responses, respondents were divided into three mutually exclusive groups: (1) non-pregnant respondents (2) pregnant respondents and (3) breastfeeding respondents. The primary outcome was acceptance of vaccination. Prevalence ratios were calculated to ascertain the independent effects of multiple patient-level factors on vaccine acceptability. RESULTS: The survey was administered from January 7, 2021 to January 29, 2021 with 1,012 respondents of whom 466 (46.9%) identified as Non-Hispanic White, 108 (10.9%) as Non-Hispanic Black, 286 (28.8%) as Hispanic, and 82 (8.2) as Non-Hispanic Asian. The median age was 36 (IQR 25-47) years. Of all the respondents, 656 respondents (64.8%) were non-pregnant, 216 (21.3%) were pregnant and 122 (12.1%) were breastfeeding. There was no difference in chronic comorbidities when evaluated as a composite variable (Table 1). 390 respondents (39.2%) reported working in healthcare. Non-pregnant respondents were most likely to accept vaccination (457 respondents, 76.2%, p<0.001) with breastfeeding respondents the second most likely (55.2%). Pregnant respondents had the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance (44.3%, p<0.001). Prevalence ratios revealed all non-White races except for non-Hispanic Asian respondents and Spanish speaking respondents were less likely to accept vaccination(Table 3). Working in healthcare was not found to be associated with vaccine acceptance among our cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of only women at a single institution, pregnant respondents of non-White or non-asian races were more likely to decline vaccination compared to non-pregnant and breast-feeding respondents. Working in healthcare was not associated with vaccine acceptance.","Sutton, Desmond; D'Alton, Mary; Zhang, Yijia; Kahe, Ka; Cepin, Ana; Goffman, Dena; Staniczenko, Anna; Yates, Hope; Burgansky, Anna; Coletta, Jaclyn; Williams, Zev; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100403; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589933321000987?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589933321000987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048965/,252

Here, we show that PRRSV efficiently activates the transcription of IFN-α/β in porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) in a time-dependent and transient manner; and this effect is dependent on the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Despite the abundant IFN-α transcripts detected in PRRSV-infected Mo-DC, little or no detectable IFN-α is found in the supernatants and cell lysates of PRRSV-infected Mo-DC, suggesting that PRRSV either blocks the translation of IFN-α or inhibits the RNA processing and transport. Furthermore, we observed that PRRSV infection significantly reduced the induction of IFN-α by Poly I:C treatment; and virus replication is essential to the effect since heat-inactivated PRRSV has no effect on IFN-α induction by Poly I:C. Overall, our data provide evidence for the possible role of PI3K in the activation of the transcription of IFN-α/β by PRRSV. We conclude that PRRSV inhibits the induction of IFN-α in Mo-DC by as yet undefined post-transcriptional mechanisms.","Zhang, Hanmo; Guo, Xueshui; Nelson, Eric; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Wang, Xiuqing",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.04.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351200274X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351200274X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22592217/,252

Within the present study, the effects of pure and nanoemulsified essential oil derived from Satureja Khuzistanica essential oil (SKEO) on Escherichia coli (E. coli ATCC 25922) as a human pathogen has been studied using a microfluidic chip. The morphology and antibacterial activity of E. coli at disparate residence durations (from 2 to 30 min) and various nanoemulsified or pure essential oil concentrations (8.0-62.5 µg mL-1) and numerous nanoemulsion's droplet sizes from 32 to 124 nm, have been investigated in the microfluidic system. Also, the quantitative analysis including optical density, time killing assay, protein, nucleic acid and potassium release were employed to confirm the effects of bacterial inhibition taking advantage of the chip apparatus. It was revealed that the prepared nanoemulsion left a considerable destructive effect on E. coli bacterial membrane, confirmed by fast release of cytoplasmic elements including protein, nucleic acid and potassium. However, this process was remarkably intensified for both nanoemulsion and pure essential oil using the microfluidic chip versus the conventional methods. The results also revealed that after 4 min of bacterium treatment by 12.5 µg mL-1 nanoemulsion with 32 nm mean particle size, the bacterial membrane wall began to degrade rapidly, and bacterial activity was almost completely inhibited in a 20-min period. These findings may have implications in the similarly structured and phospholipid-encapsulated bacteria and viruses, like COVID-19.","Alvand, Zinab Moradi; Rahimi, Masoud; Rafati, Hasan",Int J Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34419590/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.121032,252

Full-genome-sequence computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and adaptability mechanisms more accurately, as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor prophylactic strategy. In this study, we used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co-localized with regions in which recombination from non-human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","Vasilarou, Maria; Alachiotis, Nikolaos; Garefalaki, Joanna; Beloukas, Apostolos; Pavlidis, Pavlos",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.054122,252

However, little is known about host factors at the interface between replicase complexes and the host cytoplasm. We engineered a biotin ligase into a coronaviral replication/transcription complex (RTC) and identified >500 host proteins constituting the RTC microenvironment. siRNA-silencing of each RTC-proximal host factor demonstrated importance of vesicular trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related processes, and translation initiation factors. Notably, detection of translation initiation factors at the RTC was instrumental to visualize and demonstrate active translation proximal to replication complexes of several coronaviruses. Collectively, we establish a spatial link between viral RNA synthesis and diverse host factors of unprecedented breadth.

In the face of these complex issues, risk assessments supported by quantitative information would facilitate evidence-based decision making. We propose a conceptual model for disease transmission risk analysis, inclusive of these multiple other facets. To quantify several processes included in this conceptual model we conducted questionnaire surveys with wildlife consumers and vendors in semi-urban centers in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos) and direct observations of consumer behaviors. Direct observation of market stalls indicated an estimated average of 10 kg bushmeat biomass per stall per hour. The socio-demographic data suggested that consumption of bushmeat in urban areas was not for subsistence but rather driven by dietary preference and tradition. Consumer behavioral observations indicated that each animal receives an average of 7 contacts per hour. We provide other key parameters to estimate the risk of disease transmission from bushmeat consumption and illustrate their use in assessing the total public health and socio-economic impact of bushmeat consumption. Pursuing integrative approaches to the study of bushmeat consumption is essential to develop effective and balanced policies that support conservation, public health, and rural development goals.","Pruvot, Mathieu; Khammavong, Kongsy; Milavong, Phonesavanh; Philavong, Chanfong; Reinharz, Daniel; Mayxay, Mayfong; Rattanavong, Sayapeth; Horwood, Paul; Dussart, Philippe; Douangngeun, Bounlom; Theppangna, Watthana; Fine, Amanda E.; Olson, Sarah H.; Robinson, Matthew; Newton, Paul",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054417/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969719318017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719318017,252

COVID-19 pandemic has inadvertently exacerbated the problems of restricted access to OAT and, at the same time, has increased odds of harm due to opioid use. OBJECTIVES: We examined (a) adaptations conceived or implemented in the buprenorphine (BPN)-based OAT service delivery at the national, regional, or local level during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) the impact of such transformations on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of service delivery. We focused exclusively on BPN-based OAT. METHODS: We carried out a systematic electronic database search in PubMed and Google Scholar. We included all types of articles. Additionally, we looked up relevant websites of international and national government agencies working in the field of drug abuse. RESULTS: We included 21 articles from 10 countries in the review and summarized the results in a narrative format. The majority of literature was from developed countries. We observed changes in the BPN initiation, dosing, and dispensing protocols, and particular emphasis on telemedicine. There was limited literature on service provisions for the vulnerable population. The changing modes of service delivery have possibly increased the number of new patients and reduced the risk of exposure owing to limited in-person contact. CONCLUSION: Newer adaptations to meet with the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic in the BPN-based OAT delivery tend to be innovative, flexible, and patient centered. Although it is too early to comment on these newer adaptations' impact, the outcome's directions appear to be positive.","Ghosh, Abhishek; Naskar, Chandrima; Roub, Fazl-E; Basu, Debasish",J Opioid Manag,https://doi.org/10.5055/jom.2021.0649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520033/,252

However, previous demonstrations usually lacked efficient sensor modalities, facile fabrication process, mechanical stability, or biocompatibility. Here, we demonstrate a flexible approach for fabrication of multifunctional smart contact lenses with an ultrathin MoS(2) transistors-based serpentine mesh sensor system. The integrated sensor systems contain a photodetector for receiving optical information, a glucose sensor for monitoring glucose level directly from tear fluid, and a temperature sensor for diagnosing potential corneal disease. Unlike traditional sensors and circuit chips sandwiched in the lens substrate, this serpentine mesh sensor system can be directly mounted onto the lenses and maintain direct contact with tears, delivering high detection sensitivity, while being mechanically robust and not interfering with either blinking or vision. Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxicity tests reveal good biocompatibility, thus holding promise as next-generation soft electronics for healthcare and medical applications.","Guo, Shiqi; Wu, Kaijin; Li, Chengpan; Wang, Hao; Sun, Zheng; Xi, Dawei; Zhang, Sheng; Ding, Weiping; Zaghloul, Mona E.; Wang, Changning; Castro, Fernando A.; Yang, Dong; Zhao, Yunlong",Matter,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2020.12.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398259/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590238520306718; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590238520306718,252

This study investigates the impacts of and adaptations to COVID-19 among the hill tribe people of northern Thailand. METHODS: A qualitative method was used to elicit information from key informants who lived in a hill tribe village in Mae Fah Laung district, Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. Fourteen questions on two issues were used to gather information, and an NVivo program was used to extract the findings. RESULTS: A total of 57 hill tribe villagers participated, including 36 females and 21 males (mean age of 50.1 years, min = 20 and max = 90). Twenty-seven individuals were Thai Yai, 14 were Yunan Chinese, eight were Akha, and eight were members of other minor tribes. Regarding education and occupation, 30 individuals were illiterate, while 27 had attended different levels of primary school; 40 individuals were unemployed, 13 were employed as daily wage workers and farmers, and the other 4 were attending school.

At the same time, a variety of functional autoantibodies have been observed in individuals with severe COVID-19 where they likely contribute to immunopathology. Here, we aimed to determine the extent to which autoantibodies might target NETs in COVID-19 and, if detected, to elucidate their potential functions and clinical associations. We measured global anti-NET activity in 171 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 alongside 48 healthy controls. We found high anti-NET activity in the IgG and IgM fractions of approximately 40% and 50% of patients, respectively. There was a strong correlation between anti-NET IgG and anti-NET IgM, with high anti-NET antibody levels in general associating with circulating markers of NETs such as myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and calprotectin. Clinically, anti-NET antibodies tracked with impaired oxygenation efficiency and elevated levels of circulating D-dimer. Furthermore, patients who required mechanical ventilation had higher levels of anti-NET antibodies than those who did not require oxygen supplementation. Mechanistically, anti-NET antibodies of the IgG isotype impaired the ability of DNases in healthy serum to degrade NETs. In summary, these data reveal high levels of anti-NET antibodies in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, where they likely impair NET clearance and thereby potentiate SARS-CoV-2 mediated thromboinflammation.","Zuo, Y.; Yalavarthi, S.; Navaz, S.; Hoy, C.; Shi, H.; Harbaugh, A.; Gockman, K.; Zuo, M.; Madison, J.

Our original ensemble docking and cooperative docking approaches, followed by a total of over 16-micorsecond molecular simulations, have identified at least 9 compounds that may generally bind to key SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Further, we found evidence that some of these compounds can simultaneously bind to the same target, potentially leading to cooperative inhibition to SARS-CoV-2 proteins like the Spike protein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Objective: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on a wide range of mental health symptoms, to identify relevant risk factors, to identify the effect of COVID-19 country impact on mental health, and to evaluate regional differences in psychological responses to COVID-19 compared to other stressful events. Method: 7034 respondents (74% female) participated in the worldwide Global Psychotrauma Screen – Cross-Cultural responses to COVID-19 study (GPS-CCC), reporting on mental health symptoms related to COVID-19 (n = 1838) or other stressful events (n = 5196) from April to November 2020. Results: Events related to COVID-19 were associated with more mental health symptoms compared to other stressful events, especially symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and dissociation. Lack of social support, psychiatric history, childhood trauma, additional stressful events in the past month, and low resilience predicted more mental health problems for COVID-19 and other stressful events. Higher COVID-19 country impact was associated with increased mental health impact of both COVID-19 and other stressful events. Analysis of differences across geographic regions revealed that in Latin America more mental health symptoms were reported for COVID-19 related events versus other stressful events, while the opposite pattern was seen in North America. Conclusions: The mental health impact of COVID-19-related stressors covers a wide range of symptoms and is more severe than that of other stressful events. This difference was especially apparent in Latin America. The findings underscore the need for global screening for a wide range of mental health problems as part of a public health approach, allowing for targeted prevention and intervention programs.","Olff, Miranda; Primasari, Indira; Qing, Yulan; Coimbra, Bruno M.; Hovnanyan, Ani; Grace, Emma; Williamson, Rachel E.; Hoeboer, Chris M.; Consortium, the GPS-CCC",Eur J Psychotraumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262666/; https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1929754,252

This study was conducted to investigate epidemiological factors and patterns related to this disease. METHODS: Full details of MERS-CoV cases available on the disease outbreak news section of the World Health Organization official website from January 2013 to November 2016 were retrieved; demographic and clinical information, global distribution status, potential contacts, and probable risk factors for the mortality of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were extracted and analyzed by following standard statistical methods. RESULTS: Details of 1,094 laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded, including 421 related deaths. Significant differences were observed in the presentation of the disease from year to year, and all studied parameters differed during the years under study (all P-values <0.05). Evaluation of the effects of various potential risk factors of the final outcome (dead/survived) revealed that two factors, namely, the morbid case being native and travel history, are significant based on a unifactorial analysis (P <0.05). From 2013 to 2016, these factors remained important. However, factors that were significant in predicting mortality varied in different years. CONCLUSION: These findings point to interesting potential dimensions in the dynamic of this disease. Furthermore, effective national and international preparedness plans and actions are essential to prevent, control, and predict such viral outbreaks; improve patient management; and ensure global health security.","Aghazadeh-Attari, Javad; Mohebbi, Iraj; Mansorian, Behnam; Ahmadzadeh, Jamal; Mirza-Aghazadeh-Attari, Mohammad; Mobaraki, Kazhal; Oshnouei, Sima",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s160741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29670390/,252

Non-invasive neuromodulation may be useful in the treatment of the disorders associated with COVID-19. Objective: To describe the rationale and empirical basis of the use of non-invasive neuromodulation in the management of patients with COVID-10 and related disorders. Methods: We summarize COVID-19 pathophysiology with emphasis of direct neuroinvasiveness, neuroimmune response and inflammation, autonomic balance and neurological, musculoskeletal and neuropsychiatric sequela. This supports the development of a framework for advancing applications of non-invasive neuromodulation in the management COVID-19 and related disorders. Results: Non-invasive neuromodulation may manage disorders associated with COVID-19 through four pathways: (1) Direct infection mitigation through the stimulation of regions involved in the regulation of systemic anti-inflammatory responses and/or autonomic responses and prevention of neuroinflammation and recovery of respiration; (2) Amelioration of COVID-19 symptoms of musculoskeletal pain and systemic fatigue; (3) Augmenting cognitive and physical rehabilitation following critical illness; and (4) Treating outbreak-related mental distress including neurological and psychiatric disorders exacerbated by surrounding psychosocial stressors related to COVID-19. The selection of the appropriate techniques will depend on the identified target treatment pathway. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection results in a myriad of acute and chronic symptoms, both directly associated with respiratory distress (e.g., rehabilitation) or of yet-to-be-determined etiology (e.g., fatigue). Non-invasive neuromodulation is a toolbox of techniques that based on targeted pathways and empirical evidence (largely in non-COVID-19 patients) can be investigated in the management of patients with COVID-19.","Baptista, Abrahão Fontes; Baltar, Adriana; Okano, Alexandre Hideki; Moreira, Alexandre; Campos, Ana Carolina Pinheiro; Fernandes, Ana Mércia; Brunoni, André Russowsky; Badran, Bashar W.; Tanaka, Clarice; de Andrade, Daniel Ciampi; da Silva Machado, Daniel Gomes; Morya, Edgard; Trujillo, Eduardo; Swami, Jaiti K.; Camprodon, Joan A.; Monte-Silva, Katia; Sá, Katia Nunes; Nunes, Isadora; Goulardins, Juliana Barbosa; Bikson, Marom; Sudbrack-Oliveira, Pedro; de Carvalho, Priscila; Duarte-Moreira, Rafael Jardim; Pagano, Rosana Lima; Shinjo, Samuel Katsuyuki; Zana, Yossi",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.573718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324324/,252

The pandemic has forced many universities to transition rapidly to delivering online education. However, little is known about the impact of this drastic change on students' school adaptation. This cross-sectional study used an online questionnaire, including assessments of impressions of online education, study engagement, mental health, and lifestyle habits. In total, 1,259 students were assessed. The characteristics of school adaptation were analyzed by a two-step cluster analysis. The proportion of mental health problems was compared among different groups based on a cluster analysis. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of cluster membership. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The two-step cluster analysis determined three clusters: school adaptation group, school maladaptation group, and school over-adaptation group. The last group significantly exhibited the most mental health problems. Membership of this group was significantly associated with being female (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.06–1.91), being older (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.01–1.44), those who considered online education to be less beneficial (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.64–2.88), shorter sleep time on weekdays (OR = 0.826; 95% CI 0.683–.998), longer sleep time on holidays (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.03–1.43), and worse restorative sleep (OR = 2.27; 95% CI 1.81–2.86). The results suggest that academic staff should understand distinctive features of school adaptation owing to the rapid transition of the educational system and should develop support systems to improve students' mental health. They should consider ways to incorporate online classes with their lectures to improve students' perceived benefits of online education. Additionally, educational guidance on lifestyle, such as sleep hygiene, may be necessary.","Ishimaru, Daiki; Adachi, Hiroyoshi; Nagahara, Hajime; Shirai, Shizuka; Takemura, Haruo; Takemura, Noriko; Mehrasa, Alizadeh; Higashino, Teruo; Yagi, Yasushi; Ikeda, Manabu",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589012/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.731137,252

The etiology and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria were reported and used to provide a theoretical basis for appropriate infection therapy. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed electronic medical records of all the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Wuhan Union Hospital between January 27 and March 17, 2020. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients who acquired SBIs were enrolled. Demographic, clinical course, etiology, and antimicrobial resistance data of the SBIs were collected. Outcomes were also compared between patients who were classified as severe and critical on admission. RESULTS: Among 1495 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 102 (6.8%) patients had acquired SBIs, and almost half of them (49.0%, 50/102) died during hospitalization. Compared with severe patients, critical patients had a higher chance of SBIs. Among the 159 strains of bacteria isolated from the SBIs, 136 strains (85.5%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The top three bacteria of SBIs were A. baumannii (35.8%, 57/159), K. pneumoniae (30.8%, 49/159), and S. maltophilia (6.3%, 10/159). The isolation rates of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae were 91.2 and 75.5%, respectively. Meticillin resistance was present in 100% of Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase negative staphylococci, and vancomycin resistance was not found. CONCLUSIONS: SBIs may occur in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and lead to high mortality. The incidence of SBIs was associated with the severity of illness on admission. Gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, were the main bacteria, and the resistance rates of the major isolated bacteria were generally high. This was a single-center study; thus, our results should be externally examined when applied in other institutions.","Li, Jie; Wang, Junwei; Yang, Yi; Cai, Peishan; Cao, Jingchao; Cai, Xuefeng; Zhang, Yu",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962731/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-020-00819-1,252

The aim of this study was to develop a reliable algorithm to compute expected in‐hospital mortality rates in HF cohorts on a population level based on administrative data comparing regression analysis with different machine learning (ML) models. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inpatient cases with primary International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD‐10) encoded discharge diagnosis of HF non‐electively admitted to 86 German Helios hospitals between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018 were identified. The dataset was randomly split 75%/25% for model development and testing. Highly unbalanced variables were removed. Four ML algorithms were applied, and all algorithms were tuned using a grid search with multiple repetitions. Model performance was evaluated by computing receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve. In total, 59 125 cases (69.8% aged 75 years or older, 51.9% female) were investigated, and in‐hospital mortality was 6.20%. Areas under the curve of all ML algorithms outperformed regression analysis in the testing dataset with values of 0.829 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.814–0.843] for logistic regression, 0.875 (95% CI 0.863–0.886) for random forest, 0.882 (95% CI 0.871–0.893) for gradient boosting machine, 0.866 (95% CI 0.854–0.878) for single‐layer neural networks, and 0.882 (95% CI 0.872–0.893) for extreme gradient boosting. Brier scores demonstrated a good calibration especially of the latter three models. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced reliable models to calculate expected in‐hospital mortality based only on administrative routine data using ML algorithms. A broad application could supplement quality measurement programs and therefore improve future HF patient care.","König, Sebastian; Pellissier, Vincent; Hohenstein, Sven; Bernal, Andres; Ueberham, Laura; Meier‐Hellmann, Andreas; Kuhlen, Ralf; Hindricks, Gerhard; Bollmann, Andreas",ESC Heart Fail,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085775/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.13398,252

On the other hand, the percentage of children discharged right after pediatric visit significantly decreased from 80% in January to 50% in April. After March 9th, we registered a change in the diagnoses of emergency department visits, with an increase in the percentage of non-infectious acute conditions and a decrease in infectious diseases, with two cases of a noteworthy delayed access to hospital care. We performed a retrospective analysis of consultations requested to our pediatric unit for children and adolescents referred to the general Emergency Department of San Luca Hospital of Lucca (Tuscany, Central Italy) from January 1st to May 31st, 2020.

In the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which is considered to exert cellular responses to counteract the activation of the RAS primarily through a receptor, Mas, in multiple organs including skeletal muscle. Previous studies have provided abundant evidence suggesting that Ang 1-7 modulates multiple signalling pathways leading to protection from pathological muscle remodelling and muscle insulin resistance. In contrast, there is relatively little evidence to support the protective role of ACE2 in skeletal muscle. The potential contribution of endogenous ACE2 to the regulation of Ang 1-7-mediated protection of these muscle pathologies is discussed in this review. Recent studies have suggested that ACE2 protects against ageing-associated muscle wasting (sarcopenia) through its function to modulate molecules outside of the RAS. Thus, the potential association of sarcopenia with ACE2 and the associated molecules outside of RAS is also presented herein. Further, we introduce the transcriptional regulation of muscle ACE2 by drugs or exercise, and briefly discuss the potential role of ACE2 in the development of COVID-19.","Yamamoto, Koichi; Takeshita, Hikari; Rakugi, Hiromi",Clin Sci (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20200486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231620/,252
649536,Theoretical Insights into the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activity of Chloroquine and Its Analogs and In Silico Screening of Main Protease Inhibitors,2020-09-22,"BACKGROUND: Elderberry has traditionally been used to prevent and treat respiratory problems. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been interest in elderberry supplements to treat or prevent illness, but also concern that elderberry might overstimulate the immune system and increase the risk of ‘cytokine storm’. We aimed to determine benefits and harms of elderberry for the prevention and treatment of viral respiratory infections, and to assess the relationship between elderberry supplements and negative health impacts associated with overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched six databases, four research registers, and two preprint sites for studies. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data from studies, assessed risk of bias using Cochrane tools, and evaluated certainty of estimates using GRADE. Outcomes included new illnesses and the severity and duration of illness. RESULTS: We screened 1187 records and included five randomized trials on elderberry for the treatment or prevention of viral respiratory illness. We did not find any studies linking elderberry to clinical inflammatory outcomes. However, we found three studies measuring production of cytokines ex vivo after ingestion of elderberry. Elderberry may not reduce the risk of developing the common cold; it may reduce the duration and severity of colds, but the evidence is uncertain. Elderberry may reduce the duration of influenza but the evidence is uncertain. Compared to oseltamivir, an elderberry-containing product may be associated with a lower risk of influenza complications and adverse events. We did not find evidence on elderberry and clinical outcomes related to inflammation. However, we found evidence that elderberry has some effect on inflammatory markers, although this effect may decline with ongoing supplementation. One small study compared elderberry to diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and provided some evidence that elderberry is as effective or less effective than diclofenac in cytokine reduction over time. CONCLUSIONS: Elderberry may be a safe option for treating viral respiratory illness, and there is no evidence that it overstimulates the immune system. However, the evidence on both benefits and harms is uncertain and information from recent and ongoing studies is necessary to make firm conclusions.

Some emphasise social distancing, while others focus on other interventions. Evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions is urgently needed to guide public health policy and avoid unnecessary damage to the economy and other harms. We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on epidemic control, with a focus on cost-effectiveness. Methods: MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2020) and Embase (1974 to March 27, 2020) were searched using a range of terms related to epidemic control. Reviews, randomized trials, observational studies, and modelling studies were included. Articles reporting on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of at least one intervention were included and grouped into higher-quality (randomized trials) and lower-quality evidence (other study designs). Findings: We found 1,653 papers; 34 were included. Higher-quality evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies suggested that these measures are highly cost-effective. For other interventions, only evidence from observational and modelling studies was available. A cautious interpretation of this body of lower-quality evidence suggests that: (1) the most cost-effective interventions are swift contact tracing and case isolation, surveillance networks, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and early vaccination (when available); (2) home quarantines and stockpiling antivirals are less cost-effective; (3) social distancing measures like workplace and school closures are effective but costly, making them the least cost-effective options; (4) combinations are more cost-effective than single interventions; (5) interventions are more cost-effective when adopted early and for severe viruses like SARS-CoV-2. For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented). Conclusions: A cautious interpretation of this body of evidence suggests that for COVID-19: (1) social distancing is effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, swift contact tracing and case isolation, and protective equipment for healthcare workers is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.","Juneau, Carl-Etienne; Pueyo, Toma; Bell, Matt; Gee, Genevieve; Potvin, Louise",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.20054726; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20054726v1?rss=1,252

In the present study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays were used to analyse the expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS‐CoV spike (S) protein, and some pro‐inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including MCP‐1, TGF‐β1, TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6 in autopsy tissues from four patients who died of SARS. SARS‐CoV S protein and its RNA were only detected in ACE2(+) cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2‐expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS‐CoV infection in vivo in humans. High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS‐CoV‐infected ACE2(+) cells, but not in the uninfected cells. These results suggest that cells infected by SARS‐CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno‐mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in ALI and, subsequently, multi‐organ dysfunction. Therefore application of PIC antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS. Copyright © 2006 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

653420,Improved production of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) for serology assays,2020-11-18,"During epidemics, the medical working environment is highly stressful especially for the nurses. The purpose of this study was to assess occupational stress, job satisfaction, and intent to leave among nurses dealing with suspected COVID-19 patients. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 210 nurses from Zagazig Fever Hospital (ZFH) which is one of COVID-19 Triage Hospitals (Group I) versus 210 nurses from Zagazig General Hospital (ZGH) (Group II) which is neither triage nor isolation hospital; dealing only with suspected COVID-19 patients in emergency at Sharkia Governorate, Egypt, from 10th to 24th of April 2020. Assessment was done through online questionnaire formed of the Expanded Nursing Stress Scale, the McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale, and questionnaire assessing specific COVID-19-associated stressors and nurses’ intent to leave. Three quarters of nurses (75.2%) in ZFH had high stress level versus 60.5% in ZGH. Workload (98.6%), dealing with death and dying (96.7%), personal demands and fears (95.7%), employing strict biosecurity measures (95.2%), and stigma (90.5%) represented the highest priority stressors in ZFH, while exposure to infection risk (97.6%) was the stressor of highest priority among ZGH according to Pareto analysis. More than half of nurses (51.0%) in ZFH reported low satisfaction level versus 41.9% in ZGH. Only 4.8% of nurses in ZFH definitely had no intent to leave their present job. Type of hospital and its related workload were the most significant predictor of all the studied outcomes.

In this context, the ability of point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) to simultaneously explore multiple systems and detect polyserositis could promote adequate therapeutic management of fluid balance. We describe the PoCUS findings in a case-series of MIS-C patients admitted to the Emergency Department. At admission 10/11 patients showed satisfactory clinical condition without signs and symptoms suggestive for cardiovascular impairment/shock, but PoCUS showed pathological findings in 11/11 (100%). In particular, according to Rapid Ultrasound in SHock (RUSH) protocol, cardiac hypokinesis was detected in 5/11 (45%) and inferior vena cava dilatation in 3/11 (27%). Peritoneal fluid was reported in 6/11 cases (54%). Lung ultrasound (LUS) evaluation revealed an interstitial syndrome in 11/11 (100%), mainly localized in posterior basal lung segments. We suggest PoCUS as a useful tool in the first evaluation of children with suspected MIS-C for the initial therapeutic management and the following monitoring of possible cardiovascular deterioration.","Delmonaco, Angelo G.; Carpino, Andrea; Raffaldi, Irene; Pruccoli, Giulia; Garrone, Emanuela; Del Monte, Francesco; Riboldi, Lorenzo; Licciardi, Francesco; Urbino, Antonio F.; Parodi, Emilia",Ultrasound J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495434/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13089-021-00243-5,252

666220,5-amino levulinic acid inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,2021-03-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 obliged many countries to apply lockdown policies to contain the spread of infection. The restrictions in Israel included limitations on movement, reduction of working capacity and closure of the educational system. The present study focused on patients treated at a referral center for burns in northern Israel. Our goal was to investigate temporal variations in burn injuries during this period. Data was retrospectively extracted from the medical records of burn patients treated at our hospital between March 14, 2020 and April 20, 2020 (i.e., the period of aggravated lockdown). Data from this period was compared to that from paralleling periods between 2017-2019. During the lockdown and paralleling periods, 178 patients were treated for burn injuries, of whom 44% were under 18. Although no restrictions were enforced during the virus outbreak period with regard to seeking medical care, we noticed a decrease in the number of patients admitted to the emergency room for all reasons. Of particular interest was a 66% decrease in the number of adult burn patients (p&0.0001). Meanwhile, among the pediatric population, no significant decrease was observed. Nonetheless, subgroups with higher susceptibility to burn injuries included children aged 2-5 years (56.3% vs 23.8%, p=0.016) and female patients from all pediatric age groups (57.1% vs 25%, p=0.027). These findings may be explained by the presumably busier kitchen and dining areas during the lockdown. Overall, the study results can assist with building a stronger understanding of varying burn injuries, and with developing educational and preventive strategies.","Kruchevsky, Dani; Arraf, Maher; Levanon, Shir; Capucha, Tal; Ramon, Yitzchak; Ullmann, Yehuda",J Burn Care Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/jbcr/iraa154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914186/,252

BEECS undertook a baseline survey of its members after the initial response from the RCOphth 16/3/20 mirroring Public Health England (PHE) advice and a follow- up survey after the guidance was updated on 9/4/20. A combined total of 84 responses were received. Improvements after RCOphth changes between the two surveys from hospital respondents showed increases in temperature screening (13%), scrub use (34%), use of aprons (31%), masks (4%), eye protection (35%), gloves (25%) and slit lamp guard (1%). Our findings demonstrate a positive and significant adaptation of PPE in response to change in guidance published by PHE, RCOphth and BEECS between 16/3/20 and 11/4/20. The COVID19 pandemic has rapidly taken over the normal activity of Ophthalmic departments creating unprecedented challenges. Following initial confusion and vulnerability expressed by EEC professionals to PPE guidance, most Trusts appear to have adapted and are doing similar things.

Herein, we report results of the initial management of patients at one of the largest CTC in Korea. A total of 309 patients were admitted to our CTC. During the first two weeks, 7 patients were transferred to the hospital because of symptom aggravation and 107 patients were discharged without any complication.

Method: Eighty infants underwent postoperative invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 12 h and planned extubation. The infants were randomized to undergo either NHFOV or NCPAP after extubation. Primary outcomes were the incidence of PRF and reintubation, the average PaCO(2) level, the average oxygenation index (OI), and pulmonary recruitment in the early extubation phase. Secondary outcomes included the NCPAP/NHFOV time, length of hospital stay, treatment intolerance, signs of discomfort, pneumothorax, adverse hemodynamic effects, nasal trauma, and mortality. Results: Except for PaCO(2) within 12 after extubation (39.3 ± 5.8 vs. 43.6 ± 7.3 mmHg, p = 0.05), there was no statistically significant difference for any of the primary outcome measure (PRF, reintubation within 12 h after extubation, oxygenation index within 12 h after extubation, or lung volumes on X-ray after extubation) or secondary outcome measures (duration of non-invasive ventilation, duration of hospital stay, ventilation intolerance, signs of discomfort, pneumothorax, nasal trauma, adverse hemodynamic effects, or death prior to discharge), p > 0.1 for each comparison. Conclusion: NHFOV therapy after extubation in infants after CHS was more efficient in improving CO(2) cleaning than NCPAP therapy, but there was no difference in other outcomes (PRF, reintubation, oxygenation index, and pulmonary recruitment).","Wu, Hong-Lin; Lei, Yu-Qing; Xie, Wen-Peng; Chen, Qiang; Zheng, Yi-Rong",Front Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.700632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485193/,252

There is currently only one antiviral compound, remdesivir, that can be used for the treatment of COVID-19. To identify additional potential therapeutics, we investigated the enzymatic proteins encoded in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In this study, we focussed on the viral RNA cap methyltransferases, which play key roles in enabling viral protein translation and facilitating viral escape from the immune system. We expressed and purified both the guanine-N7 methyltransferase nsp14, and the nsp16 2′-O-methyltransferase with its activating cofactor, nsp10. We performed an in vitro high-throughput screen for inhibitors of nsp14 using a custom compound library of over 5000 pharmaceutical compounds that have previously been characterised in either clinical or basic research. We identified four compounds as potential inhibitors of nsp14, all of which also showed antiviral capacity in a cell-based model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, social isolation leads to significant psycho‐emotional changes. This study aimed to assess the effect of distance education (DE) activities implemented due to social isolation, on the quality of life of undergraduate dentistry students. METHOD: An e‐questionnaire (Google Forms®) was administered to identify specific DE activities after social isolation and included the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)‐bref questionnaire. The e‐questionnaire was sent 14 days after the initiation of social isolation, remaining available for 48h. Cronbach’s alpha and the means of the quality of life domains were calculated and analyzed using the Friedman/Dunn and Spearman’s correlation tests. After ranking, Chi‐squared and Fisher’s exact tests plus multinomial‐logistic‐regression were performed (SPSS, p<0.05). RESULT: There was an excellent internal consistency of WHOQOL‐bref (α=0.916), and the mean quality of life (0‐100) was 70.66±12.61. The psychological domain was the most affected (p<0.001). The social domain exhibited the weakest correlation with overall quality of life (p<0.001, r=0.688). The use of the Internet, cell phones, and streaming media increased, although all students had DE activities. In the multivariate analysis, attending virtual meetings (p=0.028) and performing DE activities in an office/study room (p=0.034) were significantly associated with good quality of life. CONCLUSION: Facing social isolation never previously experienced by this generation, undergraduate dentistry students are at risk of reduced quality of life.

Applications exploit the ability of LVMs to identify latent data structure in order to improve data (e.g., through denoising) or to estimate the relation between latent causes and measurements in medical data. In the latter case, LVMs in the form of noisy-OR Bayes nets represent the standard approach to relate binary latents (which represent diseases) to binary observables (which represent symptoms). Bayes nets with binary representation for symptoms may be perceived as a coarse approximation, however. In practice, real disease symptoms can range from absent over mild and intermediate to very severe. Therefore, using diseases/symptoms relations as motivation, we here ask how standard noisy-OR Bayes nets can be generalized to incorporate continuous observables, e.g., variables that model symptom severity in an interval from healthy to pathological. This transition from binary to interval data poses a number of challenges including a transition from a Bernoulli to a Beta distribution to model symptom statistics. While noisy-OR-like approaches are constrained to model how causes determine the observables’ mean values, the use of Beta distributions additionally provides (and also requires) that the causes determine the observables’ variances. To meet the challenges emerging when generalizing from Bernoulli to Beta distributed observables, we investigate a novel LVM that uses a maximum non-linearity to model how the latents determine means and variances of the observables. Given the model and the goal of likelihood maximization, we then leverage recent theoretical results to derive an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for the suggested LVM. We further show how variational EM can be used to efficiently scale the approach to large networks. Experimental results finally illustrate the efficacy of the proposed model using both synthetic and real data sets. Importantly, we show that the model produces reliable results in estimating causes using proofs of concepts and first tests based on real medical data and on images.","Mousavi, Hamid; Buhl, Mareike; Guiraud, Enrico; Drefs, Jakob; Lücke, Jörg",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947060/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e23050552,252

In this study, we have characterized the mechanism of membrane interaction of a short, 9-residue peptide TK9 (T(55)VYVYSRVK(63)) that had been derived from the carboxyl terminal of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) corona virus (SARS CoV) envelope (E) protein. The peptide has been studied for its physical changes in the presence of both zwitterionic DPC and negatively charged SDS model membrane micelles, respectively, with the help of a battery of biophysical techniques including two-dimensional solution state NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, in both micellar environments, TK9 adopted an alpha helical conformation; however, the helical propensities were much higher in the case of DPC compared to those of SDS micelle, suggesting that TK9 has more specificity towards eukaryotic cell membrane than the bacterial cell membrane. The orientation of the peptide TK9 also varies in the different micellar environments. The peptide's affinity was further manifested by its pronounced membrane disruption ability towards the mammalian compared to the bacterial membrane mimic. Collectively, the in-depth structural information on the interaction of TK9 with different membrane environments explains the host specificity and membrane orientation owing to subsequent membrane disruption implicated in the viral pathogenesis.","Ghosh, Anirban; Bhattacharyya, Dipita; Bhunia, Anirban",Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0005273617303334; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273617303334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29038024/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2017.10.015,252
684327,Complete mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain that escape antibody recognition,2020-11-19,"COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease and was recently declared as a pandemic by WHO. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic available for this disease. Drug repositioning represents the only feasible option to address this global challenge and a panel of 48 FDA-approved drugs that have been pre-selected by an assay of SARS-CoV was screened to identify potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a total of 24 drugs which exhibited antiviral efficacy (0.1 μM < IC50 < 10 μM) against SARS-CoV-2. In particular, two FDA-approved drugs - niclosamide and ciclesonide – were notable in some respects. These drugs will be tested in an appropriate animal model for their antiviral activities. In near future, these already FDA-approved drugs could be further developed following clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19.","Jeon, Sangeun; Ko, Meehyun; Lee, Jihye; Choi, Inhee; Byun, Soo Young; Park, Soonju; Shum, David; Kim, Seungtaek",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.999730,252

Their in vivo anticonvulsant screenings were performed by two most adopted seizure models, maximal electroshock seizure (MES) and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ). Compound 5f was found active in MES screening while compounds 5h, 5i, 5k and 5l showed significant anticonvulsant activity in both the screenings and were devoid of any neurotoxicity. Compound 5h and 5i showed marked protection at 300 mg/kg against MES and scPTZ screening. Compound 5i also showed protection against MES screening at the dose of 100 mg/kg. In 6 Hz screening these two compounds showed significant protection and emerged as lead compounds for future investigations.","Siddiqui, Nadeem; Alam, M.

690108,An in silico LLPS perturbation approach in the design of a novel SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain inhibitor,2020-11-25,"The worldwide corona virus (COVID‐19) has had profound effects on all aspects of life: physical health, the ability to travel locally or to more distant destinations, material and financial resources, and psychosocial wellbeing. Couples, families, and communities and individual persons in those relationships have struggled to cope with emerging depression, anxiety, and trauma, and the rise of relational conflict. In this article, we suggest that the existential nature of the pandemic’s challenges require more than just the usual psychosocial interventions. We propose a taxonomy of responses to foster coping and resilience – “Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around”. “Reaching Up” includes accessing spiritual, religious, and ethical values. “Reaching Down” includes ideas and practices that foster a revised relationship with the Earth and its resources, and that engage families to participate in activities that aid the Earth’s recovery from decades of human‐caused damage. “Reaching In” represents a turn towards experiences available in the mind and in shared minds in relationships that provide pleasure, excitement, joy, and peace, given that external sources of these emotions are of limited availability due to quarantine. “Reaching Around” involves reframing the mandate for “social distancing” as fostering social connection and support while maintaining physical distancing. The challenges for family therapists, whose practices are confined largely to online therapy, and who are struggling with the same fears and constraints as those persons they are attempting to help, are also discussed.","Fraenkel, Peter; Cho, Wonyoung L.",Fam Process,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589265/; https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12570,252
