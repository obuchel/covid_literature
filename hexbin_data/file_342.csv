2202,2202,2202,Safety of Tdap vaccine in pregnant women: an observational study,19.410692,7.1402826,2016-04-18,"OBJECTIVES: Actively recruit and intensively follow pregnant women receiving a dose of acellular pertussis vaccine for 4 weeks after vaccination. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A prospective observational study conducted in 2 New Zealand regions. PARTICIPANTS: Women in their 28th–38th week of pregnancy, recruited from primary care and antenatal clinics at the time of Tdap administration. Telephone interviews were conducted at 48 h and 4 weeks postvaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Outcomes were injection site reactions, systemic symptoms and serious adverse events (SAEs). Where available, data have been classified and reported according to Brighton Collaboration definitions. RESULTS: 793 women participated with 27.9% receiving trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine concomitantly. 79% of participants reported mild or moderate pain and 2.6% severe pain. Any swelling was reported by 7.6%, induration by 12.0% (collected from 1 site only, n=326), and erythema by 5.8% of participants. Fever was reported by 17 (2.1%) participants, 14 of these occurred within 24 h. Headache, dizziness, nausea, myalgia or arthralgia was reported by <4% of participants, respectively, and fatigue by 8.4%. During the study period, there were 115 adverse events in 113 participants, most of which were minor. At the end of the reporting period, 31 events were classified as serious (eg, obstetric bleeding, hypertension, infection, tachycardia, preterm labour, exacerbation of pre-existing condition and pre-eclampsia). All had variable onset time from vaccination. There were two perinatal deaths. Clinician assessment of all SAEs found none likely to be vaccine related. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with Tdap in pregnant women was well tolerated with no SAE likely to be caused by the vaccine.

3389,3389,3389,Differential chemokine expression patterns in tonsillar disease,19.169868,6.801495,2018-08-11,"Expression profiles of CXC- and CC-chemokines in various forms of tonsillar disease were studied to evaluate whether certain chemokines play a predominant role in a specific subset of tonsillar disease. Total RNA was isolated from 89 biopsies (21 hyperplastic palatine tonsils, 25 adenoids, 16 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils and 27 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils with histological prove of acute inflammation), reverse transcribed and subjected to PCR amplifying IL-8, Gro-alpha, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and RANTES. 2% agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a predominance of IL-8 in the chronic inflammatory palatine tonsil group compared to tonsillar hyperplasia. Furthermore, eotaxin-2 was strongly overexpressed in adenoid samples compared to chronic inflammatory specimens. Our data suggest that the majority of diseases related to adenoid formation are mediated via an eotaxin-2 expression, whereas chronic inflammatory tonsillitis is associated with IL-8 upregulation. These data imply that adenoids are related to a Th-2, and chronic inflammatory tonsillitis to a Th-1 based immune response.","Mandapathil, M.; H.Beier, U.; Graefe, H.; Kröger, B.; Hedderich, J.; Maune, S.; Meyer, J.

4103,4103,4103,Prevention of respiratory outbreaks in the rehabilitation setting,19.451406,6.8728485,2019-10-09,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral (RV) outbreaks in rehabilitation facilities can jeopardise patient safety, interfere with patient rehabilitation goals and cause unit closures that impede patient flow in referring facilities. PROBLEM: Despite education about infection prevention practices, frequent RV outbreaks were declared each year at our rehabilitation facility. METHODS: Before and after study design. The primary outcome was the number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days. Process measures included delays in initiation of transmission-based precautions, RV testing and reporting of staff to occupational health and safety (OHS). Balancing measures included the number of isolation days and staff missed work hours. INTERVENTIONS: Based on comprehensive analysis of prior outbreaks, the following changes were implemented: (1) clear criteria for initiation of transmission-based precautions, (2) communication to visitors to avoid visitation if infectious symptoms were present, (3) exemption of staff absences if documented due to infectious illness, (4) development of an electronic programme providing guidance to staff about whether they should be excluded from work due to infectious illness. RESULTS: The number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days dropped from 2.8% to 0.5% during the intervention season and sustained at 0.6% during the postintervention season (p<0.001). There were fewer delays in initiation of droplet and contact precautions (28.8% to 15.5%, p=0.005) and collection of RV testing (42.9% to 20.3%, p<0.001), better reporting to OHS (9 vs 28.8 reports per 100 employees; p<0.001) and fewer isolation days (7.8% vs 7.3%; p=0.02) without a significant increase in missed work hours per 100 hours worked (4.0 vs 3.9; p=0.12). CONCLUSION: This Quality Improvement study highlights the process changes that can prevent respiratory outbreaks in the rehabilitation setting.","Corpus, Carla; Williams, Victoria; Salt, Natasha; Agnihotri, Tanya; Morgan, Wendy; Robinson, Lawrence; Maze Dit Mieusement, Lorraine; Cobbam, Sonja; Leis, Jerome A",BMJ Open Qual,342,1

METHODS: The retrospective case study was conducted at the Pediatric ward and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) dedicated to the children (aged 18 years or younger) with influenza-like illness (ILI) with positive laboratory test results for pandemic H1N1 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: Between August 2009 and January 2010, a total of 100 children were hospitalized with suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza with Category “C” as described by the Government of India. Twenty five patients were positive for H1N1 and 9 for seasonal influenza A. The most common presentation (H1N1 positive) was with fever (100%), cough (100%), coryza (52%), respiratory distress (88%), vomiting (28%) and diarrhea (16%). One child presented with hypernatremic dehydration and seizures (Serum sodium 174 meq/l). Of the H1N1 positive hospitalized children, 7 (28%) had respiratory failure and required PICU admission, 4 (16%) required mechanical ventilation, and 3 (12%) died. The major radiological findings were bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and consolidation. All patients were treated with oral Oseltamivir suspension or capsule as per appropriate weigh band and supportive care as required. Two deaths were caused by refractory hypoxemia and one by refractory shock. CONCLUSIONS: The exact incidence of Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza on morbidity and mortality is difficult to calculate since only Category “C” patients were screened.","Parakh, Ankit; Kumar, Amit; Kumar, Virendra; Kumar Dutta, Ashok; Khare, Shashi",Indian J Pediatr,342,1

This report examined the effectiveness of adopting bCPAP to reduce respiratory complications and medication usage in a community hospital NICU. METHODS: The efficacy of bCPAP was assessed by retrospective examination and comparison of 45 neonates who received bCPAP and 87 neonates who received conventional ventilation only. Data on medication usage were also collected and analyzed. RESULTS: After introduction of the bCPAP protocol, the median number of days on oxygen decreased in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (median = 33 days, IQR = 7.5–66 vs median = 0, IQR = 0–0; P < 0.001). The exposure to conventional ventilation decreased in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (median = 18 days, IQR = 5–42.5 vs median = 0, IQR = 0–7; P < 0.001). Postimplementation of bCPAP revealed decreases in CLD from 26 (30%) in the conventional ventilation only group to 2 (4%) in the bCPAP group (P = 0.002); there was also a significant decrease in the use of sedative medications in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (mean = 5.20 doses, SD = 31.97 vs mean = 1.43, SD = 9.98; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of bCPAP results in significant decreases in the use of conventional ventilation, the risk for CLD, and the need for sedative medication.","Miller, Tricia A.; Li, Jing; Riddell, Stella; Barkley, Steven C.",Pediatr Qual Saf,342,1
12673,12673,12673,First in the Nation: Washington State's Long‐Term Care Trust Act,19.41707,6.878578,2019-12-19,"BACKGROUND: Short Birth Interval negatively affects the health of both mothers and children in developing nations, like, Ethiopia. However, studies conducted to date in Ethiopia upon short birth interval were inconclusive and they did not show the extent and determinants of short birth interval in developing (Afar, Somali, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz) regions of the country. Thus, this study was intended to assess the short birth interval and its determinants in the four developing regions of the country. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Demographic and Health Survey program official database website (http://dhsprogram.com). A sample of 2683 women of childbearing age group (15–49) who had at least two alive consecutive children in the four developing regions of Ethiopia was included in this study. A multilevel multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of short birth interval and Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) was used during the model selection procedure. RESULTS: In this study, the prevalence of short birth interval was 46% [95% CI; 43.7%, 47.9%]. The multilevel multivariable logistic regression model showed women living in rural area [AOR = 1.52, CI: 1.12, 2.05], women attended secondary education and above level [AOR = 0.27, CI: 0.05, 0.54], have no media exposure [AOR = 1.35, CI: 1.18, 1.56], female sex of the index child [AOR = 1.13, CI:1.07,1.20], breastfeeding duration [AOR = 0.79, CI: 0.77, 0.82], having six and more ideal number of children [AOR = 1.14, CI: 1.09, 1.20] and having preferred waiting time to birth two years and above [AOR = 0.86, CI: 0.78, 0.95] were the predictors of short birth interval. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of short birth intervals in the developing regions of Ethiopia is still high. Therefore, the government of Ethiopia should work on the access of family planning and education in rural parts of the developing regions where more than 90% of the population in these regions is pastoral.","Aychiluhm, Setognal Birara; Tadesse, Abay Woday; Mare, Kusse Urmale; Abdu, Mohammed; Ketema, Abdusemed",PLoS One,342,12

The use of a sensitive, precise, accurate, low-cost, and easy-to-perform copromicroscopic technique is of pivotal importance to perform reliable fecal egg count (FEC) and fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), in order to determine the need of anthelmintic treatment, but also anthelmintic efficacy or resistance. This approach is fundamental to a correct and efficient control of GIN. Unfortunately, in worldwide ruminant farm practice, repeated anthelmintic treatments are carried out, without prior diagnosis of infection, contributing to the spread of Anthelmintic Resistance (AR). Tackling this phenomenon, improving mainly the GIN diagnosis and AR status in farm animals, is a priority of the European COST Action “COMBAR—COMBatting Anthelmintic Resistance in Ruminants” and of the STAR-IDAZ International Research Consortium on Animal Health. One of the specific objectives of the COMBAR Working Group 1 (WG1) is to conduct an European market analysis of new diagnostics and develop a business plan for commercial test introduction, leveraging technical know-how of participants. Since the Mini-FLOTAC in combination with the Fill-FLOTAC may be considered a good candidate for a standardized FEC and FECRT in the laboratory, as well as directly in the field, the aim of this study was to conduct SWOT (Strength—Weaknesses—Opportunities—Threats) and PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) analyses of these tools in 20 European countries involved in the COMBAR WG1, in order to identify the opportunities, barriers, and challenges that might affect the Mini-FLOTAC and Fill-FLOTAC commercialization in Europe.","Maurelli, Maria Paola; Dourado Martins, Oliva Maria; Morgan, Eric R.; Charlier, Johannes; Cringoli, Giuseppe; Mateus, Teresa Letra; Bacescu, Bogdan; Chartier, Christophe; Claerebout, Edwin; de Waal, Theo; Helm, Christina; Hertzberg, Hubertus; Hinney, Barbara; Höglund, Johan; Kyriánová, Iveta Angela; Mickiewicz, Marcin; Petkevičius, Saulius; Simin, Stanislav; Sotiraki, Smaragda; Tosheska, Marina; Toth, Mariann; Martínez-Valladares, María; Varady, Marian; Sekovska, Blagica; von Samson-Himmelstjerna, Georg; Rinaldi, Laura",Front Vet Sci,342,21

This study aimed to determine when catch-up growth starts in infants with CDH and to determine the adequate amount of nutrition required during catch-up growth. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study involving neonates with isolated CDH (born 2006–2010; n = 98). Weight gain velocity (WGV) was calculated using body weight Z-scores. The minimum required weight gain was defined as WGV ≥ 0. Patients were dichotomized into severe and non-severe cases according to diaphragmatic defects. RESULTS: Average monthly WGV changed from < 0 to ≥ 0 at 2 months of age. Total caloric intake at 2 months of age was lower when the WGV between 1 and 3 months was < 0 in both severe cases [122 (95% confidence interval (CI) 116–128) vs. 97 (95% CI 84–110) kcal/kg/day, p = 0.02] and non-severe cases [115 (95% CI 110–120) vs. 99 (95% CI 87–111) kcal/kg/day, p < 0.001)]. CONCLUSION: Catch-up growth started at approximately 2 months of age. During this period, total caloric intake of > 122 kcal/kg/day was needed to avoid decreases in the body weight Z-score in severe cases.","Terui, Keita; Tazuke, Yuko; Nagata, Kouji; Ito, Miharu; Okuyama, Hiroomi; Hayakawa, Masahiro; Taguchi, Tomoaki; Sato, Yasunori; Usui, Noriaki",Pediatr Surg Int,342,28

No existing explanations account fully for these differences in life expectancy, although they do highlight the complexity and interaction of biological, social and health service factors. Methods: this paper is an exploratory explanation of gendered life expectancy difference (GLED) using a novel combination of epidemiological and sociological methods. We present the global picture of GLED. We then utilise a secondary data comparative case analysis offering explanations for GLED in Australia and Ethiopia. We combine a social determinant of health lens with Bourdieu’s concepts of capitals (economic, cultural, symbolic and social). Results: we confirmed continuing GLED in all countries ranging from less than a year to over 11 years. The Australian and Ethiopian cases demonstrated the complex factors underpinning this difference, highlighting similarities and differences in socioeconomic and cultural factors and how they are gendered within and between the countries. Bourdieu’s capitals enabled us to partially explain GLED and to develop a conceptual model of causal pathways. Conclusion: we demonstrate the value of combing a SDH and Bourdieu’s capital lens to investigate GLED. We proposed a theoretical framework to guide future research.","Baum, Fran; Musolino, Connie; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; Popay, Jennie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,342,1

Since previous research described an enhanced poststroke integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) upon systemic transplantation of neural progenitor cells, we examined if neural progenitor cell-derived EVs affect BBB integrity and which cellular mechanisms are involved in the process. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using in vitro models of primary brain endothelial cell (EC) cultures as well as co-cultures of brain ECs (ECs) and astrocytes exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation, we examined the effects of EVs or vehicle on microvascular integrity. In vitro data were confirmed using a mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Cultured ECs displayed increased ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter B1) levels when exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation, which was reversed by treatment with EVs. The latter was due to an EV-induced inhibition of the NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) pathway. Using a BBB co-culture model of ECs and astrocytes exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation, EVs stabilized the BBB and ABCB1 levels without affecting the transcellular electrical resistance of ECs. Likewise, EVs yielded reduced Evans blue extravasation, decreased ABCB1 expression as well as an inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, and downstream matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) activity in stroke mice. The EV-induced inhibition of the NF-κB pathway resulted in a poststroke modulation of immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that EVs enhance poststroke BBB integrity via ABCB1 and MMP-9 regulation, attenuating inflammatory cell recruitment by inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.","Zhang, Lin; Graf, Irina; Kuang, Yaoyun; Zheng, Xuan; Haupt, Matteo; Majid, Arshad; Kilic, Ertugrul; Hermann, Dirk M.; Psychogios, Marios-Nikos; Weber, Martin S.; Ochs, Jasmin; Bähr, Mathias; Doeppner, Thorsten R.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,342,1

We conducted a scoping literature review of observational and qualitative studies that examined stigma and HIV-related outcomes among MSM. Our search identified 5794 studies, of which 47 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The review suggests that stigma remains a formidable barrier to engaging in HIV prevention and treatment among both HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM. Among the studies of HIV-positive MSM, internalized stigma was related to lower levels of treatment engagement. HIV-positive MSM in the Southern part of the US were also more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. Perceived health care discrimination was negatively associated with PrEP awareness, particularly among HIV-negative Black MSM. Among young MSM of color, intersectional stigma compounded the social structural barriers to PrEP adherence. Findings indicate that stigma reduction interventions should be implemented in diverse MSM communities to address the disproportionate burden of HIV along with critical gap in the care continuum. Further research should examine how individual types of stigma, including intersectional stigma, affect viral suppression and PrEP uptake and adherence, especially among MSM of color.

Here, we present the molecular epidemiology of HAdV and classic HAstV in children with acute diarrhea in Shanghai. METHODS: Fecal specimens were collected from 804 outpatient infants and young children diagnosed with acute diarrhea in Shanghai from January 2017 to December 2018. All of the samples were screened for the presence of HAdV and classic HAstV. HAdV and classic HAstV were detected using traditional PCR and reverse-transcription PCR, respectively. All of the HAdV and classic HAstV positive samples were genotyped by phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Among the 804 fecal samples, 8.58% (69/804) of samples were infected with either HAdV or classic HAstV, and five were co-infected with two diarrhea viruses. The overall detection rates of HAdV and classic HAstV were 3.47% (28/804) and 5.22% (42/804), respectively. Four subgroups (A, B, C, and F) and seven genotypes (HAdV-C1, −C2, −B3, −C5, −A31, −F40, and -F41) of HAdV were detected. Subgroup F had the highest constituent ratio at 64.29% (18/28), followed by non-enteric HAdV of subgroup C (21.43%, 6/28) and subgroup B 10.71% (3/28). HAdV-F41 (60.71%, 17/28) was the dominant genotype, followed by HAdV-C2 (14.29%, 4/28) and HAdV-B3 (10.71%, 3/28). Two genotypes of classic HAstV (HAstV-1 and HAstV-5) were identified in 42 samples during the study period; HAstV-1 (95.24%, 40/42) was the predominant genotype, and the other two strains were genotyped as HAstV-5. No significant differences were found between boys and girls in the detection rates of HAdV (P = 0.604) and classic HAstV (P = 0.275). Over half of the HAdV infections (82.14%, 23/28) and classic HAstV infections (66.67%, 28/42) occurred in children less than 36 months. Seasonal preferences of HAdV and classic HAstV infections were summer and winter, respectively. In this study, the common clinical symptoms of children with acute diarrhea were diarrhea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that HAdV and classic HAstV play important roles in the pathogenesis of acute diarrhea in children in Shanghai. Systematic and long-term surveillance of HAdV and classic HAstV are needed to monitor their prevalence in children and prevent major outbreak.","Lu, Lijuan; Zhong, Huaqing; Xu, Menghua; Su, Liyun; Cao, Lingfeng; Jia, Ran; Xu, Jin",BMC Infect Dis,342,1

However, there is a higher health risk for people exposed to high levels of moxa smoke for extended durations. Here, we report the first ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) fingerprint profiles and pharmacodynamic evaluation of moxa smoke, as well as evaluation of its aqueous solution on a rat model of superficial infection. METHODS: A novel method for moxa smoke fingerprint profiling was developed using UHPLC under characteristic wavelength. Chromatographic peaks were further analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS). 12 sample batches obtained from various Chinese provinces were then analyzed using similarity evaluation, clustering analysis, and principal component analysis. The pharmacodynamics of moxa smoke and moxa aqueous solution were investigated on a rat model of acute skin wound infection. RESULTS: UHPLC fingerprint profiles of 12 batches of moxa smoke were generated at 270 nm wavelength and 21 chromatographic peaks extracted as common peaks. Similarity between the 12 batches ranged from 0.341 to 0.982. Based on cluster analysis, the 12 batches of moxa smoke samples were clustered into five groups. Principal component analysis showed that the cumulative contribution of the three principal components reached 90.17%. Eigenvalues of the first, second, and third principal components were 10.794, 6.504, and 1.638, respectively. The corresponding variance contribution rates were 51.40%, 30.97%, and 7.80%, respectively. Pharmacological analysis found that wound healing was slow in the model group relative to the mupirocin ointment, moxa smoke, and aqueous moxa smoke solution groups. Histological analysis revealed markedly reduced tissue inflammation in rats treated with moxa smoke or its aqueous solution. CONCLUSIONS: Moxa smoke and its aqueous solution significantly promote wound healing upon superficial infection. A novel quality control method for moxa smoke was established and evaluated for the first time. As its main effects are unchanged, the transformation of moxa smoke into aqueous moxa smoke improves safety and is a simple and controllable process.","Wang, Yanling; Wu, Shengbing; Chen, Leijing; Xu, Guo; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Wu, Jie; Wang, Bin; Zhou, Meiqi",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,342,1

New approaches are therefore needed. We devised a research and action agenda that calls for a collective task of revisiting biodiversity toward the goal of sustaining diverse and just futures for life on Earth. Revisiting biodiversity involves critically reflecting on past and present research, policy, and practice concerning biodiversity to inspire creative thinking about the future. The agenda was developed through a 2‐year dialogue process that involved close to 300 experts from diverse disciplines and locations. This process was informed by social science insights that show biodiversity research and action is underpinned by choices about how problems are conceptualized. Recognizing knowledge, action, and ethics as inseparable, we synthesized a set of principles that help navigate the task of revisiting biodiversity. The agenda articulates 4 thematic areas for future research. First, researchers need to revisit biodiversity narratives by challenging conceptualizations that exclude diversity and entrench the separation of humans, cultures, economies, and societies from nature. Second, researchers should focus on the relationships between the Anthropocene, biodiversity, and culture by considering humanity and biodiversity as tied together in specific contexts. Third, researchers should focus on nature and economies by better accounting for the interacting structures of economic and financial systems as core drivers of biodiversity loss. Finally, researchers should enable transformative biodiversity research and action by reconfiguring relationships between human and nonhuman communities in and through science, policy, and practice. Revisiting biodiversity necessitates a renewed focus on dialogue among biodiversity communities and beyond that critically reflects on the past to channel research and action toward fostering just and diverse futures for human and nonhuman life on Earth.","Wyborn, C.; Montana, J.; Kalas, N.; Clement, S.; Davila, F.; Knowles, N.; Louder, E.; Balan, M.; Chambers, J.; Christel, L.; Forsyth, T.; Henderson, G.; Izquierdo Tort, S.; Lim, M.; Martinez‐Harms, M.

This paper presents the perceptions of the key stakeholders in the public sector to explore factors influencing the care of small and sick newborns and young infants in inpatient care settings across Pakistan. METHODS: This exploratory study was part of a larger study assessing the situation of newborn and young infant in-patient care provided across all four provinces and administrative regions of Pakistan. We conducted 43 interviews. Thirty interviews were conducted with the public sector health care providers involved in newborn and young infant care and 13 interviews were carried out with health planners and managers working at the provincial level. A semi-structured interview guide was used to explore participants’ perspectives on enablers and barriers to the quality of care provided to small and sick newborns at the facility level. The interviews were manually analyzed using thematic content analysis. FINDINGS: The study respondents identified multiple barriers contributing to the poor quality of small and sick newborn care at inpatient care settings. This includes an absence of neonatal care standards, inadequate infrastructure and equipment for the care of small and sick newborns, deficient workforce for neonatal case management, inadequate thermal care management for newborns, inadequate referral system, absence of multidisciplinary approach in neonatal case management and need to institute strong monitoring system to prevent neonatal deaths and stillbirths. The only potential enabling factor was the improved federal and provincial oversight for reproductive, maternal, and newborn care. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study was insightful in identifying the challenges that influence the quality of inpatient care for small and sick newborns and the resources needed to fix these. There is a need to equip Sick Newborn Care Units with needed supplies, equipment and medicines, deployment of specialist staff, strengthening of in-service training and staff supervision, liaison with the neonatal experts in customizing neonatal care guidelines for inpatient care settings and to inculcate the culture for inter-disciplinary team meetings at inpatient care settings across the country.","Pradhan, Nousheen Akber; Ali, Ammarah; Roujani, Sana; Ali, Sumera Aziz; Rizwan, Samia; Saleem, Sarah; Siddiqi, Sameen",BMC Pediatr,342,22

The modern medicine and public health have been challenged by a series of emerging and reemerging infections in the past three decades. These diseases have occurred following a false sense of victory over infectious diseases on a global scale due to effective vaccinations and antibiotic agents against certain microorganisms. Because of the unique circumstances of the modern world, these new infectious diseases are emerging at much faster rates than before, and old ones are returning with formidable strength. These infections have posed severe threats to global public health and have raised serious questions regarding the capability of modern medicine to face their challenges. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dynamics and impact of these emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Diagnostic pathology continues to be an essential counterpart of clinical microbiology in dealing with emerging and reemerging infections. Diagnosis with advanced pathology techniques not only helps identify or confirm the novel pathogens causing emerging infections but is also essential for epidemiologic surveillance and studying pathogenesis of these emerging infections.","Shieh, Wun-Ju",Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology,342,12

The potential applications of monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization against a variety of veterinary pathogens are passive immunization against Moraxella bovis (pinkeye), Bacteroides nodosus (foot rot), EPEC enterotoxin (enteric colibacillosis), Pasteurella haemolytica (pneumonic pasteurellosis), and Streptococcus equi (strangles). Three main areas of application for monoclonal antibodies against bacterial antigens in veterinary medicine are passive immunization, improved immunodiagnostics, and immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, because of their specificity, unlimited availability, and high titer, represent excellent passive immunizing agents.

Canadians have valid concerns about delays related to their changing needs as millions move their purchases from food services to retail groceries, but they should not worry about our overall supply of calories. Despite some shortages, the supply chains for flour and cooking oil are not likely to be blocked for an extended period. Learning from the coordinated needs of the BSE crisis in the beef sector, the federal government developed Value Chain Roundtables in 2003, including one for grains. These roundtables bring together government and industry to tackle the issues that face each sector's major needs, including food safety, transportation infrastructure, and market access. A working group made up of various roundtable members was set up specifically to deal with COVID‐19‐related supply chain challenges. This gives both industry and government a venue to attack any choke point or breakdown within our agri‐food supply chains – the exact response we need at this time. A pre‐established forum for discussion of critical issues at these roundtables, assuming the right players are active and present, cannot hurt, but it would useful for future planners and researchers if the federal government could clarify any positive impact they have.

This raises the difference between philosophy of biology and biophilosophy as raised by the theorist Eugene Thacker.

Plain radiography is very helpful for COVID-19 disease assessment and follow-up. It gives an accurate insight into the disease course. We aimed to determine the COVID-19 disease course and severity using chest X-ray (CXR) scoring system and correlate these with patients’ age, sex, and outcome. RESULTS: In our study, there were 350 patients proven with positive COVID-19 disease; 220 patients (62.9%) had abnormal baseline CXR and 130 patients (37.1%) had normal baseline CXR. During follow-up chest X-ray studies, 48 patients (13.7%) of the normal baseline CXR showed CXR abnormalities. In abnormal chest X-ray, consolidation opacities were the most common finding seen in 218 patients (81.3%), followed by reticular interstitial thickening seen in 107 patients (39.9%) and GGO seen in 87 patients (32.5%). Pulmonary nodules were found 25 patients (9.3%) and pleural effusion was seen in 20 patients (7.5%). Most of the patients showed bilateral lung affection (181 patients, 67.5%) with peripheral distribution (156 patients, 58.2%) and lower zone affection (196 patients, 73.1%). The total severity score was estimated in the baseline and follow-up CXR and it was ranged from 0 to 8. The outcome of COVID-19 disease was significantly related to the age, sex, and TSS of the patients. Male patients showed significantly higher mortality rate as compared to the female patients (P value 0.025). Also, the mortality rate was higher in patients older than 40 years especially with higher TSS. CONCLUSION: Radiographic findings are very good predictors for assessing the course of COVID-19 disease and it could be used as long-term consequences monitoring.","Yasin, Rabab; Gouda, Walaa",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,342,27

44596,44596,44596,From the Editor's Desk,19.570787,7.035331,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 15% of persons with HIV (PWH) have opioid use disorder (OUD) over their lifetime. Due to substance use-related behaviors, untreated OUD is an obstacle to ending the HIV epidemic, especially in rural states with limited treatment options. In November, 2019, The UAB 1917 HIV Clinic opened an outpatient based opioid treatment (OBOT) clinic one half day a week. The objective of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes and utilization over 8 months. We hypothesized that approximately 200 PWD would have OUD, many with comorbid stimulant use, and that new referrals would increase over time. METHODS: This is a retrospective study PWH at the 1917 clinic from OBOT start until June 2020. Opioid misuse was identified by patient reported illicit use using validated tools and/or ICD9 code in the last 12 months. We stratified PWH to determine the OUD continuum of care for all versus those with comorbid stimulant disorder: OBOT referral, attendance, buprenorphine initiation, and HIV suppression (viral load < 20). We explored changes in clinic utilization following COVID19. RESULTS: A total of 3,580 patients receive care in the UAB 1917 HIV clinic of whom 40 were identified as having opioid misuse (Fig 1, blue). Overall, 30 patients were referred to OBOT, 25 attended any OBOT visit, 19 were initiated on buprenorphine and 14 (74%) had a VL < 20 in the last 3 months. Over half of patients had comorbid stimulant use disorder (orange). Patients received an average of 3.7 visits (range 1–10) over the study period. Although the number of new referrals did not increase (average 3.8 per month), the overall number of OBOT appointments increased from an average of 12 per month before COVID to 26 per month after March 1. Figure 1. The Opioid Continuum of Care for PWH at the UAB Outpatient Opioid Treatment Clinic (blue) including those with comorbid Stimulant Use Disorder (orange) [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: A surprisingly low percentage of patients report opioid misuse, which likely underestimates the true OUD burden in the Deep South. Stimulant Use Disorder affects over half: an added barrier to HIV suppression. In this small and early assessment, there are multiple missed opportunities for progress along the OUD continuum starting with diagnosis and referral. Yet, even this small clinic has rapidly reached clinical capacity (1/2 day weekly) accelerated by psychosocial needs in the context of COVID19.

The key argument made in this paper is that the impact of these trends can be traced through exogenous changes that work through the internalization, location, and governance decisions of multinational enterprises (MNEs). MNEs also initiate some of these megatrends directly through the creation of new technologies and products and through their direct influence on civil society and policy at all levels of formulation and implementation.

In this study, we assessed the understanding of osteoporosis treatment and its risk in dental professionals pre and post an education lecture. Method: Dental professionals were invited to an educational lecture on osteoporosis treatment and benefits. 2 lectures were conducted over the course of a year, with the 2(nd) lecture conducted virtually due to physical meeting restrictions in place for the COVID 19 pandemic. Attendees were invited to submit responses to a pre- and post- lecture survey assessing their knowledge of the current osteoporosis treatments and MRONJ. Results: There were 126 responses to the survey conducted. Majority (87%) of responders were dentists in private, including group dental practices, with 74% having more than 11 years of working experience. Most (81 %) have not had any encounters with patients with MRONJ. The pre-lecture survey showed that 60% of responders expressed slight or no confidence at all in treating patients who are on osteoporosis treatment. Only 19% of all responders were able to correctly identify the risk of MRONJ in patients on osteoporosis treatment. Majority of responders tended to inflate MRONJ risk by as much as 100 times the quoted baseline risk in the literature. One third of dentists would not perform any invasive treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. Post-lecture, the percentage of responders with slight and no confidence at all in treating patients who are on osteoporosis treatment decreased to 18%. 65% of responders were able to correctly identify the risk of MRONJ in patients on osteoporosis treatment as quoted in the literature. Only 3% of dentists would not perform any invasive treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. 95% of responders correctly stated that maintenance of good oral hygiene is the most important measure to prevent MRONJ. Attendees suggested the creation of a joint guidance from local osteoporosis and dental societies may better improve knowledge and instill confidence in treating osteoporosis patients. Conclusion: There is a significant knowledge gap within the dental practitioners in Singapore on the risk of MRONJ associated with osteoporosis treatments. This may result in dentists discouraging patients from starting osteoporosis medications and dentists not performing necessary dental treatments on patients on osteoporosis treatment. Both physical and virtual dental education lectures are effective in increasing the level of confidence and in correcting misconceptions on MRONJ risk. Continued engagement of the dental community would be important in reducing fear of MRONJ and facilitate treatment of osteoporosis in the population.","Gani, Linsey; Chionh, Siok Bee",J Endocr Soc,342,1

It was approved for use in 2017 by NICE for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Considering the current risk of COVID-19, the BSR have advocated the use of short-acting drugs such as baricitinib when escalating treatment in RA. As real-world data is limited, we aimed to explore the efficacy of baricitinib in clinical practice. Methods Observational data was collected retrospectively for patients at the Dudley Group NHSFT with RA (ACR/EULAR criteria) who had received at least one dose of baricitinib prior to 1st October 2019, with a follow up period to 1st October 2020. Patients were identified from a local biologics database. Further data was identified from patients’ medical records including, demographics, features of RA, previous RA therapy history and disease activity scores (DAS28) at 0, 6 and 12 months. Data was input into an Excel spreadsheet with subsequent analysis conducted using SPSS Version26. Results We identified 26 RA patients (77% female) treated with baricitinib; mean age 61.6 (SD 14.6) years and median disease duration of 12.1 (IQR 5.8-18.4) years. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody were positive in 73% and 65% respectively. 35% (n = 9) of patients were biologically naïve, in whom baricitinib was chosen due to needle-phobia (n = 7), or where anti-TNF drugs were considered inappropriate (bronchiectasis, ANA positivity). Mean DAS28 (SD) scores at baseline, 6 and 12 months were 5.9(0.8), 2.8(0.9) and 2.7(1.3) respectively, with significant reduction from baseline to both 6 and 12 months (P < 0.001). A drop of ≥ 1.2 in DAS28 was recorded in 94% of patients with complete data at 6 months (n = 18, 4 missing, 4 discontinued). At 6 and 12 months, 85% and 81% of patients remained on Baricitinib. In total five patients discontinued Baricitinib due to side effects or tolerability issues. Reasons for discontinuation did not include thromboembolic events, zoster or serious infections. When comparing naïve and non-naïve groups, there was no significant difference in age, sex or disease duration. The number of previous biologics used by patients were 1(n = 6), 2(n = 3), ≥3(n = 8). Biologically naive compared to non-naïve patients had a higher DAS28 at baseline, (Mean [SD]) (6.2[0.9] versus 5.7[0.8] NS) but lower at 6 months (2.1[1.6] versus 3.1[1.1] P = 0.023) and greater DAS improvement at 6months (-4.4[1.2] versus -2.5[0.9] P < 0.002). Conclusion We observed that up to 94% of patients responded to baricitinib with a mean DAS improvement at 6 months of -3.1, biologic naïve patients doing best. Drug survival at 12 months was 81%. These trends are comparable to findings in clinical trials. However, due to our small sample size, the findings are vulnerable to type 1 and 2 errors and should be interpreted with caution.

SARS‐CoV‐2 replication requires the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, composed of non‐structural proteins (nsp) 7, 8, and 12. Nsp 7 and 8 function as a primase, whereas nsp12 functions as RdRp for replication and transcription. This polymerase is the target of the antiviral drug remdesivir, an adenosine monophosphate analog. During RNA replication catalyzed by RdRp, remdesivir is covalently attached to the growing RNA strand, resulting in chain termination. Here, we designed a 3‐dimensional (3D) model of the SARS‐COV‐2 nsp12‐nsp7‐nsp8 RdRp complex bound to template‐primer double‐stranded (ds)RNA and remdesivir using Jmol and PDB 7BV2 cryo‐EM structure (Yin et al., 2020). The 3D model shows the nsp12 subunit bound to dsRNA template and growing RNA strand that forms a corkscrew‐like structure within the center channel. The model highlights specific residues aspartic acid 760, valine557, and serine861 within the active site and the interactions of the template‐primer RNA strands with remdesivir. An additional 3D model illustrates the structural similarity of remdesivir to adenosine monophosphate.

The use of a remote platform such as Zoom allowed the participant and the committee to interact in real time while limiting in-person contact. The primary aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a remote version of the TSST in producing an increase in subjective stress response, cannabis craving, and cardiovascular stress in individuals who use cannabis. Participants completed subjective effects questionnaires and had blood pressure (BP) assessed before (baseline) and at various time points after the TSST. Heart rate (HR) was continuously measured throughout the session. This remote version of the TSST significantly and robustly increased State Anxiety and Perceived Stress scores, BP, and HR compared to baseline. There was no effect of the remote TSST on cannabis craving. Overall, the remote version of the TSST appears to be an effective laboratory stressor for future stress reactivity studies.

Only a minority of patients can clear the virus spontaneously. Elimination of HCV during acute infection correlates with a rapid induction of innate, especially interferon (IFN)-induced genes, and a delayed induction of adaptive immune responses. There is a strong association between genetic variants in the IFNλ (IL28B) locus with the rate of spontaneous clearance. Individuals with the ancestral IFNλ4 allele capable of producing a fully active IFNλ4 are paradoxically not able to clear HCV in the acute phase and develop chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with more than 90% probability. In the chronic phase of HCV infection, the wild-type IFNλ4 genotype is strongly associated with an induction of hundreds of classical type I/type III IFN stimulated genes in hepatocytes. However, the activation of the endogenous IFN system in the liver is ineffective in clearing HCV, and is even associated with impaired therapeutic responses to pegylated (Peg)IFNα containing treatments. While the role of genetic variation in the IFNλ locus to the outcome of CHC treatment has declined, it is clear that variation not only at this locus, but also at other loci, modulate clinically important liver phenotypes, including inflammation, fibrosis progression and the development of hepatocellular cancer. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the role of genetics in the host response to viral hepatitis and the potential future evolution of knowledge in understanding host-viral interactions.","Heim, Markus H; Bochud, Pierre-Yves; George, Jacob",Journal of hepatology,342,5

Recently, we introduced single-site retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy (RDN) as a less invasive donor surgery. The procedure was performed in 7 donors (5 women and 2 men) by a single surgeon. The mean age and body mass index of the donors were 62.6 years (range, 53-74 years) and 24.3 kg/m(2) (range, 22.3-29.0 kg/m(2)), respectively. Left-sided nephrectomy was performed in all the donors. The donors were positioned in the right lateral position, and a 7-cm-long incision was made in the left flank. The incision was extended to the retroperitoneal space using the muscle-splitting technique. The retroperitoneal space was then expanded using an inflation balloon. A GelPOINT Advanced Access Platform (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif, United States) was placed in the incision. The subsequent technique and equipment were the same as those used in conventional 3-port RDN. The renal artery and vein were dissected using a vascular stapler, and the kidney graft was directly extracted through the incision. The mean operative time was 197 ± 28 minutes, warm ischemic time was 4.1 ± 1.2 minutes, and blood loss was 75 ± 113 mL. No statistical differences were found between the present method and conventional 3-port RDN. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were not observed in any of the donors. Graft function after transplantation was good, and delayed graft function was not observed in any of the recipients. This technique can be easily introduced in the clinical setting by surgeons experienced in RDN.","Maruyama, M; Akutsu, N; Ohtsuki, K; Aoyama, H; Matsumoto, I; Hasegawa, M; Saigo, K; Asano, T",Transplantation proceedings,342,26

The purpose of this article is to answer the question of whether the change in the composition of liposomes affected the parameters of generated aerosol and whether the nebulization process affected observed properties of liposomes. Firstly, liposomes with different composition were prepared and their properties were checked by dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering. The membrane properties were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy - especially generalized polarization (Laurdan) and anisotropy (Diphenylhexatriene). The same characteristic of liposomes was measured after the nebulization by vibrating mesh nebulizer. Cholesterol was capable of liposome stabilization because of increased membrane fluidity. The membrane properties of the outer and inner parts were not influenced by the nebulization process. Electrostatic stabilization was successful for the lowest concentration of phosphatidic acid, but after the nebulization process the hydration of the membrane outer part was changed. Higher amount of PEG needs to be added for successful steric stabilization. The nebulization process of the two lowest concentrations of PEG slightly influenced immobilized water and the rigidity of inner part of the membrane (especially around the phase transition temperature).","Szabová, Jana; Mišík, Ondrej; Havlíková, Martina; Lízal, František; Mravec, Filip","Colloids and surfaces.

Long-term studies of individually marked animals are not an exception. These studies are especially important as instrumental for understanding evolutionary and ecological processes in the wild. Further, their number and global distribution provides a unique opportunity to assess the generality of patterns and to address broad-scale global issues (e.g. climate change). To solve data integration issues and enable a new scale of ecological and evolutionary research based on long-term studies of birds, we have created the SPI-Birds Network and Database (www.spibirds.org) - a large-scale initiative that connects data from, and researchers working on, studies of wild populations of individually recognizable (usually ringed) birds. Within year and a half since the establishment, SPI-Birds has recruited over 120 members, and currently hosts data on almost 1,5 million individual birds collected in 80 populations over 2000 cumulative years, and counting. SPI-Birds acts as a data hub and a catalogue of studied populations. It prevents data loss, secures easy data finding, use and integration, and thus facilitates collaboration and synthesis. We provide community-derived data and meta-data standards and improve data integrity guided by the principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), and aligned with the existing metadata languages (e.g. ecological meta-data language). The encouraging community involvement stems from SPI-Bird's decentralized approach: research groups retain full control over data use and their way of data management, while SPI-Birds creates tailored pipelines to convert each unique data format into a standard format. We outline the lessons learned, so that other communities (e.g. those working on other taxa) can adapt our successful model. Creating community-specific hubs (such as ours, COMADRE for animal demography, etc.) will aid much-needed large-scale ecological data integration.","Culina, Antica; Adriaensen, Frank; Bailey, Liam D; Burgess, Malcolm D; Charmantier, Anne; Cole, Ella F; Eeva, Tapio; Matthysen, Erik; Nater, Chloé R; Sheldon, Ben C; Saether, Bernt-Erik; Vriend, Stefan J G; Zajkova, Zuzana; Adamík, Peter; Aplin, Lucy M; Angulo, Elena; Artemyev, Alexandr; Barba, Emilio; Barišić, Sanja; Belda, Eduardo; Can Bilgin, C; Bleu, Josefa; Both, Christiaan; Bouwhuis, Sandra; Branston, Claire; Broggi, Juli; Burke, Terry; Bushuev, Andrey; Camacho, Carlos; Campobello, Daniela; Canal, David; Cantarero, Alejandro; Caro, Samuel P; Cauchoix, Maxime; Chaine, Alexis; Cichoń, Mariusz; Ćiković, Davor; Cusimano, Camillo A; Deimel, Caroline; Dhondt, André A; Dingemanse, Niels J; Doligez, Blandine; Dominoni, Davide M; Doutrelant, Claire; Drobniak, Szymon M; Dubiec, Anna; Eens, Marcel; Erikstad, Kjell Einar; Espín, Silvia; Farine, Damien R; Figuerola, Jordi; Kavak Gülbeyaz, Pınar; Grégoire, Arnaud; Hartley, Ian R; Hau, Michaela; Hegyi, Gergely; Hille, Sabine; Hinde, Camilla A; Holtmann, Benedikt; Ilyina, Tatyana; Isaksson, Caroline; Iserbyt, Arne; Ivankina, Elena; Kania, Wojciech; Kempenaers, Bart; Kerimov, Anvar; Komdeur, Jan; Korsten, Peter; Král, Miroslav; Krist, Miloš; Lambrechts, Marcel; Lara, Carlos E; Leivits, Agu; Liker, András; Lodjak, Jaanis; Mägi, Marko; Mainwaring, Mark C; Mänd, Raivo; Massa, Bruno; Massemin, Sylvie; Martínez-Padilla, Jesús; Mazgajski, Tomasz D; Mennerat, Adele; Moreno, Juan; Mouchet, Alexia; Nakagawa, Shinichi; Nilsson, Jan-Åke; Nilsson, Johan; Norte, Ana Cláudia; Oers, Kees van; Orell, Markku; Potti, Jaime; Quinn, John L; Réale, Denis; Reiertsen, Tone Kristin; Rosivall, Balázs; Russel, Andrew F; Rytkönen, Seppo; Sánchez-Virosta, Pablo; Santos, Eduardo S A; Schroeder, Julia; Senar, Juan Carlos; Seress, Gábor; Slagsvold, Tore; Szulkin, Marta; Teplitsky, Céline; Tilgar, Vallo; Tolstoguzov, Andrey; Török, János; Valcu, Mihai; Vatka, Emma; Verhulst, Simon; Watson, Hannah; Yuta, Teru; Zamora-Marín, José M; Visser, Marcel E",The Journal of animal ecology,342,4

Although kimchi, a major fermented food, is an important part of the traditional diet in Korea, only a few studies have investigated the relationship between AD and kimchi. This study aimed to examine the association between the risk of AD and kimchi intake among Korean adults aged 19 to 49 years. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study among a total of 7,222 adults who participated in the 2010-2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We defined AD based on responses to a health interview and assessed kimchi intake using a 24-hour recall method administered by well-trained interviewers. RESULTS In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, we observed a significantly decreased odds ratio (OR) of having AD according to kimchi consumption after adjustment for confounding factors. In particular, subjects in the third quartile of kimchi consumption (85.0-158 g) had a 32% lower presence of AD than those in the first quartile of kimchi consumption (0-36.0 g) (Odds ratio: 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.92). CONCLUSIONS We found that consuming 85.0-158 g/day of kimchi was significantly associated with a lower presence of AD. Considering that one serving size of kimchi is 40 g, this corresponds to about 2-4 servings per day. This finding suggests that adequate amount of kimchi intake might have a protective effect against AD.","Kim, Hye Jung; Ju, Se-Young; Park, Yoo Kyoung",Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,342,16

In vitro, however, additional modes of initiation have been observed. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the intracellular environment allows for internal initiation of RNA replication by the HCV replicase. We used a dual luciferase replicon harboring a terminal and an internal copy of the viral genomic 5' UTR, which was anticipated to support non-canonical initiation. Indeed, a shorter RNA species was detected by northern blotting with low frequency, depending on the length and sequence composition upstream of the internal initiation site. By introducing mutations at either site, we furthermore established that internal and terminal initiation shared identical sequence requirements. Importantly, lethal point mutations at the terminal site resulted exclusively in truncated replicons. In contrast, the same mutations at the internal site abrogated internal initiation, suggesting a competitive selection of initiation sites, rather than recombination or template-switching events. In conclusion, our data indicate that the HCV replicase is capable of internal initiation in its natural environment, although functional replication likely requires only terminal initiation. Since many other positive strand RNA viruses generate subgenomic messenger RNAs during their replication cycle, we surmise that the capability for internal initiation it is a common and conserved feature of viral RdRps.ImportanceMany aspects of viral RNA replication of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) are still poorly understood. The process of RNA synthesis is driven by the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase NS5B. Most mechanistic studies on NS5B so far were performed with in vitro systems using isolated recombinant polymerase. In this study we present a replicon model, which allows the intracellular assessment of non-canonical modes of initiation by the full HCV replicase. Our results add to the understanding of the biochemical processes underlying initiation of RNA synthesis by NS5B by the discovery of internal initiation in cellulo Moreover, they validate observations made in vitro, showing that the viral polymerase acts very similarly in isolation and in complex with other viral and host proteins. Finally, these observations provide clues about the evolution of RdRps of positive strand RNA viruses, which might contain the intrinsic ability to initiate internally.","Schult, Philipp; Nattermann, Maren; Lauber, Chris; Seitz, Stefan; Lohmann, Volker",Journal of virology,342,12

INTRODUCTION Loneliness and social isolation have adverse effects on the health and well-being of older adults. Many long-term care homes provide recreational programming intended to entertain or distract residents, yet the evidence of their effectiveness is limited. Absent from the literature are comprehensive reviews of assistive technologies (other than robots) that are used to support social interaction in long-term care homes. INCLUSION CRITERIA The review considered research studies as well as gray literature that included older adults (≥65 years) living in long-term care homes. The concept of interest was the use of assistive technologies (excluding robots) that support social interaction in long-term care homes. METHODS The databases were searched on June 26, 2019 and included CINAHL Full Text (EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Embase (Elsevier), and Web of Science (Clarivate). The search for gray literature was conducted in ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Databases and across 11 websites during September and October 2019. The recommended JBI approach to study selection, data extraction, and data synthesis was used. RESULTS Twenty-five articles were included in this review, with comparable numbers of quantitative (n = 6), qualitative (n = 9), and mixed methods (n = 7) studies, with the remaining articles employing non-empirical designs (n = 3). Technologies were categorized as low (easily recognizable to everyone), medium (more electronics), or high (involves internet). Two studies reported on low-assistive technologies, including videotapes, and the telephone. Medium-assistive technologies were identified in nine studies and included videophones; Nintendo Wii; tablet-based games; picture- and video-viewing tools; and CRDL (pronounced ""cradle""), a special instrument that translates touch into sound. More than half (n = 14) of the included articles utilized high-assistive technologies, such as computer labs/kiosks, tablet-based applications, social media (eg, Facebook), videoconferencing, and multi-functional systems. Five studies measured whether assistive technologies had an impact on the quantity of long-term care residents' social interaction levels. On the other hand, qualitative themes were related to residents' social connections and experiences after using various technologies. Four studies systematically incorporated a framework/model, and Social Structuration Theory was considered the most comprehensive. In the absence of a definition of socially assistive technologies, the definition advanced from this review is: Socially assistive technologies are user-appropriate devices and tools that enable real-time connectivity to enhance social interaction. CONCLUSIONS Included literature reported benefits of technology use, with considerable variability in engagement and no cost estimates. We recommend that future research continue to advance our definition of socially assistive technologies, make promising assistive technologies available in long-term care homes after studies are completed, report the costs of assistive technologies, and include participants with dementia and culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.","Macdonald, Marilyn; Yu, Ziwa; Weeks, Lori E; Moody, Elaine; Wilson, Beth; Almukhaini, Salma; Martin-Misener, Ruth; Sim, Meaghan; Jefferies, Keisha; Iduye, Damilola; Neeb, David; McKibbon, Shelley",JBI evidence synthesis,342,1

Here, an African green monkey (AGM) model was used to elucidate immune mechanisms that facilitate viral clearance but may also contribute to persistent lung inflammation following SARS-CoV infection. During primary infection, SARS-CoV replicated in the AGM lung for up to 10 days. Interestingly, lung inflammation was more prevalent following viral clearance, as leukocyte numbers peaked at 14 days postinfection (dpi) and remained elevated at 28 dpi compared to those of mock-infected controls. Lung macrophages but not dendritic cells were rapidly activated, and both cell types had high activation marker expression at late infection time points. Lung proinflammatory cytokines were induced at 1 to 14 dpi, but most returned to baseline by 28 dpi except interleukin 12 (IL-12) and gamma interferon. In SARS-CoV homologous rechallenge studies, 11 of the 12 animals were free of replicating virus at day 5 after rechallenge. However, incidence and severity of lung inflammation was not reduced despite the limited viral replication upon rechallenge. Evaluating the role of antibodies in immune protection or potentiation revealed a progressive increase in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in lung and serum that did not correlate temporally or spatially with enhanced viral replication. This study represents one of the first comprehensive analyses of lung immunity, including changes in leukocyte populations, lung-specific cytokines, and antibody responses following SARS-CoV rechallenge in AGMs.","Clay, Candice; Donart, Nathan; Fomukong, Ndingsa; Knight, Jennifer B; Lei, Wanli; Price, Lance; Hahn, Fletcher; Van Westrienen, Jesse; Harrod, Kevin S",Journal of virology,342,31

Many strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have distinct, S-dependent organ and tissue tropisms despite using a common receptor, suggesting that they employ different cellular proteases for fusion. In support of this hypothesis, we found that inhibition of endosomal acidification only modestly decreased entry, and overexpression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 greatly enhanced entry, of the highly neurovirulent MHV strain JHM.SD relative to their effects on the reference strain, A59. However, TMPRSS2 overexpression decreased MHV structural protein expression, release of infectious particles, and syncytium formation, and endogenous serine protease activity did not contribute greatly to infection. We therefore investigated the importance of other classes of cellular proteases and found that inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- and a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)-family zinc metalloproteases markedly decreased both entry and cell-cell fusion. Suppression of virus by metalloprotease inhibition varied among tested cell lines and MHV S proteins, suggesting a role for metalloprotease use in strain-dependent tropism. We conclude that zinc metalloproteases must be considered potential contributors to coronavirus fusion.IMPORTANCE The family Coronaviridae includes viruses that cause two emerging diseases of humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as a number of important animal pathogens. Because coronaviruses depend on host protease-mediated cleavage of their S proteins for entry, a number of protease inhibitors have been proposed as antiviral agents. However, it is unclear which proteases mediate in vivo infection. For example, SARS-CoV infection of cultured cells depends on endosomal acid pH-dependent proteases rather than on the cell surface acid pH-independent serine protease TMPRSS2, but Zhou et al. (Antiviral Res 116:76-84, 2015, doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011) found that a serine protease inhibitor was more protective than a cathepsin inhibitor in SARS-CoV-infected mice. This paper explores the contributions of endosomal acidification and various proteases to coronavirus infection and identifies an unexpected class of proteases, the matrix metalloproteinase and ADAM families, as potential targets for anticoronavirus therapy.","Phillips, Judith M; Gallagher, Tom; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,342,27

OBJECTIVE To assess maternal-fetal medicine fellowship program directors' approaches to exclusive virtual interviews and to obtain program director feedback on the virtual interview experience to guide future interview cycles. STUDY DESIGN A novel cross-sectional online survey was distributed through the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine to program directors following the completion of the interview season, but prior to the results of the National Resident Matching Program on October 14, 2020. Survey data were collected anonymously and managed using secure REDCap electronic data capture tools. RESULTS Overall 71/89 (80%) program directors responded. All respondents completed their 2020 interviews 100% virtually. Nearly half (33/68 (49%)) of program directors interviewed more candidates in 2020 than in 2019. Of those who interviewed more candidates in 2020, the mean number (± standard deviation) of additional candidates per fellowship position was 5.8 (± 3.8). Almost all program directors reported no (35/71, 49%) or minimal (34/71, 48%) negative impact of technical difficulties on their virtual interview processes. The majority of programs structured their interview to a half-day (4 hours) or less for the candidates. Many programs were able to adapt their supplemental interview materials and events for the candidates into a virtual format, including a virtual social event hosted by 31/71 (44%) programs. The virtual social event was most commonly casual and led by current fellows. Ultimately, all program directors reported the virtual interview experience was as expected or better than expected. However, most program directors felt less able to provide candidates with a comprehensive and accurate representation of their program on a virtual platform compared to their prior in-person experiences; (46/71 (65%) reported minimally, moderately, or significantly less than in-person). Additionally, most program directors felt their ability to get to know candidates and assess their ""fit"" with the program was less than prior in-person years; (44/71 (62%) reported minimally, moderately, or significantly less than in-person). In a hypothetical future year without any public health concerns, there were 23/71 (32%) respondents who prefer exclusive in-person interviews, 24/71 (34%) who prefer exclusive virtual interviews, and 24/71 (34%) who prefer a hybrid of virtual and in-person interviews. CONCLUSIONS The virtual interview experience was better than expected for most program directors. However, most program directors felt less able to present their programs and assess the candidates on a virtual platform compared to prior in-person experiences. Despite this, most program directors are interested in at least a component of virtual interviewing in future years. Future efforts are needed to refine the virtual interview process to optimize the experience for program directors and candidates.","Rhoades, Janine S; Ramsey, Patrick S; Metz, Torri D; Lewkowitz, Adam K",American journal of obstetrics & gynecology MFM,342,1

Methods The literature related to the above topic was reviewed including papers that analysed the connections, actions, interactions, consequences and occasionally suggestions for rational interventions. Results/Conclusion Severe broncho-alveolar inflammation seems to be caused, at least in part, by upregulation of the KKS that increases plasma and/or local tissue concentrations of bradykinin (BK) in patients with COVID-19 infection. Besides KKS activation, suppression of ACE activity results in decreased bradykinin degradation, and these changes in concert can lead to excessive BK B1 and B2 receptor (BKB1R/BKB2R) activation. Aminopeptidase P (APP), and carboxypeptidase N also degrade bradykinin, but their protein expression and activity are unclear in COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, ACE2 expression is upregulated in patients with COVID-19 infection, so ACE2 activity is unlikely to be decreased despite blockade of part of ACE2 by the virus for entry into the cells. ACE2 cleaves lys-des-arginine9BK and arg-des-arginine9BK, the active metabolites of bradykinin, which stimulate the BKB1R receptor. Stimulation of BKB1R/BKB2R can exacerbate the pulmonary inflammatory response by causing vascular leakage and edema, vasodilation, smooth muscle spasm and stimulation of pain afferent nerves. Despite all uncertainties, it seems rational to treat comorbid COVID patients with serious respiratory distress syndrome with ARBs instead of high-dose ACE inhibitor (ACEi) that will further decrease bradykinin degradation and enhance BKB1R/BKB2R activation, but ACEi may not be contraindicated in patients with mild pulmonary symptoms.","Székács, B; Várbíró, S; Debreczeni, L",Physiology international,342,17

The primary aim was to examine the association between rSO2 values (both baseline rSO2 and intraoperative decrease in rSO2) with the composite of morbidity endpoints. We retrospectively analyzed 356 cardiac surgical patients having continuously recorded data of intraoperative rSO2 values. Per institutional guidelines, patients received interventions to restore the rSO2 value to ≥80% of the baseline value. Analyzed rSO2 variables included baseline value, and area under the threshold below an absolute value of 50% (AUT50). Their association with outcome was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. AUT50 (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval; 1.01-1.08; p = 0.015) was shown to be an independent risk factor (along with age, chronic kidney disease, and cardiopulmonary bypass time) of adverse outcomes. In cardiac surgical patients who received interventions to correct decreases in rSO2, increased severity of intraoperative decrease in rSO2 as reflected by AUT below an absolute value of 50% was associated with a composite of adverse outcomes, implicating the importance of cerebral oximetry to monitor the brain as an index organ.","Jo, Youn Yi; Shim, Jae-Kwang; Soh, Sarah; Suh, Sungmin; Kwak, Young Lan",Journal of clinical medicine,342,1

It is unknown if there is racial/ethnic variability in this quality measure in pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). We aim to determine whether racial/ethnic differences exist in wait times for children presenting to PEDs and examine between-site and within-site differences. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study for PED encounters in 2016 using the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry, an aggregated deidentified electronic health registry comprising 7 PEDs. Patient encounters were included among all patients 18 years or younger at the time of the ED visit. We evaluated differences in emergency department wait time (time from arrival to first medical evaluation) considering patient race/ethnicity as the exposure. RESULTS Of 448,563 visits, median wait time was 35 minutes (interquartile range, 17-71 minutes). Compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) children, non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and other race children waited 27%, 33%, and 12% longer, respectively. These differences were attenuated after adjusting for triage acuity level, mode of arrival, sex, age, insurance, time of day, and month [adjusted median wait time ratios (95% confidence intervals): 1.11 (1.10-1.12) for NHB, 1.12 (1.11-1.13) for Hispanic, and 1.05 (1.03-1.06) for other race children compared with NHW children]. Differences in wait time for NHB and other race children were no longer significant after adjusting for clinical site. Fully adjusted median wait times among Hispanic children were longer compared with NHW children [1.04 (1.03-1.05)]. CONCLUSIONS In unadjusted analyses, non-White children experienced longer PED wait times than NHW children. After adjusting for illness severity, patient demographics, and overcrowding measures, wait times for NHB and other race children were largely determined by site of care. Hispanic children experienced longer within-site and between-site wait times compared with NHW children. Additional research is needed to understand structures and processes of care contributing to wait time differences between sites that disproportionately impact non-White patients.","Johnson, Tiffani J; Goyal, Monika K; Lorch, Scott A; Chamberlain, James M; Bajaj, Lalit; Alessandrini, Evaline A; Simmons, Timothy; Casper, T Charles; Olsen, Cody S; Grundmeier, Robert W; Alpern, Elizabeth R",Pediatric emergency care,342,24

Many processes exist that limit or eliminate the incidence of adverse events in general surgery including the World Health Organization safety checklist. Technology and device advancement has a potentially expanding role in the context of surgical safety. Materials and Methods. A dual controlled accessory electrical diathermy footswitch (Permissive diathermy foot switch device or PDf) device concept was developed in an effort to improve patient safety in theatre and enhance opportunities in training. Electrical diathermy is only activated if the senior supervising surgeon and the novice surgeon simultaneously activate their interconnected footswitches. The activation of the PDf accessory footswitch device allows a senior surgeon to exert control on ""initiation"" of activation of diathermy devices operated by a novice surgeon (foot on pedal) as well as when desiring to deactivate the device (foot off pedal). Results. A process of designing and prototyping was initiated to define the purpose and the functionality of the PDf device up till the stage of a fully functioning prototype. The PDf device was constructed as a final working and tested prototype in association with the local medical engineering department at the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle. The device was on a nonbiological model to determine efficacy and safety and passed its laboratory testing phase and was deemed ready for clinical use. Conclusion. We demonstrated the feasibility and functionality of the PDf device and propose a positive role in surgical training in the context of early surgical training and specific circumstances where more control is needed.","Eisawi, Abdalla; Aung, Myat; Canelo, Ruben",Surgical innovation,342,31

In contrast, very few studies have focused on the link between Adverse Childhood Experiences and altruistic behavior. The objective of this study is to examine the possible influence of Adverse Childhood Experiences on the social behavior exhibited in emerging adulthood (specifically deviant and altruistic behavior). METHOD The study population consisted of 490 young adults between the ages of 18 and 20, with a mean of 18.90 years (SD = .77). All voluntarily completed the following self-report questionnaires: the Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire, the Deviant Behavior Scale, and the Altruistic Scale. RESULTS Linear regression models found that Adverse Childhood Experiences were strong, positive predictors of deviant behaviors. Moreover, specific Adverse Childhood Experiences (physical abuse for deviant behavior, and emotional neglect for altruistic behaviors) had notable, differential effects. CONCLUSIONS The prevention or early detection of Adverse Childhood Experiences during childhood could contribute to reducing maladaptive patterns of behavior and to increasing altruistic patterns during emerging adulthood.","Gomis-Pomares, Aitana; Villanueva, Lidón",Psicothema,342,7

We also describe techniques that help overcome difficulties involved in this procedure. DESIGN Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING University medical center. PATIENTS Two hundred thirty-four patients underwent LESS-TLH for benign uterine disease and cervical disease between September 2011 and February 2015. Thirty-seven patients (15.8%) were excluded from analysis. One hundred ninety-seven patients were divided into 2 groups according to the total operative time (median, 150 minutes): <150 minutes (n = 93) and ≥150 minutes (n = 104). INTERVENTIONS LESS-TLH was performed using anterior, lateral, and posterolateral colpotomy techniques, and knife-in-bag morcellation was used for specimen extraction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient characteristics, except for body mass index (BMI) and age, were generally similar in the 2 groups. Age, BMI, adhesiolysis, time to completion of colpotomy, stump repair time, specimen extraction time, blood loss, and weight of the uterus showed statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. Clinical factors that affected operative time were adhesiolysis of the posterior uterus (p = .010), time to completion of colpotomy (>65 minutes; p = .000), specimen extraction time (>34.4 minutes; p = .000), and weight of the uterus (>270 g; p = .015). Conversion to additional port laparoscopy occurred in 14 patients (5.98%). Conversion to laparotomy occurred in 1 patient (.43%). The surgical complication rates were 3.2% (3 patients) in the <150 minutes group and 3.8% (4 patients) in the ≥150 minutes group. No urologic injuries occurred in either group. One postoperative ileus occurred in the ≥150 minutes group; it was relieved by conservative treatment. CONCLUSION Time to completion of colpotomy was influenced by adhesiolysis of the posterior uterus and specimen extraction time by weight of the uterus. Alternative methods for decreasing the time required to extract a large uterus and for approaching posterior adhesion of the uterus are needed for LESS-TLH.","Jeung, In Cheul; Lee, Yong Seok; Song, Min Jong; Park, Eun Kyung",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,342,1

Eighteen A. baumannii strains, including two reference strains (ATCC 19606 and ATCC 17978), four clinical strains (AB56, AB242, AB273 and AB279) and 12 antibiotic-selected mutant strains, were used in this study. Imipenem-selected mutants were generated from imipenem-susceptible strains (ATCC 19606, ATCC 17978 and AB242) by multistep selection resistance. Amikacin-, ciprofloxacin-, colistin-, meropenem- and ceftazidime-selected mutants were also generated from the two reference strains and were used for comparison. Antibiotic susceptibilities in the absence and presence of the efflux pump inhibitors carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP) were examined in the three imipenem-selected mutants and the three clinical multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Expression profiles of the antimicrobial resistance genes in the imipenem-selected mutants and their parental strains were also determined. The results showed that imipenem was more likely, compared with the other antibiotics, to induce a MDR phenotype in the two reference strains. Differences in OXA-51-like carbapenemase, efflux pumps or/and AmpC β-lactamase expression were observed in the three imipenem-selected mutants. Moreover, a reduction in imipenem or amikacin resistance was observed when the imipenem-selected mutants and clinical isolates were exposed to NMP and CCCP. This study concluded that imipenem might be a potent inducer of multidrug resistance in A. baumannii strains. OXA-51-like carbapenemase combined with other resistance mechanisms may contribute to the development of multidrug resistance in A. baumannii. Monitoring the use of carbapenems is required to reduce the spread of MDR A. baumannii in hospitals.","Kuo, Han-Yueh; Chang, Kai-Chih; Kuo, Jai-Wei; Yueh, Hui-Wen; Liou, Ming-Li",International journal of antimicrobial agents,342,20

These factors lead to heterogeneous marker effects affecting the efficiency of genomic prediction, especially for admixed individuals. Such individuals have a genome that is a mosaic of chromosome blocks from different origins, and may be of interest to combine favorable group-specific characteristics. We developed two genomic prediction models adapted to the prediction of admixed individuals in presence of heterogeneous marker effects: Multi-group Admixed GBLUP Random Individual (MAGBLUP-RI) modeling the ancestry of alleles, and MAGBLUP Random Allele Effect (MAGBLUP-RAE) modeling group-specific distributions of allele effects. MAGBLUP-RI can estimate the segregation variance generated by admixture while MAGBLUP-RAE can disentangle the variability that is due to main allele effects from that due to group-specific deviation effects. Both models were evaluated for their genomic prediction accuracy using a maize panel including lines from the Dent and Flint groups, along with admixed individuals. Based on simulated traits, both models proved their efficiency to improve genomic prediction accuracy compared to standard GBLUP models. For real traits, a clear gain was observed at low marker densities whereas it became limited at high marker densities. The interest of including admixed individuals in multi-group training sets was confirmed using simulated traits, but was variable using real traits. Both MAGBLUP models and admixed individuals are of interest whenever there exist group-specific SNP allele effects.","Rio, Simon; Moreau, Laurence; Charcosset, Alain; Mary-Huard, Tristan",Genetics,342,1

This study investigated whether CL and subcutaneous F of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in humans can be separately estimated from subcutaneous injection data only. METHODS First, the geometric mean of linear pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, intercompartmental CL [Q], volume of distribution in the central compartment [Vc], and volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment [Vp]) after intravenous injection for mAbs in humans that have been reported in public data sources was estimated from 103 mAbs with linear pharmacokinetics and 44 mAbs with nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Next, we estimated the CL and F of 25 mAbs with linear pharmacokinetics from plasma/serum mAb concentration-time profiles after subcutaneous injection in humans by fixing the geometric mean of Q, Vc, and Vp based on the public data. Moreover, the plasma/serum concentration-time profile of 25 mAbs after intravenous injection was simulated using the estimated CL and the geometric mean of Q, Vc, and Vp. RESULTS There were no significant differences in parameters among subclasses (immunoglobulin [Ig] G1, 2, and 4) or in linearity (derivation from linear and nonlinear pharmacokinetics). Using only subcutaneous injection data, we successfully estimated the CL of 23/25 mAbs (92%) and F of all 25 mAbs (100%) within 1.5-fold of the observed value. Moreover, overall, the simulated concentration-time profiles were largely consistent with observed data (90.8% within 1.5-fold of the observed values). CONCLUSIONS This approach does not require intravenous injection data to separately estimate CL and F after subcutaneous injection in humans and can therefore accelerate the clinical development of mAbs.","Haraya, Kenta; Tachibana, Tatsuhiko",Clinical pharmacokinetics,342,31

The increasing contribution of CT to the population-collected dose has become a topic of interest. Radiation dose optimization for chest CT of COVID-19 patients is of importance in clinical practice. The present study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the detection of ground-glass nodules and exudative lesions in chest CT among COVID-19 patients and to find an appropriate combination of imaging parameters that optimize detection while effectively reducing the radiation dose. Methods The anthropomorphic thorax phantom, with 9 spherical nodules of different diameters and CT values of -800, -630, and 100 HU, was used to simulate the lesions of COVID-19 patients. Four custom-simulated lesions of porcine fat and ethanol were also scanned at 3 tube potentials (120, 100, and 80 kV) and corresponding milliampere-seconds (mAs) (ranging from 10 to 100). Separate scans were performed at pitches of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.15, and 1.49, and at collimations of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mm at 80 kV and 100 mAs. CT values and standard deviations of simulated nodules and lesions were measured, and radiation dose quantity (volume CT dose index; CTDIvol) was collected. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and figure of merit (FOM) were calculated. All images were subjectively evaluated by 2 radiologists to determine whether the nodules were detectable and if the overall image quality met diagnostic requirements. Results All simulated lesions, except -800 HU nodules, were detected at all scanning conditions. At a fixed voltage of 120 or 100 kV, with increasing mAs, image noise tended to decrease, and the CNR tended to increase (F=9.694 and P=0.033 for 120 kV; F=9.028 and P=0.034 for 100 kV). The FOM trend was the same as that of CNR (F=2.768 and P=0.174 for 120 kV; F=1.915 and P=0.255 for 100 kV). At 80 kV, the CNRs and FOMs had no significant change with increasing mAs (F=4.522 and P=0.114 for CNRs; F=1.212 and P=0.351 for FOMs). For the 4 nodules of -800 and -630 HU, CNRs had no statistical differences at each of the 5 pitches (F=0.673, P=0.476). The CNRs and FOMs at each of the 4 collimations had no statistical differences (F=2.509 and P=0.125 for CNRs; F=1.485 and P=0.309 for FOMs) for each nodule. CNRs and subjective evaluation scores increased with increasing parameter values for each imaging iteration. The CNRs of 4 -800 HU nodules in the qualified images at the thresholds of scanning parameters of 120 kV/20 mAs, 100 kV/40 mAs, and 80 kV/80 mAs, had statistical differences (P=0.038), but the FOMs had no statistical differences (P=0.085). Under the 3 threshold conditions, the CNRs and FOMs of the 4 nodules were highest at 100 kV and 40 mAs (1.6 mGy CTDIvol). Conclusions For chest CT among COVID-19 patients, it is recommended that 100 kV/40 mAs is used for average patients; the radiation dose can be reduced to 1.6 mGy with qualified images to detect ground-glass nodules and exudation lesions.","Niu, Yantao; Huang, Shunxing; Zhang, Huan; Li, Shuo; Li, Xiaoting; Lv, Zhibin; Yan, Shuo; Fan, Wei; Zhai, Yanlong; Wong, Eddy; Wang, Kexin; Zhang, Zongrui; Chen, Budong; Xie, Ruming; Xian, Junfang",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,342,16

We hypothesized that excessive O2 levels (hyperoxia) can directly injure human adult cardiac myocytes (HACMs). HACMs obtained from the explanted hearts of transplantation patients were exposed to constant hyperoxia (95% O2), intermittent hyperoxia (alternating 10 min exposures to 5% and 95% O2), constant normoxia (21% O2), or constant mild hypoxia (5% O2) using a bioreactor. Changes in cell morphology, viability as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and trypan blue (TB) staining, and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and various pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin, IL; chemokine C-X-C motif ligand, CXC; granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF; intercellular adhesion molecule, ICAM; chemokine C-C motif ligand, CCL) were compared among treatment groups at baseline (0 h) and after 8, 24, and 72 h of treatment. Changes in HACM protein expression were determined by quantitative proteomic analysis after 48 h of exposure. Compared with constant normoxia and mild hypoxia, constant hyperoxia resulted in a higher TB-positive cell count, greater release of LDH, and elevated secretion of VEGF, MIF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-1, CXCL-10, G-CSF, ICAM-1, CCL-3, and CCL-5. Cellular inflammation and cytotoxicity gradually increased and was highest after 72 h of constant and intermittent hyperoxia. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that hypoxic and hyperoxic O2 exposure differently altered the expression levels of proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation, energy metabolism, and cell signaling. In conclusion, constant and intermittent hyperoxia induced inflammation and cytotoxicity in HACMs. Cell injury occurred earliest and was greatest after constant hyperoxia, but even relatively brief repeating hyperoxic episodes induced a substantial inflammatory response.","Hafner, Christina; Wu, Jing; Tiboldi, Akos; Hess, Moritz; Mitulovic, Goran; Kaun, Christoph; Krychtiuk, Konstantin Alexander; Wojta, Johann; Ullrich, Roman; Tretter, Eva Verena; Markstaller, Klaus; Klein, Klaus Ulrich",Shock,342,28

Interoperability of these technologies and services, as well as digital inclusion for communities are important enablers of a modern, connected health system. The ongoing development of these factors is an aspiration of Australia's National Digital Health Strategy (NDHS). The Australian Digital Health Agency co-designed the NDHS with input from healthcare consumers and providers, digital health industry, academic and policy experts and organisations. Approved by all Australian governments in 2017, it provides a forward vision to 2022, with seven pillars that include: Access to health information through My Health record; Secure Messaging; Medicines Safety; Interoperability; Enhanced models of care; Workforce and Education and Driving Innovation. All of these pillars have interdependent features, and many play a role in enabling communities to live healthier and happier lives supported by better connected healthcare services as well as access to information in a timely and efficient manner at the point of care. A 'Communities of Excellence' programme has supported regional communities to connect health services to My Health Record, increase digital health tools use and provide digital health literacy support to consumers. The aims of this programme are to allow the benefits of improved interoperability and better connected care to flow to people and their clinicians, test innovation that could go on to be scaled nationally, and close the health inequity gap experienced by people in rural and remote communities.","Makeham, Meredith",Internal medicine journal,342,31

The folate receptor (FR) is known to be overexpressed extracellularly on a variety of human cancers and is therefore an outstanding gate for tumor-targeted Trojan horse-like delivery of therapeutics. In this study, an amphiphilic and biodegradable ternary copolymer conjugated with folate as ligand, polyethylenimine-graft-polycaprolactone-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol) was synthesized and evaluated for targeted siRNA delivery via folate-FR recognition. The amphiphilic character of similar polymers was shown previously to support endosomal release of endocytosed nanocarriers and to promote formation of long circulating micelles. The obtained PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol exhibited less cytotoxicity in comparison with the corresponding ternary copolymer without folate (PEI-PCL-PEG) and with unmodified PEI25kDa. Stable micelle-like polyplexes with hydrodynamic diameters about 100 nm were found to have a zeta potential of +8.6 mV, which was lower than that of micelleplexes without folate-conjugation (+13-16 mV). Nonetheless, increased cellular uptake and in vitro gene knockdown of PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol/siRNA micelleplexes were observed in SKOV-3 cells, an FR overexpressing cell line, in comparison with the nonfolate-conjugated ones. Moreover, PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol/siRNA micelleplexes exhibited excellent stability in vivo during the analysis of 120 min and a longer circulation half life than hyPEI25kDa/siRNA polyplexes. Most interestingly, the targeted delivery system yielded 17% deposition of the i.v. injected siRNA per gram in the tumor after 24 h due to the effective folate targeting and the prolonged circulation.","Liu, Li; Zheng, Mengyao; Librizzi, Damiano; Renette, Thomas; Merkel, Olivia M; Kissel, Thomas",Molecular pharmaceutics,342,16

Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and follicular regulatory T cells (Tfr) are critical for B cells maturation and antibodies production, but their roles in pAPS remain unknown. We enrolled Thirty-two pAPS patients and twenty-three healthy controls (HCs) and comprehensively analyzed circulating Tfh and Tfr, as well as their subsets, using flow cytometry. Clinical data including autoantibody levels were collected and their correlations with Tfh and Tfr subsets were analyzed. In addition, correlations between B cell functional subsets and Tfh, Tfr were also performed. Changes and potential effects of serum cytokines on Tfr and Tfh were further explored. We found the circulating Tfr was significantly decreased while Tfh and Tfh/Tfr ratios were increased in pAPS patients. Tfh2, ICOS+PD-1+Tfh and Ki-67+Tfh percentages were elevated while CD45RA-FoxP3hi, Helios+, TIGIT+ and Ki-67+ Tfr percentages were decreased in pAPS patients. New memory B cells and plasmablasts were increased and altered B cell subsets and serum autoantibodies were positively correlated with Tfh, Tfh2, ICOS+PD-1+Tfh cells, and negatively associated with Tfr, CD45RA-FoxP3hiTfr and Helios+ Tfr cells. In addition, pAPS with LA/aCL/β2GPI autoantibodies showed lower functional Tfr subsets and higher activated Tfh subsets. Serum IL-4, IL-21, IL-12 and TGF-β1 were up-regulated and associated with Tfh and Tfr subset changes. Our study demonstrated that imbalance of circulating Tfr and Tfh, as well as their functional subsets, is associated with abnormal autoantibody levels in pAPS, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of pAPS.","Long, Yan; Li, Wenyi; Feng, Jinghong; Ma, Yingting; Sun, Yuanyuan; Xu, Lijuan; Song, Ying; Liu, Chen",Clinical and experimental immunology,342,1

STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical study. METHODS Eighty-nine patients following endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis (AR) were studied. Olfactory function was evaluated using Sniffin' Sticks test pre-and 12 months after treatment. All patients completed six validated QoL questionnaires either specific for olfaction (Questionnaire of Olfactory Deficits-QOD) and for assessing mental health (Zung Anxiety Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Zung Depression Scale, Beck Depression Inventory), or generic one (Short Form-36). RESULTS Significant improvement (all P < 0.001) of olfactory function by 27.4% in total cohort (AR: 10.4%, P = 0.004; CRS: 39.9%, P < 0.001), expressed by the combined Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) score-and of all QoL questionnaires scores (all P < 0.01) as well, was observed after treatment. There was a positive correlation between olfactory recovery and improvement of patients' QoL. ROC analysis revealed that an increase in the TDI score by 3.50 points in AR and 4.75 points in CRS was necessary for a clinically significant improvement in all QoL questionnaires results. CONCLUSIONS QoL and mental health of patients suffering from chronic sinonasal diseases are totally recovered after treatment, presenting a direct positive relationship with smell improvement. An increase of olfactory function by 3.50 points for AR and 4.75 points for CRS might be considered the cutoff point for patients' QoL significant recovery.","Katotomichelakis, Michael; Simopoulos, Efthimios; Tripsianis, Gregory; Prokopakis, Emmanuel; Danielides, Gerasimos; Velegrakis, Stelios George; Livaditis, Miltos; Danielides, Vassilios",The Laryngoscope,342,15

ERα17p was subsequently found to elicit estrogenic responses in E2-deprived ERα-positive breast cancer cells, increasing proliferation and ERE-dependent gene transcription. Surprisingly, in E2-supplemented media, ERα17p-induced apoptosis and modified the actin network, influencing cell motility. Here, we report that ERα17p internalizes in breast cancer cells (T47D, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3) and induces a massive early (3 h) transcriptional activity. Remarkably, about 75% of significantly modified transcripts were also modified by E2, confirming the pro-estrogenic profile of ERα17p. The different ER spectra of the used cell lines allowed us to identify a specific ERα17p signature related to ERα as well as its variant ERα36. With respect to ERα, the peptide activates nuclear (cell cycle, cell proliferation, nucleic acid and protein synthesis) and extranuclear signaling pathways. In contrast, through ERα36, it mainly triggers inhibitory actions on inflammation. This is the first work reporting a detailed ERα36-specific transcriptional signature. In addition, we report that ERα17p-induced transcripts related to apoptosis and actin modifying effects of the peptide are independent from its estrogen receptor(s)-related actions. We discuss our findings in view of the potential use of ERα17p as a selective peptidomimetic estrogen receptor modulator (PERM).","Notas, George; Kampa, Marilena; Pelekanou, Vassiliki; Troullinaki, Maria; Jacquot, Yves; Leclercq, Guy; Castanas, Elias",Molecular oncology,342,1

The use of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx; Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) through this delivery route has been extremely limited, particularly in the peripheral interventional realm, owing to concerns about technique and conduit for delivery, skin discoloration, and ulceration. We describe three patients with relatively focal, symptomatic, congenital high-flow AVMs of the upper and lower extremity treated successfully by multifaceted approaches including transvenous coil embolization of the nidus venous outflow, transarterial embolization, and DSE of the AVM nidus with Onyx. Successful delivery of Onyx into the AVM nidus was achieved without nontarget embolization. Sustained symptomatic relief without recurrence or associated complications was achieved at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months of follow-up. Nidus embolization is a key technical maneuver for optimal treatment of high-flow AVMs, although it is not always easily achievable by the transarterial route in more extensive, convoluted angioarchitectural varieties. With appropriate technical considerations and precautionary measures, Onyx can be safely and effectively delivered through DSE into the AVM nidus with satisfactory short-term and midterm clinical outcomes. This maneuver expands the armamentarium of the treating vascular surgeon facing complicated peripheral AVMs.","Nassiri, Naiem; Cirillo-Penn, Nolan C; Crystal, Dustin Tyler",Journal of vascular surgery,342,1

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal perinatal mental health in Spain. METHODS Seven hundred and twenty-four women (N=450 pregnancy, N=274 postpartum) were recruited online during the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were administered. Variables related to sociodemographic information, the COVID-19 pandemic, and perinatal care were also assessed. FINDINGS The results showed that 58% of women reported depressive symptoms. Moreover, 51% of women reported anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, a regression analysis for life satisfaction showed that besides the perception about their own health, marital status or being a health practitioner were also significant predictors during pregnancy. However, perception about baby's health and sleep, perception about their own health, and marital status were significant predictors of life satisfaction during the postpartum stage. DISCUSSION Women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high rates of psychological distress. CONCLUSION These results highlight the need of clinical support during this period.

Due to the surrounding anatomy, surgical repair is often difficult. There is currently no consensus on the timing of operative repair of TLH. The aim of this study is to present a case series on the management of TLH performed at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) utilizing both open and laparoscopic techniques with both early and delayed repairs being undertaken. METHODS Cases were identified retrospectively from the Trauma Database at the RBWH, a tertiary-level hospital in Brisbane, Australia. RESULTS Four cases of TLH were identified from 2009 to 2014. The diagnosis was confirmed pre-operatively on CT imaging. Early repair was undertaken when the patient was stable from other associated injuries. Herniation was managed in three cases by open repair (2x open lumbar approaches, 1 via midline laparotomy) with sublay extraperitoneal mesh placement. The remaining case was managed by laparoscopic extra-peritoneal mesh repair. At a minimal 4 months follow-up, no evidence of recurrence or complications was detected in three cases. One patient was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS TLH are a rare clinical entity. Operative management can be achieved via open or laparoscopic techniques, with placement of mesh in the extraperitoneal plane. Both early, when the patients clinical status allows, and delayed repair appear to have good short-term results.

Objective To compare the effect of N95 respirators vs medical masks for prevention of influenza and other viral respiratory infections among HCP. Design, Setting, and Participants A cluster randomized pragmatic effectiveness study conducted at 137 outpatient study sites at 7 US medical centers between September 2011 and May 2015, with final follow-up in June 2016. Each year for 4 years, during the 12-week period of peak viral respiratory illness, pairs of outpatient sites (clusters) within each center were matched and randomly assigned to the N95 respirator or medical mask groups. Interventions Overall, 1993 participants in 189 clusters were randomly assigned to wear N95 respirators (2512 HCP-seasons of observation) and 2058 in 191 clusters were randomly assigned to wear medical masks (2668 HCP-seasons) when near patients with respiratory illness. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Secondary outcomes included incidence of acute respiratory illness, laboratory-detected respiratory infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory illness, and influenzalike illness.

A next-generation nasal cannula (Neotech RAM cannula) has recently been used to provide nasal NIV. The impact of the Neotech RAM cannula on the delivery of pressure needs to be studied. METHODS In this ex vivo experimental design, a lung simulator (IngMar ASL 5000, version 3.4) was programmed to model a neonate (∼1-3 kg of body weight) with normal-to-moderately affected lungs. We used a Covidien PB840 ventilator with NIV software activated to compensate for leaks. Nasal NIV was set at peak airway pressures of 15, 20, and 25 cm H2O and PEEP of 5, 6, and 7 cm H2O. Three sizes of the Neotech RAM cannula were used (prong outer diameters of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm). The nose was designed to keep the leak of the nares by the prongs to 30%. We also created a worst case leak (58% leak) by using the largest simulated nostril diameter with the smallest diameter Neotech RAM cannula prong. The outcome measure was the difference in pressures, referred to as leak effect, measured by the lung simulator relative to the set peak airway pressure and PEEP on the ventilator. RESULTS For the interface with 30% leak, leak effects of peak airway pressure during simulated nasal NIV were similar with all Neotech RAM cannula sizes, with 63-75% of peak airway pressure and 70-90% of PEEP being transmitted across the nasal interface. The worst case scenario produced a 92% leak effect in peak airway pressure and PEEP. CONCLUSIONS When used with ≤ 30% leak, the Neotech RAM cannula interface results in clinically acceptable transmission of pressures. With > 50% leak, a clinically negligible amount of pressure is transmitted to the artificial lungs.","Iyer, Narayan P; Chatburn, Robert",Respiratory care,342,33

There was statistical significance, allowing a correlation with the negative pandemic for the rates of body injury due to traffic accidents, gunshot injuries, stab wounds, sexual violence, bodily injuries and interpersonal violence. As factors possibly associated with a reduction in the incidence of these variables, the literature presents some changes resulting from the pandemic, such as adherence to isolation, with a reduction in the flow of people on the street, and a decrease in reports of violence. The present study indicates that the findings may serve as a warning for future changes and for the adoption of preventive measures, however they represent the initial situation of the pandemic in São Paulo and, therefore, further investigations must be carried out with the course of the pandemic, which still remains.","Ribeiro-Junior, Marcelo Augusto Fontenelle; NÉder, Paola Rezende; Augusto, Samara DE Souza; Elias, Yasmin Garcia Batista; Hluchan, Karoline; Santo-Rosa, Otto Mauro",Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes,342,19

Protective clothing is essential when one is treating infected patients or dealing with unknown pathogens. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of protective clothing against pathogens. In Japan, some methods for evaluating the performance of protective clothing have been established in the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS). However, a test method against virus aerosols has not been established. Because there is a risk of infection from a live virus during the test, it is necessary to devise a safe method for the virus-aerosol-based test. Here, we propose a new method of safely measuring virus aerosols for the performance evaluation of protective clothing materials. To ensure safety, an inactivated virus was used. As a model virus, the influenza virus was selected owing to the proper small diameter of the virus particles. To quantitatively measure the particle-amount of the inactivated influenza virus, we developed an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting the M1 protein. Furthermore, we evaluated two materials using our method. Significant differences in the protection performance against the virus aerosol were observed between different sample materials, thereby confirming the applicability of our new method for performance evaluation.","Shimasaki, Noriko; Nojima, Yasuhiro; Okaue, Akira; Takahashi, Hitoshi; Kageyama, Tsutomu; Hamamoto, Itsuki; Shinohara, Katsuaki",Biocontrol science,342,11

OBJECTIVES To study the increasing divergence between targeted and achieved distractions observed with magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR)lengthening, and the relationship of this reduced rate of achieved lengthening with remaining rod length. METHODS Patients with early onset scoliosis (EOS) who underwent MCGRs with minimum 2-year follow-up were consecutively enrolled. Targeted and achieved lengths were compared. Correlation between percentage of lengthening achieved from targeted length was identified with the timing of rod exchanges. RESULTS A total of 20 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age at index surgery was 9.5 years and mean postoperative follow-up was 68 ± 28 months. Of these, 8 patients had at least one rod exchange that occurred at 23 ± 4 months. A decrease in rate of achieved lengthening was observed when compared with targeted distractions. The achieved lengthening drops from 86% of targeted length at the first distraction to only 58.8% at the 21st distraction episode for the first set of rods. After rod exchange, the average achieved lengthening went back up to 81.3% of the targeted length but subsequently had a gradual reduction to 35% at the 19th distraction episode. CONCLUSIONS We propose a ""law of temporary diminishing distraction gains"" that MCGR users should be aware of when monitoring rod lengthening. Diminishing distraction length gains is observed as the rod is lengthened and is a phenomenon independent of patient factors. It is only temporary as the rates of achieved lengthening returns to baseline after rod exchange.","Cheung, Jason Pui Yin; Bow, Cora; Cheung, Kenneth M C",Global spine journal,342,19

A lack of reported strategies for musicians suffering performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) exists. Papers investigating the role that postural distortions or spinal structural anomalies that could play a role in setting the stage for PRMD do not exist. The purpose of this paper was to provide a description and discussion of the use of a specialized upper cervical manual correction at the cranio-cervical junction (CCJ) to treat a violist who had disabling pain in her wrists, arms, neck, and hip. Differential diagnoses are required regarding possible confounding elements within the cervical spine. CASE REPORT After 40 years of music performance, a violist experienced severe pain while attempting to play the simplest student musical pieces. Early retirement seemed imminent. To determine appropriate chiropractic approach, the patient's clinical assessment included active range of motion, chiropractic tests, palpation, and radiographic study. Postural distortions, hypertonic muscles, joint pain, arthritis, and ponticulus posticus (PP) were noted. Upper cervical spine orthogonal radiographic series were used to develop a correction strategy. These images identified excursion of the cervical spine away from the vertical axis and C0-C1-C2 misalignments. After performing low-velocity, low-force manual correction to the CCJ, the patient experienced immediate relief of wrist pain. Over a 9-month follow-up period, the patient reported gradual decrease of pain and increased stamina while performing. Upon completing chiropractic care, the violist's career was restored. CONCLUSIONS This case supports the hypothesis that evaluating and correcting spinal structures proximal to painful extremities may represent an efficient and long-lasting solution for PRMD.","Schalow, Philip R",The American journal of case reports,342,16

Yet, only a few studies have investigated them as models. It has previously been demonstrated that aerosolization, environmental conditions, and sampling conditions affect viral infectivity, but viral infectivity is virus dependent. Thus, several virus models are likely needed to study their general behavior in aerosols. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of aerosolization and sampling on the infectivity of five tail-less bacteriophages and two pathogenic viruses: MS2 (a single-stranded RNA [ssRNA] phage of the Leviviridae family), Φ6 (a segmented double-stranded RNA [dsRNA] phage of the Cystoviridae family), ΦX174 (a single-stranded DNA [ssDNA] phage of the Microviridae family), PM2 (a double-stranded DNA [dsDNA] phage of the Corticoviridae family), PR772 (a dsDNA phage of the Tectiviridae family), human influenza A virus H1N1 (an ssRNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family), and the poultry virus Newcastle disease virus (NDV; an ssRNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family). Three nebulizers and two nebulization salt buffers (with or without organic fluid) were tested, as were two aerosol sampling devices, a liquid cyclone (SKC BioSampler) and a dry cyclone (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler). The presence of viruses in collected air samples was detected by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our results showed that these selected five phages behave differently when aerosolized and sampled. RNA phage MS2 and ssDNA phage ΦX174 were the most resistant to aerosolization and sampling. The presence of organic fluid in the nebulization buffer protected phages PR772 and Φ6 throughout the aerosolization and sampling with dry cyclones. In this experimental setup, the behavior of the influenza virus resembled that of phages PR772 and Φ6, while the behavior of NDV was closer to that of phages MS2 and ΦX174. These results provide critical information for the selection of appropriate phage models to mimic the behavior of specific human and animal viruses in aerosols.","Turgeon, Nathalie; Toulouse, Marie-Josée; Martel, Bruno; Moineau, Sylvain; Duchaine, Caroline",Applied and environmental microbiology,342,16

DN leadership and its importance have come to the fore during the COVID-19 crisis, where hospital discharges have increased rapidly to make way for highly complex admissions (HM Government, 2020). This paper examines the importance of the SPQDN qualification, exploring the role of the DN within practice education. Continuation of the vital DN qualification will ensure that the numbers of qualified DNs increase, ultimately protecting community capacity. With a move towards an apprenticeship model to achieve the SPQDN, DNs must engage with and influence curriculum development to confirm courses deliver requirements of the workplace, commissioners and the 2019 NHS Long Term Plan. Expectations of the DN role within practice education have changed, moving away from the practice teacher standards to the new Nursing and Midwifery Council Standards for Student Support and Assessment. This poses new challenges in DN education in practice. The implications of this transition threaten to de-value the quality of the assessment process by removing the high standards of preparation previously demanded; ultimately, this is a risk to the provision of the quality practice education that previously existed.","Ashworth, Lisa",British journal of community nursing,342,31

AIM The study objective was to propose a method for recording sequences of HCW behaviours during mock vs. actual procedures and to evaluate differences for use in infection risk modelling and staff training. METHODS Procedures for three types of care were observed under mock and actual settings: IV-drip care, observational care, and doctors' rounds on a respiratory ward in a university teaching hospital. Contacts and hand hygiene behaviours were recorded in real-time using either a handheld tablet or video cameras. FINDINGS Actual patient care demonstrated 70% more surface contacts. It was also 2.4 minutes longer but equal in terms of patient contacts. On average, doctors spent 7.5mins (2.5mins for mock) with patients whilst auxiliary nurses took 4.9mins for ""obs"" (2.4mins for mock). While registered nurses took 3.2mins for mock IV-care and 3.8mins for actual observation this translated to a 44% increase in contacts. In 51% of actual care and 37% of mock care episodes, hand hygiene was performed before patient contact; in comparison, 15% of staff delivering actual care performed hand hygiene after patient contact on leaving the room vs 22% for mock care. Number of overall touches in the patient room was a modest predictor of hand hygiene.

The comparison included data collected in 2019 (March 15-October 15, when the epidemic did not influence the Polish healthcare system or patient demographics) and in a corresponding period in 2020. This study was conducted in the trauma and orthopedic surgery wards and the emergency departments of 2 regional Polish hospitals. RESULTS The analysis of the data from the orthopedic wards showed a reduction in the total number of admissions in 2020 by 55%. The number of elective and emergency interventions was differently related to the pandemic, with elective interventions declining by 72% and emergency interventions increasing by 27% in 2020 compared to 2019. The total number of elective foot surgeries in children decreased by 59% in 2020. The mean duration of hospital stay was approx. 2.5 days shorter in adults and 1.7 days shorter in children during the 2nd evaluation period.

These discoveries provide impetus for better analytical methods to detect and characterize isomerization in proteins, which will enable a more complete understanding of the underlying relationship between these modifications and biology. Herein we employ a two-dimensional approach for identification of peptides isomers that also includes pinpointing of the modified residue. Collision-induced dissociation is used to fragment ions in the first dimension, followed by separation of the fragments with travelling-wave ion mobility. By comparing data obtained from both isomers, differences in either fragment-ion intensities or arrival-time distributions can be used to identify isomeric forms and the specific site of modification within the peptides. Synthetic peptide standards with sequences derived from long-lived proteins in the eye lens and isomerization at serine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were examined. Although both dimensions are capable of isomer identification, ion mobility is much better at determining the site of modification. In general, separation of isomeric forms by ion mobility is possible but does not follow predictable trends dictated by sequence or fragment-ion length. In most cases, however, the site of isomerization can be precisely determined.","Wu, Hoi-Ting; Julian, Ryan R",The Analyst,342,28

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to propose a method for evaluating RCE quantitatively and intuitively, and to determine associations between ultrasonographic renal structural distinction and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in canine chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS Data were collected on 63 dogs, including 27 with normal kidney function and 36 CKD patients. Symmetric dimethylarginine and creatinine concentrations were measured for calculating eGFR. RCE was evaluated as 3 grades on ultrasonography images according to the distinction between the renal cortex and outer medulla. The RCE grade of each kidney was measured. RESULTS There was a significant difference in eGFR between the group normal and CKD (p < 0.001). As mean of RCE grades (the mean values of each right and left kidney's RCE grade) increases, the proportion of group CKD among the patients in each grade increases (p < 0.001). Also, severity of RCE (classified as ""high"" if any right or left kidney evaluated as RCE grade 3, ""low"" otherwise) and eGFR is good indicator for predicting group CKD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The degree of distinction between the renal cortex and the outer medulla is closely related to renal function including eGFR and the RCE grade defined in this study can be used as a method of objectively evaluating RCE.","Lee, Siheon; Hong, Sungkyun; Kim, Seungji; Oh, Dayoung; Choen, Sangkyung; Choi, Mincheol; Yoon, Junghee",Journal of veterinary science,342,7

METHODOLOGY Following a systematic search, we included any document endorsed by an organ donation organization, a professional society, or a government, that aims to direct the medical management of adult, neurologically deceased, multi-organ donors. We extracted recommendations pertaining to six domains: the autonomic storm, hemodynamic instability, hormone supplementation, ventilation, blood product transfusions, and general intensive care unit (ICU) care. Methodological quality of the guidelines was assessed by the validated AGREE-II tool. MAIN FINDINGS This review includes 27 clinical practice guidelines representing 26 countries published between 1993 and 2019. Using the AGREE-II validated tool for the evaluation of guidelines' quality, documents generally scored well on their scope and clarity of presentation. Nevertheless, quality was limited in terms of the scientific rigor of guideline development. Recommendations varied substantially across the domains of managing the autonomic storm, subsequent management of hemodynamic instability, hormone therapy, mechanical ventilation, blood product transfusion, and general ICU care. We found consistent recommendations for low tidal volume ventilation subsequent to the publication of a landmark clinical trial. CONCLUSION Highly inconsistent recommendations for deceased donor care summarized in this review likely reflect the relatively slow emergence of high-quality clinical research in this field, as well as a late uptake of recent validated guideline methodology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Nineteen patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or stent placement (in 20 lower extremities) were evaluated. A region of interest (ROI) at the proximal superficial femoral artery (SFA) was selected for a reference TTP for quantitative assessments. The ROI measurements of the TTP interval between medial and lateral plantar/dorsalis pedis relative to the reference was regarded as the ΔTTP and used to assess distal hemodynamic improvement achieved by the revascularization. The ABI was obtained with a handheld Doppler ultrasound machine with a manually operated blood-pressure cuff. Correlation between the two methods was analyzed. RESULTS The ABI improved significantly from 0.44 ± 0.18 to 0.79 ± 0.20 (t = 10.11; P < .0001) after the intervention. TTP, which reflected the blood flow time from the proximal SFA to the foot, became much faster, from 11.86 seconds ± 4.26 to 6.75 seconds ± 2.03 (t = 6.57; P < .001). A good correlation was observed between the improvement ratios of ΔTTP and ABI (r = 0. 863). CONCLUSIONS TTP measurements derived from ccDSA provide an easy and objective method for assessment of distal hemodynamic changes after endovascular treatment of lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It may provide a quantitative method to assess the adequacy of endovascular interventions and provide more objective suggestions for procedure endpoints, with potentially better clinical outcomes for patients with PAD.","Lou, Wen-Sheng; Su, Hao-Bo; Huang, Kai-Yi; He, Xu; Chen, Liang; Chen, Guo-Ping; Shi, Wan-Yin; Han, Jing-Feng; Gu, Jian-Ping",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,342,1

Prompt early initiation of sequenced multidrug therapy (SMDT) is a widely and currently available solution to stem the tide of hospitalizations and death. A multipronged therapeutic approach includes 1) adjuvant nutraceuticals, 2) combination intracellular anti-infective therapy, 3) inhaled/oral corticosteroids, 4) antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants, 5) supportive care including supplemental oxygen, monitoring, and telemedicine. Randomized trials of individual, novel oral therapies have not delivered tools for physicians to combat the pandemic in practice. No single therapeutic option thus far has been entirely effective and therefore a combination is required at this time. An urgent immediate pivot from single drug to SMDT regimens should be employed as a critical strategy to deal with the large numbers of acute COVID-19 patients with the aim of reducing the intensity and duration of symptoms and avoiding hospitalization and death.","McCullough, Peter A; Alexander, Paul E; Armstrong, Robin; Arvinte, Cristian; Bain, Alan F; Bartlett, Richard P; Berkowitz, Robert L; Berry, Andrew C; Borody, Thomas J; Brewer, Joseph H; Brufsky, Adam M; Clarke, Teryn; Derwand, Roland; Eck, Alieta; Eck, John; Eisner, Richard A; Fareed, George C; Farella, Angelina; Fonseca, Silvia N S; Geyer, Charles E; Gonnering, Russell S; Graves, Karladine E; Gross, Kenneth B V; Hazan, Sabine; Held, Kristin S; Hight, H Thomas; Immanuel, Stella; Jacobs, Michael M; Ladapo, Joseph A; Lee, Lionel H; Littell, John; Lozano, Ivette; Mangat, Harpal S; Marble, Ben; McKinnon, John E; Merritt, Lee D; Orient, Jane M; Oskoui, Ramin; Pompan, Donald C; Procter, Brian C; Prodromos, Chad; Rajter, Juliana Cepelowicz; Rajter, Jean-Jacques; Ram, C Venkata S; Rios, Salete S; Risch, Harvey A; Robb, Michael J A; Rutherford, Molly; Scholz, Martin; Singleton, Marilyn M; Tumlin, James A; Tyson, Brian M; Urso, Richard G; Victory, Kelly; Vliet, Elizabeth Lee; Wax, Craig M; Wolkoff, Alexandre G; Wooll, Vicki; Zelenko, Vladimir",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,342,1

Morbidity caused by PFTS is moderate, but case fatality is high. The etiology of PFTS is presently unknown and may include infectious agent(s), noninfectious factors, or both. PFTS was identified in a high health status farm with good management in early 2007. A diagnostic investigation was undertaken to identify the pathological lesions of, and infectious agents associated with, pigs demonstrating typical clinical signs. Affected (PFTS-SICK) and unaffected (PFTS-HLTHY) pigs from an affected farm, and unaffected pigs from 2 unaffected farms, were examined. The most prevalent lesions in PFTS-SICK pigs were superficial lymphocytic fundic gastritis, atrophic enteritis, superficial colitis, lymphocytic and neutrophilic rhinitis, mild nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis, and thymic atrophy. Rotavirus A and Betacoronavirus 1 (Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) were identified only in PFTS-SICK pigs, but the significance of the viruses is uncertain because PFTS is not consistent with the typical presentation following infection by these pathogens. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Porcine circovirus-2, Influenza A virus, Alphacoronavirus 1 (Transmissible gastroenteritis virus), Torque teno virus 1, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, and Brachyspira pilosicoli were not identified in PFTS-SICK pigs. Suid herpesvirus 2 (Porcine cytomegalovirus), Porcine enteric calicivirus, Torque teno virus 2, pathogenic Escherichia coli, and coccidia were detected in both PFTS-SICK and PFTS-HLTHY pigs. It was concluded that there is a lack of compelling evidence that PFTS is caused by any of these pathogens.","Huang, Yanyun; Gauvreau, Henry; Harding, John","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",342,1

BACKGROUND The incidence of healthcare-associated infections has increased. Previous research focuses on epidemiology, healthcare systems, and the economic burden of outbreaks. Few published studies focus on the impact of outbreaks on nurses' work in acute care facilities. INTRODUCTION Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, combating infectious diseases has become a key issue. Hospitals have implemented measures related to healthcare-associated infections. However, nurses experience challenges in preventing, controlling, and contending with outbreaks. METHODS A retrospective exploratory case study approach was used. Data were collected over a 4-month period in 2012. The incidence rates of site-specific HAIs were analysed, and individual interviews were held with 23 bedside nurses and five nurse managers. FINDINGS Five themes emerged from the interviews: comparison of healthcare-associated infections outbreaks; the nature of nurses' work; impact of outbreaks on patient care; innovation and quality control in clinical practice; and increased and expanded IPAC measures. The incidence rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci at the study site decreased, but remained above provincial benchmarks. Nurses experienced workload challenges, time pressures and psychological effects stemming from outbreaks and developed various innovations in response. Patient care was also affected. CONCLUSION Nurses' work has been impacted by healthcare-associated infectious disease outbreaks. Nursing workloads should be quantified to facilitate the development of guidelines for optimum nurse-patient ratio during outbreaks. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND/OR HEALTH POLICY A strong evidence-based policy framework is required to address healthcare-associated infectious disease outbreaks. Infection prevention and control guidelines and procedures should be established provincially and nationally. An interdisciplinary approach is essential for the creation of comprehensive and innovative strategies. Nursing research has increased understanding of the implications of infectious diseases in hospitals. Building on the literature, findings from this study can be used to influence policies on the care of patients who have secondary infections. Nurse-driven protocols are important and can lead to the creation of best practice guidelines that can be implemented across settings.","Musau, J; Baumann, A; Kolotylo, C; O'Shea, T; Bialachowski, A",International nursing review,342,27

Using a mouse model closely recapitulating key alterations of chronic human MTLE with hippocampal sclerosis, here we asked whether death of astrocytes contributes to the initiation of the disease and investigated potential underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS Antibody staining was combined with confocal imaging and semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to identify markers of different cellular death mechanisms between 4 h and 3 days after epilepsy induction. RESULTS Four hours after kainate-mediated induction of status epilepticus (SE), we found a significant reduction in the density of astrocytes in the CA1 stratum radiatum (SR) of the ipsilateral hippocampus. This reduction was transient, as within the next 3 days, astrocyte cell numbers recovered to the initial values, which was accompanied by enhanced proliferation. Four hours after SE induction, a small proportion of astrocytes in the ipsilateral CA1 SR expressed autophagy-related genes and proteins, whereas we did not find astrocytes positive for cleaved caspase 3 or terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling, ruling out apoptosis-related astrocytic death. Importantly, at the same early time point post-SE, many astrocytes in the ipsilateral CA1 SR showed strong expression of genes encoding pro-necroptosis factors, including receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Phosphorylation of MLKL (pMLKL), formation of necrosome complexes composed of RIPK3 and pMLKL, and translocation of pMLKL to the nucleus and to the plasma membrane were often observed in astrocytes of the ipsilateral hippocampus 4 h post-SE. SIGNIFICANCE The present study revealed that astrocytes die shortly after induction of SE. Our expression data and immunohistochemistry suggest that necroptosis and autophagy contribute to astrocytic death. These findings help to better understand how dysfunctional and pathological remodeling of astrocytes contributes to the initiation of temporal lobe epilepsy.","Wu, Zhou; Deshpande, Tushar; Henning, Lukas; Bedner, Peter; Seifert, Gerald; Steinhäuser, Christian",Epilepsia,342,1

There are many interventions used in the delivery room to prevent acute lung injury and consequently BPD in these patients. The availability of different treatment options often poses a practical challenge to the practicing neonatologist when it comes to making an evidence-based choice as the multitude of pairwise systematic reviews including Cochrane reviews that are currently available only provide a narrow perspective through head-to-head comparisons. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials evaluating delivery room interventions within the first golden hour after birth for prevention of BPD. The primary outcome includes BPD. Secondary outcomes include death at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or before discharge; severe intraventricular haemorrhage (grade 3 or 4 based on the Papile criteria); any air leak syndromes (including pneumothorax or pulmonary interstitial emphysema); retinopathy of prematurity (any stage) and neurodevelopmental impairment at 18-24 months. We will search from their inception to August 2018, the following databases: Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials as well as grey literature resources. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information and assess the risk of bias and the confidence in the estimate (with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach). This review will use Bayesian network meta-analysis approach which allows the comparison of the multiple delivery room interventions for prevention of BPD. We will perform a Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine the pooled direct and indirect treatment effect estimates for each outcome, effectiveness and safety of delivery room interventions for prevention of BPD. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The proposed protocol is a network meta-analysis, which has been registered on PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42018078648). The results will provide an evidence-based guide to choosing the right sequence of early postnatal interventions that will be associated with the least likelihood of inducing lung injury and BPD in preterm infants. Furthermore, we will identify knowledge gaps and will encourage further research for other therapeutic options. Therefore, its results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Due to the nature of the design, no ethics approval is necessary.","Mitra, Souvik; Disher, Timothy; Pichler, Gerhard; D'Souza, Brandon; Mccord, Helen; Chayapathi, Varsha; Jones, Karlee; Schmölzer, Georg",BMJ open,342,0

However, it is unclear whether the association between hepatic dysfunction and lactate clearance can act as a prognostic marker of clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock. We aimed to evaluate the association between lactate clearance and mortality in two cohorts of septic shock patient who had hepatic dysfunction based on their total serum bilirubin levels (TBIL). Lactate clearance at 24 h after the onset of septic shock was analyzed using two cohorts, sub-categorized into two groups based on TBIL: < 2 mg/dL and ≥ 2 mg/dL. In the derivation cohort, lactate clearance was lower in non-survivors than in survivors with TBIL ≥ 2 mg/dL, while there was no significant difference in lactate clearance between non-survivors and survivors with TBIL < 2 mg/dL. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that increased lactate clearance was significantly associated with decreased 28-day mortality in the TBIL ≥ 2 mg/dL group (10% lactate clearance, adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-0.97, P = 0.0075), Creatinine level ≥ 2 mg/dL group (adjusted OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95, P = 0.00069) and APACHE II score ≥ 35 group (adjusted OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98, P = 0.013). In the validation cohort, lactate clearance was lower in non-survivors than in survivors with TBIL ≥ 2 mg/dL, while no significant difference in lactate clearance was observed between non-survivors and survivors with TBIL < 2 mg/dL. Increased lactate clearance was significantly associated with decreased 28-day mortality in the TBIL ≥ 2 mg/dL group (10% lactate clearance, adjusted OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.96, P = 0.0038) and the association was just about significant in APACHE II score ≥ 35 group (adjusted OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.74-1.00, P = 0.051). In conclusion, increased lactate clearance in septic shock patients with hepatic dysfunction (TBIL ≥ 2 mg/dL) or high severity (APACHE II score ≥ 35) was associated with decreased 28-day mortality.","Takahashi, Nozomi; Nakada, Taka-Aki; Walley, Keith R; Russell, James A",Scientific reports,342,14

The use of virtual care in health care delivery has been gaining popularity across a variety of patient populations, especially within the COVID-19 context. Performed before COVID-19, the aim of the present study was to explore the perspectives of patients with CLD toward the use of virtual care with their liver specialists. Methods: A cross-sectional, mixed methods study was used to conduct this work. Results: A total of 101 patients with CLD participated in this study. Participants had a mean age of 54.5 years (range 19-87 years). Quantitative analysis revealed that 86% were willing to attend a virtual visit with their liver specialist in the future. There was a significant relationship between both age and income level and acceptance of virtual care. The themes emerging from the qualitative analysis included: (1) past experiences attending in-person visits, (2) perspectives on the use of virtual visits, and (3) perceived challenges of virtual visits. Conclusions: Although there are many potential benefits of virtual care to both the patient and the health care system, there are instances (older age, low income level) when in-person care may be preferred by patients. A tailored approach that is mindful of the individual patient's health status, ease of access to technology, and preferences must be considered when offering virtual care. These findings are of particular relevance during COVID-19, an era that has forced us into the virtual space.","Hyde, Ashley M; Watt, Makayla; Carbonneau, Michelle; Eboreime, Ejemai Amaize; Abraldes, Juan G; Tandon, Puneeta",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,342,24

STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Mares (n = 20) aged 3-22 years with unilateral enlarged ovaries. METHODS Enlarged ovaries were confirmed by transrectal palpation and ultrasonography. After sedation, 3 laparoscopic portals were made in the paralumbar fossa. The mesovarium was desensitized and dissected using a vessel sealing device, and the ovary was left free in the abdomen. Then under general anesthesia, the mare was positioned in dorsal recumbency and an 8 cm ventral median celiotomy made for ovary retrieval in a specimen bag. RESULTS This 2-step procedure was successfully used for removal enlarged ovaries (12-50 cm) in 17 mares and for management of behavioral problems in 3 mares. No operative or postoperative complications occurred. Owner satisfaction and cosmesis were considered excellent. CONCLUSIONS Standing laparoscopy combined with a limited median celiotomy is a safe technique for ovariectomy in mares.

In the following years, a great number of building sites were activated, building workers resulted intensely exposed and represent a relevant target for research on environmental mutagenesis and epidemiological surveillance. Cells of buccal mucosa are considered an appropriate site for early detecting of cytogenetic damage, since it represents the first barrier in inhalation or ingestion and can metabolize carcinogenic agents into reactive chemicals. Our study is aimed 1) at comparing the early genotoxic damage as measured by the buccal mucosa micronucleus test in two subgroups of workers defined by different occupational exposure and 2) at evaluating possible confounding variables such as lifestyle factors. METHODS AND RESULTS A cross-sectional study was conducted in L'Aquila, on 24 outdoor workers (OWs) highly exposed on the construction sites and 26 indoor workers (IWs), all subjected to the compulsory occupational surveillance system, in the period 2017-2018. Buccal cells samples were collected and, based on the Micronucleus test, the exfoliated cells were classified in respect of nuclear changes observed. Moreover, a self-report questionnaire composed of 84 items, was administered to the workers. RESULTS Significant differences were observed between Exp+ (OWs) and Exp- (IWs) in the number of the analyzed cells (expressed as mean value out of 1000 cells): respectively 954.46 vs 990.06 normal cells, (p < 0.001); 19.79 vs 4.95 micronucleated cells, as marker of chromosomal damage (p < 0.001); 13.93 vs 8.96 binucleated cells, as marker of failed cytokinesis (p < 0.001); 2.09 vs 1.18 karyolytic cells, as marker of cell death and damaged DNA (p < 0.05). According with a multivariate regression analysis, in addition to the job exposure (OW vs IW, beta = 12.221, p < 0.001), the only variable independently associated with an increase in Micronuclei (MNs) is the smoking habit (OWs vs IWs, beta = 6.683, p < 0.001) which, even if not associated with dust exposure, worsens cell integrity. Moreover, this worsening effect is weaker in workers not exposed to the site dust (moderation effect). Within social demographic factors, the high educational level only apparently seems to affect MNs number: even if unbalanced in favor of IWs vs OWs, this variable resulted a confounder, since its effect disappears when the interaction between these two factors is considered, because it is a covariate of smoking habit as well as of the job condition. CONCLUSION Despite some limitation, our findings clearly confirm the role of occupational exposure as a marker of cytogenetic damage associated with MNs number in construction workers. Moreover, smoking status appears as the only other investigated factor independently associated to the outcome. The statistical model, in addition, highlights possible moderation and confounding effects, such as interaction between smoking and occupational exposure and the unbalanced school education level in workers. Micronucleus test in exfoliated buccal cells would be considered a suitable method for studying the early genotoxic damage in the construction occupational setting as well as in evaluating the efficacy of preventive practices.","Leonardi, Sara; Poma, Anna Mg; Colafarina, Sabrina; D'Aloisio, Francesco; Scatigna, Maria; Zarivi, Osvaldo; Mastrantonio, Riccardo; Tobia, Loreta; Fabiani, Leila",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,342,29

However, modest sample sizes have limited characterization of the extent to which onset to treatment (OTT) time influences outcome; and the generalizability of findings to clinical practice is uncertain. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the degree to which OTT time is associated with outcome among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intraveneous tPA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Data were analyzed from 58,353 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in 1395 hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Program, April 2003 to March 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Relationship between OTT time and in-hospital mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, ambulatory status at discharge, and discharge destination. RESULTS Among the 58,353 tPA-treated patients, median age was 72 years, 50.3% were women, median OTT time was 144 minutes (interquartile range, 115-170), 9.3% (5404) had OTT time of 0 to 90 minutes, 77.2% (45,029) had OTT time of 91 to 180 minutes, and 13.6% (7920) had OTT time of 181 to 270 minutes. Median pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale documented in 87.7% of patients was 11 (interquartile range, 6-17). Patient factors most strongly associated with shorter OTT included greater stroke severity (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.1 per 5-point increase), arrival by ambulance (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.5-7.3), and arrival during regular hours (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.8-5.4). Overall, there were 5142 (8.8%) in-hospital deaths, 2873 (4.9%) patients had intracranial hemorrhage, 19,491 (33.4%) patients achieved independent ambulation at hospital discharge, and 22,541 (38.6%) patients were discharged to home. Faster OTT, in 15-minute increments, was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001), reduced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001), increased achievement of independent ambulation at discharge (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05; P < .001), and increased discharge to home (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a registry representing US clinical practice, earlier thrombolytic treatment was associated with reduced mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and higher rates of independent ambulation at discharge and discharge to home following acute ischemic stroke. These findings support intensive efforts to accelerate hospital presentation and thrombolytic treatment in patients with stroke.","Saver, Jeffrey L; Fonarow, Gregg C; Smith, Eric E; Reeves, Mathew J; Grau-Sepulveda, Maria V; Pan, Wenqin; Olson, Daiwai M; Hernandez, Adrian F; Peterson, Eric D; Schwamm, Lee H",JAMA,342,31

Herein, we prepared hyaluronic acid-functionalized regenerated silk fibroin-based nanoparticles (NPs) loading with photosensitizer (NIR770) and doxorubicin (DOX). The resultant HNDNPs had a desirable diameter of 161.0 nm and a negative zeta-potential of -30.5 mV. Interestingly, they showed excellent responses when triggered with various stimuli (acidity, reactive oxygen species, glutathione, hyaluronidase, or hyperthermia). Cell experiments revealed that HNDNPs could be specifically internalized by A549 cells, and efficiently released the payloads into the cytoplasm. Moreover, NIR770 was preferentially retained in mitochondria due to its lipophilic and cationic properties, which exhibited highly efficient photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy upon near infrared (NIR) irradiation. Meanwhile, DOX molecules were mainly accumulated in the nucleus. Intravenous injection of HNDNPs into mice followed by NIR irradiation provided excellent multimodal imaging (NIR, photothermal, and photoacoustic imaging), almost eliminated the entire tumor, and greatly prolonged mice survival time with no side effects. Our study demonstrates that this HNDNP, which integrates the functions of tumor targeting, on-demand drug release, multimodal imaging, mitochondrial phototherapy, and chemotherapy, can be exploited as a promising nanococktail for imaging-guided synergistic treatment of cancer.","Gou, Shuangquan; Yang, Jun; Ma, Ya; Zhang, Xueqing; Zu, Menghang; Kang, Ting; Liu, Siyu; Ke, Bowen; Xiao, Bo",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,342,20

However, there is mounting evidence for a much broader symptom spectrum, including psychiatric symptoms. Disordered sleep has previously been linked with dissociative symptoms, which may imply that patients with narcolepsy are more prone to develop such symptoms. Objectives: To investigate the frequency of dissociative symptoms in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared to population controls. Methods: In a retrospective case control study, sixty adult patients fulfilling the criteria for narcolepsy type 1 and 120 matched population control subjects received a structured interview using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) to assess dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: A majority of narcolepsy patients reported dissociative symptoms, and even fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria of a dissociative disorder (62% vs 1% in controls, p < .001). Most frequently reported symptoms were ""dissociative amnesia"" (37% vs 1%, p < .001) and ""dissociative disorder of voluntary movement"" (32% vs 1%, p < .001). Conclusion: Dissociative symptoms are strikingly prevalent in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1. Although a formal diagnosis of dissociation disorder should not be made as the symptoms can be explained by narcolepsy as an underlying condition, the findings do illustrate the extent and severity of the dissociative symptoms. As for the pathophysiological mechanism, there may be symptom overlap between narcolepsy and dissociation disorder. However, there may also be a more direct link between disrupted sleep and dissociative symptoms. In either case, the high frequency of occurrence of dissociative symptoms should result in an active inquiry by doctors, to improve therapeutic management and guidance.","Quaedackers, Laury; Droogleever Fortuyn, Hal; Van Gilst, Merel; Lappenschaar, Martijn; Overeem, Sebastiaan",Behavioral sleep medicine,342,5

These viral agents may lead to severe respiratory diseases especially in young children and in the elderly. The aim of this study was to determine the seasonal distribution of agent viruses in childhood respiratory infections in our region. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, nasopharyngeal swab sample was obtained from 1 326 patients who presented to Ege University, Medical Faculty Children's Hospital between 2002 and 2012 and who were thought to have respiratory tract infection. Influenza virus type A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus type 1-3 were investigated using shell-vial cell culture method and direct fluorescent antibody test and/or multiplex PCR test. Parainfluenza virus type 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human bocavirus were investigated using multiplex PCR test. The seasonal distributions of the viruses were determined according to the results obtained from Ege University Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Microbiology Clinical Virology Laboratory. Approval was obtained from the ethics committee (Ege University Clinical Researches Ethics Committee, 12.02.2013, number: 13-1/46). RESULTS The majority of the patients who presented were outpatients (n:888, 67%) and the remainder were hospitalized patients (33%, n:438). Respiratory viruses were found in 503 of the nasopharyngeal swab samples (38%). Parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus were found most frequently in December-february (58% and 59%, respectively, influenza viruses were found most frequently in November-december (72%) and adenoviruses were found most frequently in may-september (56%). CONCLUSION Although only supportive therapies are administered generally in viral infections, viral investigations are important in terms of determining the measures to be taken by determining the causes as well as in terms of establishing a general database. Another benefit of this study would be strengthening clinical approach to patients and decreasing unnecessary antibiotic use.","Gülen, Figen; Yıldız, Başak; Çiçek, Candan; Demir, Esen; Tanaç, Remziye",Turk pediatri arsivi,342,27

Studies elucidating the population structure, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec types, resistance phenotypes, and virulence gene profiles of animal-associated MRSA are needed to understand spread and transmission. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to determine 1) clonal complexes and spa types, 2) resistance phenotypes, and 3) virulence/resistance gene profiles of MRSA isolated from animals in Switzerland. METHODS We analyzed 31 presumptive MRSA isolates collected from clinical infections in horses, dogs, cattle, sheep, and pigs, which had tested positive in the Staphaurex Latex Agglutination Test. The isolates were characterized by spa typing and DNA microarray profiling. In addition, we performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the VITEK 2 Compact system. RESULTS Characterization of the 31 presumptive MRSA isolates revealed 3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates, which were able to grow on MRSA2 Brilliance agar. Of the 28 MRSA isolates, the majority was assigned to CC398 (86%), but CC8 (11%) and CC1 (4%) were also detected. The predominant spa type was t011 (n = 23), followed by t009 (n = 2), t034 (n = 1), t008 (n = 1), and t127 (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study extend the current body of knowledge on the population structure, resistance phenotypes, and virulence and resistance gene profiles of MRSA from livestock and companion animals.","Schmitt, Sarah; Stephan, Roger; Huebschke, Ella; Schaefle, Daniel; Merz, Axel; Johler, Sophia",Journal of veterinary science,342,5

Material and methods Twelve different commercially available urethral catheters from three companies (Bard™, Rusch™ and Dover™) were investigated to compare their irrigation and drainage properties. Irrigation port, drainage port and overall cross-sectional areas for a 24Fr 3-way catheter was measured and compared. The maximum (Qmax) and average (Qavg) irrigation and drainage flow rates for each catheter was measured for 20-40 seconds using uroflowmetry. The primary endpoint was to determine which catheter offers optimal irrigation and drainage parameters. Results Overall cross-sectional area, irrigation port cross-sectional area, and drainage port cross-sectional area differed significantly for each 24Fr 3-way catheter assessed (p <0.001). The 24Fr 3-way Rusch Simplastic™ catheter consistently demonstrated the greatest maximal flow rate (Qmax: 5 ±0.3 ml/s) and average flow rate (Qavg: 4.6 ±0.2 ml/s) for irrigation. The 24Fr 3-way Dover™ catheter provided the greatest drainage properties (Qmax: 19.7 ±2 ml/s; Q avg: 15.9 ±5 ml/s). In the setting of continuous bladder irrigation, the 24Fr 3-way Rusch Simplastic™ catheter provided the highest irrigation rates (Qmax: 6.6 ±1.8 ml/s; Q avg: 4.6 ±0.9 ml/s). Conclusions Three-way catheters demonstrate significant differences in their irrigation and drainage characteristics. The type of catheter selected should be based on the appropriate prioritization of efficient bladder irrigation versus efficient bladder drainage.","Abdelrahman, Mamoun; Davis, Niall F; McMahon, Barry P; Walsh, Michael; McDermott, Thomas E D; Thornhill, John A; Manecksha, Rustom P",Central European journal of urology,342,16

Surgeons in Erlangen, Germany, routinely perform complete mesocolic excision (CME) with central vascular ligation (CVL) and report 5-year survivals of higher than 89%. We aimed to further investigate the importance of CME and CVL surgery for colonic cancer by comparison with a series of standard specimens. METHODS The fresh photographs of 49 CME and CVL specimens from Erlangen and 40 standard specimens from Leeds, United Kingdom, for primary colonic adenocarcinoma were collected. Precise tissue morphometry and grading of the plane of surgery were performed before comparison to histopathologic variables. RESULTS CME and CVL surgery removed more tissue compared with standard surgery in terms of the distance between the tumor and the high vascular tie (median, 131 v 90 mm; P < .0001), the length of large bowel (median, 314 v 206 mm; P < .0001), and ileum removed (median, 83 v 63 mm; P = .003), and the area of mesentery (19,657 v 11,829 mm(2); P < .0001). In addition, CME and CVL surgery was associated with more mesocolic plane resections (92% v 40%; P < .0001) and a greater lymph node yield (median, 30 v 18; P < .0001). CONCLUSION Surgeons in Erlangen routinely practicing CME and CVL surgery remove more mesocolon and are more likely to resect in the mesocolic plane when compared with standard excisions. This, along with the associated greater lymph node yield, may partially explain the high 5-year survival rates reported in Erlangen.","West, Nicholas P; Hohenberger, Werner; Weber, Klaus; Perrakis, Aristoteles; Finan, Paul J; Quirke, Philip",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,342,1

The study also assessed whether acceptance coping moderates the relationship between craving control and increased HED food intake, and examined the associations between trait disinhibition, perceived stress and changes to HED food intake. An online survey completed by 124 adults living in Victoria, Australia (total eligible n = 147; 38.5 ± 12.9 years) during the COVID-19 lockdown showed that 49% of participants reported increased overall food intake, and 21-29% reported increased intake of HED sweet and savoury foods during the COVID-19 lockdown. Of the eating behaviour traits assessed, low craving control was the only significant predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake (cognitive restraint, disinhibition and emotional eating were non-significant predictors). Perceived stress was associated with reported increases in overall savoury and sweet snack intake, but was not significantly associated with changes to specific HED food groups (sweet and savoury). In this sample, acceptance coping did not significantly moderate the relationship between craving control and increased HED food intake. Based on these replicated findings, further trials should now consider interventions targeting craving control to promote controlled food intake in individuals at-risk of weight gain during the current COVID-19 and future potential lockdowns.","Buckland, Nicola J; Kemps, Eva",Appetite,342,1

Untreated depression affects quality of life, cancer care satisfaction and healthcare expenditure. Treatments for this vulnerable heterogenous population should be evidence based and specific. A common sentiment is that psychiatric research does not reflect the prevalence of patients with cancer and comorbid depression and is biased towards certain cancers, but this has not been empirically shown. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of studies on psychological and pharmacological treatments for depression in people with cancer was conducted. Of 4621 papers identified from a search of PubMed and PsycINFO up to 27 June 2020, 84 met inclusion criteria (eg, adults with cancer; depression diagnosis; treatment study) and comprised 6048 participants with depression with cancer. FINDINGS Cancer types are not proportionally represented in depression research in accordance with their incidence. Breast cancer is over-represented (relative frequency in research 49.3%, but 11.7% of global cancer). Cancers of the head and neck and bone and soft tissue were close to parity. All other cancers are under-represented. Representativeness varied 40-fold across different cancers. CONCLUSIONS The evidence base for depression treatments is dominated by a single cancer. Given heterogeneity in cancer populations (eg, stage of illness; psychological impact; cancer treatments), it is possible that depression treatments may not have the same benefits and harms across all cancers, impeding the ability to offer people with different cancers the best depression treatment. While the dominant opinion within this research field is that a cancer bias exists, this is the first study to demonstrate as such.","Bravery, Benjamin; Loughnan, Siobhan; Murphy, Michael",Evidence-based mental health,342,1

For SARS-CoV-2, the degree to which SSEs are involved in transmission remains unclear, but there is growing evidence that SSEs might be a typical feature of COVID-197,8. Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection. We identified 4-7 SSEs across 51 clusters (n = 309 cases) and estimated that 19% (95% confidence interval, 15-24%) of cases seeded 80% of all local transmission. Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than households when controlling for age (P = 0.002). Decreasing the delay between symptom onset and case confirmation did not result in fewer secondary cases (P = 0.98), although the odds that an individual being quarantined as a contact interrupted transmission was 14.4 (95% CI, 1.9-107.2). Public health authorities should focus on rapidly tracing and quarantining contacts, along with implementing restrictions targeting social settings to reduce the risk of SSEs and suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Adam, Dillon C; Wu, Peng; Wong, Jessica Y; Lau, Eric H Y; Tsang, Tim K; Cauchemez, Simon; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J",Nature medicine,342,1

A modelling study.,19.285292,6.896833,2020-07-08,"OPINION STATEMENT Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but very aggressive form of undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Due to its rapid rate of progression and invasive nature, ATC poses significant risks of morbidity and mortality. The cornerstone in the management of ATC remains a prompt diagnosis of the disease and timely management of complications depending on the stage of disease. Surgery continues to offer a higher chance of a cure, although not all patients are candidates for surgical management. Patients with advanced disease may be considered for palliative surgery to reduce morbidity and complications from advanced disease. With the advent of new molecular testing and improved methods of diagnosis, novel therapeutic targets have been identified. Systemic therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) as well as novel immunotherapy have shown some promise in patients with targetable genetic mutations. Patients should therefore have molecular testing of their tumor-if it is unresectable-and be tested for mutations that are targetable. Mutation-targeted therapy may be effective and may result in a significant response to allow surgical intervention for exceptional responders. Overall, patients who receive all three modalities of therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy) have the highest overall survival.","Alobuia, Wilson; Gillis, Andrea; Kebebew, Electron",Current treatment options in oncology,342,1

This study evaluated the effects of WGP on intestinal-immunosuppressed mice from early life to adulthood and detected the underlying mechanism. The results revealed that WGP demonstrated no clinical side effects on the body index, serum total IgA level, protein expression and the morphology of intestine in newborn mice. In the phase of life, compared with the cyclophosphamide-treated group (CG), WGP clearly promoted the secretion of sIgA and effectively regulated the cytokine gene (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-5, IL-17, and TGF-β1) expression in the intestine. Furthermore, WGP promoted the expression of CD40L and CD40, phosphorylation of IKKα/β and transcription of NF-κB-p65. The data as reported in this present analysis suggest that WGP can improve the intestinal immunity of newborn mice to adulthood via the CD40L-CD40-IKKα/β-NF-κB p65 signaling pathway.","Yun, Liyuan; Wu, Tao; Li, Wen; Zhang, Min",Food & function,342,1

Vaccination is the only effective way to prevent and control IBV infection. H120, one of the safest vaccine strains, which has been used worldwide as a primary vaccine, cannot adapt to passaged cells, which severely restricts the quality of the vaccine. Based on the reverse genetics of our previous research work, we constructed the recombinant R-H120-Beaudette-p65(S) strain by replacing the complete spike gene of H120 with the corresponding spike gene from the Beaudette p65 strain. Some biological characteristics, including replication kinetics, virulence and immunological properties of R-H120-Beaudette-p65(S) have been evaluated. The results showed that biological characteristics of R-H120-Beaudette-p65(S), such as replication kinetics in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) and embryo virulence, were similar to those of H120. In addition, R-H120-Beaudette-p65(S) could induce a similar antibody titre and provide up to 80 % immune protection in chickens challenged with the M41 strain.

However, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are frequent comorbid conditions, complicating the assessment of hypertension's individual contribution to the risk. The aims of this study were to evaluate the contributions of hypertension alone, T2DM alone, or their combination to the risk of death, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/respiratory failure, and severe COVID-19 infection. Additionally, we assessed risks associated with elevated blood pressure and fasting blood glucose on the same three clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic models were used for these analyses. Among the 3400 patients, 3327(97.9%) survived and 73(2.1%) died. Compared to patients having neither hypertension nor T2DM (n = 1392), the risk of mortality was significantly higher in patients with T2DM alone (n = 226, OR 5.26 [95% CI: 2.39-11.58]) or with T2DM in combination with hypertension (n = 507, OR 3.02, [95% CI: 1.48-6.15]). Similarly, T2DM was a risk factor for development of ARDS/respiratory failure and severe infection. Hypertension alone (n = 1275) only conferred additional risk for the development of severe infection (OR 1.22 [95% CI: 1.00-1.51]). In conclusion, neither hypertension nor elevated blood pressure was independent risk factors for death or ARDS/respiratory failure but hypertension marginally increased the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. The risk associated with hypertension is accentuated through its confounding effect on T2DM.","Sun, Yuhui; Guan, Xizhou; Jia, Lijing; Xing, Ning; Cheng, Liuquan; Liu, Bo; Zhang, Sibing; He, Kunlun",Journal of clinical hypertension,342,24

Different segmentation methods can be used which predict prognosis equally well but give different optimal cut-offs for risk stratification. Segmentation can be cumbersome meaning a fast, easy and robust method is needed. Aims were to i) evaluate the best automated MTV workflow in DLBCL ii) determine if uptake time, (non)compliance with standardized recommendations for FDG scanning and subsequent disease progression influenced the success of segmentation iii) assess differences in MTV values and discriminatory power of segmentation methods. Methods: 140 baseline FDG-PET/CT scans were selected from UK and Dutch studies in DLBCL to provide a balance between scans at 60- or 90-minutes uptake, parameters compliant or non-compliant with standardized recommendations for scanning and patients with or without progression. An automated tool was used for segmentation using i) standardized uptake value (SUV) 2.5 ii) SUV 4.0 iii) adaptive thresholding [A50P] iv) 41% of maximum SUV [41%] v) majority vote including voxels detected by ≥2 methods [MV2] and vi) detected by ≥3 methods [MV3]. Two independent observers rated the success of the tool to delineate MTV. Scans that required minimal interaction were rated ""success""; scans where > 50% of tumor was missed or required more than 2 editing steps were rated as ""failure"". Results: 138 scans were evaluable, with significant differences in success and failure ratings between methods. The best performing was SUV4.0, with higher success and lower failure rates than all other methods except MV2 which also performed well. SUV4.0 gave a good approximation of MTV in 105 (76%) scans, with simple editing for a satisfactory result in additionally 20% of cases. MTV was significantly different for all methods between patients with and without progression. SUV41% performed slightly worse with longer uptake times, otherwise scanning conditions and patient outcome did not influence the tool's performance. The discriminative power of methods was similar, but MTV values were significantly greater using SUV4.0 and MV2 than other thresholds except for SUV2.5. Conclusion: SUV4.0 and MV2 are recommended for further evaluation. Automated estimation of MTV is feasible.","Barrington, Sally F; Zwezerijnen, Ben Gjc; de Vet, Henrica Cw; Heymans, Martijn W; Mikhaeel, N George; Burggraaff, Coreline N; Eertink, Jakoba J; Pike, Lucy C; Hoekstra, Otto S; Zijlstra, Josee M; Boellaard, Ronald","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",342,17

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the second-most common hospital-acquired infection in pediatric ICU. Oral hygiene maintenance is a challenge here. To maintain oral hygiene and to prevent colonization of microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus which cause ventilator-associated pneumonia, a study was conducted, which aimed at finding the efficacy of chlorhexidine (CHX) wipes (as an oral hygiene aid) on colonization of these organisms in pediatric ICU. Methods and Methodology The study was conducted among twenty children (8 in ventilation and 12 without ventilation) in the age range of 6-14 years admitted in the pediatric ICU. Swab sample was taken on the 1st day from both groups. Culturing of swab sample was done for colonization of microorganisms. CHX gluconate with a concentration of 0.2% was used as wipes. Swab sample was collected at the end of the 2nd day. Culturing of swab sample was done for colonization of microorganisms. Statistical analysis was done. Results A statistically significant difference (P ≤ 0.04) was seen in the ventilator group with a mean of 0.75 ± 13.241 in the reduction of S. aureus count. P. aeruginosa growth was not seen in either of the groups before or after the use of CHX wipe. Conclusions Standard oral hygiene practice has the potential to contribute to improved oral and general health of children in pediatric ICU. CHX wipes significantly reduced S. aureus count in ventilator patients. Hence, it could be used as an effective antimicrobial agent in pediatric ICU.","Navya, P N; Dhananjaya, G; Chandra, Prakash",Journal of the Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry,342,22

Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus ( Te SADH) and from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ( Tb SADH) are well-known as robust catalysts. However, and like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This review discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune enantioselectivity of Te SADH and Tb SADH using site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, Te SADH has been used in quantitative non-stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to accomplish deracemization of alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.","Musa, Musa M; Vieille, Claire; Phillips, Robert S",Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,342,31

This is especially relevant in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery as substantial perioperative blood loss is possible, leading to a high rate of allogeneic blood transfusion in total hip replacements, total knee replacements, and hip fracture repairs. Significance The results of this systematic review may be of interest to clinicians and hospital administrators evaluating the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of intravenous (IV) iron administration prior to major orthopedic surgery. Materials and Methods The original studies considered for this review included patients who were over 18 years of age, undergoing major orthopedic surgery, and who received an IV iron treatment in the preoperative setting. A total of 1083 articles were identified and reviewed. After removing duplicates, 1031 publications were screened, and 105 full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. A total of 98 were excluded and 7 articles remained which met the criteria for this review. The primary outcome examined in the included studies was the allogeneic blood transfusion rate. The secondary areas of interest were changes in serum hemoglobin, morbidity and mortality, length of stay, and cost effectiveness. Results This systematic review found little evidence that IV iron therapy is effective at reducing transfusion in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Conclusions We do not recommend preoperative IV iron therapy for all patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery.","Smith, Aaron; Moon, Tiffany; Pak, Taylor; Park, Brian; Urman, Richard D",Geriatric orthopaedic surgery & rehabilitation,342,24

We hypothesized that safety syringes and needles could be used in outpatient orthopaedic injection and aspiration procedures. METHODS The study investigated the orthopaedic uses and procedural idiosyncrasies of safety-engineered devices, including (1) four safety needles (Eclipse, SafetyGlide, SurGuard, and Magellan), (2) a mechanical safety syringe (RPD), (3) two automatic retractable syringes (Integra, VanishPoint), (4) three manual retractable syringes (Procedur-SF, Baksnap, Invirosnap), and (5) three shielded syringes (Safety-Lok, Monoject, and Digitally Activated Shielded [DAS] Syringe). The devices were first tested ex vivo, and then 1300 devices were used for 425 subjects undergoing outpatient arthrocentesis, intra-articular injections, local anesthesia, aspiration biopsy, and ultrasound-guided procedures. RESULTS During the clinical observation, there were no accidental needlesticks (0 needlesticks per 1300 devices). Safety needles could be successfully used on a Luer syringe but were limited to ≤1.5 in (≤3.81 cm) in length and the shield could interfere with sonography. The mechanical safety syringes functioned well in all orthopaedic procedures. Automatic retractable syringes were too small for arthrocentesis of the knee, and the plunger blew out and prematurely collapsed with high-pressure injections. The manual retractable syringes and shielded syringes could be used with conventional needles for most orthopaedic procedures. CONCLUSIONS The most effective and reliable safety devices for orthopaedic syringe procedures are shielded safety needles, mechanical syringes, manual retractable syringes, and shielded syringes, but not automatic retractable syringes. Even when adopting safety-engineered devices for an orthopaedic clinic, conventional syringes larger than 20 mL and conventional needles longer than 1.5 in (3.8 cm) are necessary.","Sibbitt, Wilmer L; Band, Philip A; Kettwich, Lawrence G; Sibbitt, Cristina R; Sibbitt, Lori J; Bankhurst, Arthur D",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

COVID-19 outbreak may thus have profound indirect consequences on clinical presentation and management of patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Aim of this study was to assess clinical features of patients with STEMI during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This single-center, prospective study from a regional public service healthcare hub in Milan included all consecutive patients with STEMI admitted to our institute from February 21 to April 1, 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic). These patients were compared with a historical cohort of patients admitted for STEMI during the analogous time period (February 21 to April 1) in 2018 and 2019, in terms of time from symptoms onset to hospital admission, clinical characteristics, and in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS A total of 26 patients were admitted for STEMI during the study period, and 7 (26.9%) of these patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. On admission, medical therapy, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers use, was similar between cohorts. Median (interquartile range) time from symptoms onset to hospital admission was significantly longer in 2020 as compared to the historical cohort (15.0 [2.0-48.0] versus 2.0 [1.0-3.0] hours; P<0.01). A higher proportion of patients presenting with late presentation STEMI was observed in 2020 compared with the historical cohort (50.0% versus 4.8%; P<0.01). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention resulted indicated in 80.8% of patients in 2020 compared with 100% in the historical cohort (P=0.06). In-hospital death, thromboembolism, mechanical ventilation, or hemodynamic decompensation needing inotropic or mechanical support were similar between years. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results from a cardiovascular regional public service healthcare hub demonstrate a significantly longer time from symptoms onset to hospital admission among patients with STEMI during COVID-19 pandemic compared with the same time period in the previous 2 years.","Gramegna, Mario; Baldetti, Luca; Beneduce, Alessandro; Pannone, Luigi; Falasconi, Giulio; Calvo, Francesco; Pazzanese, Vittorio; Sacchi, Stefania; Pagnesi, Matteo; Moroni, Francesco; Ajello, Silvia; Melisurgo, Giulio; Agricola, Eustachio; Camici, Paolo G; Scandroglio, Anna Mara; Landoni, Giovanni; Ciceri, Fabio; Zangrillo, Alberto; Cappelletti, Alberto Maria",Circulation.

It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D-structures of key virous proteins are resolved. Taking the advantage of a recently released crystal structure of COVID-19 protease in complex with a covalently-bonded inhibitor, N3,1 I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an endpoint method called MM-PBSA-WSAS.2-4 Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 protease, including Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir and Elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anti-cancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, -13.82 kcal/mol. Streptomycin, an antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.82 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.92 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.86 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified. I found that one hotspot residue HIS41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including COVID-19, SARS, MERS, and HCV.

Their protein composition and gluten dependent technological traits have been comprehensively studied, however, little information is available about their carbohydrate dependent viscous properties. The aim of this work was the comprehensive rheological characterisation of all sublines of Bánkúti 1201 maintained at Martonvásár and to investigate their variability if the carbohydrate dependent viscous behaviour would be also included in the analyses. RESULTS The majority of the lines reflected the famously good mixing quality of Bánkúti, however, much higher diversity of pasting behaviour was detected. Cluster analysis of the Mixolab data was performed resulting four sample groups. Since several lines of similar mixing properties had significantly different pasting characteristics, it was assumed that classification was mainly based on the viscous properties. From each clusters 2-3 representative samples were selected for wider examination using conventional testing methods. These results also supported the higher variability of pasting behaviour of the lines, which can be critical for end product quality. The members of the second cluster can be highlighted due to their waxy wheat like behaviour. CONCLUSIONS Possible reasons of the great variability of pasting behaviour could be the compositional and structural differences of starch and other carbohydrates (e.g. arabinoxylans). Complex rheological characterisation and study of molecular background can provide information about important traits in the point of view of technology and product development, which are unknown in the case of old wheat varieties and landraces.

Furthermore, there is marked variability in peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion techniques and perioperative management within the United States. After the publication of best-demonstrated practices for peritoneal dialysis catheter placement, the utilization of peritoneal dialysis has increased significantly at our institution. We detail the long-term success of peritoneal dialysis catheter placement after the adoption of best-demonstrated practices. METHODS Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis catheter placement using the best-demonstrated practice technique from January 2005 through December 2015. Preoperative patient demographic information, intraoperative variables, 30-day morbidity and mortality, and long-term catheter durability outcomes were investigated. RESULTS A total of 457 patients met inclusion criteria. Four (0.9%) patients experienced an immediate postoperative complication requiring return to the operating room. There were no perioperative mortalities. A total of 298 (65.2%) patients were available for long-term follow-up; 221 (74.2%) patients are still alive, 76 (25.6%) patients are still undergoing peritoneal dialysis, 63 (21.1%) patients transitioned from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis, and 88 (29.5%) patients have undergone kidney transplantation. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival plots, 30% of patients will transition from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis after 5.5 years of peritoneal dialysis and the median time from commencing peritoneal dialysis to kidney transplantation is 5.6 years. CONCLUSION Based on our institutional data, the adoption of best-demonstrated practices should provide long-term and reliable access to the peritoneal cavity. We recommend the adoption of these techniques to facilitate long-term peritoneal dialysis catheter survival.","Haskins, Ivy N; Schreiber, Martin; Prabhu, Ajita S; Krpata, David M; Perez, Arielle J; Tastaldi, Luciano; Tu, Chao; Rosen, Michael J; Rosenblatt, Steven",Surgery,342,1

Intramuscular VMs (IVM), such as those in the masseter, can cause severe facial asymmetry and typically are excised transcutaneously to facilitate wide exposure and safe dissection from the facial nerve. This requires extensive dissection, prolonged healing, and can lead to suboptimal facial scarring. METHODS We describe the technique of resecting large IVMs of the masseter muscle in 3 patients using an entirely intraoral approach with continuous nerve monitoring and without visible facial scarring or secondary deformity. Preoperative injection of sclerotherapy was performed to reduce intra-operative bleeding and optimize resection. RESULTS Successful excision was performed without complication in 3 patients to date. Total average operating room time was 120 minutes (range 95-145 minutes). Estimated blood loss was 213 mL (range 180-240 mL). The patients were discharged home either post-operative day (POD) 1 or 2, with 1 returning to work POD 4. Facial nerve function was normal postoperatively and no hematomas developed. Subjective masticatory function was equivalent to preoperative levels in all patients. CONCLUSIONS Intraoral excision of VMs of the masseter muscle can be safely performed without added risk or complication. Continuous facial nerve monitoring allows minimally invasive approaches to be considered with less risk of iatrogenic facial nerve injury. We purport that this is a safe and effective method with substantially better esthetic outcomes compared with traditional transcutaneous approaches.","Schultz, Benjamin D; Gray, Rachel; Knobel, Denis; Tanna, Neil; Setabutr, Dhave; Cheng, Jeffrey A; Ortiz, Rafael; Bastidas, Nicholas",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,342,1

We assessed the early safety and technical success of a new version of PED, Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology (Pipeline Shield), which has the same design and configuration but has been modified to include a surface synthetic biocompatible polymer. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology (PFLEX) study is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study for the treatment of unruptured IAs using Pipeline Shield. The primary study endpoints included the occurrence of major stroke in the territory supplied by the treated artery or neurologic death at 1 year post-procedure. Secondary endpoints included the rate of Pipeline Shield-related or procedure-related serious or non-serious adverse events. Analyses were conducted to evaluate early safety findings in the 30-day post-procedure period as well as technical procedural success outcomes. RESULTS Fifty patients with 50 unruptured target IAs were enrolled. Mean aneurysm diameter was 8.82±6.15 mm. Thirty-eight aneurysms (76%) were small (<10 mm). Device deployment was technically successful with 98% of devices. Complete wall apposition was achieved immediately post-procedure in 48 cases (96%). No major strokes or neurologic deaths were reported in the 30-day post-procedure period. CONCLUSIONS The results of this first experience with the new Pipeline Flex corroborate the early safety of the device.

Problems with SOD are considered to be a key feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, empirical studies on SOD in BPD are scarce. Here, we present a study providing preliminary support for the usefulness and validity of a self-other facial morphing task to capture the capacity for SOD in a sample of nonclinical participants high (n = 30) and low (n = 32) in BPD features. Participants had to watch a video sequence in which their own face was gradually morphed into the face of an unfamiliar other (self-to-other) or vice versa (other-to-self), requiring them to indicate at which point they judged the morph to look more like the target face than the starting face. Consistent with predictions, results showed that participants in the high-BPD group judged the morph to look like themselves for longer in the self-to-other direction (suggestive of egocentric bias), but only with a relatively more attractive target face. In the other-to-self direction, the high-BPD group had more difficulty recognizing their own face (i.e., an altercentric bias), but this time only with the relatively less attractive face. Further research is needed to replicate these findings in clinical samples, but overall they suggest that the current task might be suited to investigate SOD problems in BPD.

The two catalytic domains of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a type I integral membrane protein, catalyze the sequential reactions that convert peptidyl-Gly substrates into amidated products. We explored the hypothesis that a conserved His-rich cluster (His-Gly-His-His) in the linker region connecting its two catalytic domains senses pH and affects PAM trafficking by mutating these His residues to Ala (Ala-Gly-Ala-Ala; H3A). Purified recombinant wild-type and H3A linker peptides were examined using circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence; mutation of the His cluster largely eliminated its pH sensitivity. An enzymatically active PAM protein with the same mutations (PAM-1/H3A) was expressed in HEK293 cells and AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells. Metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation revealed more rapid loss of newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A than PAM-1; although release of newly synthesized monofunctional PHM/H3A was increased, release of soluble bifunctional PAM/H3A, a product of the endocytic pathway, was decreased. Surface biotinylation revealed rapid loss of PAM-1/H3A, with no detectable return of the mutant protein to secretory granules. Consistent with its altered endocytic trafficking, little PAM-1/H3A was subjected to regulated intramembrane proteolysis followed by release of a small nuclear-targeted cytosolic fragment. AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A adopted the morphology of wild-type AtT-20 cells; secretory products no longer accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and secretory granule exocytosis was more responsive to secretagogue.","Vishwanatha, Kurutihalli; Bäck, Nils; Mains, Richard E; Eipper, Betty A",The Journal of biological chemistry,342,2

METHODS The pCR individuals who received different ACT cycles were paired by propensity score matching. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. RESULTS In total, 1041 pCR individuals were identified from 5567 LARC cases. Specifically, 303 pCR cases had no ACT treatment, and 738 pCR patients received fluoropyrimidine-based ACT (median, 4 cycles) treatment. After 1:3 propensity score matching, 297 cases without ACT treatment were matched to 712 cases who received ACT treatment. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that pCR individuals treated with or without ACT had the similar 3-year outcome (OS, DFS, LRFS and DMFS) (all P > 0.05). Moreover, the pCR patients received different ACT cycle(s) (0 vs. 1-4 cycles, 0 vs. ≥5 cycles) had comparable 3-year OS, DFS, LRFS and DMFS (all P > 0.05). In stratified analysis, ACT treatment did not improve 3-year survival (OS, DFS, LRFS and DMFS) for the baseline high-risk (cT3-4/cN1-2) subgroup patients (all P > 0.05).

However, the mechanisms of phosphorylation-based signaling networks during mild early-life stress remain elusive. Herein, we systematically analyzed the phosphoproteomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, which were treated with three mild temperatures (15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C) in two different short-term groups (10 min and 60 min). By utilizing an iTRAQ-based quantitative phosphoproteomic approach, 18,187 phosphosites from 3330 phosphoproteins were detected in this study. Volcano plots illustrated that the phosphorylation abundance of 374 proteins and 347 proteins, were significantly changed at 15 °C and 25 °C, respectively. Gene ontology, KEGG pathway and protein-protein interaction network analyses revealed that these phosphoproteins were primarily associated with metabolism, translation, development, and lifespan determination. A motif analysis of kinase substrates suggested that MAPK, CK, and CAMK were most likely involved in the adaption processes. Moreover, 16 and 14 aging-regulated proteins were found to undergo phosphorylation modifications under the mild stresses of 15 °C and 25 °C, respectively, indicating that these proteins might be important for maintaining long-term health. Further lifespan experiments confirmed that the candidate phosphoproteins, e.g., EGL-27 and XNP-1 modulated longevity at 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C, and they showed increased tolerance to thermal and oxidative stresses. In conclusion, our findings offered data that supports understanding of the phosphorylation mechanisms involved in mild early-life stresses in C. elegans.

Thirty-eight of the 68 (56%) ears had no microbial growth from neither the EEC nor ME; seven (10%) had bacteria isolated from the EEC only; 17 (25%) had bacteria isolated from the ME only, and six (8%) had bacteria isolated from both EEC and ME. Thirty-four total bacterial isolates were cultured from ME. The most common bacterial species isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Otic cytology identified coccoid organisms in only three of 68 EEC and four of 69 ME. CONCLUSIONS The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of PSOM in CKCS is unclear. The majority of the EEC and ME of the CKCS with PSOM were negative by conventional bacterial culture and the cytological presence of bacteria was not correlated with culture positives. The potential role of noncultivable microbiota in PSOM requires exploration using molecular methods.","Cole, Lynette K; Rajala-Schultz, Päivi J; Lorch, Gwendolen; Daniels, Joshua B",Veterinary dermatology,342,20

However, little is known about how Tregs contribute to immune regulation during memory responses to previously encountered pathogens. In this study, we used MHC class II tetramers specific for the 311-325 peptide from influenza nucleoprotein (NP311-325/IA(b)) to track the Ag-specific Treg response to primary and secondary influenza virus infections. During secondary infections, Ag-specific memory Tregs showed accelerated accumulation in the lung-draining lymph node and lung parenchyma relative to a primary infection. Memory Tregs effectively controlled the in vitro proliferation of memory CD8(+) cells in an Ag-specific fashion that was MHC class II dependent. When memory Tregs were depleted before secondary infection, the magnitude of the Ag-specific memory CD8(+) T cell response was increased, as was pulmonary inflammation and airway cytokine/chemokine expression. Replacement of memory Tregs with naive Tregs failed to restore the regulation of the memory CD8 T cell response during secondary infection. Together, these data demonstrate the existence of a previously undescribed population of Ag-specific memory Tregs that shape the cellular immune response to secondary influenza virus challenges and offer an additional parameter to consider when determining the efficacy of vaccinations.","Brincks, Erik L; Roberts, Alan D; Cookenham, Tres; Sell, Stewart; Kohlmeier, Jacob E; Blackman, Marcia A; Woodland, David L",Journal of immunology,342,1

METHODS In this prospective, observational, and comparative study, 40 acromegaly patients and 40 healthy control participants were included. Serum IGF-1 levels and disease duration of all patients were noted. Macular layers and angiography scanning was performed with a Zeiss Cirrus 5000 OCTA system. Macular thickness, RNFL, and GC-IPL values were obtained. For central vessel and perfusion density, central 6 mm was obtained and was evaluated by dividing into three groups (inner, outer, full). FAZ parameters were evaluated dividing into three groups (area, perimeter, circularity index). Analysis of the data was performed with the SPSS for Windows. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the patient group and the control group in terms of age, gender, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), intraocular pressure (IOP), and axial length (AL). The mean follow-up period after diagnosis was 11.0 ± 5.5 years. Central and mean macular thicknesses were also significantly higher in the acromegaly group (p < 0.05). Superior, inferior, and average RNFL thicknesses were also significantly thinner in the acromegaly group (p < 0.05). When OCTA parameters were compared between groups, there was a significant decrease in central vessel density (CVD) and central perfusion density (CPD) values in all regions in acromegaly group compared with controls (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Our findings with OCTA show that acromegaly causes a significant capillary network decrease according to the healthy subjects.","Akay, Fahrettin; Akmaz, Berkay; Işik, Mehmed Uğur; Güven, Yusuf Ziya; Örük, Güzide Gonca",Eye,342,19

Therefore, in this study, we fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) nano-popcorn plasmonic substrate using the surface energy difference between a perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT) spacer and the Au layer. This energy difference led to Au nanoparticle self-assembly; neighboring nanoparticles then created multiple hotspots on the substrate. The localized surface plasmon effects at the hot spots dramatically enhanced the incident field. Quantitative evaluation of A/H1N1 virus was achieved using the decrease of Raman peak intensity resulting from the release of Cy3-labeled aptamer DNAs from nano-popcorn substrate surfaces via the interaction between the aptamer DNA and A/H1N1 virus. The use of a Raman imaging technique involving the fast mapping of all pixel points enabled the reproducible quantification of A/H1N1 virus on nano-popcorn substrates. Average ensemble effects obtained by averaging all randomly distributed hot spots mapped on the substrate made it possible to reliably quantify target viruses. The SERS-based imaging aptasensor platform proposed in this work overcomes the issues inherent in conventional approaches (the time-consuming and labor-intensiveness of RT-PCR and low sensitivity and quantitative analysis limits of lateral flow assay kits). Our SERS-based assay for detecting A/H1N1 virus had an estimated limit of detection of 97 PFU mL-1 (approximately three orders of magnitude more sensitive than that determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and the approximate assay time was estimated to be 20 min. Thus, this approach provides an ultrasensitive, reliable platform for detecting viral pathogens.","Chen, Hao; Park, Sung-Gyu; Choi, Namhyun; Moon, Joung-Il; Dang, Hajun; Das, Anupam; Lee, Seunghun; Kim, Do-Geun; Chen, Lingxin; Choo, Jaebum",Biosensors & bioelectronics,342,31

However, virus recovered from the 80th passage of the persistently infected HeLa-H cells (HeLa-H-EAVP80) readily established persistent infection in HeLa-L cells. Comparative sequence analysis of the entire genomes of the VB and HeLa-H-EAVP80 viruses identified 16 amino acid substitutions, including 4 in the replicase (nsp1, nsp2, nsp7, and nsp9) and 12 in the structural proteins (E, GP2, GP3, GP4, and GP5). Reverse genetic studies clearly showed that substitutions in the structural proteins but not the replicase were responsible for the establishment of persistent infection in HeLa-L cells by the HeLa-H-EAVP80 virus. It was further demonstrated that recombinant viruses with substitutions in the minor structural proteins E and GP2 or GP3 and GP4 were unable to establish persistent infection in HeLa-L cells but that recombinant viruses with combined substitutions in the E (Ser53-->Cys and Val55-->Ala), GP2 (Leu15-->Ser, Trp31-->Arg, Val87-->Leu, and Ala112-->Thr), GP3 (Ser115-->Gly and Leu135-->Pro), and GP4 (Tyr4-->His and Ile109-->Phe) proteins or with a single point mutation in the GP5 protein (Pro98-->Leu) were able to establish persistent infection in HeLa-L cells.

Although differential display RT-PCR can be labour-intensive, it has its own merits over those of DNA microarray. While the latter usually consists of a well-defined set of species-specific genes, differential display RT-PCR allows the investigation of host-microbe interactions without bias towards any mRNA transcripts. This means that the regulated transcript expression of both host and pathogen can be analysed simultaneously. In addition, novel transcripts and alternate splicing variants pertaining to the infection can also be discovered. We have investigated the response of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to infection with a neurovirulent strain of enterovirus 71 (EV71) at different time-points during the infection process compared with uninfected cells. Using differential display RT-PCR, we identified mRNAs that were up- or down-regulated. Less than half of the clones match known genes including those involved in mediating the cytoskeleton, cell cycle, cell death, protein translational machinery and cellular transport. The rest of the clones do not match any known genes, of which several are novel genes. Noteworthy is the discovery of an alternate splicing form of TRIP7, which is down-regulated during EV71 infection. The differential display technique has potentially wide applicability to elucidate the gene expression or transcriptomic profiles of host-microbe interactions, which can provide a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis.","Fook, Leong Wai; Chow, Vincent T K",Methods in molecular biology,342,24

Prokinetic drugs may improve reflux symptoms by enhancing oesophageal motility and gastric emptying. AIM To evaluate the effect of revexepride, a novel prokinetic 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 (5-HT4 ) receptor agonist, compared with placebo, in patients with GERD who have a partial response to PPIs. METHODS A phase 2b, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted, in which patients were randomised to one of three revexepride treatment groups (0.1, 0.5 and 2.0 mg three times daily) or placebo (1:1:1:1 ratio). Daily e-diary data captured patients' symptoms over an 8-week treatment period. The primary efficacy outcome was the weekly percentage of regurgitation-free days in the second half of the study (weeks 5-8). RESULTS In total, 480 patients were randomised and 477 received treatment (mean age 47.9 years; 61% women). The mean percentage of regurgitation-free days increased from baseline (range, 15.0-18.8%) to week 8 (62.3-70.5%) in all four study arms; however, there were no statistically significant differences in this change between placebo and the three treatment arms. No dose-dependent relationship in treatment effect was observed for any of the study endpoints. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was revexepride dose-dependent.

They utilize the spike (S) glycoprotein anchored in the viral envelope to mediate host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes to initiate infection. The S protein is a major determinant of the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses and is also the main target of the host humoral immune response. We report here the 3.5-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S glycoprotein trimer from the pathogenic porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), which belongs to the recently identified Deltacoronavirus genus. Structural and glycoproteomics data indicate that the glycans of PDCoV S are topologically conserved compared with the human respiratory coronavirus NL63 S, resulting in similar surface areas being shielded from neutralizing antibodies and implying that both viruses are under comparable immune pressure in their respective hosts. The structure further reveals a shortened S2' activation loop, containing a reduced number of basic amino acids, which participates in rendering the spike largely protease resistant. This property distinguishes PDCoV S from recently characterized betacoronavirus S proteins and suggests that the S protein of enterotropic PDCoV has evolved to tolerate the protease-rich environment of the small intestine and to fine-tune its fusion activation to avoid premature triggering and reduction of infectivity.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses use transmembrane S glycoprotein trimers to promote host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. We determined a near-atomic-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S ectodomain trimer from the pathogenic PDCoV, which is responsible for diarrhea in piglets and has had devastating consequences for the swine industry worldwide. Structural and glycoproteomics data reveal that PDCoV S is decorated with 78 N-linked glycans obstructing the protein surface to limit accessibility to neutralizing antibodies in a way reminiscent of what has recently been described for a human respiratory coronavirus. PDCoV S is largely protease resistant, which distinguishes it from most other characterized coronavirus S glycoproteins and suggests that enteric coronaviruses have evolved to fine-tune fusion activation in the protease-rich environment of the small intestine of infected hosts.","Xiong, Xiaoli; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Snijder, Joost; Yoshioka, Craig; Walls, Alexandra C; Li, Wentao; McGuire, Andrew T; Rey, Félix A; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Veesler, David",Journal of virology,342,17

However, the magnitude of this effect in individual muscles has not been investigated. Thus the aim of this study was to compare the oxygenation of paralyzed versus non-paralyzed forearm muscle under tourniquet-provoked ischemia. METHODS After ethics approval and written informed consent, 30 patients scheduled for elective hand and wrist surgery were included. Ischemia was provoked by inflation of bilateral upper arm tourniquets and muscle relaxation was achieved via intravenous administration of rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg. Bilateral tourniquets were applied to both upper arms before induction of anesthesia and near infrared spectrometry (NIRS) electrodes applied on both forearms. Muscular ischemia in an isolated (= non-paralyzed, NP) as well as a paralyzed forearm (P) was created by sequential inflation of both tourniquets before and after intravenous administration of rocuronium. Muscle oxygen saturations (SmO2) of NIRS in both forearms and their changes were determined and compared. RESULTS Data of 30 patients (15 male, 15 female; 41.8 ± 14.7 years) were analyzed. The speed of SmO2 decrease (50% decrease of SmO2 from baseline (median [percentiles]: NP 210 s [180/480s] vs. P 180 [180/300]) as well as the maximum decrease in SmO2 (minimum SmO2 in % (median [percentiles]: NP 20 [19/24] vs. P 21 [19/28]) were not significantly affected by neuromuscular paralysis.

Protease p29, derived from the N-terminal portion of ORF A, functions as a suppressor of RNA silencing, while protease p48, derived from the N-terminal portion of ORF B, is required for viral RNA replication. The catalytic and cleavage site residues required for autoproteolytic processing have been functionally mapped in vitro for both proteases but not confirmed in the infected fungal host. We report here the mutagenesis of the CHV-1/EP713 infectious cDNA clone to define the requirements for p29 and p48 cleavage and the role of autoproteolysis in the context of hypovirus replication. Mutation of the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues for either p29 or p48 was tolerated but reduced viral RNA accumulation to ca. 20 to 50% of the wild-type level. Mutation of the p29 catalytic residues caused an accumulation of unprocessed ORF A product p69. Surprisingly, the release of p48 from the ORF B-encoded polyprotein was not prevented by mutation of the p48 catalytic and cleavage site residues and was independent of p29. The results show that, while dispensable for hypovirus replication, the autocatalytic processing of the leader proteases p29 and p48 contributes to optimal virus RNA accumulation. The role of the predicted catalytic residues in autoproteolytic processing of p29 was confirmed in the infected host, while p48 was found to also undergo alternative processing independent of the encoded papain-like protease activities. Importance: Hypoviruses are positive-strand RNA mycoviruses that attenuate virulence of their pathogenic fungal hosts. The prototypic hypovirus CHV-1/EP713, which infects the chestnut bight fungus Cryphonetria parasitica, encodes two papain-like autocatalytic leader proteases, p29 and p48, that also have important functions in suppressing the RNA silencing antiviral defense response and in viral RNA replication, respectively. The mutational analyses of the CHV-1/EP713 infectious cDNA clone, reported here, define the requirements for p29 and p48 cleavage and the functional importance of autoproteolysis in the context of hypovirus replication and exposed an alternative p48 processing pathway independent of the encoded papain-like protease activities.

Additionally, the ability to characterize the CA125 proteoforms expressed by individuals may offer clinical insight. Enrichment of CA125 from malignant ascites may provide a high-quality source of this important ovarian cancer biomarker, but a reliable strategy for such enrichment is currently lacking. Beginning with crude ascites isolated from three individual patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer, we enriched for MUC16 using filtration, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography and then performed bottom-up proteomics on the isolated proteins. This approach of enrichment and analysis reveals that the peptides detected via mass spectrometry map to the SEA domain and C-loop regions within the tandem repeat domains of CA125 and that peptide abundance correlates with clinical CA125 counts.","Schuster-Little, Naviya; Fritz-Klaus, Roberta; Etzel, Mark; Patankar, Niharika; Javeri, Saahil; Patankar, Manish S; Whelan, Rebecca J",The Analyst,342,33

The infection has systemic effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems; thus, patients can present a variety of symptoms from asymptomatic to rapid deaths. In this paper, we present the first case of post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing in Western part of Romania in a deceased with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and elevated D-dimer levels. METHODS During the autopsy which took place at the Institute of Forensic Medicine from Timisoara, Romania, blood sample was collected in a vacutainer with EDTA and sent to the Laboratory of Forensic Genetics from Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania. Viral RNA extraction was performed automated on the Maxwell 48 RSC Extraction System (Promega, USA) using the Maxwell RSC Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification kit (Promega, USA). After RNA extraction, the samples were amplified on a 7500 real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, USA) using the genesig® Real-Time PCR Assay (Primer Design, UK). RESULTS The molecular testing showed a cycle threshold value of 23.4 (1.2 x 106 copies/mL), indicating increased viral loads, which correlated with the laboratory analysis results, especially with D-dimer levels. CONCLUSIONS In cases of coagulopathy of SARS-CoV-2, patients in hospitals should be monitored closely for thrombosis development. Thus D-dimer can be used as prognostic marker in monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","Dumache, Raluca; Daescu, Ecaterina; Ciocan, Veronica; Mureşan, Camelia; Talida, Cut; Gavrilita, Denisa; Enache, Alexandra",Clinical laboratory,342,5

We hypothesized that age at transplantation and the presence of congenital heart disease would be risk factors for emergent PICU admission, and these factors plus development of septicemia would increase morbidity and mortality. DESIGN Retrospective review. SETTING Academic medical-surgical PICU. PATIENTS All infants with complete DiGeorge anomaly treated with thymus transplantation between January 1, 1993, and July 1, 2010. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Consent was obtained from 71 infants with complete DiGeorge anomaly for thymus transplantation, and 59 infants were transplanted. Median age at transplantation was 5.0 months (range, 1.1-22.1 mo). After transplantation, 12 of 59 infants (20%) required 25 emergent PICU admissions. Seven of 12 infants (58%) survived to PICU discharge with six surviving 6 months posttransplantation. Forty-two of 59 infants (71%) transplanted had congenital heart disease, and 9 of 12 (75%) who were admitted to the PICU had congenital heart disease. In 15 of 25 admissions (60%), intubation and mechanical ventilation were necessary. There was no difference between median ventilation-free days between infants with and without congenital heart disease (33 d vs 23 d, p = 0.544). There was also no correlation between ventilation-free days and age of transplantation (R, 0.17; p = 0.423). Age at transplantation and the presence of congenital heart disease were not associated with risk for PICU admission (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.15 and odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.30-5.49, respectively) or PICU mortality (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.73-1.31 and odds ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.15-1.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Most transplanted infants did not require emergent PICU admission.

We aimed to conduct a contemporary, nationwide study of the temporal changes in incidence of IE. Methods We included all Danish cases of first-time IE (1997-2017) using nationwide registries. Patients were grouped into three seven-year intervals (1997-2003, 2004-2010, 2011-2017). Crude annual incidence rates (IR) per 100,000 person-years (PY) were examined overall and per subgroups: age, sex, patients without prior prosthetic heart valve or a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED). Results We identified 8675 patients with IE. Over time, patients were older at diagnosis with a median age of 66.2 years (interquartile range, IQR: 51.5-76.5) and 72.2 years (IQR 62.2-79.9) in 1997-2003 and 2011-2017, respectively. The overall IR increased from 5.0/100,000 PY (95% CI: 4.4-5.6) to 10.5/100,000 PY (95% CI: 9.6-11.3) from 1997 to 2017. IR for patients without prior prosthetic heart valve or a CIED increased from 4.9/100,000 PY (95% CI: 4.3-5.5) to 6.4/100,000 PY (95% CI: 5.8-7.1) (P ≤ 0.0001 for interaction). The IR in males increased from 5.6/100,000 PY (95% CI: 4.7-6.5) to 14.2/100,000 PY (95% CI: 12.9-15.6). The IR in females increased from 4.3/100,000 PY (95% CI: 3.6-5.2) to 6.7/100,000 PY (95% CI: 5.8-7.7), and the IR for patients ≥80 years increased eight-fold from 1997 to 2017.

Long-term delivery of protein- and peptide- therapeutics requires polymeric encapsulation to protect from degradation and for its sustained release. However, results from encapsulation of protein macromolecules in dynamic delivery systems report unreliable clinical outcome, indicating ease of degradation, low permeability and serious immune responses. A specifically targeted delivery system as tumor or cancer theranostics may surpass these limitations. Areas covered: This review covers recent advancements in approaches involving conjugated protein nano-formulations as targeting delivery technology for various ailments encompassing mostly cancer treatment options. Progressions in targeted chemotherapeutics, protein nanoparticles, peptide nanoparticles, lipidation and antibody drug-conjugates are discussed. Expert opinion: Significant expansion have been made in forming new generation of antitumor-recombinant proteins, which proves a milestone of advancements for more potent and explicit cancer therapies. However, transformation of biologics from laboratory to clinical trials is an immense challenge, because of drop in efficiency of drug-loading, poor reproducibility of nanoparticles, inadequate information regarding long term toxicity and insufficient pharmacokinetics data. Hence, early stage tumor diagnosis with précised drug delivery to tumor site is crucial for protein- and peptide- based therapeutics for cancer.","Sikder, Sadia; Gote, Vrinda; Alshamrani, Meshal; Sicotte, Jeff; Pal, Dhananjay",Expert opinion on drug delivery,342,31

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine clinician confidence in telemedicine-based eye care services during COVID-19. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was sent to clinicians at University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center (April 17, 2020-May 6, 2020) when nonemergent in-person visits and procedures were restricted. The primary outcome was clinician confidence in using telemedicine-based eye care during COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included telemedicine utilization and its association with clinician confidence using Fisher's exact test. Results: Of the 88 respondents (90.7% response rate; n = 97 total), 83.0% (n = 73) were ophthalmologists and 17.0% (n = 15) were optometrists. Telemedicine utilization increased from 30.7% (n = 27) before the pandemic to 86.2% (n = 75) after the pandemic. Clinicians' confidence in their ability to use telemedicine varied with 28.6% (24/84) feeling confident/extremely confident, 38.1% (32/84) somewhat confident, and 33.3% (28/84) not-at-all confident. Most felt that telemedicine was underutilized (62.1%; 54/87) and planned continued use over the next year (59.8%; 52/87). Confident respondents were more likely to have performed three or more telemedicine visits (p = 0.003), to believe telemedicine was underutilized (p < 0.001), and to anticipate continued use of telemedicine (p = 0.009). Discussion: The majority of clinicians were at least somewhat confident about using telemedicine during the pandemic.

This study investigated the extent to which FES pass rates differ in a specific sample of individuals who have chosen a career in GI surgery and to examine the relationships between FES performance and confidence in performing flexible endoscopy. METHODS Fellows attending the 2016 SAGES Flexible Endoscopy Course were invited to complete the FES manual skills examination. Participants also provided survey responses examining demographics, fellowship type, endoscopy curricula in residency, previous endoscopic case volume, confidence in performing endoscopy, and future practice plans. RESULTS Twenty-nine (age: 32.24 ± 3.24; 72% men) fellows completed the FES skills examination. Reported fellowships were MIS/Bariatric (41.4%), MIS (24.1%), bariatric (13.8%), flexible endoscopy (6.9%), Advanced GI (6.9%), and MIS/bariatric/flexible endoscopy (6.9%). Almost half (41.4%) had previously participated in a simulation curricula, with 20.7% completing a didactic endoscopy curriculum. Fellows reported performing an average of 110 ± 109.48 EGDs and 77.44 ± 58.80 colonoscopies. The majority (96.4%) indicated that they will perform endoscopy at least occasionally in practice. Overall pass rate was 60%. Previous endoscopy experience did not correlate with overall FES examination scores. However, confidence performing EGDs (r = 0.57, p < 0.01), colonoscopies (r = 0.45, p < 0.05), polypectomy (r = 0.52, p < 0.01), and PEGs (r = 0.46, p < 0.05) did. CONCLUSIONS These data support existing research suggesting that current flexible endoscopy training in residency may be insufficient for trainees to pass the FES examination, and that failure rates hold true even for this select group of trainees who have chosen a profession in GI surgery and intend to use endoscopy in practice.","Gardner, Aimee K; Ujiki, Michael B; Dunkin, Brian J",Surgical endoscopy,342,1

The publication rates in the dermatology literature have not yet been described. We performed an analysis of the dermatology literature from 1980-2020 to characterize LGBTQ-relevant publication rates and themes over time. PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched using terminology related to sexual and gender minorities and dermatology. Articles were included if they were published in a peer-reviewed dermatology journal, used human subjects, and included terminology related to sexual or gender minorities in the title or abstract. Publication year, journal, study design, corresponding author country, and best-fit article theme were recorded. The searches yielded 2,019 articles, with 225 meeting inclusion criteria. LGBTQ-relevant articles increased substantially over time, particularly between 2015 and 2020. Overall, most centered on HIV and other infectious diseases (62.2%), followed by other dermatologic conditions (20.4%), workforce and culturally competent care (12.4%), and gender-affirming procedures (4.9%). Although the number of infectious disease-related articles also increased over time, representation of the other three themes increased substantially, particularly since 2011.

Chemogenomic analysis requires large amounts of data and both powerful computational algorithms and computers. Data used for chemogenomics analysis can either be compiled from open sources, or they can be produced in-house as is often done in the pharmaceutical industry. The chemogenomic modeller often has to resort to mixing activity values from different laboratories and even assay types to facilitate chemogenomic analysis. The amount of chemogenomics data available in the public domain has dramatically increased in recent years, allowing fully traceable analysis on a continuously increasing scale. However, some warning flags about the data quality have been raised and because the primary data determine the accuracy of chemogenomic analysis, the quality of the data is one of the key questions in chemogenomics. This mini-review discusses some of the most common issues with public domain biological data related to chemogenomic analysis. The errors in data can originate from problems with the experiments themselves and their interpretation, or from more mundane issues such as data extraction and annotation. These issues are not unique for a certain database but are shared by all the public domain databases and can plague commercial and in-house bioactivity databases as well.","Kalliokoski, Tuomo; Kramer, Christian; Vulpetti, Anna",Molecular informatics,342,6

Objective To determine the driving impairment caused by vaporized cannabis containing Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD. Design, Setting, and Participants A double-blind, within-participants, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University in the Netherlands between May 20, 2019, and March 27, 2020. Participants (N = 26) were healthy occasional users of cannabis. Interventions Participants vaporized THC-dominant, CBD-dominant, THC/CBD-equivalent, and placebo cannabis. THC and CBD doses were 13.75 mg. Order of conditions was randomized and balanced. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP; a measure of lane weaving) during 100 km, on-road driving tests that commenced at 40 minutes and 240 minutes after cannabis consumption. At a calibrated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.02%, SDLP was increased relative to placebo by 1.12 cm, and at a calibrated BAC of 0.05%, SDLP was increased relative to placebo by 2.4 cm. Results Among 26 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 23.2 [2.6] years; 16 women), 22 (85%) completed all 8 driving tests. At 40 to 100 minutes following consumption, the SDLP was 18.21 cm with CBD-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm with THC-dominant cannabis, 21.09 cm with THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and 18.28 cm with placebo cannabis. SDLP was significantly increased by THC-dominant cannabis (+2.33 cm [95% CI, 0.80 to 3.86]; P < .001) and THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis (+2.83 cm [95% CI, 1.28 to 4.39]; P < .001) but not CBD-dominant cannabis (-0.05 cm [95% CI, -1.49 to 1.39]; P > .99), relative to placebo. At 240 to 300 minutes following consumption, the SDLP was 19.03 cm with CBD-dominant cannabis, 19.88 cm with THC-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm with THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and 19.37 cm with placebo cannabis. The SDLP did not differ significantly in the CBD (-0.34 cm [95% CI, -1.77 to 1.10]; P > .99), THC (0.51 cm [95% CI, -1.01 to 2.02]; P > .99) or THC/CBD (1.22 cm [95% CI, -0.29 to 2.72]; P = .20) conditions, relative to placebo. Out of 188 test drives, 16 (8.5%) were terminated due to safety concerns. Conclusions and Relevance In a crossover clinical trial that assessed driving performance during on-road driving tests, the SDLP following vaporized THC-dominant and THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis compared with placebo was significantly greater at 40 to 100 minutes but not 240 to 300 minutes after vaporization; there were no significant differences between CBD-dominant cannabis and placebo. However, the effect size for CBD-dominant cannabis may not have excluded clinically important impairment, and the doses tested may not represent common usage.

The HydroCoil Embolization System (HES) was developed to increase volumetric filling within the aneurysm sac to maintain long term occlusion. To further enhance ease of HES deployment, a new next generation embolic coil, the HydroFill coil, was developed. OBJECTIVE To report the first clinical experience with the HydroFill coil, focusing on safety and effectiveness, with immediate and long term follow-up on cases performed at a single institution by a single operator. METHODS Retrospective angiographic and clinical analysis was performed on a non-randomized single arm registry of the first consecutive 11 patients with 14 intracranial saccular aneurysms treated during a 9 month period. RESULTS The immediate angiographic occlusion rate according to the Raymond scale was 100%. Overall packing density of all coils used was 13-135% (mean 64%). The immediate complication rate was 9% (1/11 patients), secondary to a parent vessel occlusion which resolved after intravenous administration of eptifibatide (Integrilin) without neurological sequelae. The angiographic/MR angiography follow-up period for this series was 13-30 months, with an overall complete occlusion rate of 86% (12/14 aneurysms). 2/14 aneurysms (14%) converted from complete occlusion to filling of small neck remnants. Of the two, one (7%) was a cavernous aneurysm that was retreated. CONCLUSIONS Although this initial case series is small, this study demonstrates safe deployment of the HydroFill coil in ruptured and unruptured aneurysms without major complications, and with a high rate of occlusion on long term follow-up.","Speirs, John W D; Burke, Thomas H; Lee, Stefanie Y; Ala, Brigitte D",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,342,11

Most prior studies on this topic are however limited by non-random sampling, lack of information on non-respondents, and self-reported diagnoses. Here, we aimed at overcoming these limitations by means of random sampling in a population of clinically diagnosed patients, acquisition of clinical and socio-demographic data on non-respondents, and weighting of results informed by attrition.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based online survey inviting six-thousand randomly drawn patients from the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region. They survey data were merged with sociodemographic- and clinical data from medical records on all invitees, which enabled analysis of attrition and weighting of results. The questionnaire included the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating the perceived severity of symptoms during the four-week nationwide lockdown of Denmark in March/April 2020 – using the pre-pandemic period as reference. Reasons for worsening or improvement in mental health during lockdown were also reported.ResultsThe preliminary results are as follows: The response rate was ≈20%. Approximately half the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during lockdown, while the other half reported either no change (≈33%) or improvement (≈16%). The most commonly reported reasons for deterioration in mental health were disruption of routines and loneliness.ConclusionThe final results will be shown at the conference.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Østergaard, S.; Kølbæk, P.; Speed, M.; Jefsen, O.",European Psychiatry,342,1

UV-C-based disinfection products for mobile phones, food packaging, face masks and personal protective equipment (PPE), and other everyday objects are available in popular electronic-commerce platforms as consumer products. Product designers from multinational to startup companies began to design UV-C disinfection products but had no prior-art reference, user feedback, or validation of product efficacy, which are important stages in product design. A UV-C disinfection product cannot be assessed by most consumers for its viricidal efficacy. Many firms entered the domain of UV-C products and were unaware of the necessary validation requirements. Lack of availability and access to virology laboratories, due to lockdowns in countries, and lack of standards and certification for UV-C disinfection products limited product designers and firms in benchmarking their UV-C-based devices before market release. This work evaluates two UV-C disinfection devices for viricidal efficacy on PPE fabric and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 respirators through controlled experiments using the H1N1 virus, which is enveloped and is transmitted via the respiratory route similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19. The experiment also evaluated the effectiveness of chemical disinfectants along with and versus UV-C disinfection. Experiments for material selection, UV dose calculation, and UV endurance of PPE samples to be disinfected are also discussed. The outcome of this work establishes a systematic method to validate the efficacy of UV-C disinfection products.

These proteins also play a significant role in determining the shape and size of the newly formed virus particles. The lipid membrane and the embedded proteins affect each other in non-trivial ways during the course of the viral life cycle. Unravelling the nature of the protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, under various environmental and physiological conditions, could therefore prove to be crucial in development of therapeutics. Here, we study the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the effect of temperature on the properties of the protein-membrane system. The membrane embedded dimeric M proteins were studied using atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures ranging between 10 and 50 °C. While temperature induced fluctuations should be monotonic, we observe a steady rise in the protein dynamics up to 40 °C, beyond which it surprisingly reverts back to the low temperature behaviour. Detailed investigation reveals disordering of the membrane lipids in the presence of the protein, which induces additional curvature around the transmembrane region. Coarse-grained simulations indicate temperature dependent aggregation of M protein dimers. Our study clearly indicates that the dynamics of membrane lipids and integral M protein of SARS-CoV-2 enables it to better associate and aggregate only at a certain temperature range (i.e., ~30 to 40 °C). This can have important implications in the protein aggregation and subsequent viral budding/fission processes.","Rath, Soumya Lipsa; Tripathy, Madhusmita; Mandal, Nabanita",bioRxiv,342,16

However, the sector is facing challenges of a sluggish economy, need for reform and negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper strives to assess how well the government thus far has responded to the challenges in the financial sector. The working hypothesis is that the insurance industry has improved its position, resulting in higher efficiency and profitability and lower risk. This is an industry historically plagued by too many players, financial issues and less than adequate controls. The analysis undertaken bears out the hypothesis, as revealed by the enhanced contribution made by the industry since the pandemic. Analysis suggests that strides have been made in that industry in terms of helping to diversify the economy with the onset of the pandemic. Moreover, evidence is provided that the sensitivity to changes in oil volumes (rather than to changes in oil prices) is a key risk factor for the financial sector in the KSA. These findings have implications for policy makers in terms of leveraging the pandemic conditions as an opportunity to drive further reform and diversify the economy with lower risk. © 2021 by the authors.

Although diverse technologies can be considered for the deployment of such certificates, the use of blockchain has been suggested as a promising approach due to its decentralization and transparency features. However, the proposed solutions often lack realistic experimental evaluation that could help to determine possible practical challenges for the deployment of a blockchain platform for this purpose. To fill this gap, this work introduces a scalable, blockchain-based platform for the secure sharing of COVID-19 or other disease vaccination certificates. As an indicative use case, we emulate a large-scale deployment by considering the countries of the European Union. The platform is evaluated through extensive experiments measuring computing resource usage, network response time, and bandwidth. Based on the results, the proposed scheme shows satisfactory performance across all major evaluation criteria, suggesting that it can set the pace for real implementations.

As part of social distancing, sexual distancing was one of these measures. Sexual distancing implied no sex with partners outside of one’s household. We tried to elucidate motives and barriers for complying with sexual distancing among men who have sex with men (MSM) and the relation with social distancing.MethodsIn this exploratory qualitative study we interviewed STI clinic visiting MSM during the first COVID-19 lock down using a semi-qualitative questionnaire from March-May 2020. We interviewed both men who complied and did not comply with the sexual distancing measures. The interviews were transcribed using verbatim transcription and analyzed using MAXQDA.ResultsWe included 18 non-compliers and 4 compliers. Motivations mentioned to comply with sexual distancing measures were: perceiving COVID-19 as a serious health threat, experiencing critically ill COVID-19 patients first hand, protecting someone dear from COVID-19, and being satisfied with social and/or sexual distancing measures. Barriers mentioned to comply with sexual distancing measures were: not being aware of the need for sexual distancing, being single, previously having had an active sex life, importance of the social aspect of sex, a strong urge for sex, having sex to reduce stress, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and not perceiving COVID-19 is a serious health threat.ConclusionOur findings suggest that the information on sexual distancing needs to be made more explicit, accessible, understandable, customized and relatable to the key populations. This will improve effective measures and health advises for the current COVID-19 pandemic and future droplet borne outbreaks.","De Vries, D.; Zimmerman, H.; Drückler, S.; Davidovich, U.; Hoornenborg, E.; de Vries, H.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,342,20

Bats have been found to be an important source of coronaviruses with some of them having the potential to infect humans, with other animals serving as intermediate or alternate hosts or reservoirs. Host diversity may be an important contributor to viral diversity and thus the potential for zoonotic events. To date, limited research has been done in Africa on this topic, in particular in the Congo Basin despite frequent contact between humans and wildlife in this region. We sampled and, using consensus coronavirus PCR-primers, tested 3,561 wild animals for coronavirus RNA. The focus was on bats (38%), rodents (38%), and primates (23%) that posed an elevated risk for contact with people, and we found coronavirus RNA in 121 animals, of which all but two were bats. Depending on the taxonomic family, bats were significantly more likely to be coronavirus RNA-positive when sampled either in the wet (Pteropodidae and Rhinolophidae) or dry season (Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae). The detected RNA sequences correspond to 15 Alpha- and 6 Beta-coronaviruses, with some of them being very similar (>95% nucleotide identities) to known coronaviruses and others being more unique and potentially representing novel viruses. In seven of the bats, we detected RNA most closely related to sequences of the human common cold coronaviruses 229E or NL63 (>80% nucleotide identities). The findings highlight the potential for coronavirus spillover, especially in regions with a high diversity of bats and close human contact, and reinforces the need for ongoing surveillance.","Kumakamba, Charles; Niama, Fabien R.; Muyembe, Francisca; Mombouli, Jean-Vivien; Kingebeni, Placide Mbala; Nina, Rock Aime; Lukusa, Ipos Ngay; Bounga, Gerard; N’Kawa, Frida; Nkoua, Cynthia Goma; Losoma, Joseph Atibu; Mulembakani, Prime; Makuwa, Maria; Tamufe, Ubald; Gillis, Amethyst; LeBreton, Matthew; Olson, Sarah H.; Cameron, Kenneth; Reed, Patricia; Ondzie, Alain; Tremeau-Bravard, Alex; Smith, Brett R.; Pante, Jasmine; Schneider, Bradley S.; McIver, David J.; Ayukekbong, James A.; Hoff, Nicole A.; Rimoin, Anne W.; Laudisoit, Anne; Monagin, Corina; Goldstein, Tracey; Joly, Damien O.; Saylors, Karen; Wolfe, Nathan D.; Rubin, Edward M.; MPassi, Romain Bagamboula; Tamfum, Jean J.

The method is adopted from ANI-1ccx neural network potentials (Machine Learning) for the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) and predicts the single point energies at the accuracy of CCSD(T)/CBS level for the entire configurational space that is sampled by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Our preliminary results show that the method can be as accurate as Bennet-Acceptance-Ration (BAR) with much reduced computational cost. Not only does it enable to calculate solvation free energies of small organic compounds, but it is also possible to predict absolute and relative binding free energies in ligand-protein complex systems. Rapid calculation also enables to screen small organic molecules from databases as potent inhibitors to any drug targets.","Tayfuroglu, Omer; Yildiz, Muslum; Pearson, Lee-Wright; Kocak, Abdulkadir",bioRxiv,342,30

While all sectors of the economy are expected to be adversely affected, the economic implications of this pandemic for the hotel industry have not yet been widely investigated. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the U.S. hotel industry. The results showed that daily room OCC, ADR and RevPAR have plunged about 74%, 47% and 86%, respectively. Although the impact is observed across all hotel segments, economy-scale hotels were more resilient, whereas luxury-scale hotels experienced the largest decline. Also, chain-managed hotels are the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to franchise and independent hotels. Quantifying the magnitude of this impact, we found that the U.S. hotel industry's revenue losses accumulated to over $30 billion between March-2020 and May-2020.

By pulse-chase analysis of radiolabeled protein condensation in beta-cells, the formation of insoluble aggregates of regulated secretory protein lags behind the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. Condensation occurs within immature granules (IGs), accounting for passive protein sorting as demonstrated by constitutive-like secretion of newly synthesized C- peptide in stoichiometric excess of insulin (Kuliawat, R., and P. Arvan. J. Cell Biol. 1992. 118:521-529). Experimental manipulation of condensation conditions in vivo reveals a direct relationship between sorting of regulated secretory protein and polymer assembly within IGs. By contrast, entry from the trans-Golgi network into IGs does not appear especially selective for regulated secretory proteins. Specifically, in normal islets, lysosomal enzyme precursors enter the stimulus-dependent secretory pathway with comparable efficiency to that of proinsulin. However, within 2 h after synthesis (the same period during which proinsulin processing occurs), newly synthesized hydrolases are fairly efficiently relocated out of the stimulus- dependent pathway. In tunicamycin-treated islets, while entry of new lysosomal enzymes into the regulated secretory pathway continues unperturbed, exit of nonglycosylated hydrolases from this pathway does not occur. Consequently, the ultimate targeting of nonglycosylated hydrolases in beta-cells is to storage granules rather than lysosomes. These results implicate a post-Golgi mechanism for the active removal of lysosomal hydrolases away from condensed granule contents during the storage process for regulated secretory proteins.",,J Cell Biol,342,30

Intraepithelial lymphocytes represent a substantial fraction of gut-associated lymphocytes, but their function in mucosal immunity is unclear. A newly described population of NK cells that spontaneously secrete IL-4 and IFN-gamma is present in the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment of the rat. We hypothesized that defects in the number or function of these cells would be present in rats susceptible to autoimmunity. We report that the number of NKR-P1A(+)CD3(-) intraepithelial NK (IENK) cells is deficient before onset of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in diabetes-prone BB (BBDP) rats. The absolute number of recoverable IENK cells was only approximately 8% of that observed in WF rats. Bone marrow transplantation from histocompatible WF donors reversed the IENK cell deficiency (and prevented diabetes) in these animals, suggesting a hemopoietic origin for their IENK cell defect. Analysis of diabetes-resistant BB rats, which develop autoimmune diabetes only after perturbation of the immune system, revealed IENK cell numbers intermediate between that of BBDP and WF rats. IENK cells were selectively depleted during treatment to induce diabetes. Prediabetic BBDP and diabetes-resistant BB animals also exhibited defective IENK cell function, including decreased NK cell cytotoxicity and reduced secretion of IL-4 and IFN-gamma. IENK functional defects were also observed in LEW and BN rats, which are susceptible to induced autoimmunity, but not in WF, DA, or F344 rats, which are resistant.

We describe conditions under which it is possible to define a mapping from the distribution that generated the existing external data to the relative efficiency of a covariate-adjusted estimator compared to an unadjusted estimator. Under conditions, these relative efficiencies approximate the ratio of sample size needed to achieve a desired power. We consider two situations where the outcome is either fully or partially observed and several treatment effect estimands that are of particular interest in most trials. For each such estimand, we develop a semiparametrically efficient estimator of the relative efficiency that allows for the application of flexible statistical learning tools to estimate the nuisance functions and an analytic form of a corresponding Wald-type confidence interval. We also propose a double bootstrap scheme for constructing confidence intervals. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply these methods to data to estimate the relative efficiency of using covariate adjustment in Covid-19 therapeutic trials.","Li, Xiudi; Li, Sijia; Luedtke, Alex",ArXiv,342,1

The N-terminal domain of coronaviral N proteins (N-NTD) provides a scaffold for RNA binding, while the C-terminal domain (N-CTD) mainly acts as oligomerization modules during assembly. The C terminus of the N protein anchors it to the viral membrane by associating with M protein. We characterized the structures of N-NTD from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in two crystal forms, at 1.17 A (monoclinic) and at 1.85 A (cubic), respectively, resolved by molecular replacement using the homologous avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) structure. Flexible loops in the solution structure of SARS-CoV N-NTD are now shown to be well ordered around the beta-sheet core. The functionally important positively charged beta-hairpin protrudes out of the core, is oriented similarly to that in the IBV N-NTD, and is involved in crystal packing in the monoclinic form. In the cubic form, the monomers form trimeric units that stack in a helical array. Comparison of crystal packing of SARS-CoV and IBV N-NTDs suggests a common mode of RNA recognition, but they probably associate differently in vivo during the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Electrostatic potential distribution on the surface of homology models of related coronaviral N-NTDs suggests that they use different modes of both RNA recognition and oligomeric assembly, perhaps explaining why their nucleocapsids have different morphologies.","Saikatendu, Kumar Singh; Joseph, Jeremiah S; Subramanian, Vanitha; Neuman, Benjamin W; Buchmeier, Michael J; Stevens, Raymond C; Kuhn, Peter",Journal of virology,342,1

This review will describe recent advances in our understanding of human noroviruses. In addition, we will consider related nonhuman caliciviruses to highlight some potential difficulties in the control of caliciviral disease. RECENT FINDINGS Using more sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction based assays, noroviruses are now recognized as the most common cause of infectious intestinal disease in the community, as well as outbreaks of the infectious intestinal disease. After recovery from acute disease, some individuals continue shedding norovirus, particularly if immunosuppressed. The noroviruses are extremely variable, which has important implications for protection following challenge, and for future vaccination. From amongst this variability, new strains have emerged with the potential to spread widely. Recently a mouse norovirus has been identified which will afford new insights into the biology of these important viruses. Studies on human susceptibility have identified some resistant individuals in the population and a potential virus receptor, which may lead to the development of novel antiviral therapies. SUMMARY Lack of cell culture systems for the human noroviruses is being overcome by molecular technologies. Such studies have provided new insight into the significance and epidemiology of these viruses and opened the possibility of disease control through vaccination. Work on nonhuman caliciviruses has interesting parallels with human noroviruses, and provides new insights into the understanding of these important human pathogens.","Radford, Alan D; Gaskell, Rosalind M; Hart, C Anthony",Current opinion in infectious diseases,342,5

This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.","Heffernan, J M; Smith, R J; Wahl, L M","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",342,33

Another group, which did not receive ventilation, served as the control. Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the HVZP+CAP group than in the HVZP group at 2 h of ventilation. Total protein levels were significantly higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) recovered from HVZP-ventilated rats than from controls. BALF macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and lung ANG II were significantly higher in the HVZP group than in the control and HVZP+CAP groups. Lung ANG II levels correlated positively with BALF protein and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. The number of apoptotic airway and alveolar wall cells was significantly higher in the HVZP and HVZP+CAP groups than in the control group and significantly lower in the HVZP+CAP group than in the HVZP group. These results suggest that the efficiency of captopril to attenuate VILI is related to reduction of inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of apoptosis and indicate that VILI is partly mediated by the local angiotensin system.","Jiang, Jiunn-Song; Wang, Leng-Fang; Chou, Hsiu-Chu; Chen, Chung-Ming",Journal of applied physiology,342,9

Many different methods and sites of temperature measurement are used perioperatively. It is unclear to what degree these methods might be interchangeable. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between temperatures measured at different sites in anaesthetised children. Two hundred children, 0 to 17 years, undergoing general anaesthesia for elective non-cardiac surgery, were prospectively recruited. Temperature measurements were taken in the operating theatre concurrently at the nasopharynx, tympanic membranes, temporal artery, axilla and skin (chest). Patient age and weight were documented. Temperatures varied according to site of measurement. The mean difference from nasopharyngeal temperature to temperatures at left and right tympanic, temporal, axillary and cutaneous sites were +0.24°C, +0.24°C, +0.35°C, -0.38°C and -1.70°C, respectively. Levels of agreement to nasopharyngeal temperature were similar at tympanic, temporal and axillary sites. Tympanic and temporal temperatures were superior to axillary temperatures for detection of mild hypothermia (<36°C). Skin temperature showed a large variation from nasopharyngeal measurements.

We hypothesized that its twin protein, CEACAM2, exerts a similar physiologic role in murine platelets. CEACAM2-deficient mice (Cc2-/-) displayed prolonged tail bleeding times and increased volume of blood loss. Cc2-/- platelets have moderate integrin αIIbβ3-mediated functional defects with impaired kinetics of platelet spreading on fibrinogen and type I collagen and delayed kinetics in the retraction of fibrin clots in vitro. This functional integrin αIIbβ3 defect could not be attributed to altered integrin αIIbβ3 expression. Cc2-/- platelets displayed normal 'inside-out' signaling properties as demonstrated by normal agonist-induced binding of soluble fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-fibrinogen and JON/A antibody binding. This data provides direct evidence that disruption of CEACAM2 induces a moderate integrin αIIbβ3-mediated platelet function defect, and that CEACAM2 is essential to maintain a normal integrin αIIbβ3-mediated platelet function.","Alshahrani, Musaed M; Kyriacou, Roula P; O'Malley, Cindy J; Heinrich, Garrett; Najjar, Sonia M; Jackson, Denise E",Platelets,342,16

METHODS A total of 526 volunteers, consisting of doctors and nurses, participated. Demographic features, personal hygiene behavior, personal protective equipment (PPE) use, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A) parameters, and symptoms of various dermatological diseases (xerosis, eczema, acne, hair loss, palmar hyperhidrosis, xeromycteria, urticaria, aphthous stomatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis) were investigated. RESULTS Although the frequency and severity of many dermatological complaints increased during the pandemic period, the most frequent increase was observed in the frequency of complaints suggesting xerosis and eczema. We found that complaints suggesting xerosis and eczema were seen on the hands 2.44 and 3.57 times, respectively, as a result of washing hands 10 times/day, and that handwashing times of 10 seconds or more significantly increased the risk of eczema (5.44 times). Another remarkable result was a fivefold increase in acne complaints among those using any mask. The severity of all complaints except hair loss and seborrheic dermatitis correlated significantly with HADS-A.

DESIGN AND ANIMALS: 4 TGEV seronegative sows and their litters (group A) served as controls, whereas 2 other groups (B and C) of sows (also TGEV seronegative) were oronasally inoculated with live PRCV during 1 or 2 subsequent pregnancies, respectively. PROCEDURE Effectiveness of passive immunity provided to pigs via colostrum and milk was assessed after TGEV challenge exposure, and TGEV antibody responses in colostrum and milk were analyzed. RESULTS Mortality in the 3 groups of young pigs correlated with severity of clinical signs of TGEV infection and was highest in control litters (86% in group-A pigs) and lowest in litters of sows inoculated with PRCV in 2 subsequent pregnancies (14% in group-C pigs). Virus-neutralization and IgA and IgG TGEV antibody titers of milk collected from sows at challenge exposure had significant positive correlation with litter survival. Significantly higher numbers of TGEV-specific IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells were found in group-A pigs than in group-C pigs, suggesting that high titer of maternal antibodies (induced in group-C sows multiply exposed to PRCV) may interfere with active antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggest that, in PRCV-infected pig herds, multiple exposures of pregnant sows are associated with higher IgA and IgG antibody titers to TGEV in milk, and these titers contribute to protection against TGEV infection.","Sestak, K; Lanza, I; Park, S K; Weilnau, P A; Saif, L J",American journal of veterinary research,342,16

Methods The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 47 death cases obtained from Huoshenshan Hospital in Whuhan, Hubei Province were retrospectively analyzed. Results All the patients developed initial symptoms in Wuhan. The time from onset to admission was (12.60±5.60) days. Most of them were male (68.09%) with non-nosocomial infection (91.49%), advanced age (&gt;60 years, 89.36%). Over half of the cases (51.06%) reported a history of contact with suspected or confirmed patients, and comorbidity of chronic diseases (70.21%). Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurred in 29 cases (61.70%) with heart failure (51.06%) and renal failure (36.17%). The main clinical symptoms included fever, fatigue, dyspnea and cough. At admission,most cases were severe (55.32%) or critical (42.55%), and the in-hospital survival was longer for the severe than for the critical (P=0.02). 76.59% of the patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, and they had a longer in-hospital survival than those with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions This group of cases occurred during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, characterized by male, elder and history of chronic diseases.

Although bimanual interactions in VR can resemble real-world interactions -- thus increasing realism and improving immersion -- they can also pose significant accessibility challenges to people with limited mobility, such as for people who have full use of only one hand. An opportunity exists to create accessible techniques that take advantage of users' abilities, but designers currently lack structured tools to consider alternative approaches. To begin filling this gap, we propose Two-in-One, a design space that facilitates the creation of accessible methods for bimanual interactions in VR from unimanual input. Our design space comprises two dimensions, bimanual interactions and computer assistance, and we provide a detailed examination of issues to consider when creating new unimanual input techniques that map to bimanual interactions in VR. We used our design space to create three interaction techniques that we subsequently implemented for a subset of bimanual interactions and received user feedback through a video elicitation study with 17 people with limited mobility. Our findings explore complex tradeoffs associated with autonomy and agency and highlight the need for additional settings and methods to make VR accessible to people with limited mobility.","Yamagami, Momona; Junuzovic, Sasa; Gonzalez-Franco, Mar; Ofek, Eyal; Cutrell, Edward; Porter, John; Wilson, Andrew; Mott, Martez",,342,1

Intrathyroid parathyroid adenoma (ITPA) is also rare. Co-ocurrence of PTC and ITPA in the same thyroid lobe is extremely rare. Likewise, primary hyperparathyroidism with such non-medullary thyroid carcinoma is rare. The specific molecular profile of hobnail PTC (HPTC) is different from the classic, poorly differentiated and anaplastic variants and may contribute to its aggressive behavior. HPTC's genetic profile remains unclear. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 61-year-old woman presented to our endocrine clinic with generalized aches, bone pain, polyuria, and right neck swelling of a few months' duration. Laboratory findings revealed hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasound of the neck showed 4.6â¯cm complex nodule within the right thyroid lobe. Sestamibi scan suggested parathyroid adenoma in the right thyroid lobe. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) revealed atypical follicular lesion of undetermined significance. She underwent right lobectomy, which normalized the intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone levels. Final pathology with immunohistochemical stains demonstrated HPTC and IPTA (2â¯cm each). Next-generation sequencing investigated the mutation spectrum of HPTC and detected BRAFV600E mutation. CONCLUSIONS: A parathyroid adenoma should not exclude the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid evaluation is needed for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to prevent missing concurrent thyroid cancers. Cytomorphologic features to distinguish thyroid from parathyroid cells on FNA cytology must be considered. Immunohistochemical stains are important. BRAFV600E is the most common mutation in HPTC. This is possibly the first reported case of HPTC and ITPA co-occurring within the same thyroid lobe. Studies that define other molecular abnormalities may be useful as therapeutic targets.","Al-Yahri, Omer; Abdelaal, Abdelrahman; El Ansari, Walid; Farghaly, Hanan; Murshed, Khaled; Zirie, Mahmoud A; Al Hassan, Mohamed S",Int J Surg Case Rep,342,5

LMs have emerged as a significant breakthrough in natural-language processing, providing capabilities that go far beyond sentence completion including question answering, summarization, and natural-language inference. While many of these capabilities have potential application to cognitive systems, exploiting language models as a source of task knowledge, especially for task learning, offers significant, near-term benefits. We introduce language models and the various tasks to which they have been applied and then review methods of knowledge extraction from language models. The resulting analysis outlines both the challenges and opportunities for using language models as a new knowledge source for cognitive systems. It also identifies possible ways to improve knowledge extraction from language models using the capabilities provided by cognitive systems. Central to success will be the ability of a cognitive agent to itself learn an abstract model of the knowledge implicit in the LM as well as methods to extract high-quality knowledge effectively and efficiently. To illustrate, we introduce a hypothetical robot agent and describe how language models could extend its task knowledge and improve its performance and the kinds of knowledge and methods the agent can use to exploit the knowledge within a language model.","Wray, Robert E.; III,; Kirk, James R.; Laird, John E.",,342,14

The closure of cities had had a huge impact on human production and consumption activities, which had greatly reduced population mobility. This article used air pollutant data from 341 cities in mainland China and divided these cities into seven major regions based on geographic conditions and climatic environment. The impact of urban blockade on air quality during COVID-19 was studied from the perspectives of time, space, and season. In addition, this article used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to systematically analyze the characteristics of air pollution in the country and used the Pearson correlation coefficient to explore the relationship between NDVI and the air pollutant concentrations during the COVID-19 period. Then, linear regression was used to find the quantitative relationship between NDVI and AQI, and the fitting effect of the model was found to be significant through t test. Finally, some countermeasures were proposed based on the analysis results, and suggestions were provided for improving air quality. This paper has drawn the following conclusions: (1) the concentration of pollutants varied greatly in different regions, and the causes of their pollution sources were also different. The region with the largest decline in AQI was the Northeast China (60.01%), while the AQI in the southwest China had the smallest change range, and its value had increased by 1.72%. In addition, after the implementation of the city blockade, the concentration of NO2 in different regions dropped the most, but the increase in O3 was more obvious. (2) Higher vegetation coverage would have a beneficial impact on the atmospheric environment. Areas with higher NDVI values have relatively low AQI. There is a negative correlation between NDVI and AQI, and an average increase of 0.1 in NDVI will reduce AQI by 3.75 (95% confidence interval). In the case of less human intervention, the higher the vegetation coverage, the lower the local pollutant concentration will be. Therefore, the degree of vegetation coverage would have a direct or indirect impact on air pollution.","Zhou, Manguo; Huang, Yanguo; Li, Guilan",,342,20

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic and exposure data from physical therapists from April to May 2020. All physical therapists working in an inpatient and outpatient care in Italy were eligible. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among all eligible physical therapists to collect (1) demographic characteristics, (2-3) personal- and work-related exposures, and (4) signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Factors associated with a COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) were explored through logistic regression models and multivariate methods. RESULTS: A total of 15,566 respondents completed the survey, with a response rate of 43.3%, achieving high statistical precision (99% CI, 1% type I error). Among physical therapists who received NPS testing, 13.1% (95% CI = 12.1-14.1%) had a positive result, with a peak reached in March 2020 (36%). The top five symptoms were fatigue and tiredness (69.1%), loss of smell (64.5%), aches and pains (60.8%), loss of taste (58.3%), and headache (51.1%). No symptoms were reported by 8.9%. Working in a health care institution [odds ratio (OR) = 7.2; 95% CI = 5.4-9.7], being reallocated to a different unit (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.3-2.2) and changing job tasks (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.2) increased the risk of being COVID-19 positive.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for original studies which reported the frequency of PE on CTPA in patients with COVID-19. The frequency of PE, the location of PE, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) of D-dimer levels between patients with and without PE were pooled by random effects models. RESULTS: Seventy-one studies were included. Pooled frequencies of PE in patients with COVID-19 at the emergency department (ED), general wards, and intensive care unit (ICU) were 17.9% (95% CI: 12.0-23.8%), 23.9% (95% CI: 15.2-32.7%), and 48.6% (95% CI: 41.0-56.1%), respectively. PE was more commonly located in peripheral than in main pulmonary arteries (pooled frequency of 65.3% [95% CI: 60.0-70.1%] vs. 32.9% [95% CI: 26.7-39.0%]; OR = 3.540 [95% CI: 2.308-5.431%]). Patients with PE had significantly higher D-dimer levels (pooled SMD of 1.096 [95% CI, 0.844-1.349]). D-dimer cutoff levels which have been used to identify patients with PE varied between 1000 and 4800 µg/L. CONCLUSION: The frequency of PE in patients with COVID-19 is highest in the ICU, followed by general wards and the ED. PE in COVID-19 is more commonly located in peripheral than in central pulmonary arteries, which suggests local thrombosis to play a major role. D-dimer assessment may help to select patients with COVID-19 for CTPA, using D-dimer cutoff levels of at least 1000 µg/L. KEY POINTS: â¢ The frequency of PE in patients with COVID-19 is highest in the ICU, followed by general wards and the ED. â¢ PE in COVID-19 is more commonly located in peripheral than in central pulmonary arteries. â¢ D-dimer levels are significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 who have PE.","Kwee, Robert M; Adams, Hugo J A; Kwee, Thomas C",Eur. radiol,342,1

We leverage a rich dataset on Italian municipalities to explore mechanisms behind this gradient. We first show that socio-demographic and economic features at municipal level are highly collinear, making it hard to identify single-variable causal relationships. Using Principal Components Analysis we model excess mortality and show that areas with higher excess mortality have lower income, lower education, larger households, lower trade and higher industrial employments, and older population.

Various health education and psychological models suggest that a primary driver of habits is risk perception. Protective habits are more likely to be adopted by people who experience greater risk, affecting the likelihood of infection. Two multistage random samplings made up a total of 360 participants. The data were collected via a structured questionnaire from April to May 2020. Frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and multiple logistic regression models (with 95% CI) were computed to determine the possible associated factors to risk perception towards COVID-19. The finding revealed that more than half of the respondents were of good perception (74.44%;95 % CI [69.61 to 78.87]), and most of the participants were female (88.33%), with an average age of 20.51 years old (S.D.=1.82). The factors associated with a good risk perception of COVID-19 including knowledge (AOR= 3.44, p-value = 0.023, 95% CI [1.15, 10.27]), and behaviour level of COVID-19 protection presented at a moderate and good level (AOR= 2.47, p-value = 0.045, 95% CI [1.13, 5.41] and AOR= 4.61, p-value = 0.001, 95% CI [2.04, 10.41], respectively).

In health care facilities, CRAB readily contaminates the patient care environment and health care providers' hands, survives for extended periods on dry surfaces, and can be spread by asymptomatically colonized persons; these factors make CRAB outbreaks in acute care hospitals difficult to control (2,3). On May 28, 2020, a New Jersey hospital (hospital A) reported a cluster of CRAB infections during a surge in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospital A and the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) conducted an investigation, and identified 34 patients with hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant CRAB infection or colonization during February-July 2020, including 21 (62%) who were admitted to two intensive care units (ICUs) dedicated to caring for COVID-19 patients. In late March, increasing COVID-19-related hospitalizations led to shortages in personnel, personal protective equipment (PPE), and medical equipment, resulting in changes to conventional infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. In late May, hospital A resumed normal operations, including standard IPC measures, as COVID-19 hospitalizations decreased, lessening the impact of personnel and supply chain shortages on hospital functions. CRAB cases subsequently returned to a pre-COVID-19 baseline of none to two cases monthly. The occurrence of this cluster underscores the potential for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) to spread during events when standard hospital practices might be disrupted; conventional IPC strategies should be reinstated as soon as capacity and resources allow.","Perez, Stephen; Innes, Gabriel K; Walters, Maroya Spalding; Mehr, Jason; Arias, Jessica; Greeley, Rebecca; Chew, Debra",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,342,21

Using sociological approaches to risk and drawing on some examples from the Australian online news media, we illustrate how risk management approaches and risk uncertainties in response to the coronavirus, have homogenised younger and older peoples, and widely positioned them in a binary generational conflict of ‘risky’ and ‘at risk’. Younger people are frequently framed as healthy, active agents: they are engaging in risky behaviours that endanger their health and that of others. In contrast, older people have been typically cast as passive and at risk: ‘the elderly’ and ‘the vulnerable elderly’. In extreme cases, older people have also been framed as burdensome and worthless. In this chapter, we examine how age was framed or ‘staged’ during COVID-19 to illustrate how ageist language and dichotomous pandemic framings - grounded on blame and shame - add to social divisions and ‘othering’, shape risk management strategies, and cloud public health messaging on risk, viral spread, and physical distancing measures. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Deborah Lupton and Karen Willis.","Cook, P.

This can result in the rapid spread of the infection. Based on the transmission characteristics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the nature of public transport sites, we identified comprehensive countermeasures toward the prevention and control of COVID-19, including the strengthening of personnel management, personal protection, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and health education.

Moreover, whether two German states and 19 Italian cities appropriately represent the countries within the European monitoring of excess mortality for public health action (EuroMOMO) network was explored. Significantly elevated SMRs were observed (Germany: week 14-18, Italy: week 11-18) with SMR peaks in week 15 in Germany (1.15, 95%-CI: 1.09-1.21) and in week 13 in Italy (1.79, 95%-CI: 1.75-1.83).

There is a need for alternative disinfection strategies and techniques that are adapted to the actual behavior of humans living in densely populated mega-cities. Here, high public circulation in shared passenger vehicles such as taxis, buses and personal cars represents a major risk of viral transmission due to confined space and commonly touched surfaces. Actual regulatory guidelines are not fully successful because they rely both on passengers' willingness to wear face masks and on drivers' willingness to disinfect cars after each shift or each ride with symptomatic individuals. Here we propose that passive solar heating, a sustainable technique that has been used in agronomy to kill weeds and soil pathogens, could inactivate the virus in vehicles during warm-to-hot weather within few minutes to half an hour at 50-60 °C. We measured temperatures in a white compact-size sedan left in a parking lot under direct sunlight. Air temperatures increased from 30 to 42-49 °C after 30 min and then reached a plateau at 52-57 °C after 90 min. Temperatures were about 3 °C higher in front versus back of the car and about 5 °C higher at face height compared to knee height. Since COVID-19 is inactivated in 30 min at 56 °C, our findings confirm that hot air generated passively by solar heating in enclosed spaces is a promising strategy of disinfection with benefits of no added costs, chemicals or worktime. Though this technique appears limited to hot climate, possible heating systems that work during parking time might be developed by vehicle makers to extend the technique to cold climates.","Wang, Xue; Sun, Shiyi; Zhang, Boxin; Han, Jie",Environ Chem Lett,342,33

Subject and methods: An online survey was distributed through social media to individuals with a diagnosis of PID to investigate behaviors and concerns during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: Five hundred and fifty seven responses were collected, of which 495 surveys were 100% complete; partial responses were analyzed. Respondents have been extremely cautious and have minimized their potential Covid-19 exposure risk. In this study, 56.6% (n = 289) participated in telehealth visits with the physician responsible for managing their PID during the Covid-19 pandemic. Respondents reported they would be somewhat comfortable with returning to normal activities if there was widespread herd immunity (40.9%, n = 209), an effective vaccine (46.0%. n = 235), or public health protections (44.0%, n = 225). The majority of respondents were extremely concerned (57.3%, n = 293) about additional waves of Covid-19 cases when their state or country reopens. Conclusion: The PID community is aware of the health risks posed by this public health crisis, and have done as much as possible to minimize their risk to community exposure. This pandemic has highlighted the importance of continuous medical care for a vulnerable population through the use of telemedicine.

Reliable exposure assessment was investigated to understand the exposure pattern of biocidal products used by occupational workers in their place of occupation, multi-use facilities, and general facilities. The interview-survey approach was taken to obtain the database about several subcategories of twelve occupational groups, the use pattern, and the exposure information of non-human hygiene disinfectant and insecticide products in workplaces. Furthermore, we investigated valuable exposure factors, e.g., the patterns of use, exposure routes, and quantifying potential hazardous chemical intake, on biocidal active ingredients. We focused on biocidal active-ingredient exposure from products used by twelve occupational worker groups. The 685 non-human hygiene disinfectants and 763 insecticides identified contained 152 and 97 different active-ingredient chemicals, respectively. The toxicity values and clinical health effects of total twelve ingredient chemicals were determined through a brief overview of toxicity studies aimed at estimating human health risks. To estimate actual exposure amounts divided by twelve occupational groups, the time spent to apply the products was investigated from the beginning to end of the product use. This study investigated the exposure assessment of occupational exposure to biocidal products used in workplaces, multi-use facilities, and general facilities. Furthermore, this study provides valuable information on occupational exposure that may be useful to conduct accurate exposure assessment and to manage products used for quarantine in general facilities.","Kim, Joo-Hyon; Hwang, Moon-Young; Kim, Yoo-Jin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),342,22

Selenium has an ongoing history of reducing the incidence and severity of various viral infections; for example, a German study found selenium status to be significantly higher in serum samples from surviving than non-surviving COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a significant, positive, linear association was found between the cure rate of Chinese patients with COVID-19 and regional selenium status. Moreover, the cure rate continued to rise beyond the selenium intake required to optimise selenoproteins, suggesting that selenoproteins are probably not the whole story. Nonetheless, the significantly reduced expression of a number of selenoproteins, including those involved in controlling ER stress, along with increased expression of IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in culture suggests a potential link between reduced selenoprotein expression and COVID-19-associated inflammation. In this comprehensive review, we describe the history of selenium in viral infections and then go on to assess the potential benefits of adequate and even supra-nutritional selenium status. We discuss the indispensable function of the selenoproteins in coordinating a successful immune response and follow by reviewing cytokine excess, a key mediator of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, and its relationship to selenium status. We comment on the fact that the synthetic redox-active selenium compound, ebselen, has been found experimentally to be a strong inhibitor of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease that enables viral maturation within the host. That finding suggests that redox-active selenium species formed at high selenium intake might hypothetically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases. We consider the tactics that SARS-CoV-2 could employ to evade an adequate host response by interfering with the human selenoprotein system. Recognition of the myriad mechanisms by which selenium might potentially benefit COVID-19 patients provides a rationale for randomised, controlled trials of selenium supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Jinsong; Saad, Ramy; Taylor, Ethan Will; Rayman, Margaret P",Redox Biol,342,1

These mediators may explain the age dependence of COVID-19 pneumonia, the preponderance of male and obese or hypertensive patients, as well as of persons of color and smokers. There is clear evidence that vitamin C in high doses can reduce these mediators. Vitamin C is cheap and safe.

Healthcare centres around the world have seen changes in the nature of injuries acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic; we therefore hypothesize that social isolation measures have changed the pattern of plastic and reconstructive surgery presentations. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was designed comparing patient presentations during the enforced COVID-19 lockdown to two previous periods. All emergency referrals requiring operative intervention by the plastic and reconstructive surgery unit of our institution were included. Patient demographics, place and mechanism of injury, drug and alcohol involvement, delays to presentation, length of admission and complication rates were collected. RESULTS: Demographics and complication rates were similar across all groups. A 31.8% reduction in total number of emergency cases was seen during the lockdown period. Increase in do-it-yourself injuries (P = 0.001), bicycle injuries (P = 0.001) and injuries acquired via substance abuse (P = 0.041) was observed. Head and neck injuries, mostly due to animal bites and falls, were also more prevalent compared to the same period the previous year (P = 0.007). As expected, over 80% of plastic surgery operations during the COVID-19 period were due to injuries acquired at home, a significant increase compared to previous periods.

The attack rate in the crew was 3.3% (28/832) before quarantine commencement and 4.8% (21/441) during quarantine on board. No crew members became symptomatic after completion of quarantine. Infection surveillance involved telephone correspondence, face-to-face visits, and testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

In women affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the case fatality rate appears higher in those affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid review to guide health policy and management of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, which was used to develop the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy. Data were extracted from relevant papers. This review has been used to develop guidelines with representatives of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and RCOG who provided expert consensus on areas in which data were lacking. RESULTS: From 9965 search results in PubMed and 600 in MedRxiv, 21 relevant studies, all of which were case reports or case series, were identified. From reports of 32 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 30 babies (one set of twins, three ongoing pregnancies), seven (22%) were asymptomatic and two (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), one of whom remained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No maternal deaths have been reported to date. Delivery was by Cesarean section in 27 cases and by vaginal delivery in two, and 15 (47%) delivered preterm. There was one stillbirth and one neonatal death. In 25 babies, no cases of vertical transmission were reported; 15 were reported as being tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after delivery. Case fatality rates for SARS and MERS were 15% and 27%, respectively. SARS was associated with miscarriage or intrauterine death in five cases, and fetal growth restriction was noted in two ongoing pregnancies affected by SARS in the third trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Serious morbidity occurred in 2/32 women with COVID-19, both of whom required ICU care. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 appears less lethal, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date and that one woman remains in a critical condition. Preterm delivery affected 47% of women hospitalized with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK's reasonable worst-case scenario of 80% of the population being affected is realized. Based on this review, RCOG, in consultation with RCPCH, developed guidance for delivery and neonatal care in pregnancies affected by COVID-19, which recommends that delivery mode be determined primarily by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies. We hope that this review will be helpful for maternity and neonatal services planning their response to COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian time series model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Colorado, and West Virginia. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.","Watson, Gregory L; Xiong, Di; Zhang, Lu; Zoller, Joseph A; Shamshoian, John; Sundin, Phillip; Bufford, Teresa; Rimoin, Anne W; Suchard, Marc A; Ramirez, Christina M",PLoS Comput Biol,342,1

Reverse genetics is a common technique to study the biological characteristics of viruses. So far, there is no BAC reverse genetic system available for rescue of IBV infectious clone. In the present study, a new strategy for the construction of IBV infectious cDNA clone was established. The full-length genomic cDNA of IBV vaccine strain H120 was constructed in pBAC vector from four IBV fragment subcloning vectors by homologous recombination, which contained the CMV promoter at the 5' end and the hepatitis D virus ribozyme (HDVR) sequence and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH) sequence after the polyA tail at the 3' end of the full-length cDNA. Subsequently, using the same technique, another plasmid pBAC-H120/SCS1 was also constructed, in which S1 gene from IBV H120 strain was replaced with that of a virulent SC021202 strain. Recombinant virus rH120 and rH120/SCS1 were rescued by transfecting the plasmids into BHK cells and passaged in embryonated chicken eggs. Finally, the pathogenicity of both the recombinant virus strains rH120 and rH120/SCS1 was evaluated in SPF chickens. The results showed that the chimeric rH120/SCS1 strain was not pathogenic compared with the wild-type IBV SC021202 strain and the chickens inoculated with rH120/SCS1 could resist challenge infection by IBV SC021202. Taken together, our results indicate that BAC reverse genetic system could be used to rescue IBV in vitro and IBV S1 protein alone might not be the key factor for IBV pathogenicity. KEY POINTS: â¢ BAC vector was used to construct IBV full-length cDNA by homologous recombination. â¢ Based on four subcloning vectors, a recombinant chimeric IBV H120/SCS1 was constructed and rescued. â¢ Pathogenicity of H120/SCS1 was similar to that of H120, but different to that of SC021202.","Lv, Chenfei; Shi, Tingting; Zhu, Pengpeng; Peng, Xing; Cao, Shangshang; Yan, Yan; Ojha, Nishant Kumar; Liao, Min; Zhou, Jiyong",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,342,16

Participants discussed the progress on the standardization and validation of the technical and bioinformatics steps in NGS for characterization and safety evaluation of biologics, including human and animal vaccines. It was concluded that NGS can be used for the detection of a broad range of viruses, including novel viruses, and therefore can complement, supplement or even replace some of the conventional adventitious virus detection assays.

This two-step approach is difficult to implement when there are missing data since the AUC cannot be directly calculated for individuals with missing measurements. Simple methods for dealing with missing data include the complete case analysis and imputation. A recent study showed that the estimated mean AUC difference between treatment groups based on the linear mixed model (LMM), rather than on individually calculated AUCs by simple imputation, has negligible bias under random missing assumptions and only small bias when missing is not at random. However, this model assumes the outcome to be normally distributed, which is often violated in biomarker data. In this paper, we propose to use a LMM on log-transformed biomarkers, based on which statistical inference for the ratio, rather than difference, of AUC between treatment groups is provided. The proposed method can not only handle the potential baseline imbalance in a randomized trail but also circumvent the estimation of the nuisance variance parameters in the log-normal model. The proposed model is applied to a recently completed large randomized trial studying the effect of nicotine reduction on biomarker exposure of smokers.","Shi, Luoxi; Hatsukami, Dorothy K; Koopmeiners, Joseph S; Le, Chap T; Benowitz, Neal L; Donny, Eric C; Luo, Xianghua",,342,26

Lung ultrasound (LUS) could be a useful tool for physicians detecting a bilateral heterogeneous patchy distribution of pathologic findings in a symptomatic suggestive context. The aim of this study was to focus on the implications of limiting LUS examinations to specific regions of the chest. METHODS: Patients were evaluated with a standard sequence of LUS scans in 14 anatomic areas. A scoring system of LUS findings was reported, ranging from 0 to 3 (worst score, 3). The scores reported on anterior, lateral, and posterior landmarks were analyzed separately and compared with each other and with the global findings. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. A higher prevalence of score 0 was observed in the anterior region (44.08%). On the contrary, 21.05% of posterior regions and 13.62% of lateral regions were evaluated as score 3, whereas only 5.92% of anterior regions were classified as score 3. Findings from chest computed tomography performed in 16 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 correlated with and matched the distribution of findings from LUS. CONCLUSIONS: To assess the quantity and severity of lung disease, a comprehensive LUS examination is recommended. Omitting areas of the chest misses involved lung.","Smargiassi, Andrea; Soldati, Gino; Torri, Elena; Mento, Federico; Milardi, Domenico; Giacomo, Paola Del; De Matteis, Giuseppe; Burzo, Maria Livia; Larici, Anna Rita; Pompili, Maurizio; Demi, Libertario; Inchingolo, Riccardo",J. ultrasound med,342,29

Consequently, residency programs adopted e-learning as a social distancing tool for the continuity of the learning process. In this study, we explore the opinions and perspectives of plastic surgery attending doctors and residents on the implications of e-learning. Methods: After obtaining ethical approval, this cross-sectional study was conducted electronically between October and December 2020 among plastic surgery residents and board-certified plastic surgeons in Saudi Arabia. Participants completed a validated, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire gathered participants' demographic data, perceptions of online webinars, and audiovisual evaluations. Finally, we compared traditional (in-person) teaching with online webinars. The analysis was performed at a 95% confidence interval using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, N.Y.). Results: A total of 61 responses were included in this study. The majority of respondents (78.7%) were comfortable during webinars, with 38 (62.3%) believing they should supplement traditional teaching methods. Overall, 50.8% were satisfied with the webinars. However, 37.7% were neutral. Most believed that the webinars increased their clinical (67.2%) and surgical skills (67.2%) to reasonable levels. Conclusions: Online education provided an excellent educational tool as a viable option to supplement traditional face-to-face training, with most residents being satisfied, supporting the use of this educational tool. More objective research is required to refine existing online plastic surgery teaching methods while creating novel distance e-learning approaches for the future.","Kattan, A.

Several studies have been done to estimate the basic reproduction number in the early phase of this outbreak, yet there are no reliable estimates of case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19 to date. Methods: In this study, we used a purely data-driven statistical method to estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Daily numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from January 10 to February 3, 2020 and divided into three clusters: Wuhan city, other cities of Hubei province, and other provinces of mainland China. Simple linear regression model was applied to estimate the CFR from each cluster. Results: We estimated that CFR during the first weeks of the epidemic ranges from 0.15% (95% CI: 0.120.18%) in mainland China excluding Hubei through 1.41% (95% CI: 1.381.45%) in Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan to 5.25% (95% CI: 4.985.51%) in Wuhan. Conclusions: Our early estimates suggest that the CFR of COVID-19 is lower than the previous coronavirus epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","Yang, Shu; Cao, Peihua; Du, Peipei; Wu, Ziting; Zhuang, Zian; Yang, Lin; Yu, Xuan; Zhou, Qi; Feng, Xixi; Wang, Xiaohui; Li, Weiguo; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Ju; Chen, Yaolong; He, Daihai",Ann.

Several machine learning-based methodologies have been recently proposed for COVID-19 screening in CT scans as a tool to automate and help with the diagnosis. In this project, we analyzed the various clustering algorithms like K means, improved k means and fussy c means. This method K-Means and Fuzzy logic have been proposed in order to recognize overlapping pattern classes (or) degraded images. The main objective of the project is to analyze the covid-19 abnormalities in CT lung images. The project involves extracting the abnormal regions and to spot the exact location of covid-19 in the CT lung image. In K-Means the Process time is faster than other clusterings with more number of data points. It is very suitable to spot the abnormal region because of updating centroids in some cases with improved K-Means[1]. FCM gives better results for overlapped data. Image segmentation may be defined as a technique, which partitions a given image into a finite number of non-overlapping regions concerning some characteristics, such as gray value distribution, texture distribution, etc. segmentation of medical images is required for many medical diagnoses like radiation treatment planning volume visualization of regions of interest (ROI) defining the boundary of covid-19, etc. Algorithms in this project have been used for various applications such as Biomedical applications, Information Retrieval, Pattern Recognition, Object detection.","Prasad, J.

I find that fetal exposure to pandemic influenza during the first trimester of the pregnancy period decreases the proportion of males at birth during this period. The mechanism suggests that the decline in male births owing to pandemic influenza has not led to the positive selection into births, but it has been associated with the deterioration of fetal and infant health. This result supports a wide range of previous literature on the long-run adverse effects of pandemic influenza, and it is consistent with a recent argument that the postnatal selection mechanism owing to the socioeconomic status of parents is negligible (Almond 2006; Beach et al. 2018). Analyses using population censuses provide evidence suggesting that postnatal influenza exposure has long-term impacts on the sex ratio of children aged 5-12, thereby implying potential disturbance effects on the future marriage and labor markets.","Ogasawara, Kota",,342,16

Decisions on how to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing and travel restrictions should also be based on evidence. There are some experiential and mathematical modelling data for these interventions, but there is a lack of data on the social, ethical and behavioural aspects of these interventions in the literature. Therefore, our study aims to produce evidence to inform (non-pharmaceutical) interventions such as communications, quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, travel restrictions and other public health measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study will be conducted in the United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand. We propose to conduct 600-1000 quantitative surveys and 25-35 qualitative interviews per country. Data collection will follow the following four themes: (1) Quarantine and self-isolation (2) social distancing and travel restrictions (3) wellbeing and mental health (4) information, misinformation and rumours. In light of limitations of travel and holding in-person meetings, we will primarily use online/remote methods for collecting data. Study participants will be adults who have provided informed consent from different demographic, socio-economic and risk groups. Discussion: At the time of the inception of the study, United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand have initiated strict public health measures and varying degrees of 'lockdowns'; to curb the pandemic.

In this context, this protocol describes a systematic review that aims to analyze the association of race as the higher risk for illness and death due to COVID-19. METHODS: This protocol will be developed based on the recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P). For this, we will conduct searches in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, and ScienceDirect databases in the search for cross-sectional studies. All cross-sectional studies that analyzed hospitalization and death by COVID-19 as race in its determinant will be included. The search will be carried out by 2 independent researchers who will carry out the selection of articles, then the duplicate studies will be removed and screened using the Rayyan QCRI application. To assess the risk of bias, the instrument proposed by Downs and Black will be used. Meta-analyzes and subgroup analyzes will be carried out according to included data conditions. RESULTS: Based on this review, it will be possible to carry out a high-quality synthesis of available evidence that brings race as a factor for illness and death by COVID-19 and to verify which race is most affected by this disease.

We aimed to examine whether there was a change in the demographic data, triage profile, causes, management, and cost of pediatric emergency department (PED) visits of non-COVID patients during the pandemic period. Methods : This study was a retrospective, single-center, observational comparative study that was conducted at the PED. Patient records were examined during “the pandemic spring” and the same period of the previous year. Patient demographics, waiting time, and outcome of the PED visit were analyzed in the entire population of children admitted to the PED during the study period, whereas more precise data such as the reason for PED use, duration of symptoms, urgency levels according to the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), final diagnosis, management, and cost of patient care were analyzed in a sample of admitted patients. We used the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and Mann–Whitney U test for statistical analyses. Results : A total of 62,593 PED visits occurred. During the pandemic period, PED visits showed a decrease of 55.8% compared to the previous year. Patients included in the sampling study group were selected using a systematic random sampling method. The median waiting time during the pandemic period was significantly shorter than the previous year (median 14 min [IQR: 5–32] vs. median 5 min [IQR: 2–16];p<0.001). The median duration of symptoms was 1 day (1–2) in both groups. Emergency Severity Index (ESI) levels I, II, and III showed a significant increase (27.7% vs. 37.3%) in triage scoring compared to levels IV and V (72.3% vs. 62.7%) during the pandemic period (p<0.001).

Overall costs during the pandemic period had a 1.6-fold decline. Conclusion : We highlighted the changes in an ordinary PED profile during an extraordinary period. A shift in ESI levels in a more emergent direction was observed. While the number of nonurgent patients, especially those with infections, decreased, the rates of surgical cases, acute neurological and heart diseases, home accidents, and poisoning increased relative to the pre-pandemic period.","Tuygun, Nilden Karacan Can Demir Göktuğ Aytaç Çağlar Ayla Akça Tekeli Aysun Bodur Iacute; lknur, Öztürk Betül Güngör Ali Güneylioğlu Muhammed Mustafa Yaradılmış Raziye Merve Akelma Zülfikar",Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,342,21

The response to SARS is examined to determine if there were lessons learned before it disappeared in June and July 2003. Various diagnostic approaches were developed and implemented to assist in the rapid identification of patients and treatment of their illness, yet many of the approaches required days or weeks from the onset of fever to show statistical significance. Most of the therapeutic methods used during the outbreak relied on treating symptoms of the underlying illness, such as lower respiratory infections and systemic infection, rather than effectively suppressing or curtailing replication of the virus.

We recruited 138 consecutive pregnant women attending for first trimester screening (11-13 weeks of gestation) at Sant'Anna Hospital, Turin, Piedmont, Italy, during the plateau and the falling phase of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. Patients were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2 detection in sera and nasopharyngeal swab samples. COVID-19 cumulative incidence during the first trimester was of 10.1% with high prevalence of asymptomatic patients (42.8%). Similar to the course of the disease in non pregnant adults, 80% to 90% of infections were not severe.The prevalence of reported symptoms was four-fold higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (57%) than in those negative (13%) (P < .001), suggesting that direct self-testing should open doors to confirmatory testing for COVID-19.

These chemicals are often difficult to test for mutagenicity by the Ames test because of their low production and peculiar odor. Therefore, application of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach is being considered. We used the StarDrop&#8482; Auto-Modeller&#8482; to develop a new QSAR model. RESULTS: In the first step, we developed a new robust Ames database of 406 food flavor chemicals consisting of existing Ames flavor chemical data and newly acquired Ames test data. Ames results for some existing flavor chemicals have been revised by expert reviews. We also collected 428 Ames test datasets for industrial chemicals from other databases that are structurally similar to flavor chemicals. A total of 834 chemicals' Ames test datasets were used to develop the new QSAR models. We repeated the development and verification of prototypes by selecting appropriate modeling methods and descriptors and developed a local QSAR model. A new QSAR model ""StarDrop NIHS 834_67"" showed excellent performance (sensitivity: 79.5%, specificity: 96.4%, accuracy: 94.6%) for predicting Ames mutagenicity of 406 food flavors and was better than other commercial QSAR tools. CONCLUSIONS: A local QSAR model, StarDrop NIHS 834_67, was customized to predict the Ames mutagenicity of food flavor chemicals and other low molecular weight chemicals. The model can be used to assess the mutagenicity of food flavors without actual testing.","Kasamatsu, Toshio; Kitazawa, Airi; Tajima, Sumie; Kaneko, Masahiro; Sugiyama, Kei-Ichi; Yamada, Masami; Yasui, Manabu; Masumura, Kenichi; Horibata, Katsuyoshi; Honma, Masamitsu",Genes Environ,342,16

Up to 31 May 2020, mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with COVID-19 was 41.6%. Since then, changes in therapeutics and management may have improved outcomes. Also, data from countries affected later in the pandemic are now available. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane databases up to 30 September 2020 for studies reporting ICU mortality among adult patients with COVID-19 and present an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. The primary outcome measure was death in intensive care as a proportion of completed ICU admissions, either through discharge from intensive care or death. We identified 52 observational studies including 43,128 patients, and first reports from the Middle East, South Asia and Australasia, as well as four national or regional registries. Reported mortality was lower in registries compared with other reports. In two regions, mortality differed significantly from all others, being higher in the Middle East and lower in a single registry study from Australasia. Although ICU mortality (95%CI) was lower than reported in June (35.5% (31.3-39.9%) vs. 41.6% (34.0-49.7%)), the absence of patient-level data prevents a definitive evaluation. A lack of standardisation of reporting prevents comparison of cohorts in terms of underlying risk, severity of illness or outcomes. We found that the decrease in ICU mortality from COVID-19 has reduced or plateaued since May 2020 and note the possibility of some geographical variation. More standardisation in reporting would improve the ability to compare outcomes from different reports.","Armstrong, R A; Kane, A D; Kursumovic, E; Oglesby, F C; Cook, T M",Anaesthesia,342,16

Clinical pharmacists are well positioned to expand the patient care services they already provide to address patients' basic social needs, which may otherwise impede medication access and adherence. Objectives The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate the feasibility of expanding a comprehensive medication management (CMM) telepharmacy service to include SDOH support. This service was offered as part of four primary care clinics in rural and underserved North Carolina communities. More specifically, the study aimed to describe the expanded service, evaluate stakeholders' experience with the service, and assess short-term impact on patients with diabetes. Methods Data collected over the first 4 months of implementation included administrative data used to describe the expanded service;a clinic survey and interviews to assess clinic team members' experience with the service;and patient surveys to evaluate patient satisfaction, as well as impact on SDOH self-efficacy and diabetes quality of life. Results Through SDOH screening, the pharmacist identified 26 unresolved COVID-prompted SDOH concerns across 66 patients. These concerns were addressed by the pharmacist through three types of brief interventions, including information provision/education (71%), access to resources (21%), and additional care coordination (7%). Clinic team members perceived the expanded service as highly satisfactory and beneficial. Patients also reported high levels of satisfaction and significantly increased their SDOH self-efficacy and diabetes quality of life as a result of the service. Conclusion These data provide preliminary insights into the expanded role that pharmacists can play to address current population health gaps that can directly impact patients' engagement with their medication regimen and overall health status.","Livet, Melanie Levitt Jordana M.; Lee, Alyssa Easter Jon",Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy,342,24

Thus, through our quantitative approach and trend analysis, the study aims to evaluate the changes in the level of PM2.5 as a major pollutant for the top ten polluted cities in India, with a special emphasis on finding what happened to its concentration after the lockdown ended. Thus, to better understand the nature of variation in PM2.5, we divide the entire 7 months into three periods for our analysis, i.e., before lockdown (1 January to 24 March), during lockdown (25 March to 31 May), and post-lockdown or unlock 1 and 2 (1 June to 31 July). Our investigation reveals that before lockdown, all the top polluted cities of India violating the national standard of PM2.5, as the lockdown begins interestingly, all cities show a momentous reduction in PM2.5 concentration. Further, surprisingly we found that after the post-lockdown period, the concentration of PM2.5 was reduced to minimal, as the average concentration of PM2.5 for all the cities is below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The study reveals that the lockdown has a consequence in improving overall air quality for the top polluted cities in India and further lockdown in the future with proper planning should be considered an alternative approach to restrain excessive emissions.","Roy, Subham; Singha, Nimai",Air Qual Atmos Health,342,16

This review provides indications of CT chest in COVID-19 suspect, positive and recovered patients based on the current scientific evidence and our personal experience. CT chest is not indicated as a routine screening modality due to its poor sensitivity and specificity. However, it is useful in a small subset of COVID-19 suspects who test negative on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with normal/indeterminate chest X-ray (CXR) but have moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms and high index of clinical suspicion. CT chest is not indicated in every RT-PCR-positive patient and should be done only in specific clinical scenarios, where it is expected to significantly contribute in the clinical management such as COVID-19 patients showing unexplained clinical deterioration and/or where other concurrent lung pathology or pulmonary thromboembolism needs exclusion. Serial CXR and point-of-care ultrasound are usually sufficient to evaluate the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. CT chest is also indicated in COVID-19-positive patients with associated co-morbidities (age> 65 yr, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, immune-compromise, etc.) who, despite having mild symptoms and normal/indeterminate CXR, record oxygen saturation of < 93 per cent at rest while breathing room air or de-saturate on six-minute walk test. Finally, CT chest plays a crucial role to rule out lung fibrosis in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection who present with hypoxia/impaired lung function on follow up.

Objective: To estimate the epidemiological profile of pediatric patients with COVID-19, as well as their clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. Materials and methods: A living systemic review was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus and SciELO databases. Observational studies describing clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of pediatric patients with COVID-19 and published between January 1, 2020, and July 20, 2020, were considered for the search; there were no language restrictions. Government, epidemiological, and pre-print papers were also considered. Meta-analyses of single proportion (frequentist approach) and two proportions (Bayesian method) were carried out. The study registration and protocol are available at https://osf.io/y43wm and https://osf.io/r8ktv, respectively. Results: 13 studies, with a total of 9 152 patients, were retrieved. The Bayesian meta-analysis reported that males are more affected by the disease: OR 1.24 (HDI95%: 1.09-1.4). The proportion results calculated by means of the frequentist meta-analysis are: 52% cough (95%CI: 50-55), 0% death (95%CI: 0-0.1), 16% high aspartate transaminase levels (95%CI: 13-19), and 60% lung changes observed in chest X-ray (95%CI: 57-64). Conclusions: Based on the current data, it is not possible to describe accurately the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. However, evidence suggests that males are more affected by the disease and that lung alterations in imaging studies are more frequent than clinical signs such as cough and fever. Laboratory test results are not conclusive and show that different organs and systems of the human body may be affected by SARS-CoV-2. The results reported here must be compared to prospective controlled studies conducted in larger samples and a more rigorous design.","Vasco-Morales, Santiago; Vasco-Toapanta, Cristhian Santiago; Toapanta-Pinta, Paola Cristina",Rev.

According to the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand, one in five people will develop a serious mood disorder, including depression, at some time in their life. Co-designed solutions to increase resilience and well-being in young people have specifically been recognised as part of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy and the New Zealand Health Strategy. Virtual Reality (VR) in mental health is an innovative field. Recent studies support the use of VR technology in the treatment of anxiety, phobia, and pain management. However, there is little research on using VR for supporting, treating and preventing depression. There is also very little work done in offering an individualised VR experience to improve mental health. In our earlier work, we presented iVR, a novel individualised VR experience for enhancing peoples' self-compassion, and in the long run, their mental health, and described its design and architecture. In this paper, we outline the results of a feasibility study conducted recently. Most participants believed introducing elements of choice within iVR enhanced their user experience and that iVR had the potential to enhance people's self-compassion. We also approached seven mental health professionals for feedback, who felt that introducing elements of choice within iVR would increase their knowledge of clients. Our contribution can pave the way for large-scale efficacy testing, clinical use, and cost-effective delivery of intelligent individualised VR technology for mental health therapy in future. © 2021 ACM.","Baghaei, N.; Stemmet, L.; Khaliq, I.; Ahmadi, A.; Halim, I.; Liang, H.

In this paper, we study the impact of COVID-19 on human mobility patterns at the state level within the United States. From the temporal perspective, we find that the change of mobility patterns does not necessarily correlate with government policies and guidelines, but is more related to people's awareness of the pandemic, which is reflected by the search data from Google Trends. Our results show that it takes on average 14 days for the mobility patterns to adjust to the new situation. From the spatial perspective, we conduct a state-level network analysis and clustering using the mobility data from Multiscale Dynamic Human Mobility Flow Dataset. As a result, we find that 1) states in the same cluster have shorter geographical distances; 2) a 14-day delay again is found between the time when the largest number of clusters appears and the peak of Coronavirus-related search queries on Google Trends; and 3) a major reduction in other network flow properties, namely degree, closeness, and betweenness, of all states from the week of March 2 to the week of April 6 (the week of the largest number of clusters).","Wang, Songhe; Wei, Kangda; Lin, Lei; Li, Weizi",,342,13

Recent academic work has offered significant evidence in this regard, but a critical question is still open: Can we accurately identify all new infections that happen every day, without this being forbiddingly expensive, i.e., using only a fraction of the tests needed to test everyone everyday (complete testing)? Group testing offers a powerful toolset for minimizing the number of tests, but it does not account for the time dynamics behind the infections. Moreover, it typically assumes that people are infected independently, while infections are governed by community spread. Epidemiology, on the other hand, does explore time dynamics and community correlations through the well-established continuous-time SIR stochastic network model, but the standard model does not incorporate discrete-time testing and interventions. In this paper, we introduce a""discrete-time SIR stochastic block model""that also allows for group testing and interventions on a daily basis. Our model can be regarded as a discrete version of the continuous-time SIR stochastic network model over a specific type of weighted graph that captures the underlying community structure. We analyze that model w.r.t. the minimum number of group tests needed everyday to identify all infections with vanishing error probability. We find that one can leverage the knowledge of the community and the model to inform nonadaptive group testing algorithms that are order-optimal, and therefore achieve the same performance as complete testing using a much smaller number of tests.","Srinivasavaradhan, Sundara Rajan; Nikolopoulos, Pavlos; Fragouli, Christina; Diggavi, Suhas",,342,16

Thus, host genetic factors may be involved in determining disease presentation and progression. Given that carriers of single cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing variants of the CFTR gene—CF-carriers—are more susceptible to respiratory tract infections, our aim was to determine their likelihood of undergoing severe COVID-19. We implemented a cohort study of 874 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, during the first pandemic wave in Italy. Whole exome sequencing was performed and validated CF-causing variants were identified. Forty subjects (16 females and 24 males) were found to be CF-carriers. Among mechanically ventilated patients, CF-carriers were more represented (8.7%) and they were significantly (p &lt;0.05) younger (mean age 51 years) compared to noncarriers (mean age 61.42 years). Furthermore, in the whole cohort, the age of male CF-carriers was lower, compared to noncarriers (p &lt;0.05). CF-carriers had a relative risk of presenting an abnormal inflammatory response (CRP ≥ 20 mg/dL) of 1.69 (p &lt;0.05) and their hazard ratio of death at day 14 was 3.10 (p &lt;0.05) in a multivariate regression model, adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities.

Moreover, there have been limited evaluations to date of the impact of these sociodemographic factors on the use of telephone versus video visits. Such assessments are crucial to identify, understand, and address differences in care delivery across patient populations, particularly those that could affect access to or quality of care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine changes in ambulatory visit volume and type (ie, in-person vs virtual and telephone vs video visits) by patient sociodemographics during the COVID-19 pandemic at one urban academic medical center. METHODS: We compared volumes and patient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) for visits during the first 11 weeks following the COVID-19 national emergency declaration (March 15 to May 31, 2020) to visits in the corresponding weeks in 2019. Additionally, for visits during the COVID-19 study period, we examined differences in visit type (ie, in-person versus virtual, and telephone versus video visits) by sociodemographics using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Total visit volumes in the COVID-19 study period comprised 51.4% of the corresponding weeks in 2019 (n=80,081 vs n=155,884 visits). Although patient sociodemographics between the COVID-19 study period in 2020 and the corresponding weeks in 2019 were similar, 60.5% (n=48,475) of the visits were virtual, compared to 0% in 2019. Of the virtual visits, 61.2% (n=29,661) were video based, and 38.8% (n=18,814) were telephone based. In the COVID-19 study period, virtual (vs in-person) visits were more likely among patients with race categorized as other (vs White) and patients with Medicare (vs commercial) insurance and less likely for men, patients aged 0-17 years, 65-74 years, or &#8805;75 years (compared to patients aged 18-45 years), and patients with Medicaid insurance or insurance categorized as other. Among virtual visits, compared to telephone visits, video visits were more likely to be adopted by patients aged 0-17 years (vs 18-45 years), but less likely for all other age groups, men, Black (vs White) patients, and patients with Medicare or Medicaid (vs commercial) insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visits comprised the majority of ambulatory visits during the COVID-19 study period, of which a majority were by video. Sociodemographic differences existed in the use of virtual versus in-person and video versus telephone visits. To ensure equitable care delivery, we present five policy recommendations to inform the further development of virtual visit programs and their reimbursement.","Gilson, Sarah F; Umscheid, Craig A; Laiteerapong, Neda; Ossey, Graeme; Nunes, Kenneth J; Shah, Sachin D",JMIR Med Inform,342,1

Information technologies can make this process scalable and allow physicians and nurses to deliver remote healthcare services for patients hospitalized at home. However, a correct and satisfactory usage of technology requires an adequate training of professionals and patients. This paper describes a new model for training healthcare professionals on managing remote ICT-based services for Hospitalization at Home. Methods: The model was defined based on mix-method that combined the PICO model and a User Centred Design methodology, oriented to identify and discover the healthcare professionals needs and the training instruments in the literature that directly involved these professionals. These aspects were used in the definition and development of the assessment framework of the proposed training model. Results: A training model for healthcare professionals focused on achieving an effective uptake of complex digital interventions such as Hospitalization at Home was defined. The selected mix-method led to the identification of four different blocks, that were considered as the main areas to include in a training programme. The model identifies measurable elements for assessing acceptability, workability increment and integration into daily clinical practice outcomes, as well as for evaluating the proposed training content and its outcomes. Conclusions: The proposed training model highlights the key aspects of training health professionals to favour an effective and successful implementation of complex technological healthcare interventions in the context of ICT-based HaH ICT.","Abril-Jiménez, Patricia; Merino-Barbancho, Beatriz; Lombroni, Ivana; Villanueva-Mascato, Samanta; Mallo, Irene; Vera-Muñoz, Cecilia; Arredondo, María Teresa; Fico, Giuseppe",J Med Biol Eng,342,16

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to statistically compare the outcomes of the two strategies, represented by data from Thailand and Sweden, respectively. METHODS: Data for COVID-19 pandemic control from Thailand, representing social restriction, versus data from Sweden, representing the herd immunity plan, collected from January 13 to May 31, 2020, were analyzed by using the SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model. RESULTS: The SIR model analysis demonstrated a beneficial effect of each model on the attenuation of the mortality rate, with lower mortality in social restriction and shorter overall pandemic duration in the herd immunity plan. However, the herd immunity plan demonstrated a higher mortality rate than social restriction (46.9% versus 1.9%) despite the later entry of the virus in Sweden. When the SIR model was used for predicting the COVID-19 status, Sweden was shown to likely end its COVID-19 epidemic earlier than Thailand (268 vs. 368 days). With the nonlinear estimation, at least one log difference between total confirmed cases versus active cases could be used as an indicator for relaxation of the lockdown policy in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: Both the social restriction and herd immunity plans are beneficial for COVID-19 pandemic control in terms of the amelioration of pandemic mortality. The cumulative number of total recovered cases might be a potential parameter that could be used for determining the policy direction for COVID-19 control.","Chancharoenthana, Wiwat; Leelahavanichkul, Asada; Chinpraditsuk, Sutatip; Pongpirul, Krit; Kamolratanakul, Supitcha; Phumratanaprapin, Weerapong; Wilairatana, Polrat; Pitisuttithum, Punnee",Asian Pac. j. allergy immunol,342,21

The most common form of toxic effects of APAP is in the liver where phosphatidylcholine is the major component of the cell membrane with additional associated functionalities. Although this is the case, the effects of APAP on pure phospholipid membranes have been largely ignored. Here, we used DOPC, a commonly found phospholipid in mammalian cell membranes to synthesize large unilamellar vesicles to investigate how the incorporation of APAP changes pure lipid vesicle structure, morphology, and fluidity at different concentrations. We used a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), cryo TEM for structural characterization, and neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectroscopy to investigate dynamics. We showed that the incorporation of Acetaminophen in the lipid bilayer significantly impacts the spherical phospholipid self-assembly in terms of its morphology as well as influences the lipid content in the bilayer, causing a decrease in bending rigidity. We discussed how the overall impact of APAP molecules on the pure lipid membrane may play a significant role in the drug's mechanisms of action. Our results showed the incorporation of APAP reduces membrane rigidity as well as changes the spherical unilamellar vesicles into much more irregularly shaped vesicles. Although bilayer structure did not show much change when observed by SAXS, NSE and cryo-TEM results showed the lipid dynamics change with the addition of APAP in the bilayer which causes the overall decreased membrane rigidity. A strong effect on the lipid tail motion was also observed. rigidity. A strong effect on the lipid tail motion was also observed.","Mel, Judith U.

(Houston, TX, http://www.selleckchem.com) and DrugBank database respectively. Computational methods like molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were used. The molecular docking calculations were performed using LeadIT FlexX software. The molecular dynamics simulations of 100 ns were performed to study conformational stability for all complex systems. Mitoxantrone and Leucovorin from FDA approved drug library and Birinapant and Dynasore from anti-viral drug libraries interact with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at higher efficiency as a result of the improved steric and hydrophobic environment in the binding cavity to make stable complex. Also, the molecular dynamics simulations of 100 ns revealed the mean RMSD value of 2.25 Å for all the complex systems. This shows that lead compounds bound tightly within the Mpro cavity and thus having conformational stability. Glutamic acid (Glu166) of Mpro is a key residue to hold and form a stable complex of reported lead compounds by forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridge. Our findings suggest that Mitoxantrone, Leucovorin, Birinapant, and Dynasore represents potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Lokhande, Kiran Bharat; Doiphode, Sayali; Vyas, Renu; Swamy, K Venkateswara",J Biomol Struct Dyn,342,24

Posterity will judge,19.179289,6.9188695,2020,"BACKGROUND: On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization recognised clusters of pneumonia-like cases due to a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 became a pandemic 71 days later. AIM: To report the clinical and epidemiological features, laboratory data and outcomes of the first group of 11 returned travellers with COVID-19 in Australia. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multi-centre case series. All patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted to tertiary referral hospitals in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. RESULTS: The median age of our patient cohort was 42 years (IQR, 24-53 years) with six men and five women. Eight patients (72.7%) had returned from Wuhan, one from Shenzhen, one from Japan, and one from Europe. Possible human-to-human transmission from close family contacts in gatherings overseas occurred in two cases. Symptoms on admission were fever, cough and sore throat (n = 9, 81.8%). Co-morbidities included hypertension (n = 3, 27.3%) and hypercholesterolaemia (n = 2, 18.2%). No patients developed severe acute respiratory distress nor required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation. After a median hospital stay of 14.5 days (IQR, 6.75-21), all patients were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: This is a historical record of the first COVID-19 cases in Australia during the early biocontainment phase of the national response. These findings were invaluable for establishing early inpatient and outpatient COVID-19 models of care and informing the management of COVID-19 overtime as the outbreak evolved. Future research should extend this Australian case series to examine global epidemiological variation of this novel infection. This article is protected by copyright.

There remains a challenge to determine the extent to which neurological abnormalities in COVID-19 are caused by SARS-Cov2 itself, the exaggerated cytokine response it triggers, and/or the resulting hypercoagulapathy and formation of blood clots in blood vessels throughout the body and the brain. In this article, we review the reports that address neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 who may present with acute neurological symptoms (e.g., stroke), even without typical respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Next, we discuss the different neurobiological processes and mechanisms that may underlie the link between SARS-Cov2 and COVID-19 in the brain, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, and muscles. Finally, we propose a basic ""NeuroCovid"" classification scheme that integrates these concepts and highlights some of the short-term challenges for the practice of neurology today and the long-term sequalae of COVID-19 such as depression, OCD, insomnia, cognitive decline, accelerated aging, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease in the future.

METHODS: A total of 523 patients enrolled from four hospitals in Wuhan, China. The inclusion time was from January 2, 2020 to February 15. Clinical characteristics and laboratory values were obtained from electronic medical records, nursing records, and related examinations. RESULTS: Of these patients, 211 (40.3%) were admitted to the ICU and 115 deaths (22.0%). Patients admitted to the ICU had lower BMI and plasma protein levels. The median Nutrition risk in critically ill (NUTRIC) score of 211 patients in the ICU was 5 (4, 6) and Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) score was 5 (3, 6). The ratio of parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy in non-survivors was greater than that in survivors, and the time to start nutrition therapy was later than that in survivors. The NUTRIC score can independently predict the risk of death in the hospital (OR = 1.197, 95%CI: 1.091-1.445, p = 0.006) and high NRS score patients have a higher risk of poor outcome in the ICU (OR = 1.880, 95%CI: 1.151-3.070, p = 0.012). After adjusted age and sex, for each standard deviation increase in BMI, the risk of in-hospital death was reduced by 13% (HR = 0.871, 95%CI: 0.795-0.955, p = 0.003), and the risk of ICU transfer was reduced by 7% (HR = 0.932, 95%CI:0.885-0.981, p = 0.007). The in-hospital survival time of patients with albumin level &#8804;35 g/L was significantly decreased (15.9 d, 95% CI: 13.7-16.3, vs 24.2 d, 95% CI: 22.3-29.7, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Severe and critical patients with COVID-19 have a high risk of malnutrition. Low BMI and protein levels were significantly associated with adverse events.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 34 patients who were admitted to our hospital from April 16 to May 1, 2020. Data on stress levels, sleep duration, exercise, total diet, snacks, and prepared food intake were obtained from the questionnaires. Changes in the values of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight from 3 months before the administration of the questionnaire to the time the study questionnaire was administered (pandemic year), and those from 15 months before to 12 months before the administration of the questionnaire (pre-pandemic year) were evaluated. Results: Increased stress levels and decreased exercise volumes were observed in approximately 60% and 50% of participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Decreased sleep duration was associated with changes in the body weight for 3 months during pandemic year (r = - 0.40, p = 0.043). Furthermore, compared with changes in HbA1c for 3 months during pre-pandemic year, changes in HbA1c during the pandemic year were worse (0.12% [0.33] % during pandemic year vs. - 0.09 [0.39] % during pre-pandemic year, p = 0.027). Conclusions: Many patients experienced stress and exercised less due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Glycemic control in patients with T1D was worse than that in the previous year. Since the pandemic is currently ongoing, more attention should be paid to stress and lifestyle factor management in patients with T1D.

METHODS: Papers were identified by searching Medline and Google Scholar, reference lists/citations and contacting key authors, with no date or language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were as follows: leukaemia, HSCT+TBI, aged &#8804; 24 years at HSCT and changes in body composition (total fat, central adiposity, adipose tissue function, muscle mass, muscle function). Quality was assessed using a brief Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Of 900 papers, 20 were included: seven controlled, five uncontrolled studies and eight case reports. Study quality appeared good. There was little evidence of differences in total fat/weight for HSCT + TBI groups (compared to healthy controls/population norms/short stature controls). There was some evidence of significantly higher central adiposity and differences in adipose tissue function (compared to leukaemic/non-leukaemic controls). Muscle mass was significantly lower (compared to healthy/obese controls). Muscle function results were inconclusive but suggested impairment. Case reports confirmed a lipodystrophic phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Early remodelling of adipose tissue and loss of skeletal muscle are evident following HSCT + TBI for CTYA leukaemia, with extreme phenotype of overt lipodystrophy. There is some evidence for reduced muscle effectiveness. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Body composition changes in patients after HSCT + TBI are apparent by early adult life and link with the risk of excess cardiometabolic morbidity seen in adult survivors.

The disinsertion of the PM would need increased contributions from intact shoulder musculature to generate shoulder torques. This study aimed to identify neuromuscular compensation strategies adopted by subpectoral implant breast reconstruction patients using novel muscle synergy analyses. Fourteen patients treated bilaterally with subpectoral implant breast reconstruction (>2.5 years post-reconstruction) were compared to ten healthy controls. Surface electromyography was obtained from sixteen shoulder muscles as participants generated eight three-dimensional (3D) shoulder torques in five two-dimensional arm postures bilaterally. Non-negative matrix factorization revealed the muscle synergies utilized by each experimental group on the dominant and non-dominant limbs, and the normalized similarity index assessed group differences in overall synergy structure. Bilateral subpectoral implant patients exhibited similar shoulder strength to healthy controls on the dominant and non-dominant arms. Our results suggest that 3D shoulder torque is driven by three shoulder muscle synergies in both healthy participants and subpectoral implant patients. Two out of three synergies were more similar than is expected by chance between the groups on the non-dominant arm, whereas only one synergy is more similar than is expected by chance on the dominant arm. While bilateral shoulder strength is maintained following bilateral subpectoral implant breast reconstruction, a closer analysis of the muscle synergy patterns underlying 3D shoulder torque generation reveals that subpectoral implant patients adopt compensatory neuromuscular strategies only with the dominant arm.","Leonardis, Joshua M; Wolff, Whitney L; Momoh, Adeyiza O; Lipps, David B",J Biomech,342,1

G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine, quinine, other sulphonamide-containing medicines, and chloroquine, which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We evaluated the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana, a malaria-endemic country. Methods: We obtained the geographic information of 100 randomly sampled clinics previously included in a cross-sectional survey. We also obtained the geolocated data of all public hospitals providing G6PD deficiency testing services in the region. Using ArcGIS 10.5, we quantified geographical access to G6PD deficiency screening test and identified clinics as well as visualize locations with poor access for targeted improvement. The travel time was estimated using an assumed speed of 20 km per hour. Findings: Of the 100 clinics, 58% were Community-based Health Planning and Services facilities, and 42% were sub-district health centers. The majority (92%) were Ghana Health Service facilities, and the remaining 8% were Christian Health Association of Ghana facilities. Access to G6PD deficiency screening test was varied across the districts, and G6PD deficiency screening test was available in all eight public hospitals. This implies that the health facility-to-population ratio for G6PD deficiency testing service was approximately 1:159,210 (8/1,273,677) population. The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 ± 14 km, and travel time (68 ± 27 min). The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 ± 11 km, and travel time (46 ± 33 min). Conclusion: Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor. Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries. To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.","Kuupiel, Desmond; Adu, Kwame M.; Bawontuo, Vitalis; Adogboba, Duncan A.; Drain, Paul K.; Moshabela, Mosa; Mashamba-Thompson, Tivani P.",Diagn.,342,24

Across the United States, social distancing measures have been put in place, including stay-at-home (SAH) orders, to combat the spread of this infection. This has impacted the type and volume of traumatic injuries sustained during this time. Meanwhile, steps have been taken in our health care system to assure that adequate resources are available to maintain a high standard of patient care while recognizing the importance of protecting health care providers. Using comparative data, we aim to describe the trends in traumatic injuries managed by our plastic surgery service and detail the changes in consultation policies made to minimize provider exposure. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all plastic surgery emergencies at our institution during the 3 weeks preceding the issuance of SAH orders in Chicago and the 3 weeks after. The electronic medical record was queried for patient age, type and mechanism of injury, location where injury was sustained, presence of domestic violence, length of inpatient hospital stays, and treatment rendered. The two 3-week periods were then comparatively analyzed to determine differences and trends in these variables and treatment rendered. The 2 periods were then comparatively analyzed to determine differences and trends in these variables. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in trauma consults since the issuance of SAH (88 pre-SAH vs 62 post-SAH) with a marked decrease in trauma-related hand injuries. There was an increase in the percentage of assault-related injuries including those associated with domestic violence, whereas there was an overall decrease in motor vehicle collisions. There was no notable change in the location where injuries were sustained. Significantly fewer patients were seen by house staff in the emergency room, whereas those requiring surgical intervention were able to receive care without delay. CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home orders in Chicago have impacted traumatic injury patterns seen by the Section of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at a level I Trauma Center.

The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis. ACE2 expressed on enterocytes and colonocytes could serve as an alternative route for acquiring COVID-19. Experimental models proposed some probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius, as vectors for delivering or enhancing efficacy of anti-coronavirus vaccines. These Lactobacillus probiotics were also beneficial for diabetes. The potential mechanisms for interconnections between coronavirus, diabetes, and gut microbiota could be related to the immune system, ACE2 pathway, and metformin treatment. There were suggestions but no proof supporting probiotics benefits for COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that the host environment including the gut microbiota could play a role for COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. It is a challenge to the scientific community to investigate the beneficial potential of the gut microbiota for strengthening host defense against coronavirus in patients with diabetes.","Barengolts, Elena; Smith, Emily Daviau",Endocr Pract,342,7

The Asociación Española de Gastroenterología [Spanish Association of Gastroenterology] (AEG) and the Sociedad Española de Endoscopia Digestiva [Spanish Association of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy] (SEED) have proposed the EPAGE guidelines for managing postponed colonoscopies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the EPAGE guidelines as a management tool compared to the immunologic faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) and compared to risk score (RS) that combines age, sex and the iFOBT for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and significant bowel disease (SBD). METHODS: A prospective, single-centre study enrolling 743 symptomatic patients referred for a diagnostic colonoscopy. Each order was classified according to the EPAGE guidelines as appropriate, indeterminate or inappropriate. Patients underwent an iFOBT and had their RS calculated. RESULTS: The iFOBT (p <0.001), but not the EPAGE guidelines (p = 0.742), was an independent predictive factor of risk of CRC. The ROC AUCs for the EPAGE guidelines, the iFOBT and the RS were 0.61 (95%CI 0.49-0.75), 0.95 (0.93-0.97) and 0.90 (0.87-0.93) for CRC, and 0.55 (0.49-0.61), 0.75 (0.69-0.813) and 0.78 (0.73-0.83) for SBD, respectively. The numbers of colonoscopies needed to detect a case of CRC and a case of SBD were 38 and 7 for the EPAGE guidelines, 7 and 2 for the iFOBT, and 19 and 4 for a RS &#8805;5 points, respectively. CONCLUSION: The EPAGE guidelines, unlike the iFOBT, is not suitable for screening candidate patients for a diagnostic colonoscopy to detect CRC. The iFOBT, in combination with age and sex, is the most suitable strategy for managing demand for endoscopy in a restricted-access situation.","Rodríguez-Alonso, Lorena; Rodríguez-Moranta, Francisco; Maisterra, Sandra; Botargues, Josep M; Berrozpe, Ana; Ruíz-Cerulla, Alexandra; Suris, Gerard; Camps, Blau; Gornals, Joan B; Guardiola, Jordi",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

Although it is known that the risk of severe disease is increased in certain human populations, including the elderly, it remains unclear why others who consume contaminated food develop listeriosis. Here, we used a murine model to discover that pulmonary coinfections can impair the host's ability to adequately control and eradicate systemic Lm that cross from the intestines to the bloodstream. We found that the resistance of mice to oral Lm infection was dramatically reduced by coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), a bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract and can also cause severe infections in the elderly. Exposure to Spn or microbial products, including a recombinant Lm protein (L1S) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), rendered otherwise resistant hosts susceptible to severe systemic Lm infection. In addition, we show that this increase in susceptibility was dependent on an increase in the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) from Ncr1+ cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Lastly, the ability of Ncr1+ cell derived IL-10 to increase disease susceptibility correlated with a dampening of both myeloid cell accumulation and myeloid cell phagocytic capacity in infected tissues. These data suggest that efforts to minimize inflammation in response to an insult at the respiratory mucosa render the host more susceptible to infections by Lm and possibly other pathogens that access the oral mucosa.","Bortell, Nikki; Aguilera, Elizabeth R; Lenz, Laurel L",PLoS Pathog,342,16

Inflammatory mediators secreted from activated glial cells, neurons, and mast cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of TBI through secondary brain damage. Abnormalities or damage to the neurovascular unit is the indication of secondary injuries in the brain after TBI. However, the precise mechanisms of molecular and ultrastructural neurovascular alterations involved in the pathogenesis of acute TBI are not yet clearly understood. Moreover, currently, there are no precision-targeted effective treatment options to prevent the sequelae of TBI. In this study, mice were subjected to closed head weight-drop-induced acute TBI and evaluated neuroinflammatory and neurovascular alterations in the brain by immunofluorescence staining or quantitation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure. Mast cell stabilizer drug cromolyn was administered to inhibit the neuroinflammatory response of TBI. Results indicate decreased level of pericyte marker platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-ß) and BBB-associated tight junction proteins junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in the brains 7 days after weight-drop-induced acute TBI as compared with the brains from sham control mice indicating acute TBI-associated BBB/tight junction protein disruption. Further, the administration of cromolyn drug significantly inhibited acute TBI-associated decrease of PDGFR-ß, JAM-A, and ZO-1 in the brain. These findings suggest that acute TBI causes BBB/tight junction damage and that cromolyn administration could protect this acute TBI-induced brain damage as well as its long-time consequences.","Kempuraj, Duraisamy; Ahmed, Mohammad Ejaz; Selvakumar, Govindhasamy Pushpavathi; Thangavel, Ramasamy; Raikwar, Sudhanshu P; Zaheer, Smita A; Iyer, Shankar S; Govindarajan, Raghav; Nattanmai Chandrasekaran, Premkumar; Burton, Casey; James, Donald; Zaheer, Asgar",,342,20

Little is known about the challenges to advance care planning in this context, or the changes services made to adapt. AIM: Describe the challenges that UK specialist palliative care services experienced regarding advance care planning during COVID-19 and changes made to support timely conversations. DESIGN: Online survey of UK palliative/hospice services' response to COVID-19. Closed-ended responses are reported descriptively. Open-ended responses were analysed using a thematic Framework approach using the Social Ecological Model to understand challenges. RESPONDENTS: Two hundred and seventy-seven services. RESULTS: More direct advance care planning was provided by 38% of services, and 59% provided more support to others. Some challenges to advance care planning pre-dated the pandemic, whilst others were specific to/exacerbated by COVID-19. Challenges are demonstrated through six themes: complex decision making in the face of a new infectious disease; maintaining a personalised approach; COVID-19-specific communication difficulties; workload and pressure; sharing information; and national context of fear and uncertainty. Two themes demonstrate changes made to support: adapting local processes and adapting local structures. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals and healthcare providers need to ensure advance care planning is individualised by tailoring it to the values, priorities, and ethnic/cultural/religious context of each person. Policymakers need to consider how high-quality advance care planning can be resourced as a part of standard healthcare ahead of future pandemic waves.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a key player in the viral entry into cells through its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein, and the RBD has therefore been crucial as a drug target. In this study, we used phage display to develop human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. A human synthetic Fab phage display library was panned against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2 RBD), yielding ten unique Fabs with moderate apparent affinities (EC50 = 19-663 nM) for the SARS-2 RBD. All of the Fabs showed no cross-reactivity to the MERS-CoV spike protein, while three Fabs cross-reacted with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Five Fabs showed neutralizing activities in in vitro assays based on the Fabs' activities antagonizing the interaction between the SARS-2 RBD and ACE2. Reformatting the five Fabs into immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (KD = 0.08-1.0 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity, without compromising their non-aggregating properties and thermal stability. Furthermore, two of the mAbs (D12 and C2) significantly showed neutralizing activities on pseudo-typed and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Given their desirable properties and neutralizing activities, we anticipate that these human anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs would be suitable reagents to be further developed as antibody therapeutics to treat COVID-19, as well as for diagnostics and research tools.","Kim, Yu Jung; Lee, Min Ho; Lee, Se-Ra; Chung, Hyo-Young; Kim, Kwangmin; Lee, Tae Gyu; Kim, Dae Young",Int. j. mol. sci.

The central role of SAA in pathogenesis of IRD has been confirmed by recent discoveries, including its involvement in the activation of the inflammasome cascade and recruitment of interleukin 17 producing T helper cells. Clinical utility of SAA in IRD was originally evaluated nearly half a century ago. From the first findings, it was clear that SAA could be used for evaluating disease severity and monitoring disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary amyloidosis. However, cost-effective and more easily applicable markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), overwhelmed its use in clinical practice. In the light of emerging evidences, SAA has been discerned as a more sensitive biomarker in a wide spectrum of IRD, especially in case of subclinical inflammation. Furthermore, a growing number of studies are confirming the advantages of SAA over many other biomarkers in predicting and monitoring response to biological immunotherapy in IRD patients. Arising scientific discoveries regarding the role of SAA, as well as delineating SAA and its isoforms as the most sensitive biomarkers in various IRD by recently developing proteomic techniques are encouraging the revival of its clinical use. Finally, the most recent findings have shown that SAA is a biomarker of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this review is to discuss the SAA-involving immune system network with emphasis on mechanisms relevant for IRD, as well as usefulness of SAA as a biomarker in various IRD. Therefore, over a hundred original papers were collected through an extensive PubMed and Scopus databases search.

The major components of the GBM include laminins, type IV collagen, nidogens and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In addition, the GBM harbours a number of other structural and regulatory components and provides a reservoir for growth factors. New technologies have improved our ability to study the composition and assembly of basement membranes. We now know that the GBM is a complex macromolecular structure that undergoes key transitions during glomerular development. Defects in GBM components are associated with a range of hereditary human diseases such as Alport syndrome, which is caused by defects in the genes COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5, and Pierson syndrome, which is caused by variants in LAMB2. In addition, the GBM is affected by acquired autoimmune disorders and metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Current treatments for diseases associated with GBM involvement aim to reduce intraglomerular pressure and to treat the underlying cause where possible. As our understanding about the maintenance and turnover of the GBM improves, therapies to replace GBM components or to stimulate GBM repair could translate into new therapies for patients with GBM-associated disease.","Naylor, Richard W; Morais, Mychel R P T; Lennon, Rachel",Nature reviews.

However, some conditions, such as exclusiveness hypothesis and completeness constraint, limit its development and application to a large extend. To overcome these shortcomings in Dempster-Shafer theory and enhance its capability of representing uncertain information, a novel theory called D numbers theory is systematically proposed in this paper. Within the proposed theory, uncertain information is expressed by D numbers, reasoning and synthesization of information are implemented by D numbers combination rule. The proposed D numbers theory is an generalization of Dempster-Shafer theory, which inherits the advantage of Dempster-Shafer theory and strengthens its capability of uncertainty modelling.","Deng, Xinyang; Deng, Yong",,342,29

The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US. Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.","Scheen, A J; Marre, M; Thivolet, C",Diabetes metab,342,16

Aim of this study was to assess the patients' perceptions on the risk or benefit of RAAS-I use in the COVID-19 era. Design and method: Patients visiting the emergency (non-COVID) department or the outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital in Northern Greece were invited to participate by completing a short questionnaire. This observational study was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 (April to June 2020) and would restart at an imminent second wave. Analyses included only questionnaires from the first wave (which was apparently well controlled in Greece) and were performed by IBM SPSS Statistics. Results: In total 178 patients (94 women, 52.8%) taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) participated (mean age 63.8±10.2 years). About half (97, 54.4%) were taking RAASi for hypertension, while the rest for other indications. The vast majority (160, 92.1%) were aware of the issue that some antihypertensive drugs might be harmful (mainly from TV reports), although almost one third (51, 31.9%) were not sure if they were prescribed such drugs. One fifth of the patients had contacted their doctor inquiring if they were taking such drugs and if, in that case, they could replace it. Only three patients altered their therapeutic regimen. Of note, the majority of patients (151, 84.8%) reported that the chances of getting COVID-19 were low or somewhat low, though they feel more susceptible to catch it (128, 65.7%) or that they will have a more severe disease course (136, 76.4%). Disturbingly, none of the patients had been informed of the position of major scientific societies that patients should not stop taking RAAS-i. Conclusions: Greek patients appear to be aware of the issue relating the RAAS-i with the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless they seem lacking information from their healthcare providers or from scientific bodies. Further research is warranted to assess whether patient oriented informative campaigns could comfort the concerns.","Ioannidis, A.; Paraskelidou, M.; Pechlevanis, A.; Fragkiskou, A.",Journal of Hypertension,342,1

METHODS: Data were from a large longitudinal cohort study of Australian parents of a child aged 0-18 years collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was used to measure resilience, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) measured distress (i.e., composite of stress, anxiety and depression scales). Other factors assessed included: age, gender, being born overseas, number of children, self-assessed introversion, social, educational and economic variables, family resources, positive affect and emotional regulation, external social support, and partner social support. Hierarchical regression models and a moderation analysis were used to assess the aims. RESULTS: Of 2110 parents, 1701 (80.6%) were female. The mean age was 38 years old (SD = 7, range = 19-69). High loneliness was a key contributor to distress. The level of social support received did add significantly to distress, with greater assistance associated with lower stress and anxiety (both p < .01). Partner support significantly moderated the relationship between resilience and depression; however, this relationship is of unlikely clinical significance due to its small statistical effect. CONCLUSION: Interventions targeting resilience against distress and mental health of parents at the time of pandemics should focus on reducing loneliness while working with the constraints of imposed social isolation and might include partners. Qualitative studies are needed to understand the various useful and not useful aspects of partner's support.","Mikocka-Walus, Antonina; Stokes, Mark; Evans, Subhadra; Olive, Lisa; Westrupp, Elizabeth",J Psychosom Res,342,16

The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-ASIPP Risk Mitigation & Stratification (COVID-ARMS) Return to Practice Task Force in order to provide guidance for safe and strategic reopening. OBJECTIVES: The aims are to provide education and guidance for interventional pain specialists and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic that minimizes COVID-related morbidity while allowing a return to interventional pain care. METHODS: The methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards, appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest, as well as a panel of experts from various regions, specialities, and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification were reviewed. The principles of best evidence synthesis of available literature and grading for recommendations as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) typically utilized in ASIPP guideline preparation was not utilized in these guidelines due to limitations because of their lack of available literature on COVID-19, risk mitigation and stratification. These guidelines are considered evidence -- informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS: Numerous risk factors have emerged that predispose patients to contracting COVID-19 and/or having a more severe course of the infection. COVID-19 may have mild symptoms, even be asymptomatic, or may be severe and life threatening. Older age and certain comorbidities, such as underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, have been associated with worse outcomes. In pain care, COVID-19 patients are a heterogeneous group with some individuals relatively healthy and having only a short course of manageable symptoms while others become critically ill. It is necessary to assess patients on a case-by-case basis and craft individualized care recommendations. A COVID-ARMS risk stratification tool was created to quickly and objectively assess patients. Interventional pain specialists and their patients may derive important benefits from evidence-informed risk stratification, protective strategies to prevent infection, and the gradual resumption of treatments and procedures to manage pain. LIMITATIONS: COVID-19 was an ongoing pandemic at the time during which these recommendations were developed. The pandemic has created a fluid situation in terms of evidence-informed guidance. As more and better evidence is gathered, these recommendations may be modified. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain patients require continuity of care but during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, steps must be taken to stratify risks and protect patients from possible infection to safeguard them from COVID-19-related illness and transmitting the disease to others. Pain specialists should optimize telemedicine encounters with their pain patients, be cognizant of risks of COVID-19 morbidity, and take steps to evaluate risk-benefit on a case-by-case basis. Pain specialists may return to practice with lower-risk patients and appropriate safeguards.","Shah, Shalini; Diwan, Sudhir; Soin, Amol; Rajput, Kartic; Mahajan, Amit; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Kaye, Alan D; Hirsch, Joshua A; Gharibo, Christopher",Pain Physician,342,33

This framework enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic and informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on turning period for the world's current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible-Exposed- Infective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning. Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the Lockdown and Isolation Control Program in Wuhan since January 23, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines represent an opportunity to decrease the rate of severe COVID-19 cases in patients with cancer and also to restore normal cancer care. Patients with cancer to be targeted for vaccination are difficult to define owing to the limited contribution of these patients in the phase III trials testing the different vaccines. It seems appropriate to vaccinate not only patients with cancer with ongoing treatment or with a treatment having been completed less than 3 years ago but also household and close contacts. High-risk patients with cancer who are candidates for priority access to vaccination are those treated by chemotherapy. The very high-priority population includes patients with curative treatment and palliative first- or second-line chemotherapy, as well as patients requiring surgery or radiotherapy involving a large volume of lung, lymph node and/or haematopoietic tissue. When possible, vaccination should be carried out before cancer treatment begins. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be performed during chemotherapy while avoiding periods of neutropenia and lymphopenia. For organisational reasons, vaccination should be performed in cancer care centres with messenger RNA vaccines (or non-replicating adenoviral vaccines in non-immunocompromised patients). Considering the current state of knowledge, the benefit-risk ratio strongly favours SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of all patients with cancer. To obtain more data concerning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, it is necessary to implement cohorts of vaccinated patients with cancer.","Tougeron, David; Hentzien, Maxime; Seitz-Polski, Barbara; Bani-Sadr, Firouze; Bourhis, Jean; Ducreux, Michel; Gaujoux, Sébastien; Gorphe, Philippe; Guiu, Boris; Hoang-Xuan, Khê; Huguet, Florence; Lecomte, Thierry; Lièvre, Astrid; Louvet, Christophe; Maggiori, Léon; Mansi, Laura; Mariani, Pascale; Michel, Pierre; Servettaz, Amélie; Thariat, Juliette; Westeel, Virgine; Aparicio, Thomas; Blay, Jean-Yves; Bouché, Olivier",Eur J Cancer,342,1

We investigated the status of 113 pediatric hematological patients in Wuhan union hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic from January 23 to March 10, 2020. All the patients had routine blood and biochemical examination, as well as chest computed tomography scans, and the nucleic acid, immunoglobulin G-immunoglobulin M combined antibodies tests for SARS-CoV-2. After admission, all patients were single-room isolated for 5 to 7 days. The results showed that only 1 (0.88%) child with leukemia was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and 15 (13.2%) children were considered as suspected cases. Comparing to the nonsuspected patients, the suspected cases had lower white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, neutrophil count, serum calcium ion level and serum albumin concentration, as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein. All the suspected cases were ruled out of SARS-CoV-2 infection by twice negative tests for the virus. Therefore, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hematological malignancy children was low during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. COVID-19 got early detected and the virus spread out in the ward was effectively blocked by increasing test frequency and using single-room isolation for 5 to 7 days after admission.","Wang, Zhujun; Shen, Yaqing; Jin, Runming; Yu, Hui; Zhou, Fen; Xu, Jiawei; Qiu, Yining; Wang, Lin; Wu, Xiaoyan",J. pediatr. hematol. oncol,342,24

Taj proces je u robnom dijelu nadomješten jeftinijim proizvodima izrad strok signenima u dalekim zemljama s nižim plaćama radnika, ali i radnim i ekološkim standardima, a financijski je nadomješten proizvodnjom u tercijarnim djelatnostima, tj. uslugama. Med strok signutim ovaj rad pokazuje kako su za vrijeme nedavne Velike ekonomske krize zemlje s jačom industrijom brže izlazile iz krize.

Uz to, dodani su indeks kvalitete upravljanja te udio javnoga duga u BDP-u. Analiza je pokazala kako udio prerad strok signivačke industrije u BDP-u uvećan za 1 postotni poen uzrokuje skraćivanje recesije za 0,27 kvartala. Isto tako, na krizu ima utjecaja i država, u vidu kvalitete upravljanja (povećanje indeksa kvalitete upravljanja za 1 skraćuje recesiju za 0,15 kvartala) te manevarskog prostora za poticanje potražnje (svaki postotni poen javnoga duga produžuje recesiju za 0,05 kvartala). Nadalje, analiza je pokazala kako su početni uvjeti 2008. i 2019. godine takvi da bi nova kriza, bez pojave epidemije, trajala 13,5% dulje nego Velika kriza. Stoga bi se proces deindustrijalizacije trebao promatrati s posebnom pažnjom jer se time, pokazuje se, umanjuje automatska protuciklička snaga ekonomije, posebno važna u trenutcima nadolaska još nezabilježene ekonomske krize uzorkovane epidemijom COVID-19.Alternate abstract:In the European Union there is a long-term tendency of deindustrialization. This production gap was substituted with cheap goods from the overseas countries where salaries and working and environmental standards are much lower. A GDP gap was compensated with services sector. However, in this paper it was shown that, during recent Great economic crisis, the speed of recovery of the countries with stronger manufacturing was higher than in the countries with low manufacturing participation in GDP. An econometric model is built, showing how share of manufacturing in GDP of the countries of EU is negatively related to the length of recession in these countries: each 1% point rise in that share shortnes crisis by 0,27 quarters. The model also included a composite governance quality index: each index point rise is related to the 0,15 recession quarters shortening. Also, countries' economic ability to interveine, measured as a share of public debt in GDP, showed that each 1% point of public debt in GDP prolongues recession by 0,05 quarters. The analysis has also shown that, based on the initial conditions before the epidemics, the new risis would last 13,5% longer than The great crisis. These findings provide useful ground for studying deindustrialization processes and its negative effects on the automatic stabilization, which is of utter importance for the imminent crisis caused by COVID-19 disease.","Herceg, Tomislav",Business Excellence,342,20

While this question is usually answered based on demographics (e. g., population age), health policy (e.g., quarantine), or economic factors, we argue that cultural variance across countries is just as crucial in understanding how susceptible a society is to the COVID-19 outbreak. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed data collected across 69 countries and examined the relationship between culture and the impact of COVID. Next, we conducted two studies to validate our findings further and explore the mechanism at hand. As expected, we found that the more individualistic (vs. collectivistic) a country was, the more COVID-19 cases and mortalities it had. We also found that the more individualistic participants were, the higher the chances they would not adhere to epidemic prevention measures. These findings are important in understanding the spread of the pandemic, devising optimal exit strategies from lockdowns, and persuading the population to get the new vaccine against the virus.","Maaravi, Yossi; Levy, Aharon; Gur, Tamar; Confino, Dan; Segal, Sandra",Front Public Health,342,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process, with educators now required to quickly adapt to and adopt such changes. The abundance of available systematic reviews has made the effectiveness of such approaches ambiguous especially in healthcare education. Therefore, a protocol of the overview of systematic reviews (OoSR) is planned to extrapolate the effectiveness of technology-based learning in undergraduate healthcare education. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Scopus, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection databases were selected. Screening was conducted independently by at least two authors and the decision for inclusion was done through discussion or involvement of an arbiter against a predetermined criteria. Included articles will be evaluated for quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews and Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tools, while primary systematic review articles will be cross-checked and reported for any overlapping using the 'corrected covered area' method. Only narrative synthesis will be employed according to the predefined themes into two major dimensions-theory and knowledge generation (focusing on cognitive taxonomy due to its ability to be generalised across disciplines), and clinical-based competence (focusing on psychomotor and affective taxonomies due to discipline-specific influence). The type of technology used will be identified and extracted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The OoSR involves analysis of secondary data from published literature, thus ethical approval is not required. The findings will provide a valuable insight for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers in terms of technology-based learning implementation and gaps identification. The findings will be published in several reports due to the extensiveness of the topic and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conferences.

In this three-month follow-up study, we examined discharged patients who had received hUC-MSC therapy to assess the safety of this therapy and the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of these patients. The follow-up cohort consisted of 28 discharged severe COVID-19 patients who received either the standard treatment (the control group) or the standard treatment plus hUC-MSC therapy. We examined liver function, kidney function, pulmonary function, coagulation, tumor markers, and vision. We also conducted electrocardiography (ECG) analysis, let the patients answer the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and performed computed tomography (CT) imaging for assessing the lung changes. No obvious adverse effects were observed in the hUC-MSC group after three months. Measurements of blood routine index, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, liver and kidney function, coagulation, ECG, tumor markers, and vision were almost within the normal ranges in both the treatment and control groups. Forced expiratory volumes in 1 s (FEV1) (% of predicted) were 71.88±8.46% and 59.45±27.45% in the hUC-MSC and control groups (P<0.01), respectively, and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratios were 79.95±8.00% and 58.97±19.16% in the hUC-MSC and control groups, respectively (P<0.05). SGRQ scores were lower in the hUC-MSC group than in the control group (15.25±3.69 vs. 31.9±8.78, P<0.05). The rate of wheezing in the hUC-MSC group was also significantly lower than that in the control group (37.5% vs. 75%, P<0.05). There were no significant differences in CT scores between the two groups (0.60±0.88 vs. 1.00±1.31, P=0.917).

However, the conformational pathway leading to the nucleation-competent state is unclear due to lack of high-resolution structures of the activated state. Here we report a ~3.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of activated Schizosaccharomyces pombe Arp2/3 complex bound to the S. pombe NPF Dip1 and attached to the end of the nucleated actin filament. The structure reveals global and local conformational changes that allow the two actin-related proteins in Arp2/3 complex to mimic a filamentous actin dimer and template nucleation. Activation occurs through a clamp-twisting mechanism, in which Dip1 forces two core subunits in Arp2/3 complex to pivot around one another, shifting half of the complex into a new activated position. By showing how Dip1 stimulates activation, the structure reveals how NPFs can activate Arp2/3 complex in diverse cellular processes.","Shaaban, Mohammed; Chowdhury, Saikat; Nolen, Brad J",Nat. struct. mol. biol,342,5

This study aimed to investigate the coping strategies among the healthcare workers from different countries and their attitude towards teamwork during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by using an online, web-based questionnaire, which was distributed to healthcare workers from 32 countries during April and May 2020. The respondents were recruited by the non-random convenience sampling method. Results: A total of 2166 respondents responded to the survey and the majority were working in low- and middle-income countries. Among them, 36% were doctors, 24% were nurses and 40% worked in other healthcare sectors. More than 70% of the respondents answered that ""getting family support"" and ""positive thinking"" were coping methods for them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately half of the respondents worshiped according to their belief and conducted prayers (58.4%) and had adequate sleep and food intake (48.2%). The significant associations were observed between attitude score towards interprofessional teamwork and gender (pâ¯=â¯0.009), age (31-45 years) (pâ¯<â¯0.001), marital status (pâ¯<â¯0.001), occupation (pâ¯<â¯0.001), working experience (2-5 years) (pâ¯=â¯0.005), current workplace (clinics) (pâ¯=â¯0.002).

Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogs. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i + 3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.","Gordon, Calvin J; Tchesnokov, Egor P; Feng, Joy Y; Porter, Danielle P; Götte, Matthias",J Biol Chem,342,24

METHODS: We analyzed four random samples of 1,000,000 beneficiaries each from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. The direct age-standardized rate, with 95% confidence interval (CI), was used to compare EI rates for the four calendar years. The chi-square test and chi-square test for trend were used to compare data for the four calendar years. RESULTS: Annual EI incidence rates were between 2.57% in 2000 and 3.28% in 2015. The age-standardized rates were 2.73% (95% CI, 2.70%-2.76%) in 2000, 3.37% (95% CI, 3.33%-3.41%) in 2005, 3.31% (95% CI, 3.28%-3.35%) in 2010, and 3.02% (95% CI, 2.99%-3.06%) in 2015. Manual workers had the highest EI incidence rate, followed by non-manual workers and civil servants. The proportion of EI requiring inpatient treatment declined from 1.34% in 2000 to 0.63% in 2015 (P <0.0001). Analysis of seasonality showed a consistent decrease in February in the four sampling years; however, this decrease in EI was only seen in outpatients, not in EI requiring hospitalization. The proportion of outpatients requiring surgery significantly decreased, from 2.53% in 2000 to 1.2% in 2015 (P<0.0001). However, the proportion of inpatients requiring surgery for EI as the principal diagnosis increased from 69.32% in 2000 to 83.02% in 2015 (P = 0.29), and the proportion of inpatients requiring surgery for EI as a secondary diagnosis increased from 54.86% in 2000 to 71.6% in 2015 (P = 0.0019). Among inpatients with EI, the most common cause of EI was a traffic accident (44.79%, especially motorcycles), followed by falls (9.75%) and homicide (6.05%). CONCLUSION: In Taiwan, the annual EI incidence rate slightly increased from 2000 to 2005 and then decreased through 2015. The proportion of EI patients requiring hospitalization decreased from 1.34% in 2000 to 0.63% in 2015, but the percentage of inpatients requiring surgery increased. Traffic accidents (especially those involving motorcyclists) remained the predominant external cause of EI requiring hospitalization during the study period.","Lee, Jiahn-Shing; Chen, Wei-Min; Huang, Lu-Hsiang; Chung, Chia-Chi; Yu, Kuang-Hui; Kuo, Chang-Fu; See, Lai-Chu",PLoS One,342,21

This information can be used to detect the presence of the virus in indoor environments. OBJECTIVE: To validate the COVID-19 Indoor TestTM by Phylagen as part of the AOAC Research Institute's Emergency Response Validation Performance Tested MethodSM program. METHODS: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen assay was evaluated for specificity using in silico analysis of 15,764 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and 65 exclusivity organisms. The candidate method was also evaluated in an unpaired matrix study design for one environmental surface (stainless steel) and compared to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Revision 4, Effective 6/12/2020). RESULTS: Results of the in silico analysis demonstrated the specificity of the method in being able to detect SARS-CoV-2 target sequences and discriminate them from near-neighbors. In the matrix study, the candidate method demonstrated statistically significant better recovery of the target analyte then the reference method (2 x 103 GU/2"" x 2"" test surface). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen is a rapid and accurate method that can be utilized to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, on stainless steel surfaces in built environments. HIGHLIGHTS: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen assay performed significantly better than the reference method when used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from environmental surfaces.","Fantin, Nick; Taft, Brad; Ugalde, Juan; Spring, Katie; Lam, Hannah; Tran, Alex; Green, Jessica",J.

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.","Madubueze, Chinwendu E; Dachollom, Sambo; Onwubuya, Isaac Obiajulu",Comput Math Methods Med,342,2

Traditionally, information and health communications issued by respected and established government agencies have been regarded as factual, unbiased and credible. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is such an agency that addresses all aspects of health and public health on behalf of the U.S Government for the benefit of its citizens. In July 2020, the CDC issued guidelines on reopening schools which resulted in open criticism by the U.S. President and others, prompting a review and publication of revised guidelines together with a special ""Statement on the Importance of Reopening Schools under COVID-19."" We hypothesize that this statement introduced bias with the intention to shift the public perception and media narrative in favor of reopening of schools. Using a mixed methods approach, including an online text analysis tool, we demonstrate that document title and structure, word frequencies, word choice, and website presentation did not provide a balanced account of the complexity and uncertainty surrounding school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite available scientific guidance and practical evidence-based advice on how to manage infection risks when reopening schools, the CDC Statement was intentionally overriding possible parent and public health concerns.

Dietary deficiencies of micronutrients can weaken adaptive immunity. The aim of this review was to examine links between micronutrients, immune function and COVID-19 infection, with a focus on nutritional risks in subgroups of the Swiss population. METHODS: Scoping review on the associations between selected micronutrients (vitamins D and C, iron, selenium, zinc, and n-3 PUFAs) and immunity, with particular reference to the Swiss population. These nutrients were chosen because previous EFSA reviews have concluded they play a key role in immunity. RESULTS: The review discusses the available knowledge on links between sufficient nutrient status, optimal immune function, and prevention of respiratory tract infections. Because of the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, controlled intervention studies of micronutrients in the context of COVID-19 infection are now underway, but evidence is not yet available to draw conclusions. The anti-inflammatory properties of n-3 PUFAs are well established. In Switzerland, several subgroups of the population are at clear risk of nutrient deficiencies; e.g., older adults, multiple comorbidities, obesity, pregnancy, and institutionalized. Low intakes of n-3 PUFA are present in a large proportion of the population. CONCLUSION: There are clear and strong relationships between micronutrient and n-3 PUFA status and immune function, and subgroups of the Swiss population are at risk for deficient intakes. Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a complement to a healthy and balanced diet, it may be prudent to consider supplementation with a combination of moderate doses of Vitamins C and D, as well as of Se, Zn and n-3 PUFA, in risk groups.","Berger, Mette M; Herter-Aeberli, Isabelle; Zimmermann, Michael B; Spieldenner, Jörg; Eggersdorfer, Manfred",Clin Nutr ESPEN,342,16

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) containing regimens are standard of care in the majority of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) patients. It remains unclear whether therapies should be modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed an online survey among physicians involved in the treatment of mccRCC, and 41 experts responded. Questions focused on criteria relevant for treatment decision outside the pandemic and the modifications of systemic therapy during COVID-19. FINDINGS: For the majority of experts (73%), the combination of International metastatic renal cell carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk category and patient fitness are two important factors for decision-making. The main treatment choice in fit, favourable risk patients outside the pandemic is pembrolizumab/axitinib for 53%, avelumab/axitinib, sunitinib or pazopanib for 13% of experts each. During the pandemic, ICI-containing regimens are chosen less often in favour of a tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) monotherapy, mainly sunitinib or pazopanib (35%).In fit, intermediate/poor-risk patients outside the pandemic, over 80% of experts choose ipilimumab/nivolumab, in contrast to only 41% of physicians during COVID-19, instead more TKI monotherapies are given. In patients responding to established therapies with ICI/ICI or ICI/TKI combinations, most participants modify treatment regimen by extending cycle length, holding one ICI or even both. CONCLUSION: mccRCC treatment modifications in light of the coronavirus pandemic are variable, with a shift from ICI/ICI to ICI/TKI or TKI monotherapy.","Aeppli, Stefanie; Eboulet, Eric Innocents; Eisen, Tim; Escudier, Bernard; Fischer, Stefanie; Larkin, James; Gruenwald, Viktor; McDermott, David; Oldenburg, Jan; Omlin, Aurelius; Porta, Camillo; Rini, Brian; Schmidinger, Manuela; Sternberg, Cora; Rothermundt, Christian",,342,21

Although Denmark and Sweden are alike in political organization and health care, national responses to the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic differed noticeably. Denmark initiated a hard lock down followed by an outbreak control strategy (the so-called ""hammer and dance"" strategy), while Sweden's strategy was based on advising on social distancing, while keeping society open (a so-called mitigative strategy). The objective of this study is to describe national epidemic control strategies in Denmark and Sweden in 2020, and compare the epidemic dynamics in the two countries, with respect to number of COVID-19 cases, admissions to intensive care and mortality. Data on epidemic control efforts and COVID-associated morbidity/mortality were downloaded from official government and epidemic surveillance webpages and comparatively described using basic statistics. Overall, we found ""the hammer"" resulted in better epidemic control during 2020 with less COVID-19-associated admissions to intensive care and lower mortality.","Mens, Helene; Koch, Anders; Chaine, Manon; Bengaard Andersen, Aase",APMIS acta pathol. microbiol. immunol. scand,342,1

This is particularly challenging for less-represented disciplines, such as ophthalmology. We designed a red eye clinical reasoning case for preclinical medical students, which can be delivered virtually, using video conference software. Methods: We developed a 90-minute red eye/clinical reasoning workshop for which prereading was assigned to students. We then delivered a virtual development session to nonophthalmologist copreceptors and provided a session faculty guide. The entire first-year medical student class (No. = 140) participated in one of four identical workshops, which included virtual small- and large-group discussions. Students completed a knowledge pre- and posttest, and an optional session postsurvey. Results: Knowledge gains from pretest (No. = 94) to posttest (No. = 73) were statistically significant (p < .05), with average scores improving from 57% to 70%. Overall, students were satisfied, rating the following items 4 or 5 out of 5: session (86%, No. = 31), virtual format (83%, No. = 30), and if they recommended future use (69%, No. = 35). Discussion: This novel, virtual clinical reasoning case simulated small- and large-group learning, achieved knowledge gains, and was well received by students. Minor technical challenges were encountered but successfully remedied, without apparent disruption to learning. This virtual medical education model can be used to enhance ophthalmology education in preclinical medical students and can be adapted for virtual design of other curricular content.","Chadha, Nisha; Fredrick, Douglas; Malbari, Alefiyah; Hojsak, Joanne",MedEdPORTAL,342,22

However, thus far, only a few studies have been published regarding the diet and activity of children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and remote education in this period on the diet and physical activity in a Polish population-based sample of primary school adolescents. In June 2020, the Diet and Activity of Youth during COVID-19 (DAY-19) Study was conducted on a population recruited based on stratified random sampling from all regions (schools sampled from counties, and counties from voivodeships). The sample consisted of a total of 1334 adolescents aged 10-16 years. The study assessed the diet and physical activity of the participants using a validated questionnaire which included questions about the period of remote education and the period before the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were asked about the following: consumption of fruit, vegetables, soft drinks, water, French fries, and fast food; eating meals in front of the television; and the number of days they are physically active and the number of hours they spend watching television. The obtained data were analyzed by stratifying the respondents by the gender, age, size of the city and total COVID-19 morbidity in the voivodeship. It was observed that, during the pandemic and the resultant remote education, the proportion of respondents who declared the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables had increased compared to that before the pandemic-a higher proportion consumed at least three portions of fruit per day (19.0% before pandemic vs. 27.4% during pandemic; p < 0.0001), as well as three and four or more portions of vegetables per day (11.9% vs. 14.5% and 7.5% vs. 11.1%; p = 0.0004). At the same time, the proportion of respondents consuming at least three cups of water per day had increased (41.1% vs. 47.9%; p = 0.0020), whereas the proportion of respondents who never or rarely eat their meals in front of the television had decreased (35.6% vs. 28.9%; p < 0.0001), and the proportion watching television for more than 2 h a day had increased (78.3% vs. 88.4%; p < 0.0001). Based on the results, it may be concluded that, during the period of remote education due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the dietary behaviors of the studied population of Polish adolescents were more beneficial, which included a higher intake of fruit, vegetables, and water, compared to before the pandemic. In spite of the increasing screen time, including eating in front of the television, there was no reduction in the number of days the respondents were physically active.","Kolota, Aleksandra; Glabska, Dominika",Nutrients,342,29

However, low rates of compliance amongst healthcare workers have been reported globally. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further emphasized the need for global improvement in hand hygiene compliance by healthcare workers. AIM: This comprehensive systematic review provides an up-to-date compilation of clinical trials, reported between 2014 and 2020, assessing hand hygiene interventions in order to inform healthcare leaders and practitioners regarding approaches to reduce healthcare-associated infections using hand hygiene. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, EMbase, Medline, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials published between March 2014 and December 2020 on the topic of hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers. In total, 332 papers were identified from these searches, of which 57 studies met the inclusion criteria. FINDINGS: Forty-five of the 57 studies (79%) included in this review were conducted in Asia, Europe and the USA. The large majority of these clinical trials were conducted in acute care facilities, including hospital wards and intensive care facilities. Nurses represented the largest group of healthcare workers studied (44 studies, 77%), followed by physicians (41 studies, 72%). Thirty-six studies (63%) adopted the World Health Organization's multi-modal framework or a variation of this framework, and many of them recorded hand hygiene opportunities at each of the 'Five Moments'. However, recording of hand hygiene technique was not common. CONCLUSION: Both single intervention and multi-modal hand hygiene strategies can achieve modest-to-moderate improvements in hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers.","Clancy, C; Delungahawatta, T; Dunne, C P",J Hosp Infect,342,21

Estimates of morbidity and mortality amongst homeless populations is limited due to the lack of recording of housing status across health datasets. The aim of this study is to: (i) identify a homelessness e-cohort by linking routine health data in Wales, and (ii) explore whether a period of reported past homelessness, places this population at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Homelessness identified through linkage across primary, secondary care and substance misuse datasets in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Mortality was examined through linkage to the Office for National Statistics mortality data. RESULTS: E-cohort of 15 472 individuals with lived experience of homelessness identified. Of those, 21 individuals died between February and July 2020 involving coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Those with lived experience of homelessness had increased mortality from many causes including accidents, liver diseases and suicides. CONCLUSION: Linking multiple routine datasets provides a more comprehensive dataset of a marginalized population, including individuals who are not included in government homeless statistics. Application of the cohort demonstrated that individuals with lived experience of homelessness have increased mortality involving COVID-19 and other causes. The underlying reasons, health needs and causes of death warrant further exploration.","Song, Jiao; Grey, Charlotte N B; Davies, Alisha R",J. public health (Oxf),342,20

Our results, using both GARCH (1,1) and VAR specifications, suggest that such events are directly affecting the dry bulk and the dirty tanker segments. In addition, the results also suggest that second round effects, mostly via the decline in oil prices and, in some cases, third round effects via the impact from the stock market, also exist. Finally, by employing daily port calls a proxy variable for the demand for transportation services, we show that both the dry bulk and clean tankers are highly affected by the demand side of the economy, while vessels which transport crude oil do not register such a relationship.","Michail, Nektarios A.; Melas, Kostis D.",Transp.

Today, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are staying home for longer periods of times, thus being exposed to a poor indoor air quality. Due to elevated numerical concentration and large surface area, the health effect of sub-10 nm particles can go beyond what expected from their low mass concentration in the atmosphere. The objective of this study is to find, based on analysis of recent in vitro studies, a dose-effect correlation based on particle size/surface more than on particle mass. Such a correlation cold be useful to assess the health effects of people exposed to very low mass doses of nanoparticles either indoor or outdoor.","Pedata, Paola",G Ital Med Lav Ergon,342,24

We derive the weights in continuous time to handle a complex longitudinal dataset on its own terms, without the need to discretize or artificially align the measurement times. We further propose using machine learning models designed for censored survival data with time-varying covariates and the kernel function estimator of the baseline intensity to efficiently estimate the continuous-time weights. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods provide better bias reduction and nominal coverage probability when analyzing observational longitudinal survival data with irregularly spaced time intervals, compared to conventional methods that require aligned measurement time points. We apply the proposed methods to a large-scale COVID-19 dataset to estimate the causal effects of several COVID-19 treatment strategies on in-hospital mortality or ICU admission, and provide new insights relative to findings from randomized trials.","Hu, Liangyuan; Li, Fan; Ji, Jiayi; Joshi, Himanshu; Scott, Erick",,342,16

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also belongs to Corona viridae family. Human Coronavirus causes fever, cough, fatigue, respiratory infection and abdominal symptoms. This virus has a strong affinity to human respiratory receptors and transmits rapidly. Since the virus has spread around the world and has acquired features of emergency, WHO declared it as a pandemic in March 2020. Aim: To study the clinical, haematological, biochemical findings and significance of co-morbidities amongst COVID-19 positive survivors and nonsurvivors. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was done at Chattrapati Shivaji Subharti Hospital (CSSH), Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, a level 3 COVID-19 Hospital from mid-June to end of August 2020 including 140 COVID-19 positive patients selected randomly. Patients were categorised into asymptomatic and symptomatic. Symptomatic were further divided into survivors and nonsurvivors. Haematological and biochemical parameters were analysed amongst survivors and nonsurvivors, with calculation of significant p-value. Results: Out of 37/140 patients (26%) were asymptomatic and 103/140 (74%) symptomatic. Amongst symptomatic, survivors were 78/140 (56%) and nonsurvivors were 25/140 (18%) of total positive patients. Out of 37/140 (26%) asymptomatic patients, majority were in the age group 21-30 years 14/140 (10%) with female preponderance 10/140 (7.1%). Out of 78/140 (56%) survivors, majority were in 51 to 60 years age group, with male predominance17/140 (18.6%). Amongst 25/140 (18%) nonsurvivors most common affected age group was 51 to 60 years 10/140 (7.1%). Most common symptoms in survivors was cough (51/78 patients;65%) and fever (35/78 patients;45%). In Nonsurvivors, pneumonia was seen in 100% (25/25) patients. Out of 23/25 (92%) patients presented with fever, 19/25 (76%) had breathlessness, 16/25 (64%) had myalgia, 9/25 (36%) had cough, 5/25 (20%) presented with vomiting or pain in abdomen. Amongst nonsurvivors, Total Leucocyte Count (TLC), Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), urea, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST) and Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) were significantly raised as compared to survivors (p&lt;0.01);meanwhile platelet count and Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) in nonsurvivors was significantly lower than survivors (p&lt;0.01). Most common comorbidity was diabetes in 12/25 (48%) and hypertension in 6/25 (24%) among nonsurvivors. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection more likely affects older men with co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus and hypertension and can rapidly progress to pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. Certain haematological and biological parameters have been found to be in concordance with increased mortality which can be reduced by early identification of these parameters.

METHODS: All citizens above ten years of age resident in 5 municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Trento, with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases, were invited to participate in the study. Overall, among 6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered face-to-face were collected between May 5 and 15, 2020 and examined. Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyzer. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive people on the total number of tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for a set of explanatory variables. RESULTS: A total of 1402 participants were positives for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the participants reported at least 1 symptom. The ratio between reported cases identified by molecular test and those resulting seropositive was 1:3, with a maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was 3-fold higher than the number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially of younger age, and/or who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus transmission in the community.","Stefanelli, Paola; Bella, Antonino; Fedele, Giorgio; Pancheri, Serena; Leone, Pasqualina; Vacca, Paola; Neri, Arianna; Carannante, Anna; Fazio, Cecilia; Benedetti, Eleonora; Fiore, Stefano; Fabiani, Concetta; Simmaco, Maurizio; Santino, Iolanda; Zuccali, Maria Grazia; Bizzarri, Giancarlo; Magnoni, Rosa; Benetollo, Pier Paolo; Merler, Stefano; Brusaferro, Silvio; Rezza, Giovanni; Ferro, Antonio",Clin. microbiol. infect,342,20

Initially, testing was performed using SARS-CoV-2-specific and pan-coronavirus gel-based assays that were soon superseded by real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the envelope and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes to accommodate the high anticipated volumes of samples. Throughput was further enhanced by multiplexing the different targets together with the co-detection of an internal extraction control. RESULTS: These assays are comparable in sensitivity and specificity to the assays recommended by the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At our large academic medical center, clinicians reported that existing information on distribution channels, including emails and hospital intranet posts, was inadequate to keep everyone abreast with these changes. To address these challenges, we adapted a mobile app developed in-house to communicate critical changes in hospital policies and enable direct telephonic communication between clinical team members and hospitalized patients, to support social distancing guidelines and remote rounding. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the unique benefits and challenges of adapting an app developed in-house to facilitate communication and remote rounding during COVID-19. METHODS: We adapted moblMD, a mobile app available on the iOS and Android platforms. In conjunction with our Hospital Incident Command System, resident advisory council, and health system innovation center, we identified critical, time-sensitive policies for app usage. A shared collaborative document was used to align app-based communication with more traditional communication channels. To minimize synchronization efforts, we particularly focused on high-yield policies, and the time of last review and the corresponding reviewer were noted for each protocol. To facilitate social distancing and remote patient rounding, the app was also populated with a searchable directory of numbers to patient bedside phones and hospital locations. We monitored anonymized user activity from February 1 to July 31, 2020. RESULTS: On its first release, 1104 clinicians downloaded moblMD during the observation period, of which 46% (n=508) of downloads occurred within 72 hours of initial release. COVID-19 policies in the app were reviewed most commonly during the first week (801 views). Users made sustained use of hospital phone dialing features, including weekly peaks of 2242 phone number dials, 1874 directory searches, and 277 patient room phone number searches through the last 2 weeks of the observation period. Furthermore, clinicians submitted 56 content- and phone number-related suggestions through moblMD. CONCLUSIONS: We rapidly developed and deployed a communication-focused mobile app early during COVID-19, which has demonstrated initial and sustained value among clinicians in communicating with in-patients and each other during social distancing. Our internal innovation benefited from our team's familiarity with institutional structures, short feedback loops, limited security and privacy implications, and a path toward sustainability provided by our innovation center. Challenges in content management were overcome through synchronization efforts and timestamping review. As COVID-19 continues to alter health care delivery, user activity metrics suggest that our solution will remain important in our efforts to continue providing safe and up-to-date clinical care.","Anyanwu, Emeka C; Ward, R Parker; Shah, Atman; Arora, Vineet; Umscheid, Craig A",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,342,20

METHODS: This retrospective study included 211 patients who were asymptomatic or with mild presentations of COVID-19. We evaluated the differences in demographic and clinical data between the cured (discharged to home) and transferred (aggravated to severe-stage COVID-19) groups. RESULTS: A multivariate logistic analysis showed that body temperature, chills, initial chest X-ray findings, and the presence of diabetes were significantly associated with predicting the progression to severe stage of COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The odds ratio of transfer in patients with COVID-19 increased by 12.7-fold for abnormal findings such as haziness or consolidation in initial chest X-ray, 6.32-fold for initial symptom of chills, and 64.1-fold for diabetes.

Assessing the associations between human behavior, infection, and social measures is essential to understand achievable reductions in cases and identify the factors driving changes in social dynamics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between nighttime population volumes, the COVID-19 epidemic, and the implementation of public health and social measures in Tokyo. METHODS: We used mobile phone location data to estimate populations between 10 PM and midnight in seven Tokyo metropolitan areas. Mobile phone trajectories were used to distinguish and extract on-site dining from stay-at-work and stay-at-home behaviors. Numbers of new cases and symptom onsets were obtained. Weekly mobility and infection data from March 1 to November 14, 2020, were analyzed using a vector autoregression model. RESULTS: An increase in the number of symptom onsets was observed 1 week after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=0.60, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.92). The effective reproduction number significantly increased 3 weeks after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=1.30, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.89). The nighttime population volume increased significantly following reports of decreasing numbers of confirmed cases (coefficient=-0.44, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.15).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to discover the relationship between specific symptoms and specific medicines, especially of symptoms occurring frequently in this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Worldwide collection of data in all possible formats by various parties was coordinated by the Liga Medicorum Homeopathica Internationalis. As the data came in, more symptoms were assessed prospectively. Frequent analysis and feedback by electronic newsletters were used to improve the quality of the data. Likelihood ratios (LRs) of symptoms were calculated. An algorithm for combining symptom LRs was programmed and published in the form of an app. The app was tested against 18 well-described successful cases from Hong Kong. RESULTS: LRs of common symptoms such as 'Fatigue' and 'Headache' provided better differentiation between medicines than did existing repertory entries, which are based only on the narrow presence or absence of symptoms. A mini-repertory for COVID-19 symptoms was published and supported by a web-based algorithm. With a choice of 20 common symptoms, this algorithm produced the same outcome as a full homeopathic analysis based upon a larger number of symptoms, including some that are traditionally considered more specific to particular medicines. CONCLUSION: A repertory based on clinical data and LRs can differentiate between homeopathic medicines using a limited number of frequently occurring epidemic symptoms. A Bayesian computer algorithm to combine symptoms can complement a full homeopathic analysis of cases.","Rutten, Lex; Smedley, Tom; Ives, Galen; Gold, Peter; Merizalde, Bernardo; van Haselen, Robbert; Manchanda, Raj Kumar; Ross, Ashley; Cataldi, Gustavo; Agaoglu, Altunay; di Giampietro, Tiziana; Lilas, Theodore; Schroyens, Frederik; Eizayaga, José E",Homeopathy,342,16

A reduction in pH from 6.7 to 6 in the lungs, as observed in respiratory disease, led to 20-fold, 4.0-fold, and 2.7-fold increases in lung exposure of CQ, HCQ, and AZ, respectively. Simulations indicated that the relatively high concentrations of CQ and HCQ in lung tissue were sustained long after administration of the drugs had stopped. Patients with COVID-19 often present with kidney failure. Our simulations indicate that renal impairment (plus lung pH reduction) caused 30-fold, 8.0-fold, and 3.4-fold increases in lung exposures for CQ, HCQ, and AZ, respectively, with relatively small accompanying increases (20 to 30%) in systemic exposure. Although a number of different dosage regimens were assessed, the purpose of our study was not to provide recommendations for a dosing strategy, but to demonstrate the utility of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling approach to estimate lung concentrations.

As of 29 March 2020, the disease has spread to more 199 countries and territories worldwide. The 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is known as the probable causative agent of the illness. AREAS COVERED: Here, the epidemiological dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that stand in close relation to distinct immunogenetic characters of the pathogen are discussed, to understand the ability and inability of the immune system in combatting COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19. Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19. Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19. Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19. Evidence links aging to cytokine dysregulation and T-cell repertoire reduction, male population to relatively reduced anti-viral immunity, and COVID-19-related comorbidities to hyper inflammation. The transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by the host-related factors that are known to be associated with immune dysregulation.","Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,342,24

Healthcare systems which are unprepared to properly deal with crises are much more likely to expose their public health workers and health personnel to harm and will not be able to deliver healthcare provisions in critical situations. This can lead to a drammatic toll of deaths, even in developed countries. The possible occurrence of global crises has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to devise instruments, guidelines and tools to assess the capacity of countries to deal with disasters. Iran's health system has been hit hardly by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to assess its preparedness and response to the outbreak. Methods: The present investigation was designed as a qualitative study. We utilized the ""COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan"" devised by WHO as a conceptual framework. Results: The dimension/pillar which scored the highest was national laboratories, followed by surveillance, rapid response teams and case investigations. Risk communication and community engagement was another pillar receiving a high score, followed by infection prevention and control and by country-level coordination, planning and monitoring. The pillars/dimensions receiving the lowest scores were operational support and logistics; case management; and points of entry. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has represented an unprecedent event that has challenged healthcare systems and facilities worldwide, highlighting their weaknesses and the need for inter-sectoral cooperation and collaboration during the crisis. Analyzing these experiences and capitalizing on them, by strengthening them,will help countries to be more prepared to face possible future crises.","Ghanbari, Mahboubeh Khaton; Behzadifar, Masoud; Bakhtiari, Ahad; Behzadifar, Meysam; Azari, Samad; Abolghasem Gorji, Hasan; Shahabi, Saeed; Martini, Mariano; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",J Prev Med Hyg,342,11

Here, we investigated the relationship between hypertension prevalence and gut microbial composition in two cohorts. METHODS: We included 871 unrelated TwinsUK women with faecal microbiome data (16s rRNA gene sequencing). Multivariable linear models adjusted for age, age2 and BMI as well as MiRKAT models, were used to estimate the association of hypertension with alpha- and beta-diversity metrics. To identify taxa associated with hypertension, a generalized additive model for location scale and shape was computed adjusting for covariates and multiple testing. Results were replicated in 448 women from PREDICT-1. RESULTS: We found that measures of alpha diversity are significantly lower in hypertensive cases [Beta(95% confidence interval, 95% CI)â=â-0.05 (-0.095 to -0.004), Pâ=â0.03] and a significant association between beta diversity and hypertension (FDRâ<â0.05). We identified and replicated two genera associated with hypertension. The genus, Ruminiclostridium 6 was less abundant in hypertension cases [meta-analysis (95% CI)â=â-0.31 (-0.5 to -0.13), Pâ=â1â×â10-3].

We genomically analysed the 16âs rRNA sequence and established a 100% identity match with the 16âs rRNA sequence of the genus Faecalibacillus. We functionally annotated Ruminiclostridium, identifying 83 metabolic pathways, including pathways previously linked to blood pressure regulation. CONCLUSION: In this large human observation, we show that gut microbiome diversity and composition are associated with hypertension. Our results suggest that targeting the microbiome may be a novel means to prevent or treat hypertension.","Louca, Panayiotis; Nogal, Ana; Wells, Philippa M; Asnicar, Francesco; Wolf, Jonathan; Steves, Claire J; Spector, Tim D; Segata, Nicola; Berry, Sarah E; Valdes, Ana M; Menni, Cristina",J. hypertens,342,26

All three of these countries have a federative structure, in which the individual states have largely determined the response to the pandemic. Thus, we perform an extensive analysis of the individual states of these three countries to determine patterns of similarity within each. First, we analyse structural similarity and anomalies in the trajectories of cases and deaths as multivariate time series. Next, we study the lengths of the different waves of the virus outbreaks across the three countries and their states. Finally, we investigate suitable time offsets between cases and deaths as a function of the distinct outbreak waves. In all these analyses, we consistently reveal more characteristically distinct behaviour between US and Indian states, while Brazilian states exhibit less structure in their wave behaviour and changing progression between cases and deaths.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max; Bondell, Howard",,342,23

This paper provides some of the first evidence on the socioeconomic impacts of and responses to the pandemic among households and individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa. To do so, reduced-form econometric methods are applied to longitudinal household survey data from Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, and Uganda-originating from the pre-COVID-19 face-to-face household surveys and from the novel phone surveys that are being implemented during the pandemic. The headline findings are fourfold. First, although false beliefs about COVID-19 remain prevalent, government action to limit the spread of the disease is associated with greater individual knowledge of the disease and increased uptake of precautionary measures. Second, 256 million individuals-77 percent of the population in the four countries-are estimated to live in households that have lost income due to the pandemic. Third, attempts to cope with this loss are exacerbated by the inability to access medicine and staple foods among 20 to 25 percent of the households in each country, and food insecurity is disproportionately borne by households that were already impoverished prior to the pandemic. Fourth, student-teacher contact has dropped from a pre-COVID-19 rate of 96 percent to just 17 percent among households with school-age children. These findings can help inform decisions by governments and international organizations on measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and reveal the need for continued monitoring.","Josephson, A.; Kilic, T.; Michler, J.

Understanding the characteristics of health misinformation can be a premise for rebuking and purposefully correcting such misinformation on social media. Methods: Using samples of China’s misinformation on social media related to the COVID-19 outbreak (N=547), the objective of this article was to illustrate the characteristics of said misinformation on social media in China by descriptive analysis, including the typology, the most-mentioned information, and a developmental timeline. Results: The results reveal that misinformation related to preventive and therapeutic methods is the most-mentioned type. Other types of misinformation associated with people’s daily lives are also widespread. Moreover, cultural and social beliefs have an impact on the perception and propaganda of misinformation, and changes in the crisis situation are relevant to the type variance of misinformation. Conclusion: Following research results, strategies of health communication for managing misinformation on social media are given, such as credible sources and expert sources. Also, traditional beliefs or perceptions play the vital role in health communication. To sum up, combating misinformation on social media is likely not a single effort to correct misinformation or to prevent its spread. Instead, scholars, journalists, educators, and citizens must collaboratively identify and correct any misinformation.","Chen, Kelin Luo Yuni Hu Anyang Zhao Ji Zhang Liwei",Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,342,5

Because of symptomatic similarities with common illnesses such as malaria, probable coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases may seek care at drug shops, where the knowledge and skills required to handle it may be lacking, thereby fostering community spread of the disease. This single-arm study provided an intervention to improve COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude, and practices of patent medicine vendors (PMVs) in 97 participating drug shops selected through cluster sampling in Owerri, southeastern Nigeria. The intervention involved a drug shop sensitization using information, education, and communication material, as well as training on the use of a risk assessment checklist to identify probable COVID-19 cases and to take appropriate action. Data were collected to determine the effect of this intervention using a pre-tested questionnaire and practice observation checklist, first at baseline and then 3 months post-intervention. Data analysis involved exploratory analysis and the t-test to determine pre- and post-intervention mean score differences at the 5% &#945; level.

A diagnosis of SNA is frequently delayed due to the scarcity of symptoms in its early stages, leading to significant neurological deterioration. Therefore, prompt suspicion of the disease is critical to providing better outcomes. This case assembles two rare characteristics of SNA: diabetic aetiology and a precocious time of diagnosis, and aims to highlight the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that allowed for the diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old woman, with long-term type 1 diabetes, presented with a two-month history of progressive lumbar pain, difficulty in maintaining an upright position, and discrete trunk forward-leaning. Diabetes-related vasculopathy and nephropathy were already known, and laboratory test results did not show any new abnormalities. A lumbar MRI revealed extensive signal intensity changes of the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies associated with marginal areas of enhancement and the involvement of regions adjacent to interapophyseal articulations and spinous processes from L2-L3 to L5-S1, in association with degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine. These findings were identified by the radiologist as suggestive of SNA. To rule out neoplastic and infectious disease, a bone biopsy at the L2-L3 level was executed. The pathology report revealed intervertebral disc material and fragments of fibrous tissue, with a complete absence of inflammatory cells. It was decided to perform a six-month MRI follow-up, which showed stability of the findings, confirming the hypothesis of Charcot spine. The patient was under clinical and radiological follow-up and did not require surgical fixation at the moment of diagnosis. After 2.5 years from the initial diagnosis, a new MRI revealed progression of the lesions with oedema and enlarged paravertebral soft tissues; these findings are compatible with the patient's latest complaints of lumbar pain recurrence. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of an MRI-based early diagnosis of diabetic SNA, a rare disease with nonspecific symptoms in its initial stages and a wide spectrum of differential diagnoses.

However, little is known about relationship between the chronic medical (CM) and behavioral health (CBH) of adults and children living in common households. METHODS: EHR data for children were linked to the EHR data of adults living at the same address during the same time in a retrospective cohort study from 2006 to 2014 to evaluate associations between adult and child CM and CBH conditions within a Boston safety-net primary care patient sample. RESULTS: Of the 13,845 included children, 61.6% lived with at least one adult with &#8805; 1 CM or CBH condition. Compared to children living with an adult(s) without a chronic condition, children living with an adult with a CM or CBH condition had a respective 16.2% and 18.1% increased likelihood of having a chronic condition themselves, with multiple adult chronic conditions in adults increasing children's likelihood. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: We found a positive association between the chronic diseases of adult and child household members. Given the clustering of child and adult chronic disease within households, using EHR data to support the care management needs of multiple members of households may be a promising approach to improving child and adult health in safety-net settings.","Brady, Keri J S; Legler, Aaron; Adams, William G",Matern. child health j,342,14

This qualitative study focuses on women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe women's experiences of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. METHOD: A purposive sample of fifteen women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV participated in the study. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews that were subjected to qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: One theme was identified, stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength, and three categories are as follows: managing a restricted everyday life as an expert of their illness, being afraid of contracting infections leading to suffocation and suffering and importance of continuous help and support from significant others and digital media. Breathlessness restricted women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living with a body they have to wait for. Managing everyday life was adapted to their limited abilities and energy. This required detailed planning, good knowledge of their breathing and body. Women were afraid of contracting life-threatening infections that caused suffering, especially COVID-19. The fear leads to isolation and digital media was described as an important means of communication. Significant others gave support and help that was practical and emotional. Women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experienced lack of continuous help and support from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength required women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV to conduct detailed planning to manage everyday life. Being afraid of contracting infections and the consequences of suffocation had increased since the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, which led to self-isolation and an inactive everyday life. To get help, support and socialize, women used digital media.","Ekdahl, Ann; Söderberg, Siv; Rising-Holmström, Malin",Scand. j. caring sci,342,24

However, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, interest in orthopedics in these procedures has increased significantly. The aim of this systematic review was to find out to what extent there is scientific evidence for the use of telemedicine in the orthopedic field. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in various databases on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on telemedical applications in orthopedics. RESULTS: Altogether, 14 articles were identified that reported about a total of eight RCTs of telemedical applications in orthopedics. Two RCTs were about a patient-to-doctor video consultation and six RCTs were about telerehabilitation after knee and hip arthroplasty (4 × knee arthroplasty, one hip and knee arthroplasty, one hip arthroplasty). For the majority of outcome parameters evaluated, there were no significant differences between the study groups. The cost effectiveness of videoconsultations depended on the workload (number of patient consultations) as well as the effectiveness of telerehabilitation on the distance of the patient's home to the health care center (30 km round-trip). CONCLUSION: There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of telemedical methods in orthopedics.

The sheath opens in response to a sub-atmospheric air pressure and will shut tightly under a supra-atmospheric pressure in order to form a seal. Full system numerical modelling of building drainage systems has offered insight into system responses to pressure transients and has opened up the evaluation of building wastewater systems to predictive modelling which has assisted in producing improvements to public health. A requirement of any predictive model is a mathematical representation of the physical characteristics of the system.

It has become very difficult to control the spreading of the virus. The virus is a RNA virus and the virulence of the virus is mediated by three virulence causing proteins, viz., Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7. So far the drug designing endeavors against the virus have been being targeted towards the spike protein which is responsible for the entry of the virus inside human host as well as the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. However, no effective treatment against the virus has so far been developed. In the present situation, an attempt has been made to target the virulence protein factor Nsp1 which binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit of the human host. We tried to target the Nsp1 by in-silico virtual screening of ligand libraries. We built the three dimensional structure of Nsp1 and used the structure to screen the ChEMBL drug library. We used molecular docking simulations of the top6 screened ligands with Nsp1 and subjected the liagnd-Nsp1 complexes to molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the behaviors of the ligands in a virtual cell. From our analysis we could predict that the ligands bearing the ChEMBL identifiers, CHEMBL1096281, CHEMBL2022920, CHEMBL175656, had the best binding affinity values with Nsp1. Therefore, these ligand molecules may be tested in wet-lab for further analysis. This is the first report to target the virulence factor Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It is anticipated that there will be a substantive fraction of patients who will be contagious, but asymptomatic at the time of surgery. Use multimodal perioperative infection control practices (e.g., including patient decontamination) and monitor performance (e.g., S. aureus transmission from patient to the environment). The consequence of COVID-19 is that such processes are more important than ever to follow because infection affects not only patients but the surgery center staff and surgeons. Dedicate most operating rooms to procedures that are not airway aerosol producing and can be performed without general anesthesia. Increase throughput by performing nerve blocks before patients enter the operating rooms. Bypass the phase I post-anesthesia care unit whenever possible by appropriate choices of anesthetic approach and drugs. Plan long-duration workdays (e.g., 12-h). For cases where the surgical procedure does not cause aerosol production, but general anesthesia will be used, have initial (phase I) post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where the surgery was done. Use anesthetic practices that achieve fast initial recovery of the brief ambulatory cases. When the surgical procedure causes aerosol production (e.g., bronchoscopy), conduct phase I recovery in the operating room and use multimodal environmental decontamination after each case. Use statistical methods to plan for the resulting long turnover times. Whenever possible, have the anesthesia and nursing teams stagger cases in more than one room so that they are doing one surgical case while the other room is being cleaned. In conclusion, this review shows that while COVID-19 is prevalent, it will markedly affect daily ambulatory workflow for patients undergoing general anesthesia, with potentially substantial economic impact for some surgical specialties.","Dexter, Franklin; Elhakim, Mohamed; Loftus, Randy W; Seering, Melinda S; Epstein, Richard H",J Clin Anesth,342,1

STUDY DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. A total of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or older were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. RESULTS: A total of 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature/fever) in the last 7 days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 h (defined as non-adherent). Men were more likely to be non-adherent, as were people who were less worried about COVID-19, and who perceived a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of government 'lockdown' measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19 and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures. Using volunteer networks effectively to support people in isolation may promote adherence.","Smith, L E; AmlÈt, R; Lambert, H; Oliver, I; Robin, C; Yardley, L; Rubin, G J",Public Health,342,16

Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. METHODS: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress and social safeness. RESULTS: Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion focused interventions and communications could be implemented to reduce resistances to compassion and promote mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.","Matos, Marcela; McEwan, Kirsten; Kanovský, Martin; Halamová, Júlia; Steindl, Stanley R; Ferreira, Nuno; Linharelhos, Mariana; Rijo, Daniel; Asano, Kenichi; Gregório, Sónia; Márquez, Margarita G; Vilas, Sara P; Brito-Pons, Gonzalo; Lucena-Santos, Paola; da Silva Oliveira, Margareth; de Souza, Erika Leonardo; Llobenes, Lorena; Gumiy, Natali; Costa, Maria Ileana; Habib, Noor; Hakem, Reham; Khrad, Hussain; Alzahrani, Ahmad; Cheli, Simone; Petrocchi, Nicola; Tholouli, Elli; Issari, Philia; Simos, Gregoris; Lunding-Gregersen, Vibeke; Elklit, Ask; Kolts, Russell; Kelly, Allison C; Bortolon, Catherine; Delamillieure, Pascal; Paucsik, Marine; Wahl, Julia E; Zieba, Mariusz; Zatorski, Mateusz; Komendzinski, Tomasz; Zhang, Shuge; Basran, Jaskaran; Kagialis, Antonios; Kirby, James; Gilbert, Paul",Clin. psychol. psychother,342,16

Social isolation obligation, restricted working shifts, and curfews posed unprecedented challenges for the population. Social isolation, boredom, and financial problems have been shown to stress peoples' mental health in previous comparable pandemics and even in regular situations. Individuals with a mental illness may particularly be at risk due to an already instable mental health status. While research mainly focused on the pandemic's impact on somatic health care and risk group patients, psychological obstacles caused by legal restrictions and their impact on already mentally affected individuals have been discussed, but so far only scarcely been investigated in a large sample. For this study, 12,028 people completed an online-survey during that time in Germany, when the COVID-19 outbreak gained momentum with a surge in cases and death rates as well as a lockdown of the public life. Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), distress (distress thermometer) and COVID-19-specific items, especially COVID-19-related fear, were assessed in healthy individuals, patients suffering from mental illnesses, and in patients with chronic somatic diseases, known to be at risk for an unfavorable course of COVID-19. Results show that the COVID-19-pandemic significantly worsens psychometric scores throughout the population - individuals with already heightened levels, like people with mental illnesses now reach concerning levels. Surprisingly, even though generalized anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived distress are elevated in individuals with mental illness, these individuals seem to be less affected by explicit COVID-19-related fear, than the general population or individuals with chronic somatic diseases. This study thus objectively quantifies the psychological impact of COVID-19 in a large sample and provides evidence for not only the public, but also critically affected individuals with a mental illness.","Skoda, Eva-Maria; Bäuerle, Alexander; Schweda, Adam; Dörrie, Nora; Musche, Venja; Hetkamp, Madeleine; Kohler, Hannah; Teufel, Martin; Weismüller, Benjamin",Int J Soc Psychiatry,342,22

Employment-related questions wereassessed every week (see Table 1 for details). Flares were reportedvia a weekly question. Employment variables were compared betweenflare and non-flare weeks using descriptive statistics. The relationshipbetween flares and work productivity was assessed using multi-levelmixed effects logistic regression modelling, adjusted for age and sex.ResultsData on 13 (69% female) employed participants was analysed. Amedian of 5 flares were reported per patient during the three monthperiod (IQR 3, 9). Summary employment results are displayed in Table1. Participants reported greater impact of IIM upon employment, lowerproductivity and fewer hours worked during a flare week, compared toa non-flare week. There was a significant association between flaresand detrimental impact upon work productivity (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 1.12, p &lt; 0.01). Flares were alsosignificantly associated with an increased number of work hoursmissed due to IIM (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01, 1.08, p = 0.02)ConclusionOur study has demonstrated that IIM flares are significantly associatedwith detrimental impact upon employment ability.

Many medicinal plants have antiviral, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, wound healing etc. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to screen for potent inhibitors of N-terminal domain (NTD) of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The structure of NTD of RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS coronavirus 2 was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB 6VYO) and the structures of 100 different phytocompounds were retrieved from Pubchem. The receptor protein and ligands were prepared using Schrodinger's Protein Preparation Wizard. Molecular docking was done by using the Schrodinger's maestro 12.0 software. Drug likeness and toxicity of active phytocompounds was predicted by using Swiss adme, admetSAR and protox II online servers. Molecular dynamic simulation of the best three protein- ligand complexes (alizarin, aloe-emodin and anthrarufin) was performed to study the interaction stability. We have identified three potential active sites (named as A, B, C) on receptor protein for efficient binding of the phytocompounds. We found that, among 100 phytocompounds, emodin, aloe-emodin, anthrarufin, alizarine, and dantron of Rheum emodi showed good binding affinity at all the three active sites of RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of COVID-19.The binding energies of emodin, aloe-emodin, anthrarufin, alizarine, and dantron were -8.299, -8.508, -8.456, -8.441, and -8.322 Kcal mol-1 respectively (site A), -7.714, -6.433, -6.354, -6.598, and -6.99 Kcal mol-1 respectively (site B), and -8.299, 8.508, 8.538, 8.841, and 8.322 Kcal mol-1 respectively (site C). All the active phytocompounds follows the drug likeness properties, non-carcinogenic, and non-toxic. Theses phytocompounds (alone or in combination) could be developed into effective therapy against COVID-19. From MD simulation data, we found that all three complexes of 6VYO with alizarin, aloe-emodin and anthrarufin were stable up to 50 ns. These phytocompounds can be tested further for in vitro or in vivo and used as a potential drug to cure SARS-CoV-2 infection. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It is done by identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to an infectious disease to prevent onward transmission. We summarize findings from a rapid Cochrane review that included cohort and modelling studies to assess the benefits and harms of digital solutions for identifying contacts of confirmed positive cases of an infectious disease. The review included 12 studies, which assessed digital contact tracing for the following infectious diseases: Ebola, tuberculosis, pertussis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review revealed low-certainty evidence of a decrease in secondary cases of the targeted infectious disease, if digital contact tracing was used. However, it is uncertain from the currently available evidence whether digital contact tracing would produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce the time taken to complete contact tracing. Therefore, implementation of digital contact tracing in the context of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in African countries should be accompanied by a robust monitoring and evaluation framework. There should be an evaluation and documentation of the benefits, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, equity impacts, and unintended consequences of the intervention.","Jaca, Anelisa; Iwu, Chinwe Juliana; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr Med J,342,16

It offers an opportunity to a range of disadvantaged adult learners such as school dropouts, refugees etc. to attain an educational certificate enabling them to move on in their life. This article presents an autoethnographic case study of a non-profit HSE programme in Philadelphia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The four authors of this article, all of them instructors on the front line of the youth crisis in adult education, explore the broader context of non-governmental organisation (NGO) management and privatised HSE exams. In their research and their reflections, they found that the pandemic exacerbated existing economic and social inequalities, with both pre-pandemic and current delivery of their HSE programme failing to address the survival needs of a population which has long been living in crisis. Juxtaposing relevant youth-in-crisis literature with narratives both from before the pandemic and whilst living through it, the authors of this article discuss the funding and institutional constraints around the environment in which they teach. Their case study sheds light on competing priorities within the non-profit education landscape, highlighting both pitfalls and successes in HSE curriculum and administration.

The classical neurosurgical operation is bimanual, i.e. the microsurgical instruments are operated with both hands. Often, operations have to be carried out in narrow corridors at the depth of several centimeters. With the current technology, the operator must manually adjust the field of view during surgery which poses a disruption in the operating flow. Until now, technical adjuncts existed in the form of a mouthpiece to move the stereo camera unit or voice commands and foot pedals to control other interaction tasks like optical configuration. However, these have not been widely adopted due to usability issues. This study tests two novel hands free interaction concepts based on head positioning and gaze tracking as an attempt to reduce the disruption during microneurosurgery and increase the efficiency of the user. METHODS: Technical equipment included the Pentero 900 microscope, HTC Vive Pro, and an inbuilt 3D-printed target probe. 11 neurosurgeons including 7 residents and 4 consultants participated in the study. The tasks created for this study were with the intention to mimic real microneurosurgical tasks to maintain applicative accuracy while testing the interaction concepts. The tasks involved visualization system adjustment to the specific target and touching the target. The first trial was conducted in a Virtual Reality setting applying the novel hands free interaction concepts, and the second one was conducted performing the same tasks on a 3D-printed target probe using manual field of view adjustment. The subjects completed both trials with the same predetermined tasks, in order to validate the feasibility of the novel technology. The data collected for this study was obtained with the help of review protocols, detailed post-trial interviews, video and audio recordings, along with time measurements while performing the tasks. RESULTS: The user study conducted at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, found that the gaze tracking and head positioning based microscope adjustment were 18% and 29% faster respectively than the classical bimanual adjustment of the microscope. Focused user interviews showed the user's proclivity for the new interaction concepts, as they offered minimal disruption between the simultaneous target selection and camera position adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The hands-free interaction concepts presented in this study demonstrated a more efficient execution of the microneurosurgical tasks than the classical manual microscope and were assessed to be more preferable by both residents and consultant neurosurgeons.","Khakhar, Rutvik; You, Fang; Chakkalakal, Denny; Dobbelstein, David; Picht, Thomas",World neurosurgery (Online),342,30

In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","Torshin, Ivan Y.; Gromova, Olga A.; Chuchalin, Alexander G.",,342,16

METHODS: 234 symptomatic patients with COVID-19, diagnosed according to the World Health Organization guidelines, were included in the study. The severity of the disease was classified as moderate, severe and critical. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was performed in all patients. DUS findings, clinical, laboratory's and therapeutic variables were investigated by contingency tables, Pearson chi square test and by Student t test and Fisher's exact test. ROC curve analysis was applied to study significant continuous variables. RESULTS: Overall incidence of DVT was 10.7% (25/234): 1.6% (1/60) among moderate cases, 13.8% (24/174) in severely and critically ill patients. Prolonged bedrest and intensive care unit admission were significantly associated with the presence of DVT (19.7%). Fraction of inspired oxygen, P/F ratio, respiratory rate, heparin administration, D-dimer, IL-6, ferritin and CRP showed correlation with DVT. CONCLUSION: DUS may be considered a useful and valid tool for early identification of DVT. In less severely affected patients, DUS as screening of DVT might be unnecessary. High rate of DVT found in severe patients and its correlation with respiratory parameters and some significant laboratory findings suggests that these can be used as a screening tool for patients who should be getting DUS.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Coppola, Andrea; Fusco, Stefano; Stellato, Elvira; Aliberti, Stefano; Andrisani, Maria Carmela; Vespro, Valentina; Arrichiello, Antonio; Panigada, Mauro; Monzani, Valter; Grasselli, Giacomo; Venturini, Massimo; Rehani, Bhavya; Peyvandi, Flora; Pesenti, Antonio; Blasi, Francesco; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Journal of ultrasound (Online),342,5

Areas covered: Numerous organizations have released genomic data, amongst other tools, for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this has led to the development of growing datasets of knowledge for continued collaboration amongst different scientific communities. A different technique employs a more closed, market-driven method in order to stay ahead financially in the race for developing a suitable antiviral or vaccine. The latter allows sustained motivation for company ambitions and progress has been made toward clinical trials for potential drugs. Expert opinion: A case can be made for both open and closed drug discovery models; however, due to the rapidly evolving nature of this deadly virus, organizations should collate their research and support one another to ensure satisfactory treatment can be approved in a timely manner.","Harky, Amer; Mishra, Vaibhav; Ansari, Daniyal Matin; Melamed, Naomi",Expert Opin Drug Discov,342,16

The effect of sampling methods (individual or pool) on feed intake, feed conversion and apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), organic matter (OM), gross energy (GE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and Hemicellulose (Hem.) was studied. Acid-insoluble ash was used as an internal indicator to determine apparent digestibility. No significant differences were found between the 2 sampling methods (individual or pool) on feed intake and feed conversion of DM, CP, GE, OM, NDF, ADF and Hem. With the exception of Hem, however, the sampling pool method overvalued the apparent digestibility of parameters.","Nunes do Prado, Ivanor; Maria Zeoula, Lúcia; Vinocur, Karen; Medroni, Sandro; Gonçalves do Nascimento, Willian",Acta Sci.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential predictors of both (1) engagement in behaviors aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and (2) intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It was hypothesized that Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs would predict each outcome. Additionally, given the politicization of the pandemic in the US, HBM constructs were considered as possible mediators of a relationship between political party affiliation and each outcome. A total of 205 participants completed an online survey, and data from 186 were analyzed using linear and ordinal regressions. Findings indicate that greater perceived response efficacy predicted greater engagement in preventive behaviors and intention to get vaccinated. Other HBM constructs were not significant predictors of either outcome. Mediation analyses indicated that affiliation with the Republican Party predicted reduced engagement in preventive health behaviors and vaccination intention, although effects were fully and partially mediated by lower levels of response efficacy. Understanding the predictors of adherence to recommended strategies is essential to developing effective public health campaigns that address risk factors for non-adherence and target those least likely to adhere. Public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US should emphasize the efficacy of preventive behaviors and encourage public trust in the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among Republicans.","Rabin, Carolyn; Dutra, Sunny",Psychol Health Med,342,1

Here we analyse an extended SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, believed to play an important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we derive a number of analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of infections, the time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected population. We also propose an accurate way of specifying initial conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the fact that the early time exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number, R 0 , to a target value R 0 target < 1 , but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same R 0 target < 1 , TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and our study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics provides a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. We apply our results to the COVID data for India to obtain heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic, and note that the predictions strongly depend on the assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.","Das, Arghya; Dhar, Abhishek; Goyal, Srashti; Kundu, Anupam; Pandey, Saurav",Chaos Solitons Fractals,342,21

Administration of plasma from convalescent donors containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, though promising according to case reports, failed to show a clear benefit in a greater number of trials. One reason could be varying and low antibody contents in a majority of plasma units hampering standardization and clinical efficacy. Besides, other plasma components unnecessarily transfused like coagulation factors might promote hypercoagulation seen in severe COVID-19 etiopathology. We therefore hypothesized that instead of collecting whole plasma units, convalescent donors could donate solely immunoglobulins by undergoing immunoadsorption, a mode of therapy regularly applied in autoimmune diseases. Here, we report the results of the first two antibody donations performed at the University Hospital Düsseldorf. In both cases, immunoadsorptions were very well tolerated with no side effects. Collected and neutralized eluates were concentrated using tangential flow filtration increasing the concentration of immunoglobulins 10fold as compared to peripheral blood and leading to probably eight times more neutralizing antibodies than in one plasma unit. Therefore, immunoadsorption can be used as a method of antibody donation. Whether these donated antibodies can be used as passive immunization in acutely infected patients remains to be elucidated.","Rothenburg, Jannik; Rink-Baron, Silke; Mueller, Lisa; Ostermann, Philipp Niklas; Fischer, Johannes; Stegbauer, Johannes; Moldenhauer, Anja",Transfus Apher Sci,342,22

This is especially challenging for few-shot learning problems due to the small sample size for each known category, which prevents existing open-set methods from working effectively; however, most multiclass few-shot methods are limited to closed-set scenarios. In this work, we address the problem of few-shot open-set classification by first proposing methods for few-shot one-class classification and then extending them to few-shot multiclass open-set classification. We introduce two independent few-shot one-class classification methods: Meta Binary Cross-Entropy (Meta-BCE), which learns a separate feature representation for one-class classification, and One-Class Meta-Learning (OCML), which learns to generate one-class classifiers given standard multiclass feature representation. Both methods can augment any existing few-shot learning method without requiring retraining to work in a few-shot multiclass open-set setting without degrading its closed-set performance. We demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks of both methods in different problem settings and evaluate them on three standard benchmark datasets, miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and Caltech-UCSD-Birds-200-2011, where they surpass the state-of-the-art methods in the few-shot multiclass open-set and few-shot one-class tasks.","Kozerawski, Jedrzej; Turk, Matthew",,342,1

The majority of emerging infections in humans are zoonotic. COVID-19 is an ideal example of a recently identified emerging zoonotic disease, causing a global pandemic. Anthropogenic factors such as modernisation of agriculture and livestock farming, wildlife hunting, the destruction of wild animal habitats, mixing wild and domestic animals, wildlife trading, changing food habits and urbanisation could drive the emergence of zoonotic diseases in humans. Since 2001, Bangladesh has been reporting many emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks such as nipah, highly pathogenic avian influenza, pandemic H1N1, and COVID-19. There are many other potential zoonotic pathogens such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Kyasanur forest disease virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever that may emerge in the future. However, we have a limited understanding of zoonotic diseases' overall risk in humans and associated factors that drive the emergence of zoonotic pathogens. This narrative review summarised the major emerging, re-emerging, neglected and other potential zoonotic diseases in Bangladesh and their associated risk factors. Nipah virus and Bacillus anthracis caused repeated outbreaks in humans. More than 300 human cases with Nipah virus infection were reported since the first outbreak in 2001. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) caused more than 550 outbreaks in poultry, and eight human cases were reported so far since 2007. People of Bangladesh are frequently exposed to zoonotic pathogens due to close interaction with domestic and peri-domestic animals. The rapidly changing intensified animal-human-ecosystem interfaces and risky practices increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. The narrative review's findings are useful to draw attention to the risk and emergence of zoonotic diseases to public health policymakers in Bangladesh and the application of one-health approach to address this public health threat.","Chowdhury, Sukanta; Aleem, Mohammad A; Khan, Md Shafiqul I; Hossain, Mohammad Enayet; Ghosh, Sumon; Rahman, Mohammed Z",Vet. med. sci,342,1

This study aimed to develop and evaluate the discriminative accuracy of a clinical prediction model for ambulatory ability outcomes 3 months after surgery for trochanteric fractures. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 346 patients treated with intramedullary nailing for trochanteric fractures who had independent ambulatory ability before their injury. Multiple regression models with preoperative and postoperative factors were used to predict ambulatory ability outcomes at 3 months. A clinical prediction model (CPM) was created based on a decision tree developed using a chi-square automatic interaction detector technique. RESULTS: Three months after surgery, 263 (76.0%) and 83 (24.0%) patients regained and lost independent ambulatory ability, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the Barthel index (BI) total score at 2 weeks predicted the ambulatory ability outcome at 3 months with good discriminative accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]: 0.819; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.769, 0.868], cut-off value: 22.5; sensitivity: 69.5%; specificity: 82.3%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative factors (residence before injury, diagnosis of dementia, and serum albumin at admission) and postoperative factors (BI total score at 2 weeks) predicted ambulatory ability outcomes at 3 months (AUROC: 0.710; 95%CI: [0.636, 0.783]; sensitivity: 91.3%; specificity: 41.8%). The CPM with the BI total score at 2 weeks (&#8804;10; 10<, &#8804;50; >50 points) and dementia status (present; absent) had a moderate discriminative accuracy (AUROC: 0.676; 95%CI: [0.600, 0.752]; sensitivity: 94.7%; specificity: 40.5%). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a CPM with moderate accuracy to predict ambulatory ability outcomes in patients 3 months after surgery for trochanteric fractures. Our results demonstrate the importance of the BI score measured soon after surgery and dementia status for the prediction of postoperative ambulation.","Tomita, Yosuke; Yamamoto, Norio; Inoue, Tomoo; Noda, Tomoyuki; Kawasaki, Keisuke; Ozaki, Toshifumi",Injury,342,6

Because of the time needed to investigate certain causes of death and to process and review data, final annual mortality data for a given year are typically released 11 months after the end of the calendar year. Daily totals reported by CDC COVID-19 case surveillance are timely but can underestimate numbers of deaths because of incomplete or delayed reporting. As a result of improvements in timeliness and the pressing need for updated, quality data during the global COVID-19 pandemic, NVSS expanded provisional data releases to produce near real-time U.S. mortality data.* This report presents an overview of provisional U.S. mortality data for 2020, including the first ranking of leading causes of death. In 2020, approximately 3,358,814 deaths occurred in the United States. From 2019 to 2020, the estimated age-adjusted death rate increased by 15.9%, from 715.2 to 828.7 deaths per 100,000 population. COVID-19 was reported as the underlying cause of death or a contributing cause of death for an estimated 377,883 (11.3%) of those deaths (91.5 deaths per 100,000). The highest age-adjusted death rates by age, race/ethnicity, and sex occurred among adults aged &#8805;85 years, non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons, and males. COVID-19 death rates were highest among adults aged &#8805;85 years, AI/AN and Hispanic persons, and males. COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in 2020, after heart disease and cancer.

During nationwide lockdown, it is extremely challenging to provide quality end-of-life care (EOLC) to all patients with a poor system for dignified death. Telemedicine, whose feasibility for community-based EOLC in rural settings has already been established, was a useful tool for us to overcome these barriers. Adding a widely used smartphone-based application for video calls along with voice calls and text messages made the process more dynamic and convenient. Here, we share our experience with three patients with advanced malignancy in providing EOLC during COVID-19 lockdown. A well-planned study for the utility of this service for a larger cancer patient population from different sociocultural and demographic backgrounds is warranted in the future.","Biswas, Swagata; Adhikari, Shreya; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Indian J.

Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, including 19 cases of nucleic acid false-negative patients and 31 cases of nucleic acid positive patients, were enrolled. Their epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory examination data and imaging characteristics were analyzed. Risk factors for false negatives were discussed. Compared with the nucleic acid positive group, the false-negative group had less epidemiological exposure (52.6% vs 83.9%; P = .025), less chest discomfort (5.3% vs 32.3%; P = .035), and faster recovery (10 [8, 13] vs 15 [11, 18.5] days; P = .005). The number of involved lung lobes was (2 [1, 2.5] vs 3 [2, 4] days; P = .004), and the lung damage severity score was (3 [2.5, 4.5] vs 5 [4, 9] days; P = .007), which was lighter in the nucleic acid false-negative group. Thus, the absence of epidemiological exposure may be a potential risk factor for false-negative nucleic acids. The false-negative cases of COVID-19 are worth noting because they have a risk of viral transmission without positive test results, lighter clinical manifestations, and less history of epidemiological exposure.","Rong, Yan; Wang, Fei; Liu, Jing; Zhou, Yang; Li, Xiaoli; Liang, Xinhua; Zhang, Dandan; Zeng, Huadong; Wang, Jing; Shi, Yi",J. med. virol,342,21

Our approach borrows some concepts from the curve registration framework by embedding the Shape Invariant Model in the Latent Block Model, estimated via a suitable modification of the SEM-Gibbs algorithm. The resulting procedure allows for several user-defined specifications of the notion of cluster that could be chosen on substantive grounds and provides parsimonious summaries of complex longitudinal or functional data by partitioning data matrices into homogeneous blocks.","Casa, Alessandro; Bouveyron, Charles; Erosheva, Elena; Menardi, Giovanna",,342,29

The aim of this study was to evaluate the 2019-nCoV CDC ddPCR Triplex Probe Assay (BioRad) performance, comparing the direct quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab with the procedure applied to the extracted RNA. Moreover, two widely used swab types were compared (UTM 3 mL and ESwab 1 mL, COPAN). A total of 50 nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 25 UTM 3 mL and n = 25 ESwab 1 mL) from SARS-CoV-2 patients, collected during the pandemic at IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital (Veneto Region, North-East Italy), were used for our purpose. After heat inactivation, an aliquot of swab medium was used for the direct quantitation. Then, we compared the direct method with the quantitation performed on the RNA purified from nasopharyngeal swab by automated extraction. We observed that the direct approach achieved generally equal RNA copies compared to the extracted RNA. The results with the direct quantitation were more accurate on ESwab with a sensitivity of 93.33% [95% CI, 68.05 to 99.83] and specificity of 100.00% for both N1 and N2. On the other hand, on UTM we observed a higher rate of discordant results for N1 and N2. The human internal amplification control (RPP30) showed 100% of both sensitivity and specificity independent of swabs and approaches. In conclusion, we described a direct quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab. Our approach resulted in an efficient quantitation, without automated RNA extraction and purification. However, special care needs to be taken on the potential bias due to the conservation of samples and to the heating treatment, as we used thawed and heat inactivated material. Further studies on a larger cohort of samples are warranted to evaluate the clinical value of this direct approach.","Deiana, Michela; Mori, Antonio; Piubelli, Chiara; Scarso, Salvatore; Favarato, Mosè; Pomari, Elena",Sci Rep,342,15

Methods Over the past period, from april 2020, 465 endoscopic studies were performed, of which 223 (48 %) werebronchoscopic examinations, 218 (47 %) examinations on the upper digestive tract, 24 (5 %) colonoscopies and othermanipulations. It should be noted that 204 (44 %) patients were examined due to anemia and the clinic of gastrointestinalbleeding. Results Analysis of the sources of bleeding showed that in 74 % of cases it is erosive-hemorrhagic gastroduodenopathy, in15 %-acute stress ulcers of the duodenum and stomach, 11 %-chronic duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. In addition,78 % of patients with severe comorbid patholog. Average age was 66.1±2.8 years. There was no correlation between thevolume of lung damage by CT, laboratory parameters (CRP, fibrinogen, intreleukins) and the volume of lesions of the uppergastrointestinal mucosa. Mortality in the this group was 19 % and was not associated with acute blood loss. Also, attention was drawn to the frequent detection of mycotic lesions of the esophageal mucosa, oral cavity and colon in patients withCOVID-19, which was indicated by dysphagia and abdominal pain. These findings may have been a manifestation ofdysbiosis against the background of ongoing therapy and immunosuppression. Conclusions The technical features of manipulations with the exception of anti-epidemic measures do not differ from thoseperformed in routine practice. Currently, there is no correlation between gastrointestinal complications and the course ofCOVID-19, but the most common source of bleeding was erosive-hemorrhagic gastroduodenopathy, has a rather specificendoscopic picture.

Methods and Results CVH was computed at 2 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study visits in 1987 to 1989 and 1993 to 1995, using 7 metrics (smoking, body mass index, total cholesterol, blood glucose, blood pressure, physical activity, and diet), each classified as poor, intermediate, and ideal. Overall CVH was classified as poor, intermediate, and ideal to correspond to 0 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 7 metrics at ideal levels. There 10 038 participants, aged 44 to 66 years that were eligible. From the first to the second study visit, there was an improvement in overall CVH for 17% of participants and a decrease in CVH for 21% of participants. At both study visits, 28%, 27%, and 6% had poor, intermediate, and ideal overall CVH, respectively. Compared with those with poor CVH at both visits, the risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.20-0.34) and mortality (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.29-0.44) was lowest in those with ideal CVH at both measures. Improvement from poor to intermediate/ideal CVH was also associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.59-0.75) and mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89). Conclusions Improvement in CVH or stable ideal CVH, compared with those with poor CVH over time, is associated with a lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The change in smoking status and cholesterol may have accounted for a large part of the observed association.","Gaye, Bamba; Tajeu, Gabriel S; Vasan, Ramachandran S; Lassale, Camille; Allen, Norrina B; Singh-Manoux, Archana; Jouven, Xavier",J Am Heart Assoc,342,24

Predicting the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, therefore, is a prerequisite to avoid the consequences and mitigate the complications. This research utilized the machine learning (ML) models such as linear-support vector machine (L-SVM), medium Gaussian-support vector machine (M-SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest regression (RFR), and a time series model namely PROPHET. Atmospheric NOX, SO2, CO, and O3, along with meteorological variables from Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, and Sylhet for the period of 2013 to 2019, were utilized as exploratory variables. Results showed that the overall performance of GPR performed better particularly for Dhaka in predicting the concentration of both PM2.5 and PM10 while ANN performed best in case of Chattogram and Sylhet for predicting PM2.5. However, in terms of predicting PM10, M-SVM and RFR were selected respectively. Therefore, this study recommends utilizing ""ensemble learning"" models by combining several best models to advance application of ML in predicting pollutants' concentration in Bangladesh.","Shahriar, Shihab Ahmad; Kayes, Imrul; Hasan, Kamrul; Salam, Mohammed Abdus; Chowdhury, Shawan",Air Qual Atmos Health,342,20

We aimed to determine whether gut microbiota in lean women with PCOS shows any alterations compared to healthy women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four lean patients with PCOS phenotype A according to the Rotterdam 2003 diagnostic criteria and 22 BMI-matched healthy women were included in this study. Anthropometric, hormonal and biochemical measurements were carried out in all participants. 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples. Preprocessing of the raw data was performed using QIIME; and both QIIME and R packages were used for microbiome analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial richness and diversity did not show a significant difference between patients and controls. Beta diversity was similar between the groups. However, Erysipelotrichaceae, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Planococaceae, Gemmales and Bacillales were significantly abundant in PCOS group according to LEfSe analysis. Clostridium cluster XVII showed increased abundance in patient group, while Clostridium sensu stricto and Roseburia were decreased compared to controls. Random forest prediction analysis revealed Clostridium cluster XIVb as the most discriminative feature of patient group and Roseburia for healthy controls. Testosterone and androstenedione were negatively correlated with alpha and phylogenetic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gut microbiome of lean PCOS patients with full phenotype show compositional alterations with similar bacterial richness and diversity compared to controls and that hyperandrogenism is associated with dysbiosis.","Mammadova, Gulnar; Ozkul, Ceren; Yilmaz Isikhan, Selen; Acikgoz, Aylin; Yildiz, Bulent O",Eur J Clin Invest,342,1

A state of hypercoagulability reduces circuit life spans. To maintain circuit patency and therapeutic efficiency, an optimized anticoagulation strategy is needed. This study investigates whether alternative anticoagulation strategies for RRT during COVID-19 are superior to administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study on 71 critically ill COVID-19 patients (&#8805;18 years), admitted to intensive care units at a tertiary health care facility in the southwestern part of Germany between February 26 and May 21, 2020. We collected data on the disease course, AKI, RRT, and thromboembolic events. Four different anticoagulatory regimens were administered. Anticoagulation during continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed with UFH or citrate. Anticoagulation during sustained low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD) was performed with UFH, argatroban, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Primary outcome is the effect of the anticoagulation regimen on mean treatment times of RRT. RESULTS: In patients receiving CVVHD, mean treatment time in the UFH group was 21.3 h (SEM: ±5.6 h), in the citrate group 45.6 h (SEM: ±2.7 h). Citrate anticoagulation significantly prolonged treatment times by 24.4 h (P = .001). In patients receiving SLEDD, mean treatment time with UFH was 8.1 h (SEM: ±1.3 h), with argatroban 8.0 h (SEM: ±0.9 h), and with LMWH 11.8 h (SEM: ±0.5 h). LMWH significantly prolonged treatment times by 3.7 h (P = .008) and 3.8 h (P = .002), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: UFH fails to prevent early clotting events in the dialysis circuit during COVID-19. For patients, who do not require effective systemic anticoagulation, regional citrate dialysis is the most effective strategy. For patients, who require effective systemic anticoagulation, the usage of LMWH results in the longest circuit life spans. The proposed anticoagulatory strategies are safe, can easily be monitored, and allow an individualized treatment.","Arnold, Frederic; Westermann, Lukas; Rieg, Siegbert; Neumann-Haefelin, Elke; Biever, Paul Marc; Walz, Gerd; Kalbhenn, Johannes; Tanriver, Yakup",BMC Nephrol,342,16

Here we found that, phytohormone auxin-induced, sterol-dependent nanoclustering of cell surface transmembrane receptor kinase 1 (TMK1) is critical for the formation of polarized domains at the plasma membrane (PM) during the morphogenesis of cotyledon pavement cells (PC) in Arabidopsis. Auxin-induced TMK1 nanoclustering stabilizes flotillin1-associated ordered nanodomains, which in turn promote the nanoclustering of ROP6 GTPase that acts downstream of TMK1 to regulate cortical microtubule organization. In turn, cortical microtubules further stabilize TMK1- and flotillin1-containing nanoclusters at the PM. Hence, we propose a new paradigm for polarity formation: A diffusive signal triggers cell polarization by promoting cell surface receptor-mediated nanoclustering of signaling components and cytoskeleton-mediated positive feedback that reinforces these nanodomains into polarized domains.","Pan, Xue; Fang, Linjing; Liu, Jianfeng; Senay-Aras, Betul; Lin, Wenwei; Zheng, Shuan; Zhang, Tong; Guo, Jingzhe; Manor, Uri; Van Norman, Jaimie; Chen, Weitao; Yang, Zhenbiao",Nat Commun,342,16

However, there is a dearth of studies on the psychological resilience in residents. AIMS: This study aims to measure the psychological resilience of Chinese residents to reflect their psychological status as well as influencing factors during the pandemic. METHOD: We conducted a combination of stratified sampling and snowball sampling to select survey subjects. We employed the psychological resilience and influencing factor questionnaire based on the 10-item Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10) for survey. We collected data from 3,398 residents in China between 31 January and 29 February 2020. Multivariable linear stepwise regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with psychological resilience in residents. RESULTS: The mean score of psychological resilience among Chinese residents was 27.11 ± 8.45 (SD = 7.98). There were some factors significantly associated with psychological status among the Chinese residents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Residents with lower financial status, living in rural areas, unmarried, lacking fixed employment or retirement guarantees, and lacking knowledge of policies were more likely to report a lower level of psychological resilience. CONCLUSION: Health service policy makers in many countries should adopt relevant measures to improve the psychological resilience of residents during the pandemic. This includes short-term aggressive treatment, strengthening health education, and improving the awareness of residents with respect to emergency health policies. In addition, the financial status, health levels, and risk management capabilities of residents should be increased over the long term.","Shen, Xin; Li, Yuting; Feng, Jing; Lu, Zuxun; Tian, Kunming; Gan, Yong",Int J Soc Psychiatry,342,23

The available evidence has not allowed guidelines to clearly recommend any drugs outside the context of clinical trials. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 invokes a hyperinflammatory state driven by multiple cells and mediators like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;), etc. Considering the proven role of cytokine dysregulation in causing this hyperinflammation in the lungs with IL-6 being a key driver, particularly in seriously ill COVID-19 patients, it is crucial to further explore selective cytokine blockade with drugs like the IL-6 inhibitors tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab. These targeted monoclonal antibodies can dampen the downstream IL-6 signaling pathways, which can lead to decreased cell proliferation, differentiation, oxidative stress, exudation, and improve clinical outcomes in patients with evident features of cytokine-driven inflammation like persistent fever, dyspnea and elevated markers. Preliminary evidence has come for tocilizumab from some small studies, and interim analysis of a randomized controlled trial; the latter also being available for sarilumab. International guidelines do include IL-6 inhibitors as one of the options available for severe or critically ill patients. There has been increased interest in evaluating these drugs with a series of clinical trials being registered and conducted in different countries. The level of investigation though perhaps needs to be further intensified as there is a need to focus on therapeutic options that can prove to be 'life-saving' as the number of COVID-19 fatalities worldwide keeps increasing alarmingly. IL-6 inhibitors could be one such treatment option, with generation of more evidence and completion of a larger number of systematic studies.","Atal, Shubham; Fatima, Zeenat",Pharmaceut Med,342,20

Hypoxia-induced inflammatory signaling may lead to retinal inflammation, gliosis and visual disturbances. We investigated the consequences of systemic hypoxia using serial retinal optical coherence tomography and by assessing the earliest changes within 24h after hypoxia by measuring a proteomics panel of 39 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the plasma and retina, as well as using retinal histology. We induced severe systemic hypoxia in adult C57BL/6 mice using a hypoxia chamber (10% O2) for 1 week and rapidly assessed measurements within 1h compared with 18h after hypoxia. Optical coherence tomography revealed retinal tissue edema at 18h after hypoxia. Hierarchical clustering of plasma and retinal immune molecules revealed obvious segregation of the 1h posthypoxia group away from that of controls. One hour after hypoxia, there were 10 significantly increased molecules in plasma and 4 in retina. Interleukin-1ß and vascular endothelial growth factor were increased in both tissues. Concomitantly, there was significantly increased aquaporin-4, decreased Kir4.1, and increased gliosis in retinal histology. In summary, the immediate posthypoxic period is characterized by molecular changes consistent with systemic and retinal inflammation and retinal glial changes important in water transport, leading to tissue edema. This posthypoxic inflammation rapidly improves within 24h, consistent with the typically mild and transient visual disturbance in hypoxia, such as in high-altitude retinopathy. Given hypoxia increases risk of vision loss, more studies in at-risk patients, such as plasma immune profiling and in vivo retinal imaging, are needed in order to identify novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers of visual impairment in systemic hypoxia.","Mesentier-Louro, Louise A; Rangel, Barbara; Stell, Laurel; Shariati, M Ali; Dalal, Roopa; Nathan, Abinaya; Yuan, Ke; de Jesus Perez, Vinicio; Liao, Yaping Joyce",PLoS One,342,13

The objective of this survey was to assess the change in neurosurgical training in India following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between May 7, 2020, and May 16, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated among neurosurgical residents across India by social media, regarding changes in the department's functioning, patient interaction, surgical exposure, changes in academics, and fears and apprehensions associated with the pandemic. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for changes during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 118 residents from 29 neurosurgical training programs across 17 states/union territories of the country gave their responses to the survey questionnaire. The survey revealed that the surgical exposure of neurosurgical residents has drastically reduced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, from an average of 39.86 surgeries performed/assisted per month (median 30) to 12.31 per month (median 10), representing a decrease of 67.50%. The number of academic sessions has fallen from a median of 5 per week to 2 per week. The survey uncovered the lack of universal guidelines and homogeneity regarding preoperative COVID-19 testing. The survey also reveals reluctance toward detailed patient examinations since the COVID-19 outbreak. The majority of respondents felt that the COVID-19 pandemic will hamper their operative and clinical skills. Fear of rescheduling or deferring of licensing examinations was significantly higher among those closest to the examination (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The adverse impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical training needs to be addressed. While ensuring the safety of the residents, institutes and neurosurgical societies/bodies must take it upon themselves to ensure that their residents continue to learn and develop neurosurgical skills during these difficult times.","Dash, Chinmaya; Venkataram, Tejas; Goyal, Nishant; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Raheja, Amol; Singla, Raghav; Sardhara, Jayesh; Gupta, Ravi",Neurosurg Focus,342,1

Fluvoxamine strongly binds to the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) that regulates inflammation by inhibiting the production of cytokines, believed to be responsible for severe COVID-19. We evaluated the S1R locus on chr 9p13.3 in subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We focused on SNP rs17775810 that has been previously identified by examining loss-of-function mutations in the S1R gene associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We utilized UK Biobank (UKB) data. Data processing was performed on Minerva, a Linux mainframe with Centos 7.6, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. RESULTS: The effect of rs17775810 genotype on survival was significant (p=0.036, 2 tailed Fisher exact test). The minor allele homozygotes (TT) had the lowest death rate (0%), whereas the non-TT genotypes (i.e. CT and CC) had the highest death rate (16.2%). CONCLUSION: The rs17775810 analysis corroborates the favorable effect of fluvoxamine on COVID-19 survival.","Lehrer, Steven; Rheinstein, Peter H",In Vivo,342,16

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus that primarily targets the human respiratory system, with fever, cough, myalgia, and pneumonia as the most common manifestations. However, since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool specimens much more attention has been paid to gastrointestinal symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, and diarrhea. Furthermore, the expression of ACE-2 receptors in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon suggests that these organs should also be considered as a potential high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. During aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP; e.g. intubating and extubating patients or any surgical procedures), the production of both airborne particles and droplets may increase the risk of infection. In this situation, the surgical staff is strongly recommended to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). A transparent plastic cube, the so-called ""Aerosol Box"" (AB), has been recently designed to lend further protection against droplets and aerosol exposure during the AGMP.","Bianco, F; Incollingo, P; Grossi, U; Gallo, G",Updates Surg,342,1

The purpose of this article is to explore RLM in times of crisis from the perspective of public authorities responsible for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The article also discusses the significance of crisis-driven RLM for humanitarian logistics and supply chain (HLSC) management. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on an inductive case study logic and guided by a constructivist perspective, this research involves semi-structured interviews with 15 managers and strategists responsible for the RLM of COVID-19 to capture lessons learnt so far from mitigating the transmission and spread of COVID-19. Underpinning the research is a conceptual RLM model premised on coordination, communication, and containment mechanisms (the 3Cs of crisis-driven logistics), as crisis response. Findings: The study finds that the triggering of regional logistics in times of crisis for the COVID-19 case involves taskforce teams with centralisation for crisis readiness, information infrastructure with digitalisation for crisis protocols, and capacity calculations with orchestration for crisis scenarios. The study also finds that navigating the challenges for the 3Cs of crisis-driven logistics entails forward-thinking leadership for culture-based commitments, first-hand clarity for compliance-based campaigns, and far-reaching solidarity for compassion-based contributions. Originality/value: This article addresses the gap in knowledge on RLM and potential priorities that underpin crisis-driven RLM strategies for HLSCs. The research is original in its argument for regional perspectives on logistics strategies that contribute to the “viability” and “integrity” of HLSCs. The research also uniquely focuses on RLM in times of crisis and proposes a conceptual RLM model of strategies for enhancing HLSCs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Durugbo, C. M.; Almahamid, S.

While the decline of the American-led order is not a new trend, it has been accelerated under the Trump administration, which focused on domestic policies and left the global stage in disarray. The challenges are many for the new president, and many pressures can already be felt. Biden’s administration is under high expectations to stabilize the international system and deal with the many issues that the world faces: economic recovery, COVID-19, climate change, cybersecurity, and relations with China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, to name but a few. Yet, while the Biden presidency is—wrongly—understood as “U.S. back to normal,” the international stage has evolved. The article thus argues that restoring American world leadership means modifying that leadership and adapting it to the new reality. Building on management theories and the English School of international relations theories, the research presents a theoretical framework for reinventing and reconstructing a new form of leadership. It then applies the resulting strategic design to the Biden administration’s objectives and policies in the form of seven strategic recommendations. Ultimately, the article explains how the United States can remain world leader by acknowledging the current global situation and adopting a pragmatic vision of international affairs.","Struye de Swielande, Tanguy",World Affairs,342,10

These results also hold when controlling for privacy concerns about the contact tracing app, attitudes toward the app, trust in authorities, and demographic properties.

One key requirement for service sustainability is confirming economic viability. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review to examine the cost-effectiveness of telehealth in primary care. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify articles that conducted economic evaluations of telehealth services in primary care settings. Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL databases were undertaken using keywords relating to telehealth, primary care, and economic or cost. Title, abstract and full-text reviews were conducted and data extraction of study characteristics, economic analysis, and description of service models was performed. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist was used to evaluate study reporting quality. Results: Twenty articles were selected for final inclusion. Four studies employed six analysis types through a cost-consequence analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Five studies used a cost-minimisation analysis and eleven used a simple cost analysis. Telehealth service models included triage services, substitution services, other services, and new services. There was a widespread of reporting quality when studies were assessed again the CHEERS checklist. Most studies reported telehealth as cost-effective, although the quality of this evidence is dependent on study context, analysis type and service model delivered. Conclusions: In various circumstances, telehealth services in primary care are cost-effective. Services appear to be cost-effective when used in appropriate clinical scenarios, when clinician time efficiency is improved, and when overall health service utilisation is reduced. However, telehealth implementation should be motivated by potential overall benefits rather than cost reduction alone. Telehealth can facilitate multidisciplinary care and expand primary care services. Decision makers need to consider the societal benefits of telehealth implementation, as well as the economic benefits.","De Guzman, K.; Snoswell, C.; Caffery, L. J.; Smith, A.

In this article, we provide an overview of psychological distress in the current pandemic, identifying protective factors and risk factors. METHODS: The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for relevant publications (1 January 2019 - 16 April 2020). This study was registered in OSF Registries (osf.io/34j8g). Data on mental stress and resilience in Germany were obtained from three surveys carried out on more than 1000 participants each in the framework of the COSMO study (24 March, 31 March, and 21 April 2020). RESULTS: 18 studies from China and India, with a total of 79 664 participants, revealed increased stress in the general population, with manifestations of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and sleep disturbances. Stress was more marked among persons working in the health care sector. Risk factors for stress included patient contact, female sex, impaired health status, worry about family members and significant others, and poor sleep quality. Protective factors included being informed about the increasing number of persons who have recovered from COVID, social support, and a lower perceived infectious risk. The COSMO study, though based on an insufficiently representative population sample because of a low questionnaire return rate (<20%), revealed increased rates of despondency, loneliness, and hopelessness in the German population as compared to norm data, with no change in estimated resilience. CONCLUSION: Stress factors associated with the current pandemic probably increase stress by causing anxiety and depression. Once the protective factors and risk factors have been identified, these can be used to develop psychosocial interventions. The informativeness of the results reported here is limited by the wide variety of instruments used to acquire data and by the insufficiently representative nature of the population samples.","Gilan, Donya; Röthke, Nikolaus; Blessin, Manpreet; Kunzler, Angela; Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Müssig, Markus; Yuen, Kenneth S L; Tüscher, Oliver; Thrul, Johannes; Kreuter, Frauke; Sprengholz, Philipp; Betsch, Cornelia; Stieglitz, Rolf Dieter; Lieb, Klaus",Dtsch Arztebl Int,342,32

Objective: To determine the effect of bamlanivimab on the incidence of COVID-19 among residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, single-dose, phase 3 trial that enrolled residents and staff of 74 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in the United States with at least 1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index case. A total of 1175 participants enrolled in the study from August 2 to November 20, 2020. Database lock was triggered on January 13, 2021, when all participants reached study day 57. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of bamlanivimab, 4200 mg (n = 588), or placebo (n = 587). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was incidence of COVID-19, defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and mild or worse disease severity within 21 days of detection, within 8 weeks of randomization. Key secondary outcomes included incidence of moderate or worse COVID-19 severity and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The prevention population comprised a total of 966 participants (666 staff and 300 residents) who were negative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 infection and serology (mean age, 53.0 [range, 18-104] years;722 [74.7%] women).

Five deaths attributed to COVID-19 were reported by day 57;all occurred in the placebo group. Among 1175 participants who received study product (safety population), the rate of participants with adverse events was 20.1% in the bamlanivimab group and 18.9% in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (reported by 12 participants [2%] who received bamlanivimab and 14 [2.4%] who received placebo) and hypertension (reported by 7 participants [1.2%] who received bamlanivimab and 10 [1.7%] who received placebo). Conclusions and Relevance: Among residents and staff in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, treatment during August-November 2020 with bamlanivimab monotherapy reduced the incidence of COVID-19 infection.

Psychedelic drugs (YDs) have proven particularly effective in this respect, producing subjective phenomenology which reliably elicits intense STEs. With virtual reality (VR) emerging as a powerful tool for constructing new perceptual environments, we describe a VR framework called 'Isness-distributed' (Isness-D) which harnesses the unique affordances of distributed multi-person VR to blur conventional self-other boundaries. Within Isness-D, groups of participants co-habit a shared virtual space, collectively experiencing their bodies as luminous energetic essences with diffuse spatial boundaries. It enables moments of 'energetic coalescence', a new class of embodied phenomenological intersubjective experience where bodies can fluidly merge, enabling participants to have an experience of including multiple others within their self-representation. To evaluate Isness-D, we adopted a citizen science approach, coordinating an international network of Isness-D 'nodes'. We analyzed the results (N = 58) using 4 different self-report scales previously applied to analyze subjective YD phenomenology (the inclusion of community in self scale, ego-dissolution inventory, communitas scale, and the MEQ30 mystical experience questionnaire). Despite the complexities associated with a distributed experiment like this, the Isness-D scores on all 4 scales were statistically indistinguishable from recently published YD studies, demonstrating that distributed VR can be used to design intersubjective STEs where people dissolve their sense of self in the connection to others.","Glowacki, David R.; Williams, Rhoslyn Roebuck; Maynard, Olivia M.; Pike, James E.; Freire, Rachel; Wonnacott, Mark D.; Chatziapostolou, Mike",,342,21

Its horrific manifestation at the community level significantly affects various dimensions of the quality of life (QoL) of all individuals. The study aimed to examine some of the predictors of the QoL during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional online survey questionnaire was used to gather data on the participants' sociodemographic backgrounds, physical health status, psychological reactions, and QoL. We adapted 12 items from the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instruments (WHOQOL-BREF) to assess the QoL. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. The median and inter-quartile range were used to describe the QoL scores. A multinomial regression analysis was computed between QoL score quartiles and associated factors, and the statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The results of the multinomial regression analysis demonstrated that males (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.31-2.94); participants aged 26 to 35 years (OR = 5.1; 95% CI = 1.33-19.37); non-Saudi participants (OR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.06-2.57); individuals with chronic diseases (OR = 2.15; 95% CI = 1.33-3.48); those who lost their job (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.04-4.57); and those with depression (OR = 5.70; 95% CI = 3.59-9.05), anxiety (OR = 5.47; 95% CI = 3.38-8.84), and stress (OR = 6.55; 95% CI = 4.01-10.70) were more likely to be in the first quartile of the QoL scores. While the full model predicting the total QoL score was statistically significant (R2 = 0.962, F (750, 753) = 16,705.4, p < 0.001), the three QoL dimensions explained 0.643, 0.283, and 0.036 of the variability in environmental, social, and religious/spiritual dimensions, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced various aspects of individuals' QoL, as well as their physical and psychological health.

Transmission appears to be affected by temperature, humidity, precipitation, air currents, pH, and radiation in the ambient environment.

Similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome where cardiovascular diseases were present in nearly 30% of cases, the increased presence of cardiovascular comorbidities remains true for COVID-19 as well. The mechanism of this association remains unclear at this time. Therefore, we reviewed the available literature and tried to find the probable association between cardiovascular disease with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched Medline (via PubMed) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published until Sept 5, 2020. Nineteen articles were included involving 6,872 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The random-effect meta-analysis showed that cardiovascular disease was significantly associated with severity and mortality for COVID-19: odds ratio (OR) 2.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98-4.21 for severity and OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.67-5.39 for mortality, respectively. Risk of COVID-19 severity was higher in patients having diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Similarly, patients with diabetes, hypertension, chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease were at higher risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that cardiovascular disease has a negative effect on health status of COVID-19 patients. However, large prevalence studies demonstrating the consequences of comorbid cardiovascular disease are urgently needed to understand the extent of these concerning comorbidities.","Mishra, Pinki; Parveen, Rizwana; Bajpai, Ram; Samim, Mohammed; Agarwal, Nidhi Bharal",Ann Acad Med Singap,342,33

Moreover, it is to be noted that different areas of Italy have very different lethality rates. Due to the complexity of Covid-19 patient management, it is of paramount importance to develop a well-defined clinical workflow in order to avoid the inconsistent management of patients. The Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) represents a multidisciplinary outline of anticipated care to support patient management in the Sant'Andrea Hospital, Rome. The main objective of this pilot study was to develop a new ICP evaluated by care indicators, in order to improve the COVID-19 patient management. The suggested ICP was developed by a multi-professional team composed of different specialists and administrators already involved in clinical and management processes. After a review of current internal practices and published evidences, we identified (1) the activities performed during care delivery, (2) the responsibilities for these activities, (3) hospital structural adaptation needs and potential improvements, and (4) ICP indicators. The process map formed the basis of the final ICP document; 160 COVID-19 inpatients were considered, and the effect of the ICP implementation was evaluated over time during the exponential phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, a rapid adoption of ICP and regular audits of quality indicators for the management of COVID-19 patients might be important tools to improve the quality of care and outcomes.","Capalbo, Carlo; Aceti, Antonio; Simmaco, Maurizio; Bonfini, Rita; Rocco, Monica; Ricci, Alberto; Napoli, Christian; Rocco, Matteo; Alfonsi, Valeria; Teggi, Antonella; Orsi, Giovanni Battista; Borro, Marina; Santino, Iolanda; Preissner, Robert; Marchetti, Paolo; Marcolongo, Adriano; Anibaldi, Paolo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),342,29

The post-COVID syndrome might also result from neuroinflammatory events in the brain. We highlight gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of acute and chronic COVID-19-associated cough and post-COVID syndrome, consider potential ways to reduce the effect of COVID-19 by controlling cough, and suggest future directions for research and clinical practice. Although neuromodulators such as gabapentin or opioids might be considered for acute and chronic COVID-19 cough, we discuss the possible mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cough and the promise of new anti-inflammatories or neuromodulators that might successfully target both the cough of COVID-19 and the post-COVID syndrome.","Song, Woo-Jung; Hui, Christopher K M; Hull, James H; Birring, Surinder S; McGarvey, Lorcan; Mazzone, Stuart B; Chung, Kian Fan",Lancet Respir Med,342,30

METHOD: The retrospective cohort study was performed among close contacts of index cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and exposure information were extracted. Logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the risk factors. The restricted cubic spline was conducted to examine to the dose-response relationship between age and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate (SAR) was 4.4% in 1,344 close contacts. The group of household contacts (17.2%) had the highest SAR. The rare-frequency contact (p < 0.001) and moderate-frequency contact (p < 0.001) were associated with lower risk of infection. Exposure to index cases with dry cough symptoms was associated with infection in close contacts (p = 0.004). Compared with children, adults had a significantly increased risk of infection (p = 0.014). There is a linear positive correlation between age and infection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children are probably less susceptible to COVID-19. Close contacts with frequent contact with patients and those exposed to patients with cough symptoms are associated with an increased risk of infection.","Hu, Peipei; Ma, Mengmeng; Jing, Qinlong; Ma, Yu; Gan, Lin; Chen, Yan; Liu, Jundi; Wang, Dahu; Zhang, Zhoubin; Zhang, Dingmei",Int J Infect Dis,342,23

The metasurface formed by an array of 3D half-turn Au microhelices in the surface layer of a polymer substrate rotates the polarization plane of transmitted 3-THz radiation through an angle in excess of 50°. Both experimentally and numerically, it is established that the metasurface permits to control the state of polarization and the intensity of transmitted linearly polarized THz radiation using half-wavelength and guided-mode resonances as well as diffraction effects. The proposed approach enables the fabrication of double-layer arrays of half-helices, designed for infrared metasurfaces, from 80-nm wide Au nanostrips.

KEY RESULTS: Mean age was 42.0 years, 76.4% were female, 78.9% were White, 33.2% were nurses, 18.4% were physicians, and 30.3% worked in settings at high risk for COVID-19 exposure (e.g., ICUs, EDs, COVID-19 units). Overall, 43.7% reported a COVID-19 exposure and 91.3% were exposed at work. Just 3.8% in both high- and low-risk settings experienced COVID-19 illness. In regression analyses controlling for demographics, professional role, and work setting, the risk of COVID-19 illness was higher for Black/African-Americans (aOR 2.32, 99% CI 1.45, 3.70, p < 0.01) and Hispanic/Latinos (aOR 2.19, 99% CI 1.55, 3.08, p < 0.01) compared with Whites. Overall, 41% responded that they were experiencing job burnout. Responding about the day before they completed the survey, 53% of participants reported feeling tired a lot of the day, 51% stress, 41% trouble sleeping, 38% worry, 21% sadness, 19% physical pain, and 15% anger. On average, healthcare workers reported experiencing 2.4 of these 7 distress feelings a lot of the day. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers are at high risk for COVID-19 exposure, but rates of COVID-19 illness were low. The greater risk of COVID-19 infection among race/ethnicity minorities reported in the general population is also seen in healthcare workers. The HERO registry will continue to monitor changes in healthcare worker well-being during the pandemic.

In this study we aimed at exploring the eating habits and sleep quality of the adult population of Ecuador during the mandatory confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study, which used an online survey that included questions about eating habits and sleeping habits in adults (n = 9522) between 18-69 years old. The Pittsburg sleep quality questionnaire validated for the Hispanic population was used, and questions about dietary habits. The statistical test Chi-square statistical test was used to analyze the data. The results show that sleep quality differs according to sex, being worse in women, both in all components of sleep quality and in the total score (p < 0.001). Women had greater changes in the habitual consumption of food compared to men (24.24% vs. 22.53%), and people between 18 and 40 years of age decreased their food consumption in relation to people >40 years (24.06% vs. 17.73%). Our results indicate that mandatory confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador has generated changes in the eating habits and sleep quality in the adult population sampled, and these changes are more noticeable in women and young adults. These changes offer an important alert for the health system and further, advice for the implementation of future public health policies.","Ramos-Padilla, Patricio; Villavicencio-Barriga, Verónica Dayana; Cárdenas-Quintana, Haydeé; Abril-Merizalde, Leonardo; Solís-Manzano, Angélica; Carpio-Arias, Tannia Valeria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),342,13

OBJECTIVE: To determine the COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate among the non-congregate population in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. METHODS: The infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate were calculated for adults residing in non-congregate settings in Connecticut prior to June 2020. Individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies were estimated using the seroprevalence estimates from the recently conducted Post-Infection Prevalence study. Information on total hospitalizations and deaths was obtained from the Connecticut Hospital Association and the Connecticut Department of Public Health, respectively. RESULTS: Prior to June 1, 2020, nearly 113,515 (90% confidence interval [CI] 56,758-170,273) individuals were estimated to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and there were 7792 hospitalizations and 1079 deaths among the non-congregate population. The overall COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate were estimated to be 6.86% (90% CI, 4.58%-13.72%) and 0.95% (90% CI, 0.63%-1.90%), respectively, and there was variation in these rate estimates across subgroups; older people, men, non-Hispanic Black people, and those belonging to 2 of the counties had a higher burden of adverse outcomes, although the differences between most subgroups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Using representative seroprevalence estimates, the overall COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate were estimated to be 6.86% and 0.95%, respectively, among community residents in Connecticut.","Mahajan, Shiwani; Caraballo, César; Li, Shu-Xia; Dong, Yike; Chen, Lian; Huston, Sara K; Srinivasan, Rajesh; Redlich, Carrie A; Ko, Albert I; Faust, Jeremy S; Forman, Howard P; Krumholz, Harlan M",Am J Med,342,12

In an effort to make the newly joined students get familiar with the campus environment and the general structure of the academic program, a month-long foundation course has been proposed. The regulatory body emphasized the need to evaluate the foundation course at institutional level so that it can be improved based on the received feedback for the upcoming batches of students. To conclude, the introduction of foundation course as a part of the competency-based medical education for undergraduate students is a welcome step. The foundation course has the potential to offer multiple benefits to the students, and thus it is the need of the hour that a thorough planning goes in the background, and all the available resources and logistics are utilized well for the effective implementation of the course.","Shrivastava, S.

We investigated whether there is an association between AST activity and mortality in IHD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 6857 patients with coronary angiography-proven IHD and AST activity within the reference range. AST activity measurements were available in all patients. The primary outcome was 3-year cardiac mortality. Patients were categorized in groups according to the AST activity tertiles: a group with AST within the 1st tertile (AST < 17.0 U/L), a group with AST within the 2nd tertile (AST > 17-24.5 U/L) and a group with AST within the 3rd tertile (AST > 24.5 U/L). Cardiac death (n = 297) occurred in 109, 69 and 119 patients in the 1st to 3rd AST tertiles (Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality: 5.3%, 3.6% and 5.9%; univariable hazard ratio [HR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-2.36, P < 0.001 for tertile 3 vs. 2; HR = 1.13 [0.87-1.46], P = 0.370 for tertile 3 vs. 1; and HR = 0.65 [0.48-0.87], P = 0.004 for tertile 2 vs. 1).

Since the end of February, the rate of infection has increased greatly due to mass (herd) infection within religious groups and nursing homes in the Daegu and Gyeongbuk regions. This mass infection has increased the number of infected people more rapidly than was initially expected; the epidemic model based on existing studies had predicted a much lower infection rate and faster recovery. METHODS: The present study evaluated rapid infection spread by mass infection in Korea and the high mortality rate for the elderly and those with underlying diseases through the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model. RESULTS: The present study demonstrated early infection peak occurrence (-6.3 days for Daegu and -5.3 days for Gyeongbuk) and slow recovery trend (= -1,486.6 persons for Daegu and -223.7 persons for Gyeongbuk) between the actual and the epidemic model for a mass infection region compared to a normal infection region.

This has necessitated a high degree of dependence upon the use of digitized cadaveric resources, has entailed immense workload demands on staff, and has disrupted students' studies. These educational exigencies have been accompanied by ethical uncertainties for a discipline centered on study of the dead human body. An ethical framework for anatomy is suggested based on the principles of equal concern and respect, minimization of harm, fairness, and reciprocity, in which all staff and students are to be treated with respect and as moral equals. A series of ethical obligations are proposed as a means of maintaining the ethos of anatomy, coping with the suspension of body donation, providing adequate resources, and responding to increased dependence upon external providers. Good academic practice raises more general obligations stemming from the welfare of students, the increased workload of staff, and checking on online assessment and invigilation.

By the end of February 2021, more than 100 million SARS-CoV-2 cases had been reported worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be divided into three phases: An early phase with fever and cough (phase I), a pulmonary vascular disease (phase II) and a hyperinflammatory syndrome (phase III). Since viral replication plays a particularly important role in the early stage of the disease and the patient's immune system in the later course of infection, different therapeutic options arise depending on the stage of the disease. The antiviral nucleoside analogue remdesivir is the only antiviral compound with conditional approval in the European Union. Treatment with remdesivir should be initiated early (within the first seven days of symptom onset) in patients receiving supplemental oxygen without invasive ventilation. In turn, the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone should be administered later in the course of disease in patients receiving oxygen therapy. Since autopsies indicate an increased frequency of thromboembolic events due to COVID-19, additional treatment with anticoagulants is recommended. Since the development of novel antivirals may take years, the application of convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection for the treatment of COVID-19 is reasonable. However, large-scale studies indicated low efficacy of convalescent plasma. Furthermore, vaccination of the population is essential to control the pandemic. Currently, the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran from BioNTech and Pfizer, the mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna as well as the vector vaccine AZD1222 from AstraZeneca are licensed in the European Union. All three vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy in large clinical trials. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many others are being tested in clinical trials. In the present article, an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19 as well as vaccines for protection against SARS-CoV-2 is provided.","Bormann, Maren; van de Sand, Lukas; Witzke, Oliver; Krawczyk, Adalbert",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,342,4

Face masks are believed to protect people from infection by blocking those droplets. However, current filtration efficiency tests can't evaluate masks under sneeze-like pressure. The goal of this study was to establish a method to evaluate the filtration efficiency of mask materials under extreme conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Efficiency of surgical masks, gauze masks, gauze, cotton, silk, linen and tissue paper on blocking micro-droplet sized starch particles (average 8.2 µm) and latex microspheres (0.75 µm) with a velocity of 44.4 m/s created by centrifugation was qualitatively analyzed by using imaging-based analysis. RESULTS: The 4 layers of silk could block 93.8% of microspheres and 88.9% of starch particles, followed by the gauze mask (78.5% of microspheres and 90.4% of starch particles) and the 2 layers of cotton (74.6% of microspheres and 87.5-89.0% of particles). Other materials also blocked 53.2-66.5% of microspheres and 76.4%-87.9% of particles except the 8 layers of gauze which only blocked 36.7% of particles. The filtration efficiency was improved by the increased layers of materials. CONCLUSION: Centrifugation-based filtration efficiency test not only compensates shortcomings of current tests for masks, but also offers a simple way to explore new mask materials during pandemics. Common mask materials can potentially provide protection against respiratory droplet transmission.","Xiao, L I; Sakagami, Hiroshi; Miwa, Nobuhiko",In Vivo,342,24

Thus, this article's objective was to describe the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in indigenous communities in Brazil. METHODS: This descriptive observational study was carried out in indigenous communities in the municipality of Amaturá (Amazonas, Brazil). Individuals from the Alto Rio Solimões Special Indigenous Sanitary District (DSEI) who met the Sars-Cov-2 infection case definitions during the period between January and August 2020 were included. For case notification, the definitions adopted by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health were considered. RESULTS: Out of the entire population served by the Alto Rio Solimões DSEI (n = 2890), 109 indigenous people were suspected of having been infected with Sars-Cov-R during the study period; a total of 89 cases were actually confirmed (rate: 3.08 cases/100,000 inhabitants).

The scale and severity of the COVID-19 emergency have highlighted the need for accurate forecasts of the state of the pandemic at a high resolution. Mechanistic compartmental models are widely used to produce such forecasts and assist in the design of control and relief policies. Unfortunately, the scale and stochastic nature of many of these models often makes the estimation of their parameters difficult. With the goal of calibrating a high dimensional COVID-19 model using low-level mobility data, we introduce a method for tractable maximum likelihood estimation that combines tools from Bayesian inference with scalable optimization techniques from machine learning. The proposed approach uses automatic backward-differentiation to directly compute the gradient of the likelihood of COVID-19 incidence and death data. The likelihood of the observations is estimated recursively using an Extended Kalman Filter and can be easily optimized using gradient-based methods to compute maximum likelihood estimators. Our compartmental model is trained using GPS mobility data that measures the mobility patterns of millions of mobile phones across the United States. We show that, after calibrating against incidence and deaths data from the city of Philadelphia, our model is able to produce an accurate 30-day forecast of the evolution of the pandemic.","Barreras, Francisco; Hayhoe, Mikhail; Hassani, Hamed; Preciado, Victor M.",,342,18

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence. All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and tree topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after 4 months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineage formation, despite the low phylogenetic signal since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated as 1.37 × 10-3 and 2.19 × 10-3 substitution/site/year, respectively. In conclusion, results from this study about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential features of viral emergence.

RESULTS: Out of 101 surgical procedures, including 57 primary oncological resections, 6 lung transplants and 18 emergency procedures, only 5 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 were identified, 3 in the immediate postoperative period and 2 as outpatients. All 5 patients had cancer; the median age was 64 years. The main virus-related symptom was fever (80%), and the median onset of coronavirus disease 2019 was 3 days. Although 80% of the patients who had positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 required in-hospital care, none of them were considered severe or critical and none died. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that, in properly selected cases, with short preoperative in-hospital stays, strict isolation and infection control protocols, managed by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, a surgical procedure could be performed with a relatively low risk for the patient.","Hoyos Mejía, Lucas; Romero Román, Alejandra; Gil Barturen, Mariana; Córdoba Pelaez, Maria Del Mar; Campo-Cañaveral de la Cruz, José Luis; Naranjo, José Manuel; Crolwey Carrasco, Silvana; Tanaka, Shin; Sánchez Calle, Alvaro; Varela de Ugarte, Andrés; Gómez de Antonio, David",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,342,33

A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in a real-world setting is needed. Objective: To assess the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of the BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection 13 to 24 days after immunization in a real-world setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used data from a 2.6 million-member state-mandated health care system in Israel. Participants included all individuals aged 16 years and older who received 1 dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 19, 2020, and January 15, 2021. Data were analyzed in March 2021. Exposure: Receipt of 1 dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: Information was collected regarding medical history and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test and COVID-19 symptoms from 1 day after first vaccine to January 17, 2021. Daily and cumulative infection rates in days 13 to 24 were compared with days 1 to 12 after the first dose using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models. Results: Data for 503â¯875 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.7 [14.7] years; 263â¯228 [52.4%] women) were analyzed, of whom 351â¯897 had follow-up data for days 13 to 24. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2484 individuals (0.57%) during days 1 through 12 and 614 individuals (0.27%) in days 13 through 24. The weighted mean (SE) daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in days 1 through 12 was 43.41 (12.07) infections per 100â¯000 population and 21.08 (6.16) infections per 100â¯000 population in days 13 through 24, a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 51.4% (95% CI, 16.3%-71.8%).

The objective of this study was to develop a time-dependent dynamic simulation model to forecast the COVID-19 autumn-winter outbreak in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, and to assess the effect of social distancing on epidemic spread. The model used was the 'Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered' framework which incorporated appropriate compartments relevant to interventions such as quarantine, isolation and treatment. In a low-intervention scenario including only 2-week isolation for international travelers and their contacts, the model estimated a maximum peak of nearly 90 000 symptomatic cases for early May. For an intervention scenario with mandatory quarantine during a 5-month period, the curve of cases flattened and receded as the proportion of quarantined individuals increased. The maximum peak was expected to appear between May 8 and Jul 8 depending on the quarantine strategy, and the average number of infectious symptomatic cases were 46 840, 30 494, 23 164, 16 179, and 13 196 when 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the population remained in a 5-month-term continuous quarantine, respectively. Only mandatory quarantine was able to delay the maximum peak of infection and significantly reduce the total number of infected individuals and deaths at a 150-day term. The interruption of the quarantine before 120 days of its beginning could generate an even more serious outbreak 30 days later, and surpass the scarce medical resources available for the intensive care of critically-ill patients.","Borracci, Raul A; Giglio, Norberto D",Medicina (B.Aires),342,1

Indeed, following the emergence of this new virus, despite the existence of a few approved and known effective vaccines at the time of writing this original study, a sense of urgency has emerged worldwide to discover new technical tools and new drugs as soon as possible. In this context, many studies and researches are currently underway to develop new tools and therapies against SARS CoV-2 and other viruses, using different approaches. The 3-chymotrypsin (3CL) protease, which is directly involved in the cotranslational and posttranslational modifications of viral polyproteins essential for the existence and replication of the virus in the host, is one of the coronavirus target proteins that has been the subject of these extensive studies. Currently, the majority of these studies are aimed at repurposing already known and clinically approved drugs against this new virus, but this approach is not really successful. Recently, different studies have successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based techniques to understand existing chemical spaces and generate new small molecules that are both effective and efficient. In this framework and for our study, we combined a generative recurrent neural network model with transfer learning methods and active learning-based algorithms to design novel small molecules capable of effectively inhibiting the 3CL protease in human cells. We then analyze these small molecules to find the correct binding site that matches the structure of the 3CL protease of our target virus as well as other analyses performed in this study. Based on these screening results, some molecules have achieved a good binding score close to -18 kcal/mol, which we can consider as good potential candidates for further synthesis and testing against SARS-CoV-2.","Yassine, Rabhi; Makrem, Mrabet; Farhat, Fnaiech",Biomed Res Int,342,16

OBJECTIVE: To understand barriers to physical distancing among HCWs on an inpatient unit and identify strategies for improvement. DESIGN: Qualitative study including observations and semistructured interviews conducted over 3 months. SETTING: A non-COVID-19 adult general medical unit in an academic tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HCWs based on the unit. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study in which we (1) observed HCW activities and proximity to each other on the unit during weekday shifts July-October 2020 and (2) conducted semi-structured interviews of HCWs to understand their experiences with and perspectives of physical distancing in the hospital. Qualitative data were coded based on a human-factors engineering model. RESULTS: We completed 25 hours of observations and 20 HCW interviews. High-risk interactions often occurred during handoffs of care at shift changes and patient rounds, when HCWs gathered regularly in close proximity for at least 15 minutes. Identified barriers included spacing and availability of computers, the need to communicate confidential patient information, and the desire to maintain relationships at work. CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing can be improved in hospitals by restructuring computer workstations, work rooms, and break rooms; applying visible cognitive aids; adapting shift times; and supporting rounds and meetings with virtual conferencing. Additional strategies to promote staff adherence to physical distancing include rewarding positive behaviors, having peer leaders model physical distancing, and encouraging additional safe avenues for social connection at a safe distance.","Keller, Sara C; Pau, Sara; Salinas, Alejandra B; Oladapo-Shittu, Opeyemi; Cosgrove, Sara E; Lewis-Cherry, Robin; Vecchio-Pagan, Briana; Osei, Patience; Gurses, Ayse P; Rock, Clare; Sick-Samuels, Anna C",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,342,29

Currently, measures of precision of regression models' predictions are usually based on the notion of mean error, where by error we mean a deviation of a prediction from an observation. However, these mean based measures of models' performance have two drawbacks. Firstly, they ignore the length of the prediction, which is crucial when dealing with chaotic systems, where a small deviation at the beginning grows exponentially with time. Secondly, these measures are not suitable in situations where a prediction is made for a specific point in time (e.g. a date), since they average all errors from the start of the prediction to its end. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a new measure of models' prediction precision, a divergence exponent, based on the notion of the Lyapunov exponent which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. The proposed approach enables the measuring and comparison of models' prediction precision for time series with unequal length and a given target date in the framework of chaotic phenomena. Application of the divergence exponent to the evaluation of models' accuracy is demonstrated by two examples and then a set of selected predictions of COVID-19 spread from other studies is evaluated to show its potential.","Mazurek, Jirí",PLoS One,342,20

During follow up nine (15.5%) patients required ICU admission and three of them were died eventually. Serum IL-18 were correlated with other inflammatory markers and biochemical markers of organ injury; creatinine, liver enzymes and troponin. Serum IL-18 levels were remarkably higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects with being highest in severe pneumonia group (p < 0.001). IL-18 serum concentrations were almost four-fold higher in patients with worse outcome compared to good outcome (p < 0.001). Serum IL-18 above the cut off value of 576 pg/mL on admission was associated with 11.7 fold increased risk of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The serum concentrations of IL-18 correlate with other inflammatory markers and reflect disease severity. Results of the present study shed light on role of IL-18 on COVID-19 pathogenesis and might provide an evidence for the clinical trials on IL-18 antagonists for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.","Satis, Hasan; Özger, Hasan Selçuk; Aysert Yildiz, Pinar; Hizel, Kenan; Gulbahar, Özlem; Erbas, Gonca; Aygencel, Gülbin; Guzel Tunccan, Ozlem; Öztürk, Mehmet Akif; Dizbay, Murat; Tufan, Abdurrahman",Cytokine,342,10

Although COVID-19 is often compared to other respiratory viral illnesses, few formal comparisons of these viruses on kidney health exist. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the incidence, features, and outcomes of acute kidney injury among Veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 or influenza and adjusted for baseline conditions using weighted comparisons. A total of 3402 hospitalizations for COVID-19 and 3680 hospitalizations for influenza admitted between October 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020 across 127 Veterans Administration hospitals nationally were studied using the electronic medical record. Acute kidney injury occurred more frequently among those with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza (40.9% versus 29.4%, weighted analysis) and was more severe. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and vasopressors and experienced higher mortality. Proteinuria and hematuria were frequent in both groups but more common in COVID-19. Recovery of kidney function was less common in patients with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury but was similar among survivors. Thus, findings from this study confirm that acute kidney injury is more common and severe among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to influenza, a finding that may be driven largely by illness severity. Hence, the combined impact of these two illnesses on kidney health may be significant and have important implications for resource allocation.","Birkelo, Bethany C; Parr, Sharidan K; Perkins, Amy M; Greevy, Robert A; Hung, Adriana M; Shah, Shailja C; Arroyo, Juan Pablo; Denton, Jason; Vincz, Andrew J; Matheny, Michael E; Siew, Edward D",Kidney int,342,26

The magnitude of exposure risk to COVID-19 infections in Ethiopia is rapidly increasing following its spread in the country. However, studies about the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers and factors associated with risk of COVID-19 infection are lacking in Ethiopia. Objective: The study investigated level of risk of COVID-19 infection and associated factors among healthcare workers at Eka Kotebe COVID-19 treatment center. Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September to October 2020 to determine risk of COVID-19 infection and associated factors at Eka Kotebe COVID-19 treatment center. In total, 318 healthcare workers participated in the study. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to describe the Asian American community's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California, and to better inform a Federally Qualified Health Center's (FQHC) health care services and response to challenges faced by the community. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between May 20 to June 23, 2020 using a multi-pronged recruitment approach, including word-of-mouth, FQHC patient appointments, and social media posts. The survey was self-administered online or administered over the phone by FQHC staff in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Survey questions included COVID-19 testing and preventative behaviors, economic impacts of COVID-19, experience with perceived mistreatment due to their race/ethnicity, and mental health challenges. RESULTS: Among 1,297 Asian American respondents, only 3% were tested, and 49% stated that they could not find a place to get tested. Three-quarters of respondents reported feeling stressed, and about 23% reported feeling depressed. About 6% of respondents reported being treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity. Among respondents who experienced economic impacts from COVID-19, 32% had lost their regular jobs and 23% had reduced hours or reduced income. Additionally, 70% of respondents shared that they avoid leaving their homes to go to public places (e.g., grocery stores, church, and school). CONCLUSIONS: We found that Asian Americans reported lower levels of COVID-19 testing and limited access to testing, high prevalence of mental health issues and economic impacts, and high prevalence of risk-avoidant behaviors (e.g., not leaving the house) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary insights into the COVID-19 impact on Asian American communities served by an FQHC and underscore the longstanding need for culturally- and linguistically-appropriate approaches to providing mental health, outreach, and education services. These findings led to the establishment of the first Asian multi-lingual and multi-cultural COVID-19 testing sites in the local area where the study was conducted, and laid the groundwork for subsequent COVID-19 programs, specifically contact tracing and vaccines.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the determinants of quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Impacts of lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 100 patients with PD and their caregivers/spouses were assessed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the short form (SF)-8 were used to evaluate health-related QOL. RESULTS: Regarding health-related QOL, physical function, role physical, general health, vitality and the PCS score were significantly worse in PD patients than in caregivers. Worsening of PD-related symptoms, increased stress, and decreased physical activity were observed in 29.0%, 37.0% and 44.0% of PD patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (16.0%) experienced problems with hospital access, but none reported medication shortages. Strong concerns about COVID-19 were reported by 47.0% of caregivers and 50.0% of PD patients. In PD patients, increased gait disturbance and rigidity, disease severity, smoking, the levodopa equivalent dose and decreased body weight predicted a worse PCS score; anxiety, depression, female sex, stress and long disease duration predicted a worse MCS score. In caregivers, age and smoking contributed to a worse PCS score; depression, stress and worsening patient mood contributed to a worse MCS score. CONCLUSION: We report the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related QOL and its determinants in PD patients and their caregivers.","Suzuki, Keisuke; Numao, Ayaka; Komagamine, Tomoko; Haruyama, Yasuo; Kawasaki, Akiko; Funakoshi, Kei; Fujita, Hiroaki; Suzuki, Shiho; Okamura, Madoka; Shiina, Tomohiko; Hirata, Koichi",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),342,24

This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics of a midsize national dialysis provider that had at least 1 patient who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from February to June 2020. PREDICTORS: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregated setting, comorbid conditions, measurements of frailty, and use of selected medications. OUTCOMES: COVID-19, defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression analyses conducted to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19 and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19. RESULTS: 438 of 7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 were 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregated setting (odds ratio [OR], 17.10 [95% CI, 13.51-21.54]). Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died. Older age, heart disease, and markers of frailty were associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: No distinction was detected between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with asymptomatic screening limited by testing capacity during this initial COVID-19 surge period.

To identify features useful for supporting the confirmation of comorbid anxiety disorders, we investigated the prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders and their associated factors in Japanese patients with mood disorders using data from our previously reported JET-LMBP study. Patients and Methods: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD; n=114) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD; n=334), all with major depressive episodes (DSM-IV-TR) were analyzed. Comorbid anxiety disorders were confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Demographic and clinical features were assessed using patient background forms, including the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Japanese version, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and severity of depressive symptoms was used to identify factors associated with comorbid anxiety disorders (post hoc analysis). Results: The prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders was significantly higher in patients with BD (53.2%) than in patients with MDD (37.2%). Factors associated with comorbid anxiety disorders in BD included no spouse, interpersonal rejection sensitivity, higher CATS sexual abuse scores, and lower SF-36 mental component summary scores. In MDD, factors included hypersomnia, pathological guilt feelings, higher CATS neglect scores, and lower SF-36 physical component summary scores. Conclusion: Comorbid anxiety disorders were commonly seen in Japanese patients with mood disorders. Childhood abuse, atypical depression symptoms, and deterioration of health-related QoL were commonly associated with comorbid anxiety disorders in BD and MDD, suggesting that the presence of these features may be useful to support the confirmation of comorbid anxiety disorders in these patients.","Inoue, Takeshi; Kimura, Toshifumi; Inagaki, Yoshifumi; Shirakawa, Osamu",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,342,20

Since its outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there are no medicines to cure the disease till date. Based on their experience, scientists say that developing a coronavirus vaccine could take at least a year. There are many steps in place before the vaccine comes for the distribution like its safety and cost-effectiveness, especially for the developing countries. In this scenario, the only way to prevent the disease is by following certain safety guidelines and to boost up the body's immune system. Zinc, a crucial trace element involved in several biological and metabolic processes, has been found to play a pivotal role in promoting and appropriately regulating the host defense mechanisms against viral infections. Zinc is naturally present in some foods, fortified in others and also available as dietary supplement. The current RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) of zinc is 12 and 10 mg for males and females respectively. Zinc is the second most common trace mineral after iron in the cell. It is present in all organs and tissues in the body as it forms catalytic component of all 6 classes of enzymes encompassing almost 2000 enzymes in the body. Zinc is biologically essential for cellular processes, including growth and development, as well as DNA synthesis and RNA transcription. Zinc deficiency results in a number of metabolic changes besides a compromised immune system.

Yet we lack a complete, realistic account of either. Building on control engineering, here we introduce a model for decision making in the brain that reuses a temporally abstracted map of future events to enable biologically-realistic, flexible choice at the expense of specific, quantifiable biases. It replaces the classic nonlinear, model-based optimization with a linear approximation that softly maximizes around (and is weakly biased toward) a default policy. This solution demonstrates connections between seemingly disparate phenomena across behavioral neuroscience, notably flexible replanning with biases and cognitive control. It also provides insight into how the brain can represent maps of long-distance contingencies stably and componentially, as in entorhinal response fields, and exploit them to guide choice even under changing goals.","Piray, Payam; Daw, Nathaniel D",Nat Commun,342,26

METHODS: We performed two independent analyses, travel network-based epidemiological modelling and Bayesian phylogeographic inference, to investigate the intercontinental spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: Both approaches revealed two distinct phases of COVID-19 spread by the end of March 2020. In the first phase, COVID-19 largely circulated in China during mid-to-late January 2020 and was interrupted by containment measures in China. In the second and predominant phase extending from late February to mid-March, unrestricted movements between countries outside of China facilitated intercontinental spread, with Europe as a major source. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed that the dominant strains circulating in the USA were introduced from Europe. However, stringent restrictions on international travel across the world since late March have substantially reduced intercontinental transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses highlight that heterogeneities in international travel have shaped the spatiotemporal characteristics of the pandemic. Unrestricted travel caused a large number of COVID-19 exportations from Europe to other continents between late February and mid-March, which facilitated the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted restrictions on international travel from countries with widespread community transmission, together with improved capacity in testing, genetic sequencing and contact tracing, can inform timely strategies for mitigating and containing ongoing and future waves of COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Jing; Li, Juan; Lai, Shengjie; Ruktanonchai, Corrine W; Xing, Weijia; Carioli, Alessandra; Wang, Peihan; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Li, Ruiyun; Floyd, Jessica R; Wang, Liang; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Weifeng; Tatem, Andrew J",J. travel med,342,16

OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate two commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serology tests. DESIGN: A total of 333 unique, non-duplicated serum samples obtained from COVID-19 patients (n=170) and negative controls (n=163) obtained pre-December 2019 were used in the study. Samples were tested on the Roche E411 and Abbott Architect i4000SR platforms and results were correlated to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: There was a strong level of agreement in the qualitative results between both assays with a Cohen's kappa value of 0.840, P<.001. The specificity for both Roche and Abbott were excellent at 100%. Roche exhibited marginally better performance in the &#8805;21 days group with a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI 75.8-96.8%) versus Abbott's sensitivity 84.4% (95% CI 68.3 - 93.1%) as well as the 14-20 days group with a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI 65.4 - 95.0%) versus Abbott sensitivity 81.0% (95% CI 60.0 - 92.3%). Less than 14 days of symptoms groups exhibited poor sensitivity at <50% for both assays. The area under curve (AUC ± standard error) for Roche (0.894 ± 0.025, P< .001) and Abbott (0.884 ± 0.026, P <.001) were very similar. Potential confounders for negative serological results include antiretroviral medication use and pauci-symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Specificities for high throughput Roche and Abbott immunoassays are excellent but users need to be cautious to interpret serological test results after 14 days of symptoms to avoid false negatives.","Tan, Shaun S; Saw, Sharon; Chew, Ka Lip; Wang, Cindy; Pajarillaga, Anastacia; Khoo, Candy; Wang, Weixuan; Mohamed Ali, Zahidah; Yang, Zhixin; Huak, Chan Yiong; Tambyah, Paul; Jureen, Roland; Sethi, Sunil K",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Strict quarantine measures implemented as a result of the pandemic have disrupted many aspects of people's lives, triggering psychological distress. A total of 256 participants were recruited through a convenience sample. Data were collected through snowball sampling, an assessment of distress symptoms using the Brief Symptoms Inventory, and an assessment of leisure-time physical activity using the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Significant changes in paranoid ideation (z = -2.45, P = .01) and interpersonal sensitivity (z = -2.01, P = .04) dimensions were noted between those who were and those who were not authorized to leave their homes during quarantine. Similarly, for physical activity, significant changes in depression (z = -2.15, P = .03), anxiety (z = -2.13, P = .03), interpersonal sensitivity (z = -1.95, P = .05), and somatization (z = -2.11, P = .03) were reported among the insufficiently active group compared with the more physically active group. From multiple regression analysis, variables correlated with general distress were type of quarantine, gender, age, education level, chronic disease, and smoking (R2 = .80). With some variables, leisure-time physical activity domains appeared to be associated only with interpersonal sensitivity and somatization. Having to leave one's home during the outbreak was linked to distress, especially symptoms like suspiciousness, hostility, fearful thoughts of losing autonomy, and feelings of inadequacy, uneasiness, and discomfort during interpersonal interactions. Individuals who were moderately or sufficiently active physically reported less psychological distress.","Sfendla, Anis; Hadrya, Fatine",Health Secur,342,24

However, it remains unclear how the acceptance and uptake of these apps can be improved. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the coverage of the SwissCovid app and the reasons for its nonuse in Switzerland during a period of increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We collected data between September 28 and October 8, 2020, via a nationwide online panel survey (COVID-19 Social Monitor, N=1511). We examined sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with app use by using multivariable logistic regression, whereas reasons for app nonuse were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Overall, 46.5% (703/1511) of the survey participants reported they used the SwissCovid app, which was an increase from 43.9% (662/1508) reported in the previous study wave conducted in July 2020. A higher monthly household income (ie, income >CHF 10,000 or >US $11,000 vs income &#8804;CHF 6000 or <US $6600 [reference]: odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.40-2.64), more frequent internet use (ie, daily [reference] vs less than weekly: OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.85), better adherence to recommendations for wearing masks (ie, always or most of the time [reference] vs rarely or never: OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52), and nonsmoker status (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.71) were associated with an increased likelihood for app uptake. Citizenship status (ie, non-Swiss citizenship vs. Swiss [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87), and language region (French vs Swiss German [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80) were associated with a lower likelihood for app uptake. Further analysis in a randomly selected subsample (n=712) with more detailed information showed that higher levels of trust in government and health authorities were also associated with a higher likelihood for app uptake (ie, high vs low [reference] trust: OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.58-6.22). The most frequent reasons for app nonuse were lack of perceived benefit of using the app (297/808, 36.8%), followed by the lack of a compatible phone (184/808, 22.8%), and privacy concerns (181/808, 22.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating technical hurdles and communicating the benefits of digital proximity tracing apps are crucial to promote further uptake and adherence of such apps and, ultimately, enhance their effectiveness to aid pandemic mitigation strategies.","von Wyl, Viktor; Höglinger, Marc; Sieber, Chloé; Kaufmann, Marco; Moser, André; Serra-Burriel, Miquel; Ballouz, Tala; Menges, Dominik; Frei, Anja; Puhan, Milo Alan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,342,1

In addition to therapeutic treatment methods, preventive measures are also important in controlling the pandemic. As a result, billions of people are quarantined in their homes to prevent the spread of coronavirus. However, social isolation may result in immobility, which can lead to musculoskeletal problems and an increased level of pain, depending on the weakness of the muscles. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of social isolation during the recent COVID-19 pandemic on patients with chronic low back pain. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 patients who underwent a spine intervention within the past year were enrolled in this prospective and cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was performed in the interventional pain unit of a tertiary rehabilitation center in Turkey. METHODS: Patient data were obtained by telephone interview and included information pertaining to demographics, pain history, an assessment of pain, analgesic use, activity levels, and an evaluation of stress and sleep habits. Additionally, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to evaluate patient activity levels. RESULTS: It was detected that social isolation has increased the intensity of low back pain experienced by patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that patients who benefited from spinal injections administered in the prepandemic period experience less severe low back pain (P = 0.000) and took fewer analgesics (P = 0.000) during the pandemic. The findings of our study revealed that there was a significant reverse correlation between IPAQ walking scores and the prepandemic Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores (P = 0.015, r = -0.201) and the pandemic VAS scores (P = 0.000, r = -0.313). By contrast, the level of benefit from injections decreased (P &lt; 0.05) and the duration of spinal intervention was shortened in patients with high IPAQ sitting scores (P &lt; 0.05). LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the study are the small number of patients and the fact that our results are based on patients' self-reported data. CONCLUSIONS: Social isolation has had an increasing effect on low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our study showed a significant relationship between activity level and pain intensity. We also found that patients who have benefited from spinal injections administered in the prepandemic period experience less severe low back pain during the pandemic.","San, A.

Particularities of SARS-CoV-2, such as its persistence in surfaces and the lack of a curative treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, have pushed authorities to apply restrictive policies to control its spreading. As data drove most of the decisions made in this global contingency, their quality is a critical variable for decision-making actors, and therefore should be carefully curated. In this work, we analyze the sources of error in typically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used for diagnosis, and their impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading dynamics. We address the existence of different delays in the report of new cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time gaps, and other error sources related to the sensitivity/specificity of the tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Using a statistically-based algorithm, we perform a temporal reclassification of cases to avoid delay-induced errors, building up new epidemiologic curves centered in the day where the contagion effectively occurred. We also statistically enhance the robustness behind the discharge/recovery clinical criteria in the absence of a direct test, which is typically the case of non-first world countries, where the limited testing capabilities are fully dedicated to the evaluation of new cases. Finally, we applied our methodology to assess the evolution of the pandemic in Chile through the Basic Reproduction Number $R_0$, identifying different moments in which data was misleading governmental actions.

A surgery on COVID-19 patients not only involves a risk of spread of the disease but also there is a serious concern for the patient's surgical outcomes and resources requirement. Aim: The retrospective study is aimed to provide a protocol for pre-operative testing of SARS CoV-2 using RT-PCR in the patient undergoing cardio-thoracic surgeries. Material and Methods: To analyze the impact of pre-operative testing of SARS- CoV-2 using RT-PCR in the patient undergoing elective cardio-thoracic surgeries. The patient who underwent surgical interventions during the COVID-19 lockdown period was divided into two phases. Phase I (without COVID-19 RT-PCR testing) and Phase II (with pre-operative COVID-19 RT-PCR testing). The retrospective comparison between the two study groups was done using Student t-test, Mann-Whitney U, and Chi square (&#967;2) test depending upon the clinical variable to be analyzed. Results: During the early phase (phase I), 26 patients underwent cardio-thoracic surgery without COVID-19 RT-PCR test. Whereas, during phase II, all patients were tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR, preoperatively and a total of 64 surgeries were performed during this phase. One patient planned for CABG was positive on RT-PCR for COVID-19 and was sent to the quarantine ward. The difference in the pre-operative hospital stay between two groups was found to be statistically significant and a significant decrease in the number of PPE kits used, during the phase I. Conclusion: All asymptomatic patients should be tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR prior to cardio-thoracic surgeries not only to contain the disease but to avoid potential implications of COVID-19 on the perioperative course, without added financial implications.","Ralhan, Sarju; Arya, Rajesh C; Gupta, Rama; Wander, Gurpreet S; Gupta, Rajiv K; Gupta, Vivek K; Bagga, Suhani; Mohan, Bishav",Ann Card Anaesth,342,1

We show that the empirically calibrated quadratic kernel is well described by a diagonal contribution (that captures past realised volatility), plus a rank-one""Zumbach""contribution (that captures the effect of past trends). We find that the Zumbach kernel is a power-law of time, as are all other feedback kernels.

The advantages of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), gamification, and telerehabilitation have been demonstrated in several medical fields. In this review, we searched the literature for studies using these technologies for orthopedic rehabilitation and analyzed studies’ quality, type and field of rehabilitation, patients’ characteristics, and outcomes to describe the state of the art of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation for orthopedic rehabilitation. Methods: A comprehensive search on PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Embase databases was conducted. This review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies published between 2015 and 2020 about remote virtual rehabilitations for orthopedic patients were selected. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Cochrane Risk-of-Bias assessment tool were used for quality assessment. Results: 24 studies (9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 non-randomized studies) and 2472 patients were included. Studies mainly concern telerehabilitation (56%), and to a lesser extent VR (28%), AR (28%), and gamification (16%). Remote virtual technologies were used following knee and hip arthroplasty. The majority of included patients were between 40 and 60 years old and had a university degree. Remote virtual rehabilitation was not inferior to face-to-face therapy, and physical improvements were demonstrated by increased clinical scores. Orthopedic virtual remote rehabilitation decreased costs related to transports, hospitalizations, and readmissions. Conclusion: The heterogeneity of included studies prevented a meta-analysis of their results. Age and social context influence adaptability to technology, and this can modify compliance to treatment and outcomes. A good relationship between patient and physiotherapist is essential for treatment compliance and new technologies are useful to maintain clinical interactions remotely. Remote virtual technologies allow the delivery of high-quality care at reduced costs. This is a necessity given the growing demand for orthopedic rehabilitation and increasing costs related to it. Future studies need to develop specific and objective methods to evaluate the clinical quality of new technologies and definitively demonstrate advantages of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation compared to face-to face orthopedic rehabilitation.","Berton, Alessandra; Longo, Umile Giuseppe; Candela, Vincenzo; Fioravanti, Sara; Giannone, Lucia; Arcangeli, Valeria; Alciati, Viviana; Berton, Claudia; Facchinetti, Gabriella; Marchetti, Anna; Schena, Emiliano; De Marinis, Maria Grazia; Denaro, Vincenzo",J.

guidelines are of great importance for all organizations, and governments and regulators are becoming more strict on HSE issue The onset and prevalence of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an example of a lack of attention to such standards and guidelines Adherence to such standards is much more important in all organizations, especially in health-oriented organizations such as hospitals, and they increases safety and improves the efficiency of hospitals and the community (environment) Because health and safety factors are closely related to ergonomic factors (E), attention to this factor has led to the evolution of HSE and the emergence of HSEE Much research has been done on HSE management, related evaluations, and other related issues However, due to the novelty of HSEE, such models have rarely been researched in HSEE In addition, in previous models, the weight of all factors was considered the same, and the evaluations were practically turned into checklists While in any organization or in any situation, the importance of observing some factors may be more or less than others, and at the same time the ergonomic factor should be considered in this model The purpose of this study is to provide a quantitative model for measuring the performance of organizational units based on the observance of the usual HSE criteria and consider the ergonomic factor (HSEE) Numerous studies have shown that ergonomics play a major role in increasing human performance in all areas Developing such a model can lead to more accurate information to managers and their better decision-making in order to reduce harm in the organization as well as organization environment It will also provide more accurate feedback to the organization's units for self-assessment and calculation of any points for them, and ultimately ranking the units Research Method: Since the result of this research is a model that can be used in practice by organizations (especially hospitals), this research is an applied research It is also a descriptive study because it explores the current situation and tries to describe and clarify it and present the result in the form of a quantitative model Finally, because the data in this study is collected through a questionnaire, it is a survey study In the first phase, studies related to the HSE and HSEE models were reviewed In each model, the main variables (health, safety, environment and ergonomics) were collected along with the following variables for each Then, by combining them into one large model, all variables entered the model and overlaps were eliminated Because this model is made for a hospital, the variables were redefined based on the characteristics of the hospital and the model was modified Finally, a model including the main variables of safety, health, environment and ergonomics and 12 sub-variables were designed and a research questionnaire was developed To calculate the reliability of this questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha method with 11 samples were used This sample was selected by emphasizing on people's familiarity with HSE and HSEE models The alpha value was calculated to be greater than 0 8 and the reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed In order to discover the relationship between the 4 main factors and 12 sub-factors, the DEMATEL method with 8 samples was used DEMATEL's method is a well-known method used to the models with independent variables Using the initial classification of factors as well as HSE(E), the decision tree was designed based on ANP method and also the weight of the indicators was obtained The ANP method is based on pairwise comparisons and a subset of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques used to discover the weight of criteria simultaneously with ranking alternatives Because each of the ANP and DEMATEL questionnaires requires a lot of patience and concentration, the YungLan method was used to combine DEMATEL and ANP In this method, the data collection is required only once by he questionnaire and this data is reused in both models At this stage, the weight of 12 factors was calculated and the research model was completely architectural The designed model was implemented in ArabNia Hospital in Qom The goal is to determine how well each of the eight units in the hospital complies with HSEE ArabNia Hospital is the first hospital in Iran, Qom, where patients with COVID-19 were quarantined in February 2020 Because there was no information on how well each of the HSEE components were observed in the hospital, a simple questionnaire using the Likert's spectrum was designed to collect this information This questionnaire was published in a total of 8 units and 11 questionnaires were completed This data was entered into the model as input, and after analysis, hospital units were ranked based on compliance with safety, health, environmental and ergonomic criteria Results: The most important achievement of this research is a quantitative model including 4 areas of safety, health, environment and ergonomics with 12 sub-variables The results showed a correlation between the main domains as well as the research variables Identifying these connections revealed that the decision hierarchy is network type and the model governing the problem is ANP type However, in some research the AHP model was used for this purpose The premise of this model is that the variables are sufficiently independent of each other, which was rejected in this study The results of using this model in the study area also showed that ergonomic factor has the greatest impact on other macro factors, and employee factor has the greatest impact on other 11 sub-variables of research This model was used to evaluate all 8 units of the hospital The goal is to determine how well each of these units complies with HSEE If there is data related to the observance of each sub-variable by each unit in the hospital documents, the relevant data can be entered into the model and after analysis, the amount of HSEE observance by each unit can be determined Because many cases are not recorded in organizations, access to the necessary data is not possible through the hospital's databases Since the organization's staff are the only ones who have a lot of data and metadata in their mental history (albeit to some extent, vague and erroneous), a questionnaire was used to solve this problem For ease of response, the Likert range was used in qualitative measurements This questionnaire was distributed in 8 units and 11 questionnaires were completed and received The required data were analyzed by the research model and 8 hospital units were ranked based on HSEE compliance The results showed that, firstly, the weight of each of the 12 factors of the HSEE model is not the same, and secondly, there is a relationship between them, and finally, the ranking of the units is not the same Conclusion: The results proved the power of model differentiation Using the results obtained in this study, the extent to each components of the HSEE model is affected and differ from each other The use of the model in ArabNia Hospital in Qom showed that the medical, financial and administrative equipment units are ranked first to third in the field of HSEE, respectively With the development of the HSEE measurement model, including the determination of indicators, sub-indicators, their relationship and the weight of each of them, it was found that the weight of the employee invoice is higher than other sub-factors This study provides a framework for measuring hospital performance in terms of HSEE compliance This model can be used in other hospitals as well The point to keep in mind is that it is necessary to recalculate the weight of the variables and sub-variables, which is very simple This model can also be used in other organizations Provided that all sub-variables are redefined in accordance with the same organization and replaced in the model It should be noted that the main foundation and architecture of the model is fixed, but due to the difference in th nature of organizations, such a change in the details of the model is necessary In addition, the relationship between the factors and their weight must be recalculated The results of this study are consistent with many studies conducted in the field of HSE, Including the fact that the human factor is very important in establishing HSE in organizations and complying with the relevant rules and regulations The difference between the model presented in this study and other research is that the relationship between the factors in this model is considered Although this is not explicitly stated, the use of AHP in some studies is due to the fact that independent HSE variables have been considered and the relationship between them have not been considered Some recent research has shown that the combination of DEMATEL and ANP has been used in the HSE model, which indicates an increase in accuracy in such research However, ergonomic factors are absent in these studies In the present study, an attempt has been made to pay attention to all these aspects © 2020

METHODS: A task force, including 10 rheumatologists and 4 infectious disease specialists from North America, was convened. Clinical questions were collated, and an evidence report was rapidly generated and disseminated. Questions and drafted statements were reviewed and assessed using a modified Delphi process. This included asynchronous anonymous voting by e-mail and webinars with the entire panel. Task force members voted on agreement with draft statements using a 1-9-point numerical scoring system, and consensus was determined to be low, moderate, or high based on the dispersion of votes. For approval, median votes were required to meet predefined levels of agreement (median values of 7-9, 4-6, and 1-3 defined as agreement, uncertainty, or disagreement, respectively) with either moderate or high levels of consensus. RESULTS: To date, the task force has approved 80 guidance statements: 36 with moderate and 44 with high consensus. These were combined, resulting in 27 final guidance statements. CONCLUSION: These guidance statements are provided to promote optimal care during the current pandemic.

We focus on 3 historical vectors, all rooted in specific technologies, that have profound implications at the levels of our social imaginary and prereflective ways of being: architecture, social media, and medicine. Architecture has progressively eliminated ""porosity"" between spaces by establishing clear borders between public and private spaces (also within the private ones), thereby contributing to our drive for social distancing. Social media have provided apparatuses that replace intercorporeal encounters with disembodied, virtual interactions mediated by images. Visual experiences that are more embodied, participatory, and ""immersed"" are replaced by passive forms of ""seeing"": the other becomes an image for me, and I for the other. The object of medicine has also recently dematerialized with the advent of the new ""optical"" and ""digital"" machines of modern medicine, which can operate remotely thanks to an increasingly powerful interface reliant on computational power and the resources of artificial intelligence, thereby dispensing with body-to-body interactions. We offer these reflections as routes to a better understanding of changes that have occurred and are occurring on the planes of both culture and individual psychological existence.","Stanghellini, Giovanni; Sass, Louis",Psychopathology,342,15

We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection. METHODS: A multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to three study groups: vaccinated (n=86); PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n=65), and unvaccinated non-infected controls (n=62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD and N). RESULTS: BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (Anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer rate was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared to second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group. CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination induces a robust maternal humoral response that effectively transfers to the fetus, supporting the role of vaccination during pregnancy.

NDIS funding to support education during the first COVID-19 lockdown period forms an important case study of the flexibility of individualized funding schemes. Our results suggest that participant experiences varied widely, with some people able to make the changes they required and others left with a significant service gap. This shows that individual funding schemes are not necessarily more flexible than traditional systems in an emergency situation-useful flexibility depends on many factors, such as clarity of information giving, all actors having a shared message, proactive support of flexibility initiatives, and participants' ability to quickly navigate a complicated system.

Concerns over high severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral burden of mucosal surfaces has raised questions about the aerosol-generating potential and dangers of many otorhinolaryngologic procedures. However, the risks of aerosol generation and associated viral transmission by droplet or airborne routes for many otorhinolaryngology procedures are largely unknown. Indoor aerosol and droplet viral respiratory transmission risk is influenced by 4 factors: (1) aerosol or droplet properties; (2) indoor airflow; (3) virus-specific factors; and (4) host-specific factors. Herein we elaborate on known aerosol vs droplet properties, indoor airflow, and aerosol-generating events to provide context for risks of aerosol infectious transmission. We also provide simple but typically effective measures for mitigating the spread and inhalation of viral aerosols in indoor settings. Understanding principles of infectious transmission, aerosol and droplet generation, as well as concepts of indoor airflow, will assist in the integration of new data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and activities that can generate aerosol to best inform on the need for escalation or de-escalation from current societal and institutional guidelines for protection during aerosol-generating procedures.","Kohanski, Michael A; Lo, L James; Waring, Michael S",Int. forum allergy rhinol,342,26

As a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Cuscutae Semen-Mori Fructus coupled-herbs (CSMFCH) has been known to act a curative effect on OA for thousands of years. Nevertheless, the substantial basis and molecular mechanism of CSMFCH in treating OA remain elusive. METHODS: Herein, an integrated approach, including network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experiment validation, was utilized to reveal the new candidate active component and mechanism of CSMFCH in treating OA. RESULTS: The results show that kaempferol is the most significant bioactive component of CSMFCH on OA. The mechanism and targets of CSMFCH against OA are relevant to hormone regulation, oxidant stress, and reproductive promotion. In order to validate network pharmacology results, molecular docking and experiment validation were conducted. In detail, molecular docking was employed to verify the strong binding interactions between kaempferol and the core targets. UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS was used to identify kaempferol in the CSMFCH extract. In vitro and in vivo experiments further proved CSMFCH and kaempferol could enhance the mouse Leydig (TM3) and mouse Sertoli (TM4) cell viability, improve the male reproductive organ weights, sperm quality, and decrease testis tissue damage in the OA mouse model induced by CP. CONCLUSION: Our results not only identify the new candidate active component of CSMFCH in treating OA but also provide new insights into the mechanisms of CSMFCH against OA.","Bai, Xue; Tang, Yibo; Li, Qiang; Liu, Dan; Liu, Guimin; Fan, Xiaolei; Liu, Zhejun; Yu, Shujun; Tang, Tian; Wang, Shuyan; Li, Lingru; Zhou, Kailin; Zheng, Yanfei; Liu, Zhenquan",Drug Des Devel Ther,342,26

Higher expression of the virus receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the nasal mucosa may be associated with high transmissibility and asymptomatic infection. In COVID-19, the elucidation of the determinants of ACE2 expression at nasal tissue level is crucial. The development of strategies to downregulate ACE2 expression in nasal epithelial cells might reduce transmission and be useful as a novel therapeutic approach. OBJECTIVE To verify ACE2 expression in the nasal mucosa of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis induced by Japanese cedar pollen (SAR-JCP) and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) and to examine the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on ACE2 expression in airway epithelial cells. METHODS We assessed ACE2 expression in the nasal mucosa of control subjects, patients with SAR-JCP, and those with CRSwNP using real-time polymerase chain reaction. We also quantified ACE2 gene expression in cultured airway epithelial cells. RESULTS Although ACE2 expression was greatly increased in a few patients with SAR-JCP during the Japanese cedar pollen season, mean levels were not significantly increased. ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in nasal polyp tissue from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis compared with the expression in that from control subjects. SCFAs generated by gastrointestinal microbiota significantly reduced resting ACE2 expression in cultured airway epithelial cells. SCFAs also significantly suppressed the dsRNA-dependent upregulation of ACE2 expression in airway epithelial cells. CONCLUSION Inflammatory endotype affects ACE2 expression in the nasal mucosa and influences susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In particular, type 2 inflammation could downregulate ACE2 expression in the nasal mucosa and reduces susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with CRSwNP. Although in vivo experiments are required, administration of SCFAs to the nasal cavity might be worthy of consideration as a preventative or therapeutic strategy for the early-stage COVID-19.","Takabayashi, Tetsuji; Yoshida, Kanako; Imoto, Yoshimasa; Schleimer, Robert P; Fujieda, Shigeharu",American journal of rhinology & allergy,342,24

METHODS: In order to disseminate findings from a review on mental health and coping for children and adolescents, a psychoeducational comic book ‘Somoud’ was developed and piloted with adolescents and their caregivers in Lebanon, using a qualitative Grounded Theory approach. RESULTS: In total, 10 participants (5 adolescents, 5 parents), took part in the study. Using Thematic Content Analysis, 6 themes were identified; 1) psychoeducation versus misinterpretation, 2) balancing depth with accessibility, 3) aesthetic appeal, 4) contextual relevance and realism, 5) daily stressors, and 6) parental and social relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the importance of cultural and contextual piloting of psychoeducational content, and the potential usefulness and accessibility of a comic book format to disseminate information to adolescents. Data from the pilot was used to inform the development of a new version of ‘Somoud’ for sharing with adolescents in Lebanon. Further research is required to establish the effectiveness of the psychoeducational book as a ‘self-help’ tool, and to further improve knowledge exchange between researchers and communities.","Bosqui, Tania; Mayya, Anas; Younes, Liliane; Baker, Myriam Claire; Annan, Ismat Maktabi",Confl Health,342,30

HT is a multifactorial disease and a public health burden, as it is a risk factor for diseases like stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure, leading to 10.4 million deaths yearly. Blood pressure is regulated by the RAAS. The system consists of two counter‐regulatory axes: ACE/ANG‐II/AT(1)R and ACE2/ANG‐(1‐7)/MAS. The main regulatory protein in balancing the RAAS is angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The protein also functions as the main mediator of endocytosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) into the host cell. SARS‐CoV‐2 is the cause of COVID‐19 and has caused a worldwide pandemic; however, the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID‐19 are limited. Several drugs and vaccines are currently being tested in clinical trials with a few already approved by EMA and FDA. HT is a major risk factor regarding the severity and fatality of COVID‐19, and the RAAS plays an important role in COVID‐19 infection since SARS‐CoV‐2 can lead to a dysregulation of the system by reducing the ACE2 expression. The exact mechanisms of HT in relation to COVID‐19 remain uncertain, and more research is needed for further elucidation.","Ravichandran, Briyanth; Grimm, Daniela; Krüger, Marcus; Kopp, Sascha; Infanger, Manfred; Wehland, Markus",Physiol Rep,342,1

METHOD: A qualitative design was used. Ten participants with a diagnosis of MCI took part in this study. All interviews were recorded and coded using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The thematic analysis identified three themes related to the quarantine experience of older adults with MCI diagnosis: (1) Effects of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic (2) Believes, feelings and behaviors about the SARS-CoV-2 virus (3) Coping with social isolation/response to difficulties during the pandemic. It was found that older adults with MCI have been mainly psychologically and socially affected by social distancing and isolation, particularly individuals who were alone during COVID-19 outbreak. The only physical dimension negatively affected was the level of activity. Social isolation led to a significant number of negative emotions such as anger, fear of contracting the virus or possibility of contagion for their families, worries and sadness as well as emotional loneliness. It is noteworthy that the majority of participants have used several coping strategies during this challenging time. CONCLUSION: Since social isolation and a sedentary life have been associated with poorer cognition and functionality in people with MCI, a rational plan to both prevent the progression of cognitive decline and to increase social contact, is essential. Special attention must be drawn to maintaining people physically active at home and keeping their daily routine (within the possibilities) and also to ensure social connectedness through technology. Implementation of these measures could potentially reduce negative emotions during the pandemic.","Farhang, Maryam; Miranda-Castillo, Claudia; Behrens, Maria Isabel; Castillo, Eduardo; Mosquera Amar, Sandra; Rojas, Graciela",Aging Ment Health,342,21

However, fewer than 1% of patients in PARADIGM-HF had NYHA class IV symptomology; accordingly, data that informs the use of S/V among patients with advanced HF are limited. The LIFE (LCZ696 In Hospitalized Advanced Heart FailurE) study is a 24-week prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-comparator trial to assess the safety, efficacy and tolerability of S/V compared with V in patients with advanced HFrEF. The trial planned to randomize 400 patients age ≥18 years with advanced HF, defined as an EF ≤35%, NYHA functional class IV symptoms, elevated natriuretic peptide concentration (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] ≥250 pg/mL or N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] ≥800 pg/mL), and ≥1 objective finding(s) of advanced HF.

In this study, an original US, highly virulent PED virus (PEDV) strain PC22A was serially passaged in Vero CCL81 and Vero BI cells. The virus growth kinetics in cell culture, virulence in neonatal pigs and the whole genomic sequences of selected passages were examined. Increased virus titers and sizes of syncytia were observed at the 65th passage level (P65) and P120, respectively. Based on the severity of clinical signs, histopathological lesions and the distribution of PEDV antigens in the gut, the virulence of P100 and above, but not P95C13 (CCL81), was markedly reduced in 4-day-old, caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets. Subsequently, the attenuation of P120 and P160 was confirmed in 4-day-old, conventional suckling piglets. Compared with P120, P160 replicated less efficiently in the intestine of pigs and induced a lower rate of protection after challenge. Sequence analysis revealed that the virulent viruses [P3 and P95C13 (CCL81)] had one, one, sixteen (including an early termination of nine amino acids) and two amino acid differences in non-structure protein 1 (nsp1), nsp4, spike and membrane proteins, respectively, from the fully attenuated P160. However, the overall pattern of attenuation-related genetic changes in PC22A differed from those of the other four pairs of PEDV wild type strains and their attenuated derivatives. These results suggest that PEDV attenuation can occur through multiple molecular mechanisms. The knowledge provides insights into potential molecular mechanisms of PEDV attenuation.","Lin, Chun-Ming; Hou, Yixuan; Marthaler, Douglas G.; Gao, Xiang; Liu, Xinsheng; Zheng, Lanlan; Saif, Linda J.; Wang, Qiuhong",Vet Microbiol,342,22

Acute infections should be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests, but serology tests can demonstrate previous exposure to the virus. METHODS: We compared the performance of the Diazyme, Roche, and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 serology assays using 179 negative subjects to determine negative percent agreement (NPA) and in 60 SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed positive patients to determine positive percent agreement (PPA) at three different timeframes following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. RESULTS: At ≥ 15 days, the PPA (95% CI) was 100 (86.3–100)% for the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel, 96.0 (79.7–99.9)% for the Roche total Ig assay, and 100 (86.3–100)% for the Abbott IgG assay. The NPA (95% CI) was 98.3 (95.2–99.7)% for the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel, 99.4 (96.9–100)% for the Roche total Ig assay, and 98.9 (96.0–99.9)% for the Abbott IgG assay. When the Roche total Ig assay was combined with either the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel or the Abbott IgG assay, the positive predictive value was 100% while the negative predictive value remained greater than 99%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that the Diazyme, Roche, and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 serology assays have similar clinical performance. We demonstrated a low false positive rate across all three platforms and observed that false positives observed on the Roche platform are unique compared to those observed on the Diazyme or Abbott assays.

PURPOSE: Hyperkalemia more commonly affects patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min. Using intravenous (IV) insulin to shift potassium intracellularly may cause hypoglycemia, requiring additional treatment or longer hospitalization. Literature on insulin dosing in this context is limited, with one previous study indicating that 5 units of IV insulin might be as effective and result in less hypoglycemia than the standard dose of 10 units of IV insulin. The hyperkalemia treatment pathway at our institution was revised in May 2018 to include a reduced-dose option (5 units of insulin) for patients with end-stage renal disease. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of hypoglycemia between patients who received standard-dose vs reduced-dose IV insulin. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective, quasi-experimental study evaluated the impact of revision of the hyperkalemia treatment pathway by assessing rates of hypoglycemia during the 6 months before and after implementation of the revised pathway. The primary endpoint was prevalence of hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose level of less than or equal to 70 mg/dL. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia when comparing the pre- and postimplementation groups (36 [17.7%] patients vs 34 [18.7%] patients; P = 0.7924). The postimplementation group had a statistically significant lower reduction in potassium levels after treatment than the preimplementation group (mean [interquartile range], –0.9 [–1.3, –0.5] mEq/L vs –0.6 [–1.2, –0.2] mEq/L; P = 0.0095). Baseline potassium levels were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: Administration of reduced-dose IV insulin for treatment of hyperkalemia was significantly less effective in lowering serum potassium levels and did not decrease prevalence of hypoglycemia. When accounting for potential confounders, the only variable that was associated with hypoglycemia was pretreatment glucose level.","Pearson, Sara Catherine; O’Connor, Kristin; Keller, Kimberly; Hodge, T J; Nesbit, Ross",Am J Health Syst Pharm,342,20

Time series analysis is of great importance to determine both the similarity in the behavior of COVID-19 in certain countries/states and the establishment of models that can analyze and predict the transmission process of this infectious disease. In this contribution, an analysis of the different states of the United States will be carried out to measure the similarity of COVID-19 time series, using dynamic time warping distance (DTW) as a distance metric. A parametric methodology is proposed to jointly analyze infected and deceased persons. This metric allows to compare time series that have a different time length, making it very appropriate for studying the United States, since the virus did not spread simultaneously in all the states/provinces. After a measure of the similarity between the time series of the states of United States was determined, a hierarchical cluster was created, which makes it possible to analyze the behavioral relationships of the pandemic between different states and to discover interesting patterns and correlations in the underlying data of COVID-19 in the United States. With the proposed methodology, nine different clusters were obtained, showing a different behavior in the eastern zone and western zone of the United States. Finally, to make a prediction of the evolution of COVID-19 in the states, Logistic, Gompertz and SIR model was computed. With these mathematical model it is possible to have a more precise knowledge of the evolution and forecast of the pandemic.","Rojas, I.; Rojas, F.; Valenzuela, O.",,342,24

Women with chronic hypertension are easily-recognized and in touch with a wide variety of healthcare providers before, during, and after pregnancy, mandating that chronic hypertension in pregnancy be within the scope of many practitioners. We reviewed recent data on management to inform current care and future research. Study design Narrative review of published literature. Results Compared with normotensive women, women with chronic hypertension are at increased risk of maternal and perinatal complications. Women wish to be involved in their care and are capable of measuring blood pressure (BP) at home. Accurate devices for home BP monitoring are now available. The diagnostic criteria for superimposed preeclampsia remain problematic, as most guidelines continue to include deteriorating BP control in the definition. It has not been established how angiogenic markers may aid in confirmation of the diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia when suspected, over and above information provided by routinely-available clinical data and laboratory results. While chronic hypertension is a strong risk factor for preeclampsia and aspirin decreases preeclampsia risk, the effectiveness specifically among women with chronic hypertension has been questioned. It is unclear whether calcium has an independent effect in preeclampsia prevention in such women. Treating hypertension with antihypertensive therapy halves the risk of progression to severe hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, but a reduction in preeclampsia or serious maternal complications has not been demonstrated; however, the latter lack of evidence is possibly due to few events. Also, treating chronic hypertension neither reduces nor increases fetal/newborn death or morbidity, regardless of the gestational age at which the antihypertensive treatment is started. Antihypertensive agents are not teratogenic, but there may be an increase in malformations associated with chronic hypertension itself. At present, BP treatment targets used in clinic are the same as those used at home; although BP values tend to be inconsistently lower at home among hypertensive women. While starting all women on the same antihypertensive medication is usually effective in reducing BP, it remains unclear whether there is an optimal agent for such an approach, or how best to use combinations of antihypertensive medications. An alternative approach is to individualize care, using maternal characteristics and BP features beyond BP level (e.g., variability) that are of prognostic value. Outcomes may be improved by timed birth between 38+0-39+6 weeks based on observational literature; confirmatory trial evidence is pending. Postnatal care is facilitated by the acceptability of most antihypertensives (included angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors) for use in breastfeeding. Conclusions The evidence base to guide the care of pregnant women with chronic hypertension is growing and aligning international guidance. Addressing outstanding research questions would inform personalized care of chronic hypertension in pregnancy.","MAGEE, Laura A.; KHALIL, Asma; KAMETAS, Nikos; VON DADELSZEN, Peter",Am J Obstet Gynecol,342,28

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe CAP of polymicrobial aetiology in patients admitted to the ICU. METHODS: The prospective observational study included 362 consecutive adult patients with CAP admitted to the ICU within 24 hours of presentation; 196 (54%) patients had an established aetiology. RESULTS: Polymicrobial infection was present in 39 (11%) cases (20% of those with defined aetiology): 33 cases with two pathogens, and six cases with three pathogens. The most frequently identified pathogens in polymicrobial infections were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 28, 72%), respiratory viruses (n = 15, 39%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 8, 21%). Chronic respiratory disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria were independent predictors of polymicrobial aetiology. Inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment was more frequent in the polymicrobial aetiology group compared with the monomicrobial aetiology group (39% vs. 10%, P < 0.001), and was an independent predictor of hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 10.79, 95% confidence interval = 3.97 to 29.30; P < 0.001). The trend for higher hospital mortality of the polymicrobial aetiology group compared with the monomicrobial aetiology group (n = 8, 21% versus n = 17, 11%), however, was not significantly different (P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Polymicrobial pneumonia occurs frequently in patients admitted to the ICU. This is a risk factor for inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment, which in turn independently predicts hospital mortality.","Cillóniz, Catia; Ewig, Santiago; Ferrer, Miquel; Polverino, Eva; Gabarrús, Albert; Puig de la Bellacasa, Jorge; Mensa, Josep; Torres, Antoni",Crit Care,342,23

A realist review,19.244202,6.8425045,2021-03-22,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 has caused great global concerns. In contrast to SARS, some SARS‐CoV‐2 infected people can be asymptomatic or only have mild non‐specific symptoms. Furthermore, there is evidence that SARS‐CoV‐2 may be infectious during an asymptomatic incubation period. With the discovery that SARS‐CoV‐2 can be detected in plasma or serum, blood safety is worthy of consideration. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a NAT screening system for SARS‐CoV‐2 targeting nucleocapsid protein (N) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF 1ab) gene which could screen 5076 samples every 24 hours. 2019‐nCoV RNA standard was used to evaluate linearity of standard curves. Diagnostic sensitivity and reproducibility were evaluated using artificial SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Specificity was evaluated with 61 other respiratory pathogens. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by testing 2 sputum and 9 oropharyngeal swab specimens. The RT‐PCR assay was used to screen SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in blood donors specimens collected during the outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 in Chengdu. RESULTS: LOD of the SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR assay for N and ORF 1ab gene were 12.5 and 27.58 copies/mL, respectively. Intra‐assay and inter‐assay for SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR assay based on Ct were acceptably low. No cross‐reactivity was observed with other respiratory virus and bacterial isolates. The overall agreement value between SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR assay and clinical diagnostic results were 100%. A total of 16 287 blood specimens collected from blood donors during SARS‐CoV‐2 surveillance were tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: A high throughput NAT screening system was developed for SARS‐CoV‐2 screening of blood donations during the outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2.","Li, Meng; Zhao, Yuwei; Li, Ying; Chen, Xue; Luo, Dongxia; Luo, Mei; Hou, Jue; Liu, Juan; Liu, Humin; Wang, Huan; Dong, Yufang; Zhang, Lanjiang; Ji, Maosheng; Zhao, Xin; Wei, Caibing; Li, Wen; Gao, Jialiang; Shan, Hua; Fu, Xuemei",Transfusion,342,16

At the same time, the global slowdown of commercial fishing as a result of COVID-19 has reduced pressure on some threatened stocks to levels not seen since the Second World War. In combination, Brexit and the COVID-19 slowdown have created a unique opportunity to facilitate the recovery of a threatened resource. Nevertheless, challenges remain as fisheries represent only 0.12% of UK economic output, presenting a risk that opportunities for more sustainable management will be lost during wider trade negotiations. Reduced fishing pressure during the COVID-19 era will enable stocks an opportunity to recover if supported by a new UK Fisheries Policy that focuses on: (a) re-establishing the role of Maximum Sustainable Yield to set limits that enable the recovery of fish populations initiated during the COVID-19 era; (b) ensuring that catch targets are set with the aim to maintain biomass at 120% of that which will achieve Maximum Sustainable Yield; (c) improving coherent resource management that also considers the expensive use of carbon associated with unsustainable fishing, and the need to protect fish throughout their life-cycle; and (d) constructing and effectively enforcing protection of a resilient network of Marine Protected Areas despite potential protests from EU member states.","Kemp, Paul S.; Froese, Rainer; Pauly, Daniel",Mar Policy,342,2

High viral loads are found at the sewage pipeline or at the entrance of wastewater treatment plants from cities where the number of COVID-19 cases are significant. In Quito (Ecuador) as in many other cities worldwide, wastewater is directly discharged into natural waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 target regions) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target regions in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC/L for N2. The high values detected in natural waters from a low sanitation region have several implications in health and ecology that should be further assessed.","Guerrero-Latorre, Laura; Ballesteros, Isabel; Villacrés, Irina M.; Granda, M.

Given that angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the viral entry molecule, understanding ACE2 has become a major focus of current COVID-19 research. ACE2 is highly expressed in the gut, but its role has not been fully understood and thus COVID-19 treatments intending to downregulate ACE2 level may cause untoward side effects. Gaining insight into the functions of ACE2 in gut homeostasis therefore merits closer examination, and is beneficial to find potential therapeutic alternatives for COVID-19. Methods: We took advantage of Ace2 knockout out mice and isolated intestinal organoids to examine the role of ACE2 in intestinal stemness. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mouse model was established by 4% dextran sodium sulfate. LGR5 and KI67 levels were quantitated to reflect the virtue of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). FITC-dextran 4 (FD-4) assay was used to assess intestinal barrier function. Results: Western blotting identified the expression of ACE2 in colon, which was consistent with the results of immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Moreover, Ace2(−/−) organoids showed decreased LRG5 and KI67 levels, and elevated calcium concentration. Furthermore, the permeability of ace2(−/−) organoids was markedly increased compared with ace2(+/+) organoids. Collectively, ace2(−/−) mice were more susceptible than ace2(+/+) mice to IBD, including earlier bloody stool, undermined intestinal architecture and more pronounced weight loss. Conclusions: Our data reveal that ACE2 contributes to the proliferation of intestinal stem cells and hence orchestrates the mucosal homeostasis.","Yu, Wei; Ou, Xianhong; Liu, Xiaofan; Zhang, Shuaixu; Gao, Xinxin; Cheng, Hongju; Zhu, Baoliang; Yan, Jing",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,342,1

Mobile health (mHealth)–based interventions taking advantage of smartphone technology have shown particular promise in increasing the quality of self-care among these patients, and in turn improving the outcomes of their disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to co-develop with physicians, patients with HF, and their caregivers a patient-oriented mHealth app, perform usability assessment, and investigate its effect on the quality of life of patients with HF and rate of hospitalizations in a pilot study. METHODS: The development of an mHealth app (The Hellenic Educational Self-care and Support Heart Failure app [ThessHF app]) was evidence based, including features based on previous clinically tested mHealth interventions and selected by a panel of HF expert physicians and discussed with patients with HF. At the end of alpha development, the app was rated by mHealth experts with the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). The beta version was tested by patients with HF, who rated its design and content by means of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). Subsequently, a prospective pilot study (THESS-HF [THe Effect of a Specialized Smartphone app on Heart Failure patients’ quality of self-care, quality of life and hospitalization rate]) was performed to investigate the effect of app use on patients with HF over a 3-month follow-up period. The primary endpoint was patients’ quality of life, which was measured with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L). The secondary endpoints were the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale (EHFScBS) score and the hospitalization rate. RESULTS: A systematic review of mHealth-based HF interventions and expert panel suggestions yielded 18 separate app features, most of which were incorporated into the ThessHF app. A total of 14 patients and 5 mHealth experts evaluated the app. The results demonstrated a very good user experience (overall PSSUQ score 2.37 [SD 0.63], where 1 is the best, and a median MARS score of 4.55/5). Finally, 30 patients (male: n=26, 87%) participated in the THESS-HF pilot study (mean age 68.7 [SD 12.4] years). A significant increase in the quality of self-care was noted according to the EHFScBS, which increased by 4.4% (SD 7.2%) (P=.002). The mean quality of life increased nonsignificantly after 3 months according to both KCCQ (mean increase 5.8 [SD 15] points, P=.054) and EQ-5D-5L (mean increase 5.6% [SD 15.6%], P=.06) scores. The hospitalization rate for the follow-up duration was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The need for telehealth services and remote self-care management in HF is of vital importance, especially in periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a user-friendly mHealth app to promote remote self-care support in HF. In this pilot study, the use of the ThessHF app was associated with an increase in the quality of self-care. A future multicenter study will investigate the effect of the app use on long-term outcomes in patients with HF.","Bakogiannis, Constantinos; Tsarouchas, Anastasios; Mouselimis, Dimitrios; Lazaridis, Charalampos; Theofillogianakos, Efstratios K; Billis, Antonios; Tzikas, Stergios; Fragakis, Nikolaos; Bamidis, Panagiotis D; Papadopoulos, Christodoulos E; Vassilikos, Vassilios P",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,342,20

METHODS: This prospective, multicentre cohort study was conducted in paediatric units in three university hospitals in Finland from 2008 to 2010. Hospital medical records were reviewed to collect data on clinical course, testing and treatment. Data were analysed separately for children meeting our strict definition of bronchiolitis, aged under 12 months without a history of wheezing, and a loose definition, aged 12–23 months or with a history of wheezing. RESULTS: The median age of the 408 children was 8.1 months. Clinical management varied between the three hospitals when stratified by strict and loose bronchiolitis subgroup definitions: complete blood counts ranged from 15–95% vs 16–94%, respectively, and the other measures were chest x‐ray (16–91% vs 14–72%), intravenous fluids (2–47% vs 2–41%), use of nebulised epinephrine (10–84% vs 7–50%), use of salbutamol (18–21% vs 13–84%) and use of corticosteroids (6–23% vs 60–76%). CONCLUSION: The clinical management of bronchiolitis varied considerably with regard to the three hospitals and the two definitions of bronchiolitis.

The purpose of the present study was to explore the potential mental health impact of this forced quarantine and widespread shutdown among small business owners and the self-employed. A semi-structured interview was employed among 14 participants from three different cities in China. Grounded Theory was employed to analyze the data using Nvivo11 plus. Based on a qualitative analysis, 9 categories of responses emerged to describe the experience and actions of participants towards the quarantine: enjoyment of life, emotional disturbance, hope, comparisons to others, social support, patriotism, making changes, and obedience. Further analysis suggested that the mental state of participants was either positive or negative depending on enjoyment of life, loss, emotional disturbance, and hope, and that these were impacted by intervening conditions (national measures, social support, patriotism), personal strategies (exercising, studying, comparisons to others), and personal consequences (making change, obedience). Rather than observing a linear pattern of negative outcomes, mental state was found to be variable in that positive outcomes were experienced earlier in the quarantine (making connections with family), negative states were encountered midway through the quarantine (fear of financial loss, anxiety), and more positive mental states (hope) emerged towards the end of the quarantine depending on intervening conditions, personal strategies, and consequences. It can be concluded that the nature of the impact of mandatory quarantine in China among small business owners and the self-employed is complex and depends on a variety of personal and situational factors.","Wang, Wei; Huang, Wenjing; Liu, Xiaoxue; Hennessy, Dwight A.",Curr Psychol,342,5

To reasonably anticipate major consequences according to the available evidence, we hereby review the literature for studies that have explored the health impacts of several weeks of a reduction in physical activity and daily step-count combined with modified eating habits. These studies identify as main metabolic consequences increases in insulin resistance, total body fat, abdominal fat and inflammatory cytokines. All these factors have been strongly associated with the development of metabolic syndrome, which in turn increases the risk of multiple chronic diseases. A plausible mechanism involved in these impacts could be a positive energy balance promoted by maintaining usual dietary intake while reducing energy expenditure. This means that just as calorie intake restriction could help mitigate the deleterious impacts of a bout of physical inactivity, overeating under conditions of home confinement is very likely to exacerbate these consequences. Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been identified as potential risk factors for more severely ill patients with COVID-19. Thus, adequate control of metabolic disorders could be important to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.","Martinez-Ferran, María; de la Guía-Galipienso, Fernando; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabián; Pareja-Galeano, Helios",Nutrients,342,1

Borna disease, caused by Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), is an infectious disease affecting mammals, but recently it has also been shown to cause fatal encephalitis in humans. The endemic character of Borna disease points towards a nature-bound reservoir, with only one shrew species identified as reservoir host to date. Bats have been identified as reservoirs of a variety of zoonotic infectious agents. Endogenous borna-like elements in the genome of certain bat species additionally point towards co-evolution of bats with bornaviruses and therefore raise the question whether bats could serve as a potential reservoir of orthobornaviruses. METHODS: Frozen brain samples (n = 257) of bats of seven different genera from Germany were investigated by orthobornaviral RT-PCR. Additionally, tissue slides of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of a subset of these bats (n = 140) were investigated for orthobornaviral phosphoprotein by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The brain samples were tested by RT-PCR without any evidence of orthobornavirus specific amplicons. Immunohistochemistry revealed a faint immunoreaction in 3/140 bats but with an untypical staining pattern for viral antigen. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR-screening showed no evidence for orthobornaviral RNA in the investigated bats. However, immunohistochemistry results should be investigated further to elucidate whether the reaction might be associated with expressed endogenous bornaviral elements or other so far unknown bornaviruses.","Nobach, Daniel; Herden, Christiane",Virol J,342,16

Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spike-mediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here, we detailed how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also made all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrated how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles could be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.","Crawford, Katharine H.

A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2 and 17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalized lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","Hawryluk, Iwona; Mellan, Thomas A.; Hoeltgebaum, Henrique; Mishra, Swapnil; Schnekenberg, Ricardo P.; Whittaker, Charles; Zhu, Harrison; Gandy, Axel; Donnelly, Christl A.; Flaxman, Seth; Bhatt, Samir",J R Soc Interface,342,1

The current pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), is unprecedented even in the historical term of pandemics. The unprecedentedness is featured by multiple surges, rapid identification of therapeutic options and accelerated development of vaccines. Remdesivir, originally developed for Ebola viral disease, is the first treatment of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. As demonstrated by in vitro and preclinical studies, this therapeutic agent is highly potent with a broad spectrum activity against viruses from as many as seven families even cross species. However, randomized controlled trials have failed to confirm the efficacy and safety. Remdesivir improves some clinical signs but not critical parameters such as mortality. This antiviral agent is an ester/phosphorylation prodrug and excessive hydrolysis which increases cellular toxicity. Remdesivir is given intravenously, leading to concentration spikes and likely increasing the potential of hydrolysis-based toxicity. This review has proposed a conceptual framework for improving its efficacy and minimizing toxicity not only for the COVID-19 pandemic but also for future ones caused by remdesivir-sensitive viruses.","Yan, Daisy; Ra, One Hyuk; Yan, Bingfang",Animal Diseases,342,16

IFN-α producing cells, referred to as natural interferon α producing (NIP) cells, were detected by an ELISPOT assay using anti-porcine IFN-α monoclonal antibodies. The frequency of NIP cells among blood cells is low, at most 40–110 per 105 PBMC and each NIP cell was found to produce several units of IFN. We have shown that NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell gradually increased with the age of the donor animals, from the neonatal period to the adult age, with a significant increase around puberty. Our present results also indicate that NIP cells may be influenced by physiological and genetic factors; thus (1) NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell were decreased during lactation; (2) Chinese (Meishan) pigs were found to have higher NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell than European (Large White) animals.","Nowacki, W.; Cederblad, Britta; Renard, Christine; La Bonnardière, C.; Charley, B.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,342,8

Identifying indicators of hospital admission for Covid‐19 patients early in the disease course could aid the efficient allocation of medical interventions. Self‐reported olfactory impairment has recently been recognized as a hallmark of Covid‐19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. METHODS: : A retrospective review of all patients presenting to a San Diego Hospital system with laboratory‐confirmed positive Covid‐19 infection was conducted with evaluation of olfactory and gustatory function and clinical disease course. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and anosmia. RESULTS: : A total of 169 patients tested positive for Covid‐19 disease between March 3 and April 8, 2020. Olfactory and gustatory data were obtained for 128/169 (75.7%) subjects of which 26/128 (20.1%) required hospitalization. Admission for Covid‐19 was associated with intact sense of smell and taste, increased age, diabetes, as well as subjective and objective parameters associated with respiratory failure. On adjusted analysis, anosmia was strongly and independently associated with outpatient care (aOR 0.09 95% CI: 0.01‐0.74) while positive findings of pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleural effusion on chest radiograph (aOR 8.01 95% CI: 1.12‐57.49) was strongly and independently associated with admission. CONCLUSIONS: : Normosmia is an independent predictor of admission in Covid‐19 cases. Smell loss in Covid‐19 may associate with a milder clinical course. This article is protected by copyright.

DD1 was optimized in gas phase, aqueous and DMSO solutions using hybrid B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method. Comparisons between experimental and theoretical infrared spectra, (1)H and (13)C NMR chemical shifts and electronic spectrum in DMSO solution evidence good concordances. Higher solvation energy was observed in aqueous solution than in DMSO, showing in aqueous solution a higher value than antiviral brincidofovir and chloroquine. on Bond orders, atomic charges and topological studies suggest that imidazole ring play a very important role in the properties of DD1. NBO and AIM analyses support the intra-molecular O15-H16•••N17 bonds of DD1 in the three media. Low gap value supports the higher reactivity of DD1 than chloroquine justified by the higher electrophilicity and low nucleophilicity. Complete vibrational assignments of DD1 in gas phase and aqueous solution are reported together with the scaled force constants. In addition, better intermolecular interactions were observed by Hirshfeld surface analysis. Finally, the molecular docking mechanism between DD1 ligand and COVID-19/6WCF and COVID-19/6Y84 receptors were studied to explore the binding modes of these compounds at the active sites.

It uses a multi-level perspective to organise the various factors influencing food-related behaviour and proposes a new, multi-level, framework of consumer behaviour and household food waste. A novel addition to the field, the framework gathers factors at micro (individual), meso (household), and macro (external to the household) levels and argues that behaviour and food waste emerge from their interactions. Our review also reveals a research domain with disciplinary and methodological ‘bald spots’ and an over-emphasis on individual level factors. A multi-level research agenda focusing on under-explored factors and interactions between factors across levels is presented, and consideration given to multi-level interventions that support consumer behaviour change to reduce household food waste.","Boulet, Mark; Hoek, Annet C.; Raven, Rob",Appetite,342,16

Multifactorial interventions could be more effective in people at high risk of falling; however, the focus of such interventions has traditionally been quite narrow. This paper describes the design of a randomised controlled trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of an eHealth programme, which addresses cumulative effects of key fall-risk factors across the triad of physical, affective and cognitive functions on falls in older people. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 518 older people aged 65 years and over with high fall risk, defined as having a history of falls in the past 6 months, self-reported fear of falling or being aged 80 years or over, will be recruited via local advertisements, newsletters and presentations, and randomised to an intervention or health education control group. The intervention comprises balance exercise, cognitive-motor exercise and cognitive–behavioural therapy, with their dosage based on participant’s baseline balance, executive function and mood. The primary outcome is the rate of falls in the 12 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes at 6 and 12 months comprise programme adherence, healthcare use, physical activity, balance and mobility, cognitive function, psychological well-being, quality of life, health literacy and user experience and attitudes towards the programme. Data will be analysed following intention to treat to gauge real-world effectiveness. We will further determine complier averaged causal effects to correct for varying adherence and conduct economic analyses to gain insight into cost-effectiveness and cost–utility.

STEM is not a model or a tool designed for a specific disease; it is a flexible, modular framework supporting exchange and integration of community models, reusable plug-in components, and denominator data, available to researchers worldwide at www.eclipse.org/stem. A review of multiple projects illustrates its capabilities. STEM has been used to study variations in transmission of seasonal influenza in Israel by strains; evaluate social distancing measures taken to curb the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico City; study measles outbreaks in part of London and inform local policy on immunization; and gain insights into H7N9 avian influenza transmission in China. A multistrain dengue fever model explored the roles of the mosquito vector, cross-strain immunity, and antibody response in the frequency of dengue outbreaks. STEM has also been used to study the impact of variations in climate on malaria incidence. During the Ebola epidemic, a weekly conference call supported the global modeling community; subsequent work modeled the impact of behavioral change and tested disease reintroduction via animal reservoirs. Work in Germany tracked salmonella in pork from farm to fork; and a recent doctoral dissertation used the air travel feature to compare the potential threats posed by weaponizing infectious diseases. Current projects include work in Great Britain to evaluate control strategies for parasitic disease in sheep, and in Germany and Hungary, to validate the model and inform policy decisions for African swine fever. STEM Version 4.0.0, released in early 2019, includes tools used in these projects and updates technical aspects of the framework to ease its use and re-use.","Douglas, Judith V.; Bianco, Simone; Edlund, Stefan; Engelhardt, Tekla; Filter, Matthias; Günther, Taras; Hu, Kun (Maggie); Nixon, Emily J.; Sevilla, Nereyda L.; Swaid, Ahmad; Kaufman, James H.",Health Secur,342,22

METHODS: Patients were recruited from two acute hospital sites in Leicester (UK) over 3 successive winters. Samples were taken for viral and bacterial testing. RESULTS: Of the 780 patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness 345 (44%) had a respiratory virus detected. Picornaviruses were the most commonly isolated viruses (detected in 23% of all patients). Virus detection rates exceeded 50% in patients with exacerbation of asthma (58%), acute bronchitis and Influenza-like-illness (64%), and ranged from 30 to 50% in patients with an exacerbation of COPD (38%), community acquired pneumonia (36%) and congestive cardiac failure (31%). Bacterial detection was relatively frequent in patients with exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia (25% and 33% respectively) but was uncommon in all other groups. Antibiotic use was high across all clinical groups (76% overall) and only 21% of all antibiotic use occurred in patients with detectable bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are the predominant detectable aetiological agents in most hospitalised adults with acute respiratory illness. Antibiotic usage in hospital remains excessive including in clinical conditions associated with low rates of bacterial detection. Efforts at reducing excess antibiotic use should focus on these groups as a priority.

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age ≥ 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age ≥ 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L; age < 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L, 0%) (P <0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.","Lu, Jiatao; Hu, Shufang; Fan, Rong; Liu, Zhihong; Yin, Xueru; Wang, Qiongya; Lv, Qingquan; Cai, Zhifang; Li, Haijun; Hu, Yuhai; Han, Ying; Hu, Hongping; Gao, Wenyong; Feng, Shibo; Liu, Qiongfang; Li, Hui; Sun, Jian; Peng, Jie; Yi, Xuefeng; Zhou, Zixiao; Guo, Yabing; Hou, Jinlin",,342,16

The COVID-19 vaccine trials are high profile trials that have enrolled more than 100 000 participants. Consent documents must be succinct and understandable to ensure informed voluntary participation. OBJECTIVE: To assess how well informed consent documents of the COVID-19 vaccine trials achieve the ideal of being succinct and understandable, and to create a shorter, more readable document. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study collected and analyzed the informed consent documents used in 4 COVID-19 vaccine phase III randomized clinical trials to quantitatively assess readability and length and, based on this analysis, created a measurably more accessible informed consent document. Analysis was conducted from October 2020 to January 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were number of words (measured as word count), time-to-read (measured at reading speeds of 175-300 words per minute), language complexity (measured using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level assessment), and readability (measured using Flesch Reading Ease Score). Secondary outcomes included clarity of how the placebo group could access the vaccine if it is proven safe and effective. The study also examined the length and readability of an improved consent document. RESULTS: The 4 informed consent documents were a mean (range) of 8333 (7821 to 9340) words long, with a mean (range) 35 (32.6 to 38.9) minutes to read at 240 words per minute. All documents exceeded grade 9 language complexity and scored lower than 60 in the formal reading ease metric, which constitutes difficult. Only 1 document specified that participants in the placebo group might receive vaccine. It was possible to write a document in fewer than 3000 words with a grade 7 to 8 reading level and a formal readability score that was not difficult. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that existing COVID-19 vaccine informed consent documents were too long, difficult to read, and exceeded grade 9 in language complexity.

These outbreaks share many similarities, including clinical presentation, transmission, and management. Although respiratory manifestations are responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality in these conditions, extra-pulmonary manifestations such as gastrointestinal symptoms are also increasingly recognized as important symptoms. Important gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Hepatic manifestations such as abnormal aminotransferases are also noted in these patients. Early identification of GI symptoms is crucial as some patients can present only with GI manifestations in the absence of pulmonary symptoms. Furthermore, patients with diarrhea have tested positive for viral RNA in the stool. This has been reported even after the resolution of respiratory symptoms and can extend up to many days from the onset of symptoms. Because of this phenomenon, there is a theoretical risk of fecal-oral transmission and the potential spread of the disease. Though GI symptoms are frequently observed, understanding the pathogenesis of these symptoms is crucial, as it can not only of public health importance but could also identify infected patients early in the spread. Understanding the different GI and hepatic manifestations with underlying mechanisms of symptoms can assist in the therapeutic management of these patients. In this article, we summarize various GI and hepatic manifestations with their prevalence, underlying pathophysiology with emphasis on stool positivity.","McFee, R.B.",Dis Mon,342,26

We aimed to conduct a comprehensive etiologic and epidemiologic study of multiple CIRD agents in a diverse dog population using molecular methods and statistical modeling analyses. In addition, a novel probe-based multiplex real-time PCR was developed to simultaneously detect and differentiate two species of Mycoplasma (M. canis and M. cynos).

Results showed low occurrence of classical CIRD agents such as B. bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus and distemper virus, while highlighting the potential role of emerging bacteria such as M. canis and M. cynos. Statistical modeling analyses of CIRD pathogens emphasized the impact of co-infections on the severity of clinical presentation, and showed that host factors, such as animal age, are the most important predictors of disease severity. This study provides new insights into the current understanding of the prevalence and role of co-infections with selected viruses and bacteria in the etiology of CIRD, while underscoring the importance of molecular diagnosis and vaccination against this disease.","Maboni, Grazieli; Seguel, Mauricio; Lorton, Ana; Berghaus, Roy; Sanchez, Susan",PLoS One,342,1

The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed two B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The motif in S1 subunit is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Phosphatases and kinases are major players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses target PP2A in order to manipulate hosts antiviral responses. Recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight COVID-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and the PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the discovery and/or development of a bioactive ligand inhibitor for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, a small molecule called Artepillin C (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis, mimics the side chains of LxxLxE motif. Importantly, ArtC is known, among other effects, to have anti-inflammatory activity that makes it an excellent candidate for future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.","Maaroufi, Halim",bioRxiv,342,21

We aim to evaluate the economic and healthcare impact of lung perfusion scintigraphy (LPS) used in patients with suspected APE, in the event of non-conclusive or contraindicated computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). We considered two alternative healthcare processes for APE diagnosis, with and without LPS. We performed a cost analysis with the aim of evaluating the average direct healthcare costs for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of APE. We used data from a monocentric trial. Our economic model showed that the strategy with LPS was preferable in terms of costs. The average per-patient costs for the diagnosis and treatment of the acute phase of PE in low-risk patients with a non-conclusive or not-executable CTPA, with and without LPS, are EUR 2145.25 and EUR 4912.45, respectively. LPS is a simple, quick, and economic examination, useful in this setting of patients not only for an early diagnosis but also to exclude APE, demonstrating an advantage in terms of healthcare resources. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the economic and healthcare impact of the use of LPS in the diagnostic pathway of suspected APE.","Rubini, Giuseppe; Ferrari, Cristina; Mammucci, Paolo; Pisani, Antonio Rosario; Mincarone, Pierpaolo; Leo, Carlo Giacomo",Healthcare (Basel),342,10

It has affected over 52 million people and led to over 1.29 million deaths worldwide, as of November 13th, 2020. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 present with symptoms ranging from none to severe and include fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, anosmia, and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Severe complications are largely due to overdrive of the host immune system leading to “cytokine storm”. This results in disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and death. Due to its highly infectious nature and concerning mortality rate, every effort has been focused on prevention and creating new medications or repurposing old treatment options to ameliorate the suffering of COVID-19 patients including the immune dysregulation. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to be incorporated throughout the body into the bi-phospholipid layer of the cell membrane leading to the production of less pro-inflammatory mediators compared to other fatty acids that are more prevalent in the Western diet. In this article, the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, including their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, and possible antiviral effects have been discussed.","Hathaway, Donald; Pandav, Krunal; Patel, Madhusudan; Riva-Moscoso, Adrian; Singh, Bishnu Mohan; Patel, Aayushi; Min, Zar Chi; Singh-Makkar, Sarabjot; Sana, Muhammad Khawar; Sanchez-Dopazo, Rafael; Desir, Rockeven; Fahem, Michael Maher Mourad; Manella, Susan; Rodriguez, Ivan; Alvarez, Alina; Abreu, Rafael",Infect Chemother,342,0

We surveyed the knowledge, attitude, and practices on rabies among school children in three schools located in southern Bhutan. A total of 701 students (57.9% female, 42.1% male) with an age range of 12–21 years (mean: 15 years) participated in the survey, of which 98.2% had heard about rabies. Most of the students demonstrated a good level of knowledge (59.7%) and a favorable perception towards rabies (57.7%). Multivariable logistic analysis revealed the relation between knowledge and the awareness campaign (OR:1.5, 95% CI: 1.1–2.1). Similarly, higher grades of students (OR:1.9, 95%CI: 1.3–2.9) and employed mothers of the students (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0–2.7) were associated with more favorable perceptions. However, some knowledge gaps were identified in this study, such as students not being able to clearly mention the susceptible hosts of rabies, transmission routes, clinical signs, and prevention and control options. Therefore, regular awareness programs on rabies are necessary among school children in Bhutan.","Lungten, Lungten; Rinchen, Sangay; Tenzin, Tenzin; Phimpraphai, Waraphon; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel",Trop Med Infect Dis,342,16

Although gallbladder perforation and spilled gallstones during surgery are common complications, thoracic consequences are rare. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We describe a case of a pleural empyema developed in an immunosuppressed patient five months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, as a result of spilled gallstones. Decortication via video assisted thoracoscopy resulted in retrieval of stone remnants, biliary sludge and diagnosis of a diaphragmatic defect. DISCUSSION: Iatrogenic perforation of the gallbladder is the most common complication after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Despite this, thoracic consequences derived from spilled gallstones are rare, but they represent significant morbidity. CONCLUSION: Thoracic complications after spilled gallstones are rare. Documentation of iatrogenic perforation of the gallbladder and a high index of suspicious are fundamental to speed diagnosis and treatment.","Tchercansky, Ariel Nicolas; Fernandez Alberti, Joaquin; Panzardi, Nicolas; Auvieux, Rodolfo; Buero, Agustin",Int J Surg Case Rep,342,1

Some of our participants showed depressive and anxious attitudes even in the absence of real pictures of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon, combined with mechanisms of emulation and conditioning, can trigger a vicious cycle within interpersonal relationships and promote the administration of unnecessary treatments. Various approaches have been proposed to help populations suffering from psychosocial problems induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but there is an objective difficulty in treating a large population. METHODS: To contain and reduce this widespread psychosocial unease, in this study we used two radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments, neuro postural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimization–cervicobrachial (NPPO-CB), aimed at optimizing an individual’s response to the effects of environmental stressors. These treatments are quick and easy to administer; therefore, they can be administered to a large cohort of participants in a short time. To evaluate the effects of the REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments, the DASS-21 psychometric test was used because it has already been used to test depression, anxiety, and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The results of the study confirm the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments in helping participants to have better coping strategies for the environmental pressures and reduce the neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: The results obtained in this study are consistent with previous clinical studies confirming the usefulness of the treatments to face neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by exposome pressure.","Pinheiro Barcessat, Ana Rita; Nolli Bittencourt, Marina; Duarte Ferreira, Larissa; de Souza Neri, Erick; Coelho Pereira, José Alfredo; Bechelli, Fabio; Rinaldi, Arianna",Psychol Res Behav Manag,342,23

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, parallel arm, open-label, adaptive platform Phase 2/3 trial of potential disease modifying therapies in patients with late stage 1/stage 2 COVID-19-related disease, with a diagnosis based either on a positive assay or high suspicion of COVID-19 infection by clinical, laboratory and radiological assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 and over, with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of COVID-19-related disease (with/without a positive COVID-19 test) AND a risk count (as defined below) >3 OR ≥3 if risk count includes “Radiographic severity score >3”. A risk count is calculated by the following features on admission (1 point for each): radiographic severity score >3, male gender, non-white ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, neutrophils >8.0 x10(9)/L, age >40 years and CRP >40 mg/L. Patients should be considered an appropriate subject for intervention with immunomodulatory or other disease modifying agents in the opinion of the investigator and are able to swallow capsules or tablets. The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the Additional file 1 should be fulfilled. Drug specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will also be applied to the active arms. Patients will be enrolled prior to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, cardiac or renal support. Participants will be recruited across multiple centres in the UK including initially at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and St George’s University NHS Foundation Trust. Other centres will be approached internationally in view of the evolving pandemic. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: There is increasing evidence of the role of immunomodulation in altering the course of COVID-19. Additionally, various groups have demonstrated the presence of pulmonary shunting in patients with COVID-19 as well as other cardiovascular complications. TACTIC-E will assess the efficacy of the novel immunomodulatory agent EDP1815 versus the approved cardio-pulmonary drugs, Dapagliflozin in combination with Ambrisentan versus the prevailing standard of care. EDP1815 will be given as 2 capsules twice daily (1.6 x 10(11) cells) for up to 7 days with the option to extend up to 14 days at the discretion of the principal investigator or their delegate, if the patient is felt to be clinically responding to treatment, is tolerating treatment, and is judged to be likely to benefit from a longer treatment course. Ambrisentan 5mg and Dapagliflozin 10mg will be given in combination once daily orally for up to maximum of 14 days. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio across treatments. Each active arm will be compared with standard of care alone. Additional arms may be added as the trial progresses. No comparisons will be made between active arms in this platform trial. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the incidence (from baseline up to Day 14) to the occurrence of the any one of the following events: death, invasive mechanical ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomised using a central web-based randomisation service (Sealed Envelope) in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site to one of the treatment arms or standard of care. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. Data analysis will not be blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): There is no fixed sample size for this study. There will be an early biomarker-based futility analysis performed at a point during the study. If this biomarker futility analysis is not conclusive, then a second futility analysis based on clinical endpoints will be performed after approximately 125 patients have been recruited per arm. Provisionally, further analyses of clinical endpoints will be performed after 229 patients per active arm and later 469 patients per arm have been recruited. Further additional analyses may be triggered by the independent data monitoring committee. TRIAL STATUS: TACTIC-E Protocol version number 1.0 date May 27(th), 2020. Recruitment starts on the 3(rd) of July 2020. The end trial date will be 18 months after the last patient’s last visit and cannot be accurately predicted at this time.

We determined the minimal mechanism of helicase function by nsp13. We showed a clear unwinding lag with increasing length of the double-stranded region of the nucleic acid, suggesting the presence of intermediates in the unwinding process. To elucidate the nature of the intermediates we carried out transient kinetic analysis of the nsp13 helicase activity. We demonstrated that the enzyme unwinds nucleic acid in discrete steps of 9.3 base-pairs (bp) each, with a catalytic rate of 30 steps per second. Therefore the net unwinding rate is ∼280 base-pairs per second. We also showed that nsp12, the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), enhances (2-fold) the catalytic efficiency of nsp13 by increasing the step size of nucleic acid (RNA/RNA or DNA/DNA) unwinding. This effect is specific for SARS-CoV nsp12, as no change in nsp13 activity was observed when foot-and-mouth-disease virus RdRp was used in place of nsp12. Our data provide experimental evidence that nsp13 and nsp12 can function in a concerted manner to improve the efficiency of viral replication and enhance our understanding of nsp13 function during SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.","Adedeji, Adeyemi O.; Marchand, Bruno; te Velthuis, Aartjan J.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were treated during the months of March and April 2020 at our institution were included. All patients were symptomatic and the thrombotic event objectively confirmed. Patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial thrombosis (PAT) were included. Survival curves for all groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier with Log Rank test, and Cox regression. RESULTS: During the pandemic period from March-1 to April-30, 2943 patients were treated with confirmed COVID-19 in our center. 106 patients showed some symptomatic vascular thrombosis: 13 patients had PAT, 15 ischemic stroke, 20 DVT and 58 PE. 11 patients presented multiple vascular thrombosis. Although the mean age was 65 years, there were differences between groups being older those patients with arterial thrombosis. A 67.92% were men. In total, 25 patients died during their hospital admission (23.58%), with differences between groups, being more common in patients with PAT (9 patients out of 13) and ischemic stroke (8 patients out of 15), than in those with DVT (1 patient out of 20) or PE (7 patients out of 58). CONCLUSIONS: The venous thromboembolic risk in these patients is greater than the arterial, but arterial thrombosis when it occurs was associated with high mortality rates. Survival was better in patients with DVT and PE than in patients with ischemic stroke or PAT.","Gonzalez-Fajardo, José A.; Ansuategui, Marina; Romero, Carmen; Comanges, Alejandra; Gómez-Arbeláez, Diego; Ibarra, Gabriela; Garcia-Gutierrez, Ania",Med Clin (Engl Ed),342,3

The first strategy is the manufacturer recommended standard of two doses (two-dose strategy) given within 21 days apart versus a strategy of giving a larger group a single dose of vaccine (first-dose-for-most strategy) by delaying the second injection. Three parameters are varied in the course of 36 estimation scenarios of the population-level effects of the two vaccination strategies. The first is the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccine at preventing disease, the second is the effectiveness of the vaccine at preventing transmission of the virus, and the third is the rate of transmission of the virus during the course of the simulations. Over the course of the different scenarios, the first-dose-for-most strategy was superior in reducing disease transmission in all scenarios where vaccination is assumed to have an effect on viral transmission. The results for fatalities was mixed, with the first-dose-for-most strategy being superior in cases where a higher first-dose effectiveness at preventing disease was assumed. Finally, in the best-guess scenarios where a 75% reduction in disease transmission and a 92.6% effectiveness at preventing disease from a single dose were used, the first-dose-for-most strategy was superior in a situation with reduced vaccine doses available, and switching to the first-dose-for-most strategy earlier helped to prevent a higher proportion of cases and deaths.","Ruse, T.",,342,1

Despite many efforts, very little progress has been made regarding finding low-cost oral medicines that can be made widely available worldwide to address the global pandemic. Methods We sought to examine if a triple combination of nitazoxanide (using its active metabolite tizoxanide), ribavirin, and hydroxychloroquine would lead to a multiplicative effects on viral replication of SARS-COV-2 resulting in a significant reduction of virus yield using VERO E6 cells as a model of viral replication. Results Virus yield measured in PFU/ml was ~ 2 logs lower with triple combination versus either drug alone, resulting in the prolongation of time to peak cytopathic effects (CPE). The time to produce 50% CPE increased from 2.8 days for viral controls versus 5.3 days for triple combination therapy. Finally, for each 1-log reduction in virus yield 24 hours post-infection, there was an additional 0.7-day delay in onset of CPE. Conclusions A triple combination of tizoxanide, ribavirin, and hydroxychloroquine produced a reduction in SARS-COV-2 viral replication in Vero E6 cells, warranting exploration in additional cell lines as well as human clinical trials.","Lian, Elena; McAlister, Carley; Ramirez, Gabriela; Chernoff, David N.; Went, Gregory; Hoopes, Justin; Perera, Rushika",bioRxiv,342,16

Spain is among the most affected countries. Our aim is to describe the cases of COVID-19 at Infanta Sofía University Hospital (Madrid), a public secondary hospital that increased its hospital beds to provide assistance during the outbreak. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study of cases that met COVID-19 clinical diagnosis criteria or had a positive PCR test from February 27 to June 29, 2020. A description of demographic variables, hospital stay, mortality and the epidemiological curve was performed. RESULTS: Of 1,828 confirmed cases, 64.4% were hospitalised, 5.6% were admitted to the ICU. About 52.2% were male. The median age was 63.2 years. About 13.1% were nursing home residents. Nineteen percent were of Latin American origin of which 6.8% were admitted to the ICU. Overall case fatality was 14.6%. We observed a biphasic epidemiological curve. CONCLUSIONS: Sixty to 79-year-old males were admitted and deceased more often than women. Mortality reached 14.7%. Latin Americans were admitted more often to the ICU.

A checklist for the clinicians,19.163115,7.15471,2020-05-25,"PURPOSE: SARS-CoV-2’s new scenario has forced health systems to work under extreme stress urging to perform a complete reorganization of the way our means and activities were organized. The orthopaedic and trauma units have rescheduled their activities to help SARS-CoV-2 units, but trauma patients require also treatment, and no standardized protocols have been established. METHODS: A single-centre cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary hospital. Two different periods of time were analyzed: a two week period of time in March 2019 (pre-SARS-CoV-2) and the same period in March 2020 (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic time). Outpatient’s data, emergency activity, surgical procedures, and admissions were evaluated. Surgeons’ and patient’s opinion was also evaluated using a survey. RESULTS: A total of ~ 16k (15,953) patients were evaluated. Scheduled clinical appointments decreased by ~ 22%. Urgent consultations and discharge from clinics also descended (~ 37% and ~ 20% respectively). Telemedicine was used in 90% of outpatient clinical evaluations. No elective surgical procedures during SARS-CoV-2 time were scheduled, and subtracting the effect of elective surgeries, there was a reduction of inpatient surgeries, from ~ 85% to ~ 59%. Patients delayed trauma assistance more than 48 hours in 13 cases (35%). Pre-operative admission for hip fractures decreased in ten hours on average. Finally, surveys stated that patients were more in favour than surgeons were to this new way to evaluate orthopaedic and trauma patients based strongly on telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Detailed protocols should be standardized for surgical departments during the pandemic. This paper offers a general view in how this virus affects an orthopaedic unit and could serve as a protocol and example for orthopaedic and trauma units. Even in the worst scenario, an orthopaedic and trauma unit could offer an effective, efficient, and quality service. SARS-CoV-2 will set up a new paradigm for health care in orthopaedics and trauma.","Luengo-Alonso, Gonzalo; Pérez-Tabernero, Fernando García-Seisdedos; Tovar-Bazaga, Miguel; Arguello-Cuenca, José Manuel; Calvo, Emilio",Int Orthop,342,16

Mutations in Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB) are present in the vast majority of CS patients and in other DNA repair-related pathologies. In the literature, the role of CSB in different DNA repair pathways has been highlighted, however, new CSB functions have been identified in DNA transcription, mitochondrial biology, telomere maintenance and p53 regulation. Herein, we present an overview of identified structural elements and processes that impact on CSB activity and its post-translational modifications, known to balance the different roles of the protein not only during normal conditions but most importantly in stress situations. Moreover, since CSB has been found to be overexpressed in a number of different tumors, its role in cancer is presented and possible therapeutic targeting is discussed.","Spyropoulou, Zoi; Papaspyropoulos, Angelos; Lagopati, Nefeli; Myrianthopoulos, Vassilios; Georgakilas, Alexandros G.; Fousteri, Maria; Kotsinas, Athanassios; Gorgoulis, Vassilis G.",Cells,342,1

Areas of clinical competencies included professional decision-making (33%), the role of cognition and emotion (21%), attending to culture and diversity (21%), and others, such as supervision skills (8%). Using qualitative (46%), quantitative (42%), and mixed methods (13%) in research design, more than half of the SBR studies reported in the selected articles used live actors (54%) to simulate a realistic practice situation for research. Selected articles also offered both benefits and limitations of SBR in social work. We offer suggestions for when to use SBR for research on clinical social work practice and strengthening a collaboration between clinicians and researchers in advancing practice-informed research.","Asakura, Kenta; Gheorghe, Ruxandra M.; Borgen, Stephanie; Sewell, Karen; MacDonald, Heather",Clin Soc Work J,342,1

These policies explicitly encouraged homeworking, hence reducing the number of commuters with the implicit assumption that restricting peoples’ movement reduces risk of infection for travellers and other people in their areas of residence and work. Yet, the spatial interrelation of different areas has been rarely addressed both in the public discourse and in early accounts of the various consequences of COVID-19. METHODS: Our study proposes a spatial analysis of the association between commuting flows and COVID-19 mortality in England between March and June 2020, using a range of publicly available area-level data. To account for spatial correlation, we used a structural mobility gravity model to analyse commuting flows between Local Authority Districts. By accounting for these spatial dependencies, we temper concerns of bias and inefficiency affecting simple linear estimates. Additionally, we disentangle the direct and indirect (from other areas) influence of commuting on COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: The results of our spatial regression models suggest that higher commuting flows – in general and particularly by public transport - are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality. Our results are consistent with a reduction in COVID-related mortality after the introduction of a national lockdown in March. The spatial-lag term is statistically significant, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial dependencies. CONCLUSION: We suggest that considering spatial interactions through commuting or travel motivations may offer interesting perspectives on the trade-off between health and economic activity during lockdowns.","Francetic, Igor; Munford, Luke",Eur J Public Health,342,33

Among ncRNAs, long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as longer than 200 nucleotides and have been shown to be involved in several physiological and pathological events, including immune system regulation and cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined as a population of cancer cells that possess characteristics, such as resistance to standard treatments, cancer initiation, ability to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and the ability to invade, spread, and generate metastases. The cancer microenvironment, together with genetic and epigenetic factors, is fundamental for CSC maintenance and tumor growth and progression. Unsurprisingly, lncRNAs have been involved in both CSC biology and cancer progression, prognosis and recurrence.

Despite editorials evaluating neurosurgery COVID-19 responses, data reporting COVID-19’s effects on case volume, census, and resident illness are lacking. Objective To present areal-world analysis of neurosurgical volumes, resident deployment, and unique challenges encountered during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak peak in New York City. Methods Daily census and case volume data were prospectively collected throughout the Spring 2020SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Neurosurgical census was compared against COVID-19 system-wide data. Neurosurgical cases during the crisis were analyzed and compared to seven-week periods from 2019 and 2020. Resident deployment and illness were reviewed. Results From March 16-May 5, 2020, residents participated in 72 operations and 69 endovascular procedures. This compares to 448 operations and 253 endovascular procedures in January-February 2020 and 530 operations and 340 endovascular procedures over March-May 2019. There was a 59% reduction in neurosurgical census during the outbreak (median 24 patients, 2.75 average total cases daily). COVID-19 neurosurgical admissions peaked in concert with the system-wide pandemic. Three residents demonstrated COVID-19 symptomatology (no hospitalizations occurred) for a total 24 workdays lost (median 7 days). Conclusion These data provide real-world guidance on neurosurgical infrastructure needs during a COVID-19 outbreak. While re-deployment to support the COVID-19 response was required, there remained a significant need to continue to provide critical neurosurgical service.","Rothrock, Robert J.; Maragkos, Georgios A.; Schupper, Alexander J.; McNeill, Ian T.; Oermann, Eric K.; Yaeger, Kurt A.; Gilligan, Jeffrey; Bederson, Joshua B.; Mocco, J.

It is important to understand youth attitudes toward and experience of virtual services. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the attitudes toward and experiences of virtual mental health and substance use services among youth drawn from clinical and non-clinical samples. METHOD: Four hundred nine youth completed a survey including questions about their attitudes toward and experience of virtual services. The survey included quantitative and open-ended questions on virtual care, as well as a mental health and substance use screener. RESULTS: The majority of youth with mental health or substance use challenges would be willing to consider individual virtual services, but fewer would consider group virtual services. However, many have not received virtual services. Youth are interested in accessing a wide variety of virtual services and other supportive wellness services. Advantages and disadvantages of virtual services are discussed, including accessibility benefits and technological barriers. DISCUSSION: As youth mental health and substance use services have rapidly gone virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that we hear the perspectives of youth to promote service utilization among those in need. Diverse, accessible, technologically stable virtual services are required to meet the needs of different youth, possibly with in-person options for some youth. Future research, engaging youth in the research process, is needed to evaluate the efficacy of virtual services to plan for the sustainability of some virtual service gains beyond the pandemic period.","Hawke, Lisa D.; Sheikhan, Natasha Y.; MacCon, Karen; Henderson, Joanna",BMC Health Serv Res,342,16

Considered as a marker for traffic-related air pollution in cities, we conducted a city-wide measurement of NO(x) levels in the Accra Metropolis and examined their spatiotemporal patterns in relation to land use and meteorological factors. Between April 2019 to June 2020, we collected weekly integrated NO(x) (n=428) and NO(2) (n=472) samples at 10 fixed (year-long) and 124 rotating (week-long) sites. Data from the same time of year were compared to a previous study (2006) to assess changes in NO(2) concentrations. NO and NO(2) concentrations were highest in commercial/business/industrial (66 and 76 μg/m(3), respectively) and high-density residential areas (47 and 59 μg/m(3), respectively), compared with peri-urban locations. We observed annual means of 68 and 70 μg/m(3) for NO and NO(2), and a clear seasonal variation, with the mean NO(2) of 63 μg/m(3) (non-Harmattan) increased by 25-56% to 87 μg/m(3) (Harmattan) across different site types. The NO(2)/NO(x) ratio was also elevated by 19-28%. Both NO and NO(2) levels were associated with indicators of road traffic emissions (e.g. distance to major roads), but not with community biomass use (e.g. wood and charcoal). We found strong correlations between both NO(2) and NO(2)/NO(x) and mixing layer depth, incident solar radiation and water vapor mixing ratio. These findings represent an increase of 25 – 180% when compared to a small study conducted in two high-density residential neighborhoods in Accra in 2006. Road traffic may be replacing community biomass use (major source of fine particulate matter) as the prominent source of air pollution in Accra, with policy implication for growing cities in SSA.","Wang, Jiayuan; Alli, Abosede Sarah; Clark, Sierra; Hughes, Allison; Ezzati, Majid; Beddows, Andrew; Vallarino, Jose; Nimo, James; Bedford-Moses, Josephine; Baah, Solomon; Owusu, George; Agyemang, Ernest; Kelly, Frank; Barratt, Benjamin; Beevers, Sean; Agyei-Mensah, Samuel; Baumgartner, Jill; Brauer, Michael; Arku, Raphael E",Sci Total Environ,342,26

We sought to review the impact of COVID-19 on the neurosurgical services in Africa. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to African neurosurgeons seeking to review demographics, national and neurosurgical preparedness, and change in clinical services in April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 316 responses from 42 countries were received. Of these, 81.6% of respondents were male and 79.11% were under the age of 45 years. In our sample, 123 (38.92%) respondents were in training. Most (94.3%) respondents stated they had COVID-19 cases reported in their country as of April 2020. Only 31 (41.50%) had received training on managing COVID-19. A total of 173 (54.70%) respondents were not performing elective surgery. There was a deficit in the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE): surgical masks (90.80%), gloves (84.80%), N95 masks (50.80%), and shoe covers (49.10%). Health ministry (80.40%), World Health Organization (74.50%), and journal papers (41.40%) were the most common sources of information on COVID-19. A total of 43.60% had a neurosurgeon in the COVID-19 preparedness team; 59.8% were concerned they may contract COVID-19 at work with a further 25.90% worried they may infect their family. Mental stress as a result of COVID-19 was reported by 14.20% of respondents. As of April 2020, 73.40% had no change in their income. CONCLUSIONS: Most African countries have a national COVID-19 policy response plan that is not always fully suited to the local neurosurgery services. There is an ongoing need for PPE and training for COVID-19 preparedness. There has been a reduction in clinical activities both in clinic and surgeries undertaken.","Mahmud, Muhammad Raji; Cheserem, Beverly; Esene, Ignatius N.; Kalangu, Kazadi; Sanoussi, Samuila; Musara, Aaron; El-Ghandour, Nasser M.F.; Fieggen, Graham; Qureshi, Mahmood",World Neurosurg,342,5

The present work aims to study the molecular -docking and dynamic of three pertinent medicinal plants i.e. Eurycoma harmandiana, Sophora flavescens and Andrographis paniculata phyto-compounds against SARS-COV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) and main protease (Mpro)/3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). The interaction of protein targets and ligands was performed through AutoDock-Vina visualized using PyMOL and BIOVIA-Discovery Studio 2020. Molecular docking with canthin-6-one 9-O-beta-glucopyranoside showed highest binding affinity and less binding energy with both PLpro and Mpro/3CLpro proteases and was subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for a period of 100ns. Stability of the protein-ligand complexes was evaluated by different analyses. The binding free energy calculated using MM-PBSA and the results showed that the molecule must have stable interactions with the protein binding site. ADMET analysis of the compounds suggested that it is having drug-like properties like high gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, no blood-brain barrier permeability and high lipophilicity. The outcome revealed that canthin-6-one 9-O-beta-glucopyranoside can be used as a potential natural drug against COVID-19 protease.","Verma, Devvret; Mitra, Debasis; Paul, Manish; Chaudhary, Priya; Kamboj, Anshul; Thatoi, Hrudayanath; Janmeda, Pracheta; Jain, Divya; Panneerselvam, P.; Shrivastav, Rakesh; Pant, Kumud; Das Mohapatra, Pradeep K.",,342,30

One of the explanations might be the individual HLA allelic variants. Indeed, B cell response is stimulated and sustained by CD4(+) T helper cells activated by antigens presented by HLA-class II alleles on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The impact of the number of antigens binding to HLA class-II alleles on the antibody response to the COVID vaccine has been assessed in a cohort of 56 healthcare workers who received the full schedule of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. Such vaccine is based on the entire spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. Ab titers have been evaluated 2 weeks after the first dose as well as 2 weeks and 4 months after the boosting dose. HLA-DRB1 and DBQ1 for each of the vaccinees have been assessed, and strong binders have been predicted. The analysis showed no significant correlation between the short-medium-term Ab titers and the number of strong binders (SB) for each individual. These results indicate that levels of Ab response to the spike glycoprotein is not dependent on HLA class II allele, suggesting an equivalent efficacy at global level of the currently used vaccines. Furthermore, the pattern of persistence in Ab titer does not correlate with specific alleles or with the number of SBs.","Ragone, Concetta; Meola, Serena; Fiorillo, Pasqualina C.; Penta, Roberta; Auriemma, Laura; Tornesello, Maria Lina; Miscio, Leonardo; Cavalcanti, Ernesta; Botti, Gerardo; Buonaguro, Franco M.; Bianchi, Attilio; Buonaguro, Luigi; Tagliamonte, Maria",Front Immunol,342,26

The first research was conducted in 2018 into the users´ satisfaction with the course which was taught using traditional methods, and the second research was conducted in 2019 into the users´ satisfaction with the new online course. The idea of the creator of the online course was to keep the contents and the scope of the subject as much similar as possible to create two groups of users, i.e. the first, using the traditional approaches, and the second with the modern technology-enabled class. With this intention, the Blackboard class was created, and the users were taught by using blended learning methodology. The research focused merely on personal satisfaction with the course within the intention of positive psychology, i.e. focusing on potential issues regarding personal satisfaction. It did not focus on the differences in the performance of the students as there is a lot of research into this aspect. However, it focused on the individual satisfaction and personal feelings of the users while using blended learning platforms in the context of ubiquitous computing. The findings are that the users expressed their satisfaction regarding easily accessible materials and varied learning environment; however, the dissatisfaction was created by increased screen time and reduces social contacts. The findings are very important for educators who use various mobile platforms and eLearning environments as they should be aware of the reservations of the users of these tools.","Pikhart, Marcel",Procedia Computer Science,342,5

The chapter describes the distribution of fatty acid acylated proteins, distribution of fatty acid acylated proteins, analysis of the fatty acid, and site and mechanism of fatty acid acylation. Many of the data pertaining to fatty acid acylation of eukaryotic cell membrane proteins come from studies with those glycoproteins that form the external spikes on enveloped RNA animal viruses. The procedures for detecting and identifying protein-bound fatty acids rely primarily on incorporating high specific radioactive labeled fatty acids into growing tissue culture cells and analyzing proteins from these cells by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. The function of fatty acid in membrane proteins is unknown, and it is believed that fatty acid acylation might be important for proper intracellular transport of proteins destined to be localized to the plasma membrane.","Schlesinger, Milton J.",Methods in Enzymology,342,16

Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of CRS. We describe the efficacy and safety of TCZ in SARS CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from April 20 2020 to May 21 2020. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of a composite of either need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Safety outcomes included an increase in liver transaminases and/or evidence of infection. Results: A total of 20 patients received TCZ during the study period. The median age was 54 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 47–63). About 85% of the patients were male. Nearly 70% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. About 55% required ICU admission. The median duration of ICU stay was 11 days (95% CI: 3–13 days). The cumulative incidence of the requirement for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvement and mortality was 11% (95% CI: 0.03%–1%), 74% (95% CI 37%–89%) and 25% (95% CI: 11%–63%), respectively. There was no difference in outcomes according to age, gender or computed tomography severity score. Asymptomatic transaminitis was the most common drug reaction (55%), and one patient developed bacteraemia. Conclusions: TCZ is likely a safe and effective modality of treatment for improving clinical and laboratory parameters of SARS CoV-2 patients with a reduction in ICU stay and ventilatory care need.","Patel, Atul; Shah, Kinjal; Dharsandiya, Mitkumar; Patel, Ketan; Patel, Tushar; Patel, Mukesh; Reljic, Tea; Kumar, Ambuj",Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology,342,26

RESULTS: We found each 1 unit increase in daily MSI was significantly positively associated with daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in all lag days and the strongest estimated RR (1.21, 95% CIs:1.14 ~ 1.28) was observed at lag 014. In PM analysis, we found each 10 μg/m(3) increase in the concentration of PM(10) and PM(2.5) was positively associated with the confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the estimated strongest RRs (both at lag 7) were 1.05 (95% CIs: 1.04, 1.07) and 1.06 (95% CIs: 1.04, 1.07), respectively. A similar trend was also found in all cumulative lag periods (from lag 01 to lag 014). The strongest effects for both PM(10) and PM(2.5) were at lag 014, and the RRs of each 10 μg/m(3) increase were 1.18 (95% CIs:1.14, 1.22) and 1.23 (95% CIs:1.18, 1.29), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Population mobility and airborne particulate matter may be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Wang, Bo; Liu, Jiangtao; Li, Yanlin; Fu, Shihua; Xu, Xiaocheng; Li, Lanyu; Zhou, Ji; Liu, Xingrong; He, Xiaotao; Yan, Jun; Shi, Yanjun; Niu, Jingping; Yang, Yong; Li, Yiyao; Luo, Bin; Zhang, Kai",BMC Public Health,342,1

Here, we characterize and compare in an ambidirectional cohort study SARS-CoV-2 serology among Norwegian school employees and retail employees at baseline following the first epidemiological wave, and at follow-up after a second wave. Methods: We enrolled a cohort of 238 school and retail employees after the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Self-reported exposure history and serum samples were collected at 10 schools and 15 retail stores in Oslo, Norway, sampled at two time-points, baseline (May 18. to July 2. 2020) and follow-up (Jan 7. to Mar 17. 2021). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting both spike and nucleocapsid were characterized by multiplex microsphere-based serological methods. Results: At baseline, 6 enrolled workers presented with positive SARS-CoV-2 serology (3%; CI [1, 6]; P=0.019), which was significantly higher than the expected 1% prevalence in the general Oslo-population at this time-point. Five of the positive cases were retail employees. However, school and retail groups distributions at baseline were not significantly different as the number of seropositive observations were limited. Due to a school closure effectuated during the first wave, half of the school employees reported [≤]2 days of physical workplace presence per week, while 65% of the retail employees reported [≥]5 days per week. Eight months later, after passing a second epidemiological wave, school and retail groups presented 11 new seropositive cases altogether, but there was still no significant differences between the groups. Physical attendance at the workplace was similar between the groups during the second wave, but some preventive measures against viral transmission at workplaces were different. Self-reported virus diagnostics (RNA) for the same period were compared to the serological data obtained in this study, showing that all but one positive SARS-CoV-2 serological findings arising between baseline and follow-up had been diagnosed with virus testing. Conclusions: After the first wave, distribution of SARS-CoV-2 positive serology was slightly higher than expected in a cohort of school and retail employees. Distribution of infection was not significantly different between the groups at baseline nor at follow-up, even though physical workplace attendance had been different. Nearly all new seropositive cases discovered in this study between baseline and follow-up, had already been diagnosed due to widespread virus testing during the second wave. This highlights the importance of extensive viral testing among workers.","Moe, A.-M. G.; Eriksen, M.; Schjolberg, T.; Haugen, F.",,342,19

One mechanism that may help offset the negative outcomes of work-related stress on employees’ well-being is recovery. Recovery refers to the experience of unwinding from one's job when not at work. However, employees who experience high levels of work-related stress and are thus particularly in need of recovery tend to struggle to switch-off. Due to the detrimental effects of this prolonged and sustained mental representation of job stressors, interventions promoting recovery may contribute to improvements in employees' mental health. METHODS: In this randomized, waitlist controlled trial, we will investigate the effectiveness of two 6-week online training programs (cognitive behavioral and mindfulness-based). The sample will include employees working at least part-time during regular work hours. Besides the pre-post-follow-up assessments, the trial will include measurement bursts with the goal of examining the underlying mechanisms. We expect that both interventions will reduce work-related perseverative thinking (PT) compared with the waitlist control groups (primary outcome). Also, we expect that both interventions will result in similar improvements, but the underlying mechanisms will differ (process outcomes). In the cognitive-behavioral intervention group, we expect that the main mechanism responsible for lower PT levels will be an increase in recovery experiences across time. In the mindfulness-based group, we expect that the main mechanism responsible for lower PT levels will be an increase in facets of mindfulness across time. DISCUSSION: In the present study, we will investigate mechanisms underlying assumed changes in work-related PT in great detail. Besides evaluating the overall effectiveness of the two interventions in terms of pre-post-follow-up changes, we will look at the underlying processes at different levels—that is, within days, within weeks, across weeks, and between individuals. Accordingly, our study will offer a fine-grained approach to investigating potential determinants, mediators, and moderators of the processes that may, in the end, be responsible for work-related strain. From a public health perspective, if effective, the online training programs may offer valuable, low-threshold, and low-intensity interventions for a broad range of occupations.

As consequence, a major effort worldwide has been performed for the development of viral diagnostics strategies aiming at (i) reducing the diagnostics time, (ii) decrease the costs per assay, and (iii) providing population-scale solutions. Beyond the diagnostics requirements, the description of the B.1.1.7 strain, originated in the south of England, as a highly transmissible variant has strongly accelerated the worldwide interest in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants occurrence. Since then, other extremely infectious variants were described and unsurprisingly further others are expected to be discovered, notably due to the long period of time on which the pandemic situation is lasting. Interestingly, all currently described SARS-CoV-2 variants present systematically several mutations within the gene encoding the Spike protein, involved in host receptor recognition and entry into the cell. Hence, instead of sequencing the whole viral genome for variants tracking, our proposed strategy focuses on the SPIKE region, as a way to increase the number of candidate samples to screen at once; an essential aspect to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, but also improve variants emergence and progression surveillance. Herein we present a proof of concept study, for performing both at once, population-scale SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and variants tracking. This strategy relies on (i) the use of the portable and affordable MinION DNA sequencer; (ii) a DNA barcoding strategy and a SPIKE gene-centered variants tracking, for largely increasing the number of candidates per assay; and (iii) a real-time diagnostics and variants tracking monitoring thanks to our software RETIVAD. As a whole, this strategy represents an optimal solution for addressing the current needs on SARS-CoV-2 progression surveillance, notably due to its affordable implementation, allowing its implantation even in remote places over the world.","Studer, F.; Petit, J.-L.; Engelen, S.; Mendoza-Parra, M.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become an urgent public health issue of global concern. It is speculated that the virus first emerged through a zoonotic spillover. Basic research studies have suggested that bats are likely the ancestral reservoir host. Nonetheless, the evolutionary history and host susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear as a multitude of animals has been proposed as potential intermediate or dead-end hosts. SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from domestic animals, both companion and livestock, as well as in captive wildlife that were in close contact with human COVID-19 cases. Currently, domestic mink is the only known animal that is susceptible to a natural infection, develop severe illness, and can also transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other minks and humans. To improve foundational knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, we are conducting a synthesis review of its host diversity and transmission pathways. To mitigate this COVID-19 pandemic, we strongly advocate for a systems-oriented scientific approach that comprehensively evaluates the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at the human and animal interface.","Hedman, Hayden D.; Krawczyk, Eric; Helmy, Yosra A.; Zhang, Lixin; Varga, Csaba",Pathogens,342,1

CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit on two separate occasions for attempting suicide by overdosing on paliperidone and mirtazapine. During both admissions, the patient had atypical chest pain and a first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) with paradoxical sinus tachycardia, which resolved with the discontinuation of paliperidone and mirtazapine and aggressive intravenous fluids. CONCLUSION: Drug-induced first-degree AVB from paliperidone and mirtazapine should be on the differential diagnosis in patients on paliperidone and/or mirtazapine who present with chest pain, tachycardia or new-onset first-degree AVB. LEARNING POINTS: Paliperidone and mirtazapine are associated with first-degree heart block, which may be a harbinger of torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. Paliperidone and mirtazapine may potentiate each other’s proarrhythmic effects since the metabolism of both involve the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme. A history of psychiatric illness makes it difficult to rule out atypical chest pain without ECG or troponins and often leads to increased resource utilization, even during times of heavy use like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheung, Brian; Levy, Chris; Shivkumar, Abhijit",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,342,26

The cognitive and motivational approaches to attitude theory in wildlife management guided, under the phenomenology method, the collection of qualitative data on the importance of the seasonal closure of hunting and its implementation challenges. This inquiry was deemed crucial to improving the disjointed relationship between park management and local communities that often make wildlife conservation and tourism difficult at the Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary. Forty-five key wildlife stakeholders, including park officers, traditional authorities, elderly residents, and bushmeat traders, were purposively selected with some interviewed personally and others engaged in focus group discussions. Despite a more significant number of stakeholders admitting the importance of the seasonal closure of hunting, some challenges impeded its implementation. These included the absence of alternative arrangements to support hunters during the period for the annual closure of hunting; lack of proper sensitisation and education on the hunting ban; absence of transparency in the equitable sharing of proceeds from wildlife tourism at the Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary among park officers (Government) and the traditional authorities; the booming bushmeat business and the fear of losing customers after the fallow period; and purported corruption on the part of park officers, threatening the observation of the seasonal closure of hunting. The study has offered proactive suggestions to the Wildlife Division of the Forestry Commission and mainly to park management at the Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary on how to address these challenges and improve wildlife management and sustainable wildlife tourism potentials in Ghana. Paramount among them is the tactful provision of alternative sources of livelihood and the establishment of enterprises in non-timber forest products as sources of income for hunters during the seasonal hunting ban.","Adom, Dickson; Boamah, Daniel Asante",Glob Ecol Conserv,342,16

METHODS: Urologists worldwide completed a Société Internationale d’Urologie online survey from 16 April 2020 until 1 May 2020. Analysis was carried out to evaluate their knowledge about protecting themselves and others in the workplace, including their confidence in their ability to remain safe at work, and any regional differences. RESULTS: There were 3488 respondents from 109 countries. Urologists who stated they were moderately comfortable that their work environment offers good protection against coronavirus disease 2019 showed a total mean satisfaction level of 5.99 (on a “0 = not at all” to “10 = very” scale). A large majority (86.33%) were confident about protecting themselves from coronavirus disease 2019 at work. However, only about one‐third reported their institution provided the required personal protective equipment (35.78%), and nearly half indicated their hospital has or had limited personal protective equipment availability (48.08%). Worldwide, a large majority of respondents answered affirmatively for testing the healthcare team (83.09%).

Current concepts suggest that blepharospasm is a network disorder, involving basal ganglia, thalamus, cortex, and, possibly, the cerebellum. Tracing, imaging, and clinical studies revealed that these structures are also concerned with olfaction and taste. Because of this anatomical overlap, dysfunction of the chemical senses in blepharospasm is expected. Injections of botulinum toxin into the eyelid muscles are the first-line treatment of blepharospasm. Yet, the effects of botulinum toxin on the chemical senses have not been systematically assessed. To contribute to a better understanding of blepharospasm, olfactory and gustatory abilities were assessed in 17 subjects with blepharospasm and 17 age-/sex-matched healthy controls. Sniffin Sticks were used to assess odor threshold, odor discrimination, and odor identification. Results of these three Sniffin Sticks subtests were added to the composite olfactory score. The Taste Strips were applied to assess taste. In an adjacent study, we assessed the sense of smell and taste in eight subjects with blepharospasm before and 4 weeks after botulinum toxin treatment. Subjects with blepharospasm had significantly lower (= worse) scores for odor threshold and for the composite olfactory score than healthy controls, while odor discrimination, odor identification, and the composite taste score were not different between groups. The adjacent study revealed that botulinum toxin did not impact the chemical senses. In this study, subjects with blepharospasm had a lower (= worse) odor threshold than healthy controls.

There is a lot of information about the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on the internet where people can create and share information quickly. This can lead to an infodemic, which is a challenge every government might face in the fight against pandemics. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand public attention toward the pandemic (from December 2019 to November 2020) through 7 types of sources: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, blogs, news sites, forums, and e-commerce sites. METHODS: We collected and analyzed nearly 38 million pieces of text data from the aforementioned sources via SocialHeat, a social listening (infoveillance) platform developed by YouNet Group. We described not only public attention volume trends, discussion sentiments, top sources, top posts that gained the most public attention, and hot keyword frequency but also hot keywords’ co-occurrence as visualized by the VOSviewer software tool. RESULTS: In this study, we reached four main conclusions. First, based on changing discussion trends regarding the COVID-19 subject, 7 periods were identified based on events that can be aggregated into two pandemic waves in Vietnam. Second, community pages on Facebook were the source of the most engagement from the public. However, the sources with the highest average interaction efficiency per article were government sources. Third, people’s attitudes when discussing the pandemic have changed from negative to positive emotions. Fourth, the type of content that attracts the most interactions from people varies from time to time. Besides that, the issue-attention cycle theory occurred not only once but four times during the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that online resources can help the government quickly identify public attention to public health messages during times of crisis. We also determined the hot spots that most interested the public and public attention communication patterns, which can help the government get practical information to make more effective policy reactions to help prevent the spread of the pandemic.","Tran, Huyen Thi Thanh; Lu, Shih-Hao; Tran, Ha Thi Thu; Nguyen, Bien Van",JMIR Med Inform,342,1

To refine our understanding of how human social behaviour may change over time, we conducted a longitudinal study of Hong Kong residents. We recorded the social contact patterns for 1450 individuals, up to four times each between May 2012 and September 2013. We found individuals made contact with an average of 12.5 people within 2.9 geographical locations, and spent an average estimated total duration of 9.1 h in contact with others during a day. Distributions of the number of contacts and locations in which contacts were made were not significantly different between study waves. Encounters were assortative by age, and the age mixing pattern was broadly consistent across study waves. Fitting regression models, we examined the association of contact rates (number of contacts, total duration of contact, number of locations) with covariates and calculated the inter- and intra-participant variation in contact rates. Participant age was significantly associated with the number of contacts made, the total duration of contact and the number of locations in which contact occurred, with children and parental-age adults having the highest rates of contact. The number of contacts and contact duration increased with the number of contact locations. Intra-individual variation in contact rate was consistently greater than inter-individual variation. Despite substantial individual-level variation, remarkable consistency was observed in contact mixing at the population scale. This suggests that aggregate measures of mixing behaviour derived from cross-sectional information may be appropriate for population-scale modelling purposes, and that if more detailed models of social interactions are required for improved public health modelling, further studies are needed to understand the social processes driving intra-individual variation.","Kwok, Kin On; Cowling, Ben; Wei, Vivian; Riley, Steven; Read, Jonathan M.",J R Soc Interface,342,29

Data were collected between 14 February and 19 July 2020 from online data repositories. The linear trend and magnitude of change were evaluated using the itsa function with ordinary least-squares regression in Stata with a 7-d deferred interruption point, which allows a period of diffusion post-border closure. RESULTS: Overall, the countries recorded an increase in the incidence rate of COVID-19 after border closure. However, when compared with matched control groups, SA, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and Kenya showed a higher incidence rate trend. In contrast, Ethiopia, DRC and Tunisia showed a lower trend compared with their controls. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of border closures within African countries had minimal effect on the incidence of COVID-19. The inclusion of other control measures such as enhanced testing capacity and improved surveillance activities will reveal the effectiveness of border closure measures.","Emeto, Theophilus I; Alele, Faith O; Ilesanmi, Olayinka S",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,342,1

Financial strain, personal debt, recent job loss and housing insecurity are important risk factors for the mental health of working-age adults. Community interventions have the potential to attenuate the mental health impact of these stressors. We examined the effectiveness of community interventions for protecting and promoting the mental health of working-age adults in high-income countries during periods of financial insecurity. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were systematically screened for experimental and observational studies published since 2000 measuring the effectiveness of community interventions on mental health outcomes. We included any non-clinical intervention that aimed to address the financial, employment, food or housing insecurity of participants. A review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42019156364) and results are reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: From 2326 studies screened, 15 met our inclusion criteria. Five categories of community intervention were identified: advice services colocated in healthcare settings; link worker social prescribing; telephone debt advice; food insecurity interventions; and active labour market programmes. In general, the evidence for effective and cost-effective community interventions delivered to individuals experiencing financial insecurity was lacking. From the small number of studies without a high risk of bias, there was some evidence that financial insecurity and associated mental health problems were amenable to change and differences by subpopulations were observed. CONCLUSION: There is a need for well-controlled studies and trials to better understand effective ingredients and to identify those interventions warranting wider implementation.","McGrath, Michael; Duncan, Fiona; Dotsikas, Kate; Baskin, Cleo; Crosby, Liam; Gnani, Shamini; Hunter, Rachael Maree; Kaner, Eileen; Kirkbride, James Bowes; Lafortune, Louise; Lee, Caroline; Oliver, Emily; Osborn, David P; Walters, Kate R; Dykxhoorn, Jennifer",J Epidemiol Community Health,342,32

In order to eliminate infectious diseases, individuals need to consider social welfare beyond mere self-interest—regardless of ethnic, religious, or national group borders. It has therefore been proposed that vaccination poses a social contract in which individuals are morally obliged to get vaccinated. However, little is known about whether individuals indeed act upon this social contract. If so, vaccinated individuals should reciprocate by being more generous to a vaccinated other. On the contrary, if the other doesn’t vaccinate and violates the social contract, generosity should decline. Three preregistered experiments investigated how a person’s own vaccination behavior, others’ vaccination behavior, and others’ group membership influenced a person’s generosity toward respective others. The experiments consistently showed that especially compliant (i.e., vaccinated) individuals showed less generosity toward nonvaccinated individuals. This effect was independent of the others’ group membership, suggesting an unconditional moral principle. An internal metaanalysis (n = 1,032) confirmed the overall social contract effect. In a fourth experiment (n = 1,212), this pattern was especially pronounced among vaccinated individuals who perceived vaccination as a moral obligation. It is concluded that vaccination is a social contract in which cooperation is the morally right choice. Individuals act upon the social contract, and more so the stronger they perceive it as a moral obligation. Emphasizing the social contract could be a promising intervention to increase vaccine uptake, prevent free riding, and, eventually, support the elimination of infectious diseases.","Korn, Lars; Böhm, Robert; Meier, Nicolas W.; Betsch, Cornelia",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,342,5

Analysis of macroscopic, histopathological findings with clinical features was performed. All 3 deceased patients were Caucasian males (average age 61 years, range from 56 to 68 years). Using real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, the patients were confirmed (antemortem) to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Two patients were obese, and 1 patient had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The medical history of 1 patient included hemorrhagic pancreatitis, gangrenous cholecystitis, Acinetobacter baumanii sepsis, and cholecystectomy. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 2 patients. At autopsy, in 1 case, the lungs showed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), while in another case, interstitial pulmonary lymphoid infiltrates and enlarged atypical pneumocytes were present but without DAD. Microthrombi in lung vessels and capillaries were observed in 2 cases. This study revealed thrombotic complications of COVID-19 and interstitial pneumonia with DAD presence as the main autopsy findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that was confirmed antemortem with molecular tests.

This study aimed to assess the influence of a novel enhanced stress-resilience training (ESRT) course delivered at the start of core surgical training in a single UK statutory education body. METHOD: All newly appointed core surgical trainees (CSTs) were invited to participate in a 5-week ESRT course teaching mindfulness-based exercises to develop tools to deal with stress at work and burnout. The primary aim was to assess the feasibility of this course; secondary outcomes were to assess degree of burnout measured using Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) scoring. RESULTS: Of 43 boot camp attendees, 38 trainees completed questionnaires, with 24 choosing to participate in ESRT (63.2 per cent; male 13, female 11, median age 28 years). Qualitative data reflected challenges delivering ESRT because of arduous and inflexible clinical on-call rotas, time pressures related to academic curriculum demands and the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic (10 of 24 drop-out). Despite these challenges, 22 (91.7 per cent) considered the course valuable and there was unanimous support for programme development. Of the 14 trainees who completed the ESRT course, nine (64.3 per cent) continued to use the techniques in daily clinical work. Burnout was identified in 23 trainees (60.5 per cent) with no evident difference in baseline MBI scores between participants (median 4 (range 0–11) versus 5 (1–11), P = 0.770). High stress states were significantly less likely, and mindfulness significantly higher in the intervention group (P < 0.010); MBI scores were comparable before and after ESRT in the intervention cohort (P = 0.630, median 4 (range 0–11) versus 4 (1–10)). DISCUSSION: Despite arduous emergency COVID rotas ESRT was feasible and, combined with protected time for trainees to engage, deserves further research to determine medium-term efficacy.","Luton, O W; James, O P; Mellor, K; Eley, C; Hopkins, L; Robinson, D B T; Lebares, C C; Powell, A G M T; Lewis, W G; Egan, R J",BJS Open,342,20

A sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR protocol that can address these clinical needs would be valuable to molecular diagnostic laboratories. Here we report a multiplex nucleic acid based assay using hydrolysis probes targeting the 5′ non-translated region for the detection and differentiation of enteroviruses and parechoviruses without cross-detection of rhinoviruses. This assay has been shown to detect enteroviruses belonging to the different species in a variety of specimen types without detecting the different species of rhinoviruses. Laboratory validation shows the assay to be sensitive, specific, reproducible, easy to set up and uses generic cycling conditions.

Recently, elevated OSM levels have been found in the serum of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units. Multiple anti-OSM therapeutics have been investigated, but to date no OSM small molecule inhibitors are clinically available. To pursue a high-throughput screening and structure-based drug discovery strategy to design a small molecule inhibitor of OSM, milligram quantities of highly pure, bioactive OSM are required. Here, we developed a reliable protocol to produce highly pure unlabeled and isotope enriched OSM from E. coli for biochemical and NMR studies. High yields (ca. 10 mg/L culture) were obtained in rich and minimal defined media cultures. Purified OSM was characterized by mass spectrometry and circular dichroism. The bioactivity was confirmed by induction of OSM/OSM receptor signaling through STAT3 phosphorylation in human breast cancer cells. Optimized buffer conditions yielded (1)H, (15)N HSQC NMR spectra with intense, well-dispersed peaks. Titration of (15)N OSM with a small molecule inhibitor showed chemical shift perturbations for several key residues with a binding affinity of 12.2 ± 3.9 μM.

METHODS: Four faculty designed an advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) student workbook on general medicine topics consisting of short answer and multiple-choice questions to ensure standardization by exposing all students to the same topics. A pre- and posttest was administered on the first and last day of the five-week rotation block to evaluate the effects of the APPE workbook on student understanding of general medicine topics. A paired t-test was used to evaluate the significance of the difference in test scores. RESULTS: The average of the posttest exam was found to be significantly higher after the completion of the student workbook. The average grade on the pre-rotation 30-item exam was 22.8 (76.73%) and the post-rotation 30-item exam was 25.7 (86.26%), with a difference of 9.53% (P < .001, 95% CI = 7.11 to 11.96). CONCLUSIONS: Creating a standardized student workbook for an inpatient acute care rotation was a valuable addition. All students assigned to the faculty involved were exposed to the same topics despite variability in preceptors and practice sites. Overall the verbal feedback from the students was positive about the student workbook and discussions, especially since the information was applicable to their patients on rotation.

Contemparaneous laboratory diagnosis has not been available previously. Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness. PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance. Serology is slow, insensitive and difficult to interpret at low titres.","Wallace, Lesley A.; Collins, Terry C.; Douglas, James D.M.; McIntyre, Sheena; Millar, John; Carman, William F.",J Clin Virol,342,3

Two Babies, Two Pandemics, 100 Years Apart",19.267864,6.909453,2021,"Objective The possible connection between COVID-19 and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) remains unclear (1). Elucidating these outcomes is important both to better understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and to improve patient care in pregnant patients with COVID-19. Our objectives were to test the hypothesis that COVID-19 infection is associated with an increased risk of HDP and to examine the association between the gestational age at COVID-19 infection and delivery and HDP risk. Study Design This was a retrospective cohort study at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, which has a universal COVID-19 testing policy on admission to labor and delivery. All women admitted for delivery from June 1, 2020-November 30, 2020, with a positive Sars-CoV-2 test at any time during pregnancy were compared 1:2 with randomly selected controls who had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test and were matched for race and parity. COVID-19 was diagnosed with nasopharyngeal RT-PCR or rapid antigen testing. HDP was diagnosed using standard criteria. Cox proportional hazards models with left truncation to account for the varying gestational age at COVID-19 diagnosis, and random effects (frailty) to account for the matching design and small cluster sizes, were used to examine the association between COVID-19 and HDP (2). As a sensitivity analysis we also examined early (before 32 weeks gestation) vs. late COVID-19 infection and HDP development. The study was deemed exempt from review by the Institutional Review Board. Results Of 1856 births, there were 83 women (4.5%) with COVID-19 infection. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between COVID-19 infected women and controls. Patients with COVID-19 infection had almost a two-fold risk of HDP (HR 1.93 (95%CI 1.13, 3.31). However, COVID-19 infection was not associated with severity of HDP, and severity of COVID-19 (3) was not associated with HDP development. Among patients with COVID-19 and HDP at delivery, the median interval from COVID-19 diagnosis to delivery was 3.8 weeks (IQR 0.29, 11.5). In additional analysis, early, but not late, COVID-19 infection was associated with HDP development (HR for early COVID-19 2.17 (95%CI 1.11, 4.24), HR for late COVID-19 1.68, (95%CI 0.79, 3.57). Conclusions Early COVID-19 infections are associated with HDP, even when accounting for differential exposure and delivery times, suggesting that COVID-19 infection may alter pregnancy physiology and increase the risk of HDP development over time. Infection closer to term is not associated with HDP, which likely reflects our high proportion of asymptomatic infections found at the time of delivery from a universal testing policy (4) and insufficient time to develop HDP in these cases. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 modulates placental ACE2 expression, which may be related to HDP development (5). Our study is limited by sampling in a single institution with a high HDP incidence. However, our results suggest that monitoring of patients with antepartum COVID-19 infection should encompass precautions for HDP development.","Rosenbloom, Joshua I.; Raghuraman, Nandini; Carter, Ebony B.; Kelly, Jeannie C.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,342,22

Multivariate logistic regression models stratified by ethnicity and sex describe the independent associations between obesity and multilevel socioeconomic factors after adjustment for age, other SEP measures at the individual, family and neighborhood levels, and health behaviors such as physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking. A positive relationship was observed between obesity and family income among African-American and Caribbean-Black men. Receipt of public assistance was a strongly associated factor for obesity in Caribbean-Black men and women. Among African-American women, inverse relationships were observed between obesity and education, occupation, and family income; residence within a neighborhood with a supermarket also decreased their odds of obesity. Residence in a neighborhood with a park decreased the odds of obesity only among African-American men, whereas residence in a neighborhood with a supermarket decreased the odds of obesity among Caribbean-Black men.

Although they convey useful information, such systems may lose tissue-specific architecture, biomechanical effectors, and biochemical cues deriving from the native extracellular matrix, with significant alterations in several cellular functions and processes. Notably, the introduction of three-dimensional (3D) platforms that are able to re-create in vitro the structures of the native tissue, have overcome some of these issues, since they better mimic the in vivo milieu and reduce the gap between the cell culture ambient and the tissue environment. 3D culture systems are currently used in a broad range of studies, from cancer and stem cell biology, to drug testing and discovery. Here, we describe the mechanisms used by cells to perceive and respond to biomechanical cues and the main signaling pathways involved. We provide an overall perspective of the most recent 3D technologies. Given the breadth of the subject, we concentrate on the use of hydrogels, bioreactors, 3D printing and bioprinting, nanofiber-based scaffolds, and preparation of a decellularized bio-matrix. In addition, we report the possibility to combine the use of 3D cultures with functionalized nanoparticles to obtain highly predictive in vitro models for use in the nanomedicine field.","Pennarossa, Georgia; Arcuri, Sharon; De Iorio, Teresina; Gandolfi, Fulvio; Brevini, Tiziana A.

There are many infectious pathogens that are not endemic to the US, but two of particular importance are Plasmodium and Leishmania, which respectively cause malaria and leishmaniasis. These parasites are both known to cause significant disease burden in their endemic locales, and thus pose a threat to military travelers. This review introduces readers to basic life cycle and disease mechanisms for each. Local and military epidemiology are described, as are the specific actions taken by the US military for prevention and treatment purposes. Complications of such measures with regard to human health are also discussed, including possible chemical toxicities. Additionally, poor recognition of these diseases upon an individual’s return leading to complications and treatment delays in the United States are examined. Information about canine leishmaniasis, poorly studied relative to its human manifestation, but of importance due to the utilization of dogs in military endeavors is presented. Future implications for the American healthcare system regarding malaria and leishmaniasis are also presented.","Beiter, Kaylin J.; Wentlent, Zachariah J.; Hamouda, Adrian R.; Thomas, Bolaji N.",PeerJ,342,1

Data came from a Swiss longitudinal study (N = 786, age ˜22 in 2020), with one prepandemic (2018) and four during‐pandemic assessments (2020). The prevalence of self‐injury did not change between April (during the first Swiss national lockdown) and September 2020 (postlockdown). Domestic violence perpetration increased temporarily in males. Prepandemic self‐injury was a major risk factor for during‐pandemic self‐injury. Specific living arrangements, pandemic‐related stressor accumulation, and a lack of adaptive coping strategies were associated with during‐pandemic self‐injury and domestic violence. Stressor accumulation had indirect effects on self‐injury and domestic violence through negative emotions.","Steinhoff, Annekatrin; Bechtiger, Laura; Ribeaud, Denis; Murray, Aja Louise; Hepp, Urs; Eisner, Manuel; Shanahan, Lilly",J Res Adolesc,342,28

The process involving infiltration of the N. benthamiana leaves with Agrobacterium spp, harbouring vectors with the gene of interest, facilitates transient expression. To date, little information is available on the effect of the agro-infiltration process on the metabolome of N. benthamiana, which is necessary to improve the process for large-scale, renewable manufacturing of high value compounds and medical products. Hence, the objective of the present study was to assess metabolic adaptation of N. benthamiana as a response to the presence of Agrobacterium. The present study elucidated changes of the steady-state metabolism in the agroinfiltrated leaf area, the area around the infection and the rest of the plant. Furthermore, the study discusses the phenotypic advantages of the N. benthamiana lab strain, optimised for agro-infiltration, compared to three other wild accessions. Results showed that the lab strain has a different metabolic composition and showed less alterations of the phenylpropanoid pathway and cell wall remodelling in the agroinfiltrated leaf areas, for example chlorogenic acid, cadaverine and C18:0–2-glycerol ester. In conclusion, both of these alterations present potential candidates to improve the phenotype of the N. benthamiana lab strain for a more efficient transient expression process.

We compared clinical characteristics according to these categories. RESULTS: We found two pandemic peaks, and the proportion of patients and health providers who were infected in other hospitals had increased in the latter two periods (period 2: 49.6%, period 3: 32.7%). Particularly, the proportion of infected health providers was 27% in period 2, and they tended to be younger females with a mild condition. Severity of the disease (requirement of oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation) was associated with advanced age, and all the patients who died during admission were over 60 years old.

Aberrant activation of innate immune system may affect organ damage with poor prognosis for septic patients. Here, we investigated the efficacy of polymethyl methacrylate membrane (PMMA)-based continuous hemofiltration (CVVH) in modulating systemic and tissue immune activation in a swine model of LPS-induced AKI. After 3 h from LPS infusion, animals underwent to PMMA-CVVH or polysulfone (PS)-CVVH. Renal deposition of terminal complement mediator C5b-9 and of Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) deposits were evaluated on biopsies whereas systemic Complement activation was assessed by ELISA assay. Gene expression profile was performed from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by microarrays and the results validated by Real-time PCR. Endotoxemic pigs presented oliguric AKI with increased tubulo-interstitial infiltrate, extensive collagen deposition, and glomerular thrombi; local PTX-3 and C5b-9 renal deposits and increased serum activation of classical and alternative Complement pathways were found in endotoxemic animals. PMMA-CVVH treatment significantly reduced tissue and systemic Complement activation limiting renal damage and fibrosis. By microarray analysis, we identified 711 and 913 differentially expressed genes with a fold change >2 and a false discovery rate <0.05 in endotoxemic pigs and PMMA-CVVH treated-animals, respectively. The most modulated genes were Granzyme B, Complement Factor B, Complement Component 4 Binding Protein Alpha, IL-12, and SERPINB-1 that were closely related to sepsis-induced immunological process.

Over 95% of cases of renovascular hypertension are due either to atherosclerosis of the main renal artery trunks or to fibromuscular dysplasia. These two causes of renal artery stenosis have been extensively discussed in recent reviews and consensus. The aim of the current article is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on the remaining causes. While these causes are rare or extremely rare, etiologic and differential diagnosis matters both for prognosis and management. Therefore, the clinician cannot ignore them. For didactic reasons, we have grouped these different entities into stenotic lesions (neurofibromatosis type 1 and other rare syndromes, dissection, arteritis, and segmental arterial mediolysis) often associated with aortic coarctation and other arterial abnormalities, and nonstenotic lesions, where hypertension is secondary to compression of adjacent arteries and changes in arterial pulsatility (aneurysm) or to the formation of a shunt, leading to kidney ischemia (arteriovenous fistula). Finally, thrombotic disorders of the renal artery may also be responsible for renovascular hypertension. Although thrombotic/embolic lesions do not represent primary vessel wall disease, they are characterized by frequent macrovascular involvement. In this review, we illustrate the most characteristic aspects of these different entities responsible for renovascular hypertension and discuss their prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, management, and prognosis.","Persu, Alexandre; Canning, Caitriona; Prejbisz, Aleksander; Dobrowolski, Piotr; Amar, Laurence; Chrysochou, Constantina; Kądziela, Jacek; Litwin, Mieczysław; van Twist, Daan; Van der Niepen, Patricia; Wuerzner, Gregoire; de Leeuw, Peter; Azizi, Michel; Januszewicz, Magda; Januszewicz, Andrzej",Hypertension,342,24

We sought to review the benefits of meditation on the alleviation of loneliness. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted based on Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework. Eligibility criteria included primary studies of any type that investigated the effects of meditation on loneliness. Search strategies were developed and conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, and CINAHL. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, and American Psychological Association websites were also searched. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were critically reviewed using a descriptive-analytical narrative method. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria and were published between 2012 and 2020 across 10 countries. Eleven studies reported improvements in relation to loneliness. Of the remaining two studies (15%), one mentioned the alleviation of loneliness, but only looked primarily at social closeness in lonely individuals. The other study found a correlation between loneliness and nuclear factor (NF)-κB levels, which was the measured outcome; however, the direct effects of meditation on loneliness were unclear. Three main themes emerged from our analysis, as follows: 1) positive results across all studies, 2) relatively small randomized control trials conducted over the last decade, and 3) lack of diverse demographic information. CONCLUSIONS: While a small number of studies exist at this intersection, given all included studies indicated positive findings, the effects of meditation in alleviating loneliness are promising. Future research should be directed at understanding how meditation mitigates loneliness and how this intervention can impact practice for healthcare professionals.","Saini, Gurleen K.; Haseeb, Saud B.; Taghi-Zada, Zhala; Ng, Jeremy Y.",BMC Psychol,342,3

The impact of this virus has continued to overwhelm hospital infrastructure and demanded remodeling of healthcare systems. With rising concerns for a third, and possibly the largest, wave of individuals infected with the virus, national leaders are continuing to seek avenues by which we can further limit disease transmission and prevent infection with the use of vaccination. To our knowledge, no clinical trial evaluating vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 has included pregnant women. In December 2020, it was anticipated that the Food and Drug Administration will approve at least 1 or 2 mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine under the Emergency Use Authorization based on phase 3 clinical trial efficacy data. Both Pfizer and Moderna have manufactured mRNA-based vaccines with 95% and 94.1% efficacy against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. AstraZeneca has manufactured a vaccine using a viral vector demonstrating early efficacy as well, and this next-generation platform has previously been utilized with the Ebola vaccine and safely administered during pregnancy with an acceptable safety profile. Approval of these vaccines will have a tremendous impact on the ongoing pandemic, yet there remains a lack of data for use of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in pregnant women.

To test the previously proposed replicase-driven template-switching mechanism for recombination, a partially purified TCV replicase preparation (RdRp) was programed with RNAs resembling the putative in vivo recombination intermediates. Analysis of the in vitro RdRp products revealed efficient generation of 3'-terminal extension products. Initiation of 3'-terminal extension occurred at or close to the base of a hairpin that was a recombination hotspot in vivo. Efficient generation of the 3'-terminal extension products depended on two factors: (i) a hairpin structure in the acceptor RNA region and (ii) a short base-paired region formed between the acceptor RNA and the nascent RNA synthesized from the donor RNA template. The hairpin structure bound to the RdRp, and thus is probably involved in its recruitment. The probable role of the base-paired region is to hold the 3' terminus near the RdRp bound to the hairpin structure to facilitate 3'-terminal extension. These regions were also required for in vivo RNA recombination between TCV-associated sat-RNA C and sat-RNA D, giving crucial and direct support for a replicase-driven template-switching mechanism of RNA recombination.","Nagy, P D; Zhang, C; Simon, A E",The EMBO Journal,342,16

Elopiprazole (a phenylpiperazine antipsychotic drug in phase 1) has been characterized as a therapeutic drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection in a repurposing study. We aim to investigate the potential effects of aripiprazole (an FDA approved phenylpiperazine) on COVID19-related immunological parameters. Methods: Differential gene expression profiles of non-COVID versus COVID RNA-Seq samples (CRA002390 project in GSA database) and drug-naive patients with psychosis at baseline and after three months of aripiprazole treatment was identified. An integrative analysis between COVID and aripiprazole immunomodulatory antagonist effects was performed. Findings: 82 out the 377 genes (21.7%) with expression significantly altered by aripiprazole have also their expression altered in COVID-19 patients and in 93.9% of these genes their expression is reverted by aripiprazole. The number of common genes with expression altered in both analyses is significantly higher than expected (Fisher's Exact Test, two tail; P value=3.2e-11). 11 KEGG pathways were significantly enriched with genes with altered expression both in COVID-19 patients and aripiprazole medicated schizophrenia patients (P adj<0.05). The most significant pathways were associated to the immune system such as the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (the most significant pathway with a P adj of 0.00021), Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation and B cell receptor signaling pathway, all three related to the defense against infections. Interpretation: This exploratory investigation may provide further support to the notion that protective effect is exerted by phenylpiperazine by modulating the immunological dysregulation associated to COVID-19. Along with many ongoing studies and clinical trials, repurposing available medications could be of use in countering SARS-CoV-2 infection, but require further studies and trials.","Crespo-Facorro, B.; Ruiz-Veguilla, M.; Vazquez-Bourgon, J.; Sanchez-Hidalgo, A.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a model that estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2–related mortality among all enrollees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study used data from 7 635 064 individuals enrolled in the VA health care system as of May 21, 2020, to develop and internally validate a logistic regression model (COVIDVax) that predicted SARS-CoV-2–related death (n = 2422) during the observation period (May 21 to November 2, 2020) using baseline characteristics known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2–related mortality, extracted from the VA electronic health records (EHRs). The cohort was split into a training period (May 21 to September 30) and testing period (October 1 to November 2). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2–related death, defined as death within 30 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. VA EHR data streams were imported on a data integration platform to demonstrate that the model could be executed in real-time to produce dashboards with risk scores for all current VA enrollees. RESULTS: Of 7 635 064 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 66.2 (13.8) years, and most were men (7 051 912 [92.4%]) and White individuals (4 887 338 [64.0%]), with 1 116 435 (14.6%) Black individuals and 399 634 (5.2%) Hispanic individuals. From a starting pool of 16 potential predictors, 10 were included in the final COVIDVax model, as follows: sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and Care Assessment Need score. The model exhibited excellent discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.1%), superior to the AUROC of using age alone to stratify risk (72.6%; 95% CI, 71.6%-73.6%). Assuming vaccination is 90% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2–related death, using this model to prioritize vaccination was estimated to prevent 63.5% of deaths that would occur by the time 50% of VA enrollees are vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimate for prioritizing vaccination based on age (45.6%) or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention phases of vaccine allocation (41.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study of all VA enrollees, prioritizing vaccination based on the COVIDVax model was estimated to prevent a large proportion of deaths expected to occur during vaccine rollout before sufficient herd immunity is achieved.","Ioannou, George N.; Green, Pamela; Fan, Vincent S.; Dominitz, Jason A.; O’Hare, Ann M.; Backus, Lisa I.; Locke, Emily; Eastment, McKenna C.; Osborne, Thomas F.; Ioannou, Nikolas G.; Berry, Kristin",JAMA Netw Open,342,12

In addition to the medical practice for treatment and immunization, it is vital to have a thorough understanding of community spread phenomena as related research reports 17.9–30.8% confirmed cases to remain asymptomatic. Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time. This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics. To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time. Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city.","Simsek, Murat; Kantarci, Burak",Int J Environ Res Public Health,342,1

Globally, it was observed that countries implementing strict movement control were more successful in controlling the spread of the virus as compared with those with less stringent measures. Society’s adherence to the movement control order has helped expedite the process to flatten the pandemic curve as seen in countries such as China and Malaysia. At the same time, there are countries facing challenges with society’s nonconformity toward movement restriction orders due to various claims such as human rights violations as well as sociocultural and economic issues. In Indonesia, society’s adherence to its large-scale social restrictions (LSSRs) order is also a challenge to achieve. Indonesia is regarded as among the worst in Southeast Asian countries in terms of managing the spread of COVID-19. It is proven by the increased number of daily confirmed cases and the total number of deaths, which was more than 6.21% (1351/21,745) of total active cases as of May 2020. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore public sentiments and emotions toward the LSSR and identify issues, fear, and reluctance to observe this restriction among the Indonesian public. METHODS: This study adopts a sentiment analysis method with a supervised machine learning approach on COVID-19-related posts on selected media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube). The analysis was also performed on COVID-19-related news contained in more than 500 online news platforms recognized by the Indonesian Press Council. Social media posts and news originating from Indonesian online media between March 31 and May 31, 2020, were analyzed. Emotion analysis on Twitter platform was also performed to identify collective public emotions toward the LSSR. RESULTS: The study found that positive sentiment surpasses other sentiment categories by 51.84% (n=1,002,947) of the total data (N=1,934,596) collected via the search engine. Negative sentiment was recorded at 35.51% (686,892/1,934,596) and neutral sentiment at 12.65% (244,757/1,934,596). The analysis of Twitter posts also showed that the majority of public have the emotion of “trust” toward the LSSR. CONCLUSIONS: Public sentiment toward the LSSR appeared to be positive despite doubts on government consistency in executing the LSSR. The emotion analysis also concluded that the majority of people believe in LSSR as the best method to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission. Overall, Indonesians showed trust and expressed hope toward the government’s ability to manage this current global health crisis and win against COVID-19.","Tri Sakti, Andi Muhammad; Mohamad, Emma; Azlan, Arina Anis",J Med Internet Res,342,16

Recently, patients with hyperinflammatory shock have been identified among children who are confirmed to have or are suspected of having SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The presenting signs and symptoms are characterized by prolonged fever, abdominal pain, and cardiac involvement without any signs of pneumonia on chest computed tomography. However, it is uncertain at this time whether SARS‐CoV‐2 infection affects this syndrome. Compared to adults, quite a few children are asymptomatic even when infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, which could make these children serious sources of infection at home or in medical institutions. Considering these characteristics, it is important to take appropriate precautions during medical examinations and perform infection control in emergency departments to save the lives of both the children and adult patients. Most healthy children are suffering huge stress due to restrictions against going outside and school closures as social means to control infection. It is possible that children are socially isolated when they come to the emergency department, and they might require mental or social support even if they are only complaining about their physical condition. Healthcare providers are required to examine the children’s circumstances carefully and cooperate with workers in other professions appropriately.","Imai, Kazunori; Matsushima, Asako; Saitoh, Shinji",Acute Med Surg,342,1

As hand contamination is considered an important and potentially preventable factor for transmission, we have reviewed face touching in the context of a group of disorders known as the Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours (BFRPs). Spontaneous face-touching is a poorly understood, atavistic, ingrained habit for humans, who engage in this activity approximately 26 times per hour. Nearly half of spontaneous face-touches involve mucous membranes, and one third of those involve the eyes. Historically the majority of research of this curious phenomenon has focused on psychological aspects, despite its pertinence to a range of anterior eye diseases such as keratoconus, trichotillomania and mucus-fishing syndrome. The ocular infectious sequelae through chiral auto-inoculation are well known for diseases including the conjunctivitides, herpetic keratitis, and papillomatosis. Furthermore, touches to the ocular mucous membranes also play an important role in systemic disease through access to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts via the nasolacrimal duct and nasopharynx, and may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through this access, chiral touches may also play a significant role in building and maintaining the microbiome, which has been increasingly implicated in ocular disease. This article reviews spontaneous self-touches, and their significant ramifications for ocular and systemic health and disease.","Spencer, Sascha K.R.; Francis, Ian C.; Coroneo, Minas T.",Ocul Surf,342,20

Design This was a qualitative study with an interpretive phenomenological approach. Data were collected during 8 focus groups of 2-3 physical therapists each (n=22). Setting Focus groups were conducted via videoconference. Participants A purposive sampling strategy was used. To be included, participants had to be licensed PTs, worked in facilities in the NY metro area at the onset of the pandemic (March 1, 2020), and had to have had direct patient-care responsibilities. Participant work settings included: acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, homecare, outpatient clinics, school systems, and skilled nursing facilities. Interventions This was a qualitative study without interventions. Main Outcome Measures An open, inductive coding process was used to identify codes, categories and themes. To improve trustworthiness the investigators took notes, debriefed, and maintained and audit trail. All 3 investigators participated in the coding process. Results Four themes emerged including: 1) Everything was disrupted; 2) It was not safe; 3) It was overwhelming; and 4) There was a professional transformation. In hospitals and skilled nursing, participants described chaos, inadequate communication, and unsafe working environments. In outpatient settings, participants experienced furloughs and layoffs along with challenges adapting to telehealth. As the pandemic progressed, inpatient PTs gained confidence and grew into new roles as essential members of interdisciplinary care teams. Outpatient therapists adapted to telehealth and and as patients returned to therapy. Conclusions Physical therapists experienced extreme challenges during the initial phases of the pandemic. As the pandemic progressed, they redefined practice in ways that will be instructive as the pandemic continues.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are especially at risk of isolation from face-to-face and non-face-to-face interactions. We developed the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Social Network Scale (NCGG-SNS) to assess frequency of, and satisfaction with, social interactions. The NCGG-SNS consists of four domains: face-to-face/non-face-to-face interactions with family/friends. Each domain score is obtained by multiplying frequency ratings by satisfaction ratings for each item; all scores were summed to obtain a total NCGG-SNS score (range: 0–64). Additionally, face-to-face and non-face-to-face subscores were calculated. Higher scores indicated satisfactory social networking. A cohort of 2445 older Japanese adults completed the NCGG-SNS and the Geriatrics Depression Scale-Short form. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression determined predictive validity for depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were reported by 284 participants (11.6%). The optimal NCGG-SNS cut-off value to identify depressive symptoms was 26.5 points. In logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders, lower NCGG-SNS values were significantly associated with greater prevalence of depressive symptoms. Face-to-face and non-face-to-face subscores were associated with depressive symptoms. The NCGG-SNS is a valid and useful indicator of multidimensional social networking enabling identification of depressive symptoms in older adults.","Bae, Seongryu; Harada, Kenji; Chiba, Ippei; Makino, Keitaro; Katayama, Osamu; Lee, Sangyoon; Shinkai, Yohei; Shimada, Hiroyuki",Int J Environ Res Public Health,342,0

Significant resources have been dedicated towards profiling the viral genome in the adult population. We present an analysis of viral genomes acquired from pediatric patients presenting to Children's National Hospital in Washington D.C, including 24 with primary SARS CoV2 infection and 3 with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) undergoing treatment at our facility. Viral genome analysis using next generation sequencing indicated that approximately 81% of the analyzed strains were of the GH clade, 7% of the cases belonged to the GR clade, and 12% of the cases belonged to S, V, or G clades. One sample, acquired from a neonatal patient, presented with the highest viral RNA load of all patients evaluated at our center. Viral sequencing of this sample identified a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant, S:N679S. Analysis of data deposited in the GISAID global database of viral sequences shows the S:N679S variant is present in eight other sequenced samples within the US mid-Atlantic region. The similarity of the regional sequences suggests transmission and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant within the Capitol region, raising the importance of increasing the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance. IMPORTANCE A variant in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was identified in a febrile neonate who was hospitalized with COVID-19. This patient exhibited the highest viral RNA load of any COVID-19 patient tested at our center. Viral sequencing identified a spike protein variant, S:N679S, which is proximal to the cleavage site at residue 681. The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike is a protein trimer (three subunits) which serves as the key target for antibody therapies and vaccine development. Study of viral sequences from the GISAID database revealed eight related sequences from the US mid-Atlantic region. The identification of this variant in a very young patient, its critical location in the spike polyprotein, and the evidence that it has been detected in other patients in our region underscores the need for increased viral sequencing to monitor variant prevalence and emergence, which may have a direct impact on recommended public health measures and vaccination strategies.","LoTempio, J.

Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) and digital ulcers (DUs) in SSc patients can be resistant to usual treatments. We studied the clinical benefits, capillaroscopy changes, and cost-effectiveness of local injection of botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) and intravenous prostaglandin analogs (iloprost/alprostadil) in patients with SSc with resistant DUs. METHOD: In a clinical trial study, we evaluated 26 patients fulfilling the ACR/EULAR SSc criteria with resistant DUs. Visual analog scale of pain and RP, skin color and type of ulcers, and capillaroscopy were assessed before and 1 month after treatment. In the first group, 20 units of BTX-A was injected at the base of each involved fingers by a dermatologist. In the second group, 20 µg iloprost or 60 µg alprostadil was infused daily. The cost of these treatments was compared. RESULT: In 26 patients (43 fingers), there were 16 patients (22 fingers) in the BTX-A and 10 patients (21 fingers) in the prostaglandin group. In 95.5% of the BTX-A and 90.5% of the prostaglandin group, the ulcers were healed. In both groups, a significant decrease in pain was seen (p < 0.0001). Capillaroscopy patterns in both groups were not changed although the microhemorrhages disappeared significantly (p value: BTX-A: 0.03 and prostaglandin: 0.002). The cost was significantly lower in the BTX-A injection group (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Both BTX-A and prostaglandins helped in the healing and pain control of DUs. In capillaroscopy, microhemorrhages were significantly decreased in both groups. In the BTX-A group, the cost was significantly lower as an outpatient treatment and was more time-saving. KEY MESSAGES: • BTX-A and prostaglandin analogs both contributed to the healing of digital tip ulcers and improving the pain • In capillaroscopy, microhemorrhages were significantly decreased or disappeared after both treatments • There was no significant side effect in both groups • Comparing both groups, in the BTX-A group, the cost was significantly lower when performed on an outpatient treatment and more time-saving.

RESULTS: There was one treatment-related death (0.19%) due to hospital-acquired legionella pneumonia, and one patient developed neutropenic bacteremia (Klebsiella pneumonia) without sepsis. Overall 5-year survival was 98.8%. Post HSCT secondary autoimmune diseases (2nd ADs) were idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) and hypo or hyperthyroidism. ITP was highest with alemtuzumab (14%) and 0 to 2.8% for the non-alemtuzumab regimens. After HSCT, 16 patients developed hypothyroidism (3.5%) and 15 developed hyperthyroidism / Grave’s disease (3.3%). Relapse free survival (RFS) at 5 years for RRMS and SPMS was 80.1% and 98.1%, respectively, while progression free survival (PFS) at 4 years for RRMS and SPMS was 95% versus 66%, respectively. For patients with RRMS, the EDSS significantly improved (p < 0.0001) at each follow-up from a pre-HSCT mean of 3.87 to 2.51, 2.50, 2.41, 2.33, and 2.19 at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. For SPMS, the EDSS improved significantly only at 1 year but not thereafter.

Diagnosing and managing asthma patients during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since early 2020 has been challenging, mainly due to the risk of contracting COVID-19 disease and to the limited access to hospital care and pulmonary function tests. We report a case of a 52-year-old female patient, diagnosed with adult-onset asthma in 2018, who was first referred to the Allergy Department of our hospital in January 2019 for dyspnea, wheezing, and worsening cough. Despite continuous inhaled therapy and good inhalation technique, she had frequent asthma symptoms, requiring short courses of oral corticosteroids (CS). Physical examination and pulmonary function tests on admission revealed broncho-obstructive syndrome and laboratory tests showed mild inflammation and high total serum IgE.

The etiology for this outbreak is a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Thus far, related research on COVID-19 is still in preliminary stage. This paper summarized the latest outcomes of corresponding study from Chinese centers and clarified the hematopoietic abnormality caused by SARS-CoV-2 and potential mechanism. Lymphopenia was common in the early stage after the onset of COVID-19. A significant decrease was observed in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. As the illness progressed, neutrophilia emerged in several cases, and patients with severe critical pulmonary conditions showed higher neutrophils than common type. Thrombocytopenia was resulting from the consumption and/or the reduced production of platelets in damaged lungs. Anemia was not observed notably, but the decrease in hemoglobin was frequent. The activation of monocyte-macrophage system aggravates the immune damage of lung and other tissues, which leads to the increase of D-dimer, prothrombin time, and platelet consumption.","Liu, Xiaoqing; Zhang, Run; He, Guangsheng",Ann Hematol,342,16

In this context, revisiting the definition of myocarditis is appropriate with a specific focus on diagnostic and management considerations in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. RECENT FINDINGS: Pathologic cardiac specimens from patients with COVID-19 suggest a mixed inflammatory response involving lymphocytes and macrophages, and importantly, cellular injury occurs predominantly at the level of pericytes and endothelial cells, less often involving direct myocyte necrosis. In COVID-19, the diagnosis of myocarditis has understandably been based predominantly on clinical criteria, and the number of patients with clinically suspected myocarditis who would meet diagnostic histological criteria is unclear. Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance are important diagnostic tools, although the prognostic implications of abnormalities are still being defined. Importantly, SARS-CoV2 myocarditis should be diagnosed within an appropriate clinical context and should not be based on isolated imaging findings. Therapies in COVID-19 have focused on the major clinical manifestation of pneumonia, but the promotion of viral clearance early in the disease could prevent the development of myocarditis, and further study of immunosuppressive therapies once myocarditis has developed are indicated. SUMMARY: A strict and uniform approach is needed to diagnose myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the natural history of this disease and to facilitate evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions. A methodological approach will also better inform the incidence of COVID-19 associated myocarditis and potential long-term health effects.","Abou Hassan, Ossama K.; Sheng, Calvin C.; Wang, Tom Kai Ming; Cremer, Paul C.",Curr Cardiol Rep,342,1

A cross-sectional study was conducted among registered Lebanese radiographers to assess the general, workplace conditions, health and safety, mental/psychologic, financial, and skill/knowledge development impacts. Despite applying an adapted safety protocol, institutions are neither providing free RT-PCR testing to their staff nor showing adequate support for infected staff members, thus causing distress about contracting the virus from the workplace. Aggravated by the deteriorating economic situation that affected the radiographers financially, they additionally suffer from severe occupational physical and mental burnout. Regardless of that, they used their free time during the lockdown for skill/knowledge development and have performed many recreational activities.

Although the search for viruses with pandemic potential in the environment may have an important predictive and monitoring role, it is still based on empirical methodologies, mostly resulting from the clinic and not fully validated for environmental matrices. As far as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, currently underway, is concerned, environmental monitoring activities aiming at checking the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be extremely useful to predict and check the diffusion of the disease. For this reason, the present study aims at evaluating the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion by means of a wastewater-based environmental monitoring developed in Piedmont, N-W Italy, during the second and third pandemic waves. Wastewater sampling strategies, sampling points sample pre-treatments and analytical methods, data processing and standardization, have been developed and discussed to give representative and reliable results. The following outcomes has been highlighted by the present study: i) a strong correlation between SARS-CoV-2 concentration in untreated wastewater and epidemic evolution in the considered areas can be observed as well as a predictive potential that could provide decision-makers with indications to implement effective policies, to mitigate the effects of the ongoing pandemic and to prepare response plans for future pandemics that could certainly arise in the decades to come; ii) moreover, the data at disposal from our monitoring campaign (almost 500 samples analysed in 11 months) confirm that SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater are strongly variable and site-specific across the region: the highest SARS-CoV-2 concentration values have been found in sewer networks serving the most populated areas of the region; iii) normalization of viral concentrations in wastewater through Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (a specific faecal marker) has been carried out and commented; iv) the study highlights the potential of wastewater treatment plants to degrade the genetic material referable to SARS-CoV-2 as well. In conclusion, the preliminary data reported in the present paper, although they need to be complemented by further studies considering also other geographical regions, are very promising.","Robotto, Angelo; Lembo, David; Quaglino, Paola; Brizio, Enrico; Polato, Denis; Civra, Andrea; Cusato, Jessica; Di Perri, Giovanni",Environ Res,342,10

The aim of this article is to review the mechanistic interaction of drugs with membrane lipid rafts and address the question whether drugs induce physicochemical changes in raft-constituting and raft-surrounding membranes. METHODS: Literature searches of PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases from 2000 to 2020 were conducted to include articles published in English in internationally recognized journals. Collected articles were independently reviewed by title, abstract and text for relevance. RESULTS: The literature search indicated that pharmacologically diverse drugs interact with raft model membranes and cellular membrane lipid rafts. They could physicochemically modify functional protein-localizing membrane lipid rafts and the membranes surrounding such domains, affecting the raft organizational integrity with the resultant exhibition of pharmacological activity. Raft-acting drugs were characterized as ones to decrease membrane fluidity, induce liquid-ordered phase or order plasma membranes, leading to lipid raft formation; and ones to increase membrane fluidity, induce liquid-disordered phase or reduce phase transition temperature, leading to lipid raft disruption. CONCLUSION: Targeting lipid raft membrane domains would open a new way for drug design and development. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors which are a cell-specific target of and responsible for the cellular entry of novel coronavirus are localized in lipid rafts, agents that specifically disrupt the relevant rafts may be a drug against coronavirus disease 2019.","Tsuchiya, Hironori; Mizogami, Maki",Drug Target Insights,342,20

Here, we provide a national-scale analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) superspreading during the first wave of infections in Austria, a country that played a major role in initial virus transmissions in Europe. Capitalizing on Austria’s well-developed epidemiological surveillance system, we identified major SARS-CoV-2 clusters during the first wave of infections and performed deep whole-genome sequencing of more than 500 virus samples. Phylogenetic-epidemiological analysis enabled the reconstruction of superspreading events and charts a map of tourism-related viral spread originating from Austria in spring 2020. Moreover, we exploited epidemiologically well-defined clusters to quantify SARS-CoV-2 mutational dynamics, including the observation of low-frequency mutations that progressed to fixation within the infection chain. Time-resolved virus sequencing unveiled viral mutation dynamics within individuals with COVID-19, and epidemiologically validated infector-infectee pairs enabled us to determine an average transmission bottleneck size of 10(3) SARS-CoV-2 particles. In conclusion, this study illustrates the power of combining epidemiological analysis with deep viral genome sequencing to unravel the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to gain fundamental insights into mutational dynamics and transmission properties.","Popa, Alexandra; Genger, Jakob-Wendelin; Nicholson, Michael D.; Penz, Thomas; Schmid, Daniela; Aberle, Stephan W.; Agerer, Benedikt; Lercher, Alexander; Endler, Lukas; Colaço, Henrique; Smyth, Mark; Schuster, Michael; Grau, Miguel L.; Martínez-Jiménez, Francisco; Pich, Oriol; Borena, Wegene; Pawelka, Erich; Keszei, Zsofia; Senekowitsch, Martin; Laine, Jan; Aberle, Judith H.; Redlberger-Fritz, Monika; Karolyi, Mario; Zoufaly, Alexander; Maritschnik, Sabine; Borkovec, Martin; Hufnagl, Peter; Nairz, Manfred; Weiss, Günter; Wolfinger, Michael T.; von Laer, Dorothee; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Allerberger, Franz; Michor, Franziska; Bock, Christoph; Bergthaler, Andreas",Sci Transl Med,342,1

Proponents have suggested that five-fraction hypofractionated radiotherapy for these patients would result in significant cost savings. An assessment of this argument is thus warranted. The FAST-Forward and UK FAST clinical trials each demonstrated that their respective hypofractionated regimens provided equivalent outcomes compared with standard regimens. Thus, a cost-minimization analysis was performed to quantify the potential savings associated with these regimens, which were designated as FAST-Forward 1 (26 Gy/5 fractions/1 week) and FAST-Forward 2 (27 Gy/5 fractions/1 week), and UK FAST 1 (28.5 Gy/5 fractions/5 weeks) and UK FAST 2 (30 Gy/5 fractions/5 weeks). A standard regimen of 42.5 Gy/16 fractions/5 weeks was also included. A comprehensive model of radiotherapy costs for a Canadian cancer centre was created. Time, labour costs, and capital costs were calculated for each regimen and applied using established measures. The total costs per patient for the FAST-Forward trials were $851.77 for FAST-Forward 1 and $874.77 for FAST-Forward 2, providing a total savings of $487.99 and $464.99, respectively. Similarly, the total costs per patient for the FAST trials were $979.75 for UK FAST 1 and $1017.70 for UK FAST 2, providing savings of $360.01 and $322.06, respectively. Following the FAST-Forward 1 regimen results in the greatest reduction of infrastructure and human resources costs at 36.42% compared with the standard. Sensitivity analysis shows a maximum per-patient costs savings ranging from $474.60 to $508.53 for the FAST-Forward 1 trial, which translates to an annual savings of $174,700/year locally and $2.06 million/year province-wide, based on a moderate-to-large size department workload. Compared with a standard radiotherapy regimen, all FAST-Forward and UK FAST hypofractionated regimens provide cost savings for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. The cost savings associated with each of these equivalent regimens can be directly calculated; activities in this model can easily be adjusted to account for cost variations, allowing other centres to calculate cost impacts specific to their own centres.","Yaremko, Hannah L.; Locke, Gordon E.; Chow, Ronald; Lock, Michael; Dinniwell, Robert; Yaremko, Brian P.",Curr Oncol,342,1

This study aimed to examine the possible mediating role of psychological capital and the moderating role of academic burnout in the relationship between problematic social media usage and anxiety among university students during COVID-19. A total of 3,123 undergraduates from universities in Shanghai participated in an online survey from March to April 2020. The results showed that problematic social media usage among university students predicted their levels of anxiety. Mediation analysis indicated that psychological capital mediated the relationship between problematic social media usage and anxiety. Furthermore, for university students whose academic performance had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of both problematic social media usage and the psychological capital on anxiety were moderated by academic burnout. For university students whose academic performance was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, academic burnout moderated the effects of psychological capital but not the effects of problematic social media usage on anxiety. The results highlighted the underlying mechanisms in the relationship between problematic social media usage and anxiety. These findings provide practical insights into the development and implementation of psychological interventions when facing a pandemic.","Jiang, Yan",Front Psychol,342,16

Therefore, convenient, timely and accurate detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 is urgently needed. Here, we review the types, characteristics and shortcomings of various detection methods, as well as perspectives for the SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis. Clinically, nucleic acid‐based methods are sensitive but prone to false‐positive. The antibody‐based method has slightly lower sensitivity but higher accuracy. Therefore, it is suggested to combine the two methods to improve the detection accuracy of COVID‐19.","Li, Chun; Ren, Linzhu",Transbound Emerg Dis,342,11

Human microbiota is composed by bacteria, yeasts, fungi and, last but not least, viruses, whose composition has not been completely described. According to previous evidence on pathogenic viruses, the human gut harbours plant-derived viruses, giant viruses and, only recently, abundant bacteriophages. New metagenomic methods have allowed to reconstitute entire viral genomes from the genetic material spread in the human gut, opening new perspectives on the understanding of the gut virome composition, the importance of gut microbiome, and potential clinical applications. This review reports the latest evidence on human gut “virome” composition and its function, possible future therapeutic applications in human health in the context of the gut microbiota, and attempts to clarify the role of the gut “virome” in the larger microbial ecosystem.","Scarpellini, Emidio; Ianiro, Gianluca; Attili, Fabia; Bassanelli, Chiara; De Santis, Adriano; Gasbarrini, Antonio",Dig Liver Dis,342,1

Non‐emergency medical appointments were cancelled. Ongoing clinical trials were challenged to create new modes of operation while public pressure mounted to find therapeutic options against COVID‐19. Yet, the inability to conduct research during COVID‐19 was overcome with cooperation, resource sharing, and compassion, which provides important lessons on how to improve health related research as we enter a new normal.","Kozlowski, Hannah N.; Farkouh, Michael E.; Irwin, Meredith S.; Radvanyi, Laszlo G.; Schimmer, Aaron D.; Tabori, Uri; Rosenblum, Norman D.",EMBO Mol Med,342,16

However, the role of key components of neutrophil innate immunity in severe forms of COVID‐19 has deserved insufficient attention. We aimed to evaluate the involvement of neutrophil elastase, histone‐DNA, and DNases in systemic and multi‐organ manifestations of COVID‐19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter study of markers of neutrophil innate immunity in 155 cases consecutively recruited in a screening center, local hospitals, and two regional university hospitals. The cases were evaluated according to clinical and biological markers of severity and multi‐organ manifestations and compared to 35 healthy controls. RESULTS: Blood neutrophil elastase, histone‐DNA, myeloperoxidase‐DNA, and free dsDNA were dramatically increased, and DNase activity was decreased by 10‐fold, compared with controls. Neutrophil elastase and histone‐DNA were associated with intensive care admission, body temperature, lung damage, and markers of cardiovascular outcomes, renal failure, and increased interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), IL‐8, and CXCR2. Neutrophil elastase was an independent predictor of the computed tomography score of COVID‐19 lung damage and the number of affected organs, in multivariate analyses. The increased blood concentrations of NE and neutrophil extracellular traps were related to exacerbation of neutrophil stimulation through IL‐8 and CXCR2 increased concentrations and increased serum DAMPs, and to impaired degradation of NETs as a consequence of the dramatic decrease in blood DNase activity. CONCLUSION: Our results point out the key role of neutrophil innate immunity exacerbation in COVID‐19. Neutrophil elastase and DNase could be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of severe systemic manifestations of COVID‐19.","Guéant, Jean‐Louis; Guéant‐Rodriguez, Rosa‐Maria; Fromonot, Julien; Oussalah, Abderrahim; Louis, Huguette; Chery, Celine; Gette, Mickael; Gleye, Stanislas; Callet, Jonas; Raso, Jeremie; Blanchecotte, François; Lacolley, Patrick; Guieu, Régis; Regnault, Véronique",Allergy,342,24
