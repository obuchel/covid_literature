Particularly, a discrete SEIRS epidemic model with standard incidence is also considered. The positivity and boundedness of solutions with positive initial conditions are obtained. It is shown that if the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , then disease-free equilibrium is globally attractive, and if [Formula: see text] , then the disease is permanent. When the model degenerates into SEIR model, it is proved that if [Formula: see text] , then the model has a unique endemic equilibrium, which is globally attractive. Furthermore, the numerical examples verify an important open problem that when [Formula: see text] , the endemic equilibrium of general SEIRS models is also globally attractive.","Fan, Xiaolin; Wang, Lei; Teng, Zhidong",Adv Differ Equ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100848/,510

9356,Healthy People Curriculum Task Force: A commentary by the Surgeon General,2004-11-17,"Feline oncornavirus and lentivirus infections have provided useful models to characterize the virus and host cell factors involved in a variety of marrow suppressive disorders and haematological malignancies. Exciting recent progress has been made in the characterization of the viral genotypic features involved in FeLV-associated diseases. Molecular studies have clearly defined the causal role of variant FeLV env gene determinants in two disorders: the T-lymphocyte cytopathicity and the clinical acute immuno-suppression induced by the FeLV-FAIDS variant and the pure red cell aplasia induced by FeLV-C/Sarma. Variant or enFeLV env sequences also appear to play a role in FeLV-associated lymphomas. Additional studies are required to determine the host cell processes that are perturbed by these variant env gene products. In the case of the FeLV-FAIDS variant, the aberrant env gene products appear to impair superinfection interference, resulting in accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA and cell death. In other cases it is likely that the viral env proteins interact with host products that are important in cell viability and/or proliferation. Understanding of these mechanisms will therefore provide insights to factors involved in normal The haematological consequences of FIV are quite similar to those associated with HIV. As with HIV, FIV does not appear to directly infect myeloid or erythroid precursors, and the mechanisms of marrow suppression likely involve virus, viral antigen, and/or infected accessory cells in the marrow microenvironment. Studies using in vitro experimental models are required to define the effects of each of these microenvironmental elements on haematopoietic progenitors. As little is known about the molecular mechanisms of FIV pathogenesis, additional studies of disease-inducing FIV strains are needed to identify the genotypic features that correlate with virulent phenotypic features. Finally, experimental FIV infection in cats provides the opportunity to correlate in vivo virological and haematological changes with in vitro observations in a large animal model that closely mimics HIV infection in man.","Linenberger, Michael L.; Abkowitz, Janis L.",Baillieres Clin Haematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135792/,510
10400,An invited commentary on: “Evidence based management guideline for the COVID-19 pandemic - Review article”,2020-04-21,"Background: Rotaviruses are the single most important causative agent of acute neonatal enteritis in most avian and mammalian species including humans. Rotaviruses infections have also been shown to be associated with the elderly, immunocompromised individuals and more recently with epidemic diarrheal illness in adults. Objectives: To study the incidence and the effect of seasonality on the prevalence of rotaviruses in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates. Study design: A total of 650 stool samples submitted to the laboratories of two University Teaching Hospitals (Al-Ain and Tawam) and a private hospital (Oasis) were examined for the presence of rotaviruses from January 1990–December, 1992, using a commercially available latex agglutination assay. The meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) recorded during the sampling period was analyzed statistically to examine the effect of seasonality on the prevalence of rotavirus cases in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates. Results: Rotavirus was detected in 21.4% of the samples examined. The predominant number of positive cases (35%) were in the 7–12 months age group. It was interesting to find rotavirus-positive cases in as low an age group as <3 months (3.6%) and as high as 10 years (8.04%). There was no significant difference on infection rates between male and female groups in the study. However, there was a significant difference between the national (38.18%) and non-national children (61.28%). The higher rate of the latter may be due to import of infections. There appeared to be a seasonal pattern of rotavirus occurrence in the cases studied, with a marked increase in the number of positive cases during the months when the relative humidity was low (25–45%) and there was no rainfall. Conclusions: Rotavirus was detected in all age groups with a predominance in 7–12 month age groups, and a higher incidence in non-nationals. There was a marked increase in the number of positive cases during the months when the relative humidity was low (25–45%) and there was no rainfall. These findings are discussed in relation to the epidemiology and prophylaxis of rotavirus infections.","Ijaz, M.K.; Alharbi, S.; Uduman, S.A.; Cheema, Y.; Sheek-Hussen, M.M.; Alkhair, A.R.A.; Shalabi, A.G.; Ijaz, S.S.; Bin-Othman, S.A.; Sattar, S.A.; Liddle, L.F.",Clin Diagn Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172816/,510

16382,Implementation of an ED-based bundled mechanical ventilation protocol improves adherence to lung-protective ventilation(),2020-02-25,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mind-body interventions (MBIs) have been shown to be effective individual-level interventions for mitigating physician burnout, but there are no controlled studies of yoga-based MBIs in resident physicians. We assessed the feasibility of a yoga-based MBI called RISE (resilience, integration, self-awareness, engagement) for residents among multiple specialties and academic medical centers. METHODS: We conducted a waitlist controlled randomized clinical trial of the RISE program with residents from multiple specialty departments at three academic medical centers. The RISE program consisted of six weekly sessions with suggested home practice. Feasibility was assessed across six domains: demand, implementation, practicality, acceptability, adaptation, and integration. Self-reported measures of psychological health were collected at baseline, post-program, and two-month follow-up. RESULTS: Among 2,000 residents contacted, 75 were assessed for eligibility and 56 were enrolled. Forty-four participants completed the study and were included in analysis. On average, participants attended two of six sessions. Feasibility of in-person attendance was rated as 28.9 (SD 25.6) on a 100-point visual analogue scale. Participants rated feasibility as 69.2 (SD 26.0) if the program was offered virtually. Those who received RISE reported improvements in mindfulness, stress, burnout, and physician well-being from baseline to post-program, which were sustained at two-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: This is the first controlled study of a yoga-based MBI in residents. While the program was not feasible as delivered in this pilot study, initial analyses showed improvement in multiple measures of psychological health. Residents reported that virtual delivery would increase feasibility.","Loewenthal, Julia; Dyer, Natalie L; Lipsyc-Sharf, Marla; Borden, Sara; Mehta, Darshan H; Dusek, Jeffery A; Khalsa, Sat Bir S",Glob Adv Health Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7961714/,510
16513,Centenarians in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-03-02,"Background: In October 2018, the University of Witten/Herdecke (UW/H) launched the new reformed medical education programme called Medicine 2018+. A major innovation compared to the existing model programme was the introduction of thematic focuses. A longitudinal communication skills curriculum was integrated into the new thematic focus “professional and personal development – inner work” (IAP). With the start of the new programme, the IAP curriculum has been built step-by-step over time, i.e. the first four semesters have already been implemented, the following semesters are being planned. Project description: IAP aims to provide students with patient-centred medicine. Five areas of competence were defined: Doctor-patient communication, team competence, staying healthy, my paths to becoming a doctor, medicine and society. The focus of this article is on the communication curriculum. The first year of study focusses on the training of basic communication skills. In the 2(nd) year of study, students practice these basic skills in small groups with simulated patients (SP), whereby the emphasis in the 3(rd) semester is on history taking and in the 4(th) semester is on sharing information. In the 3(rd) semester, students complete a communication station in an OSCE. From the 5(th) semester onwards, the focus of training is on the consolidation of basic and advanced communication skills, which can be applied in clinical clerkships, and the reflection of clinical experiences. Key didactic elements are, in addition to teaching the theoretical basics, experience-based small group work with and without SP, feedback and reflection. The evaluation of the summer semester 2020 showed high agreement ratings of the students regarding the overall satisfaction with the individual courses (83-100% agreement). Discussion: The introduction of IAP has been very positively received by the students. Challenges are the adequate handling of the increasing student workload when planning new courses, the implementation of a longitudinal e-portfolio as well as the recruitment and training of clinical teachers and SPs. Conclusion: As the evaluation results of the summer semester 2020 show, the first steps of implementing a longitudinal communication curriculum at UW/H have been successful. Helpful strategies were the orientation on published examples from other faculties as well as regular feedback and discussions with students and teachers in order to adapt and integrate educational considerations into the existing model programme in Witten.","Kiessling, Claudia; Mennigen, Florian; Schulte, Heike; Schwarz, Laura; Lutz, Gabriele",GMS J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7994876/,510
17040,The E/e’ Ratio—Role in Risk Stratification of Acute Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction,2021-04-13,"Non-adherence after heart transplantation (HTx) is a significant problem. The main objective of this study was to evaluate if a mHealth strategy is more effective than standard care in improving adherence and patients’ experience in heart transplant recipients. Methods: This was a single-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in adult recipients >1.5 years post-HTx. Participants were randomized to standard care (control group) or to the mHeart Strategy (intervention group). For patients randomized to the mHeart strategy, multifaceted theory-based interventions were provided during the study period to optimize therapy management using the mHeart mobile application. Patient experience regarding their medication regimens were evaluated in a face-to-face interview. Medication adherence was assessed by performing self-reported questionnaires. A composite adherence score that included the SMAQ questionnaire, the coefficient of variation of drug levels and missing visits was also reported. Results: A total of 134 HTx recipients were randomized (intervention N = 71; control N = 63). Mean follow-up was 1.6 (SD 0.6) years. Improvement in adherence from baseline was significantly higher in the intervention group versus the control group according to the SMAQ questionnaire (85% vs. 46%, OR = 6.7 (2.9; 15.8), p-value < 0.001) and the composite score (51% vs. 23%, OR = 0.3 (0.1; 0.6), p-value = 0.001). Patients’ experiences with their drug therapy including knowledge of their medication timing intakes (p-value = 0.019) and the drug indications or uses that they remembered (p-value = 0.003) significantly improved in the intervention versus the control group. Conclusions: In our study, the mHealth-based strategy significantly improved adherence and patient beliefs regarding their medication regimens among the HTx population. The mHeart mobile application was used as a feasible tool for providing long-term, tailor-made interventions to HTx recipients to improve the goals assessed.","Gomis-Pastor, Mar; Mirabet Perez, Sonia; Roig Minguell, Eulalia; Brossa Loidi, Vicenç; Lopez Lopez, Laura; Ros Abarca, Sandra; Galvez Tugas, Elisabeth; Mas-Malagarriga, Núria; Mangues Bafalluy, Mª Antonia",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070926/,510
19686,Commentary: An insight into the preferred practice of vitreoretinal specialists of India: Surgical retina,2021-06-11,"The persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is one of the leading causes of chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To explore the factors important in LSC-mediated resistance, we use mass spectrometry to screen the factors related to LSC chemoresistance and defined IFN-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) as a candidate. We found that the GILT expression was upregulated in chemoresistant CD34+ AML cells. Loss of function studies demonstrated that silencing of GILT in AML cells sensitized them to Ara-C treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic findings revealed that the ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage plays a pivotal role in inducing apoptosis of GILT-inhibited AML cells after Ara-C treatment. The inactivation of PI3K/Akt/ nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway, causing reduced generation of antioxidants such as SOD2 and leading to a shifted ratio of GSH/GSSG to the oxidized form, contributed to the over-physiological oxidative status in the absence of GILT. The prognostic value of GILT was also validated in AML patients. Taken together, our work demonstrated that the inhibition of GILT increases AML chemo-sensitivity through elevating ROS level and induce oxidative mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis, and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NRF2 pathway enhances the intracellular oxidative state by disrupting redox homeostasis, providing a potentially effective way to overcome chemoresistance of AML.","Niu, Li-Ting; Wang, Yu-Qing; Wong, Catherine C.L.; Gao, Shuai-Xin; Mo, Xiao-Dong; Huang, Xiao-Jun",Transl Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319687/,510

Thus we could say that allergic diseases have plagued mankind since the beginning of life on earth. The prophet Job was affected by a condition that following the rare symptoms described by the Holy Bible might be identified as a severe form of atopic dermatitis (AD). The earliest record of an apparently allergic reaction is 2621 B.C., when death from stinging insects was first described by hieroglyphics carved into the walls of the tomb of Pharaoh Menes depicting his death following the sting of a wasp. In 79 A.D., the death of the Roman admiral Pliny the Elder was ascribed to the SO(2)-rich gases emanating from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

32430,Dear Dermatoethicist: Web-Based Dermatology Residency Interviews in the Time of COVID-19,2020-05-12,"Sequential recommendation leverages the temporal information of users’ transactions as transition dependencies for better inferring user preference, which has become increasingly popular in academic research and practical applications. Short-term transition dependencies contain the information of partial item orders, while long-term transition dependencies infer long-range user preference, the two dependencies are mutually restrictive and complementary. Although some work investigates unifying both long-term and short-term dependencies for better performance, they still neglect the fact that short-term interactions are multi-folds, which are either individual-level interactions or union-level interactions. Existing sequential recommendations mainly focus on user’s individual (i.e., individual-level) interactions but ignore the important collective influence at union-level. Since union-level interactions can reflect that human decisions are made based on multiple items he/she has already interacted, ignoring such interactions can result in the disability of capturing the collective influence between items. To alleviate this issue, we proposed a Joint Relational Dependency learning (JRD-L) for sequential recommendation that exploits both long-term and short-term preferences at individual-level and union-level. Specifically, JRD-L combines long-term user preferences with short-term interests by measuring short-term pair relations at individual-level and union-level. Moreover, JRD-L can alleviate the sparsity problem of union-level interactions by adding more descriptive details to each item, which is carried by individual-level relations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate JRD-L outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for the sequential recommendation.","Wang, Xiangmeng; Li, Qian; Zhang, Wu; Xu, Guandong; Liu, Shaowu; Zhu, Wenhao",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206282/,510

TELEMEDICINE REVIEW IN NEURO-ONCOLOGY: COMPARATIVE EXPERIENTIAL ANALYSIS FOR BARROW NEUROLOGICAL INSTITUTE AND GEISINGER HEALTH DURING THE 2020 COVID-19 PANDEMIC,2020-11-09,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a widespread viral disease that has led to huge economic losses for the global swine industry. Non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9) of PRRSV possesses essential RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity for viral RNA replication. Our previous report showed that Nsp9-specific nanobody, Nb6, was able to inhibit PRRSV replication. In this study, recombinant Nsp9 and Nsp9-Nb6 complex were prepared then characterized using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses that demonstrated high-affinity binding of Nb6 to Nsp9 to form a homogeneous complex. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization analyses revealed that spatial interactions differed between Nsp9 and Nsp9-Nb6 complex molecular envelopes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) revealed key involvement of Nsp9 residues Ile588, Asp590, and Leu643 and Nb6 residues Tyr62, Trp105, and Pro107 in the Nsp9-Nb6 interaction. After reverse genetics-based techniques were employed to generate recombinant Nsp9 mutant viruses, virus replication efficiencies were assessed in MARC-145 cells. The results revealed impaired viral replication of recombinant viruses bearing I588A and L643A mutations as compared with replication of wild type virus, as evidenced by reduced negative-strand genomic RNA [(−) gRNA] synthesis and attenuated viral infection. Moreover, the isoleucine at position 588 of Nsp9 was conserved across PRRSV genotypes. In conclusion, structural analysis of the Nsp9-Nb6 complex revealed novel amino acid interactions involved in viral RNA replication that will be useful for guiding development of structure-based anti-PRRSV agents.","Wang, Yan; Li, Rui; Qiao, Songlin; Wang, Jiaxi; Liu, Hongliang; Li, Zhijun; Ma, Hongfang; Yang, Lei; Ruan, Haiyu; Weng, Maoyang; Hiscox, Julian A.; Stewart, James P.; Nan, Yuchen; Zhang, Gaiping; Zhou, En-Min",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7688669/,510

The scale of environmental crimes and aggression towards indigenous peoples and people of African-descendent has been a characteristic of the Bolsonaro administration in the Amazon region. As cases of COVID-19 rise daily in remote areas of the Amazon, a recent study indicates that indigenous lands that aren’t formally demarcated are more vulnerable to intrusion and hence disease: indeed illegal loggers have emerged as a key vector of Covid-19 transmission in a region with Brazil’s lowest number of intensive care units. The weakening of environmental protection in the Amazon has been systematic and a feature of the Brazilian shift from neo-liberalism to neo-developmentalism which can be characterised politically as neo-liberal authoritarianism. If Covid-19 also is now becoming a metaphor for the poisonous spread of neo-liberal globalisation, plunder and land grabs in the Brazilian rainforest can be seen to represent the most egregious of many egregious cases on the ground zero of neo-liberalism unchained. With the rise of Bolsonaro, we can see that the previous conjuncture characterised by the hegemony of PT and Lula was the exception to Brazil’s long embrace of the caudillo going back to the 1930s. Even then, a look at the mechanism of Lula’s rule raises questions as to precisely what changed under Lula when it came to the state and the rule of big capital.","Stewart, Paul; Garvey, Brain; Torres, Mauricio; Borges de Farias, Thais",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7689255/,510

ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS 19 PANDEMIC ON NEURO-ONCOLOGY AT GUY’S CANCER CENTRE LONDON,2020-11-09,"Transmitting a substantial amount of basic knowledge in Rheumatology to all medical students is essential for the future medical care of patients with rheumatic diseases for two reasons: on the one hand, future general practitioners will need to master the patterns of rheumatic diseases to recognize them fast enough in new-onset patients and to refer them in time and directly to rheumatologists. On the other hand, the shortage of rheumatologists can only then be relieved in the future when we are able to inspire enthusiasm for our specialty. Adequate rheumatological structures are established only in some of the German faculties of medicine. Structural improvements happen in small steps only but were achieved at several sites. The better the local structures, the higher the chances of committed university teachers in rheumatology to reach all medical students. Probably from 2026 onwards, the learning objectives relevant for examinations will be defined by the national competence-based catalogue of learning objectives in medicine (NKLM), which is currently in the final stages of completion together with the German Federal Institute for Medical and Pharmaceutical Examinations (IMPP). It now appears that systemic autoimmune diseases and inflammatory rheumatic diseases are adequately depicted in this catalogue. If this is achieved, students will know more about these diseases in the future and will diagnose them faster in patients. Work on the NKLM is therefore of highest importance. In addition to the work on the learning objectives, up to date learning materials are required, which have to be available throughout Germany. A Rheumatology script just finished by the committee for medical student education of the German Society of Rheumatology (DGRh) and now available on the DGRh homepage should close this gap.","Aringer, M.; Baerwald, C.; Bergner, R.; Feuchtenberger, M.; Gebhardt, C.; Hagen, M.; Keyßer, G.; Lorenz, H.-M.; Witte, T.",Z Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709903/,510

Several studies have assessed these impacts, showing among others that medical journals have strongly accelerated their review processes for Covid-19-related content. This has raised questions and concerns regarding the quality of the review process and the standards to which manuscripts are held for publication. To address these questions, this study sets out to assess qualitative differences in review reports and editorial decision letters for Covid-19 related, articles not related to Covid-19 published during the 2020 pandemic, and articles published before the pandemic. It employs the open peer-review model at the British Medical Journal and eLife to study the content of review reports, editorial decisions, author responses, and open reader comments. It finds no clear differences between the review processes of articles not related to Covid-19 published during or before the pandemic. However, it does find notable diversity between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19-related articles, including fewer requests for additional experiments, more cooperative comments, and different suggestions to address too strong claims.

Based on an improved gravity model, the population inflow numbers for each city from 10 January to 23 February are estimated. A correlation analysis is done to reveal the impact of population inflow on the number of infected people in the 14 days after 23 January, the day Wuhan was locked down. The results show that: (i) the population outflow from Wuhan was mostly distributed between Xiaogan, Huanggang, Ezhou and Huangshi in Hubei Province; (ii) the number of accumulated confirmed patients is closely associated with inflows from Wuhan, which displayed by correlation coefficient 1 with a mean of 0.88 and a maximum of 0.93. Meanwhile, there is a weak correlation between the number of people that came from cities except Wuhan and accumulated confirmed patients, which indicated by correlation coefficient 2 with a mean of 0.65 and a maximum of 0.75; and (iii) the total population inflow is a greater predictor of epidemic spread than the population inflow from Wuhan.","Chen, Qun; Yan, Jiao; Huang, Helai; Zhang, Xi",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928662/,510

The processing of pre-existing airborne TEM data has been performed with the state-of-the-art methodologies. In this respect, (1) the minimum possible gate-dependent lateral stacking between adjacent soundings has been performed for the preparation of the data; (2) a 1D nonlinear forward modelling has been used for the inversion of the stacked data; (3) even if the forward modelling was 1D, the data have been inverted by spatially constraining the adjacent models (in a pseudo-2/3D fashion). We adopted an iterative approach in which the processing and inversion parameters, and the type of stabilizer utilized, have been decided after an a-posteriori analysis. Hence, after every inversion, the results have been discussed with the geologists (1) to assess, at least qualitatively, the uncertainty of the solution features and (2) to, as much as possible, include prior geological knowledge into the geophysical analysis. The new geophysical insights detected geological features that might be interpreted as glacial paleovalleys. If confirmed, those structures can have a significant impact in terms of their socio-economic relevance (i.e. as groundwater reservoirs); as well as from a scientific point of view (as they would require rethinking the stratigraphy of the area). In addition, these kind of Sturtian glacial evidences in West Africa could support the Snowball Earth hypothesis.","Vignoli, Giulio; Dzikunoo, Elikplim Abla; Jørgensen, Flemming; Yidana, Sandow Mark; Banoeng-Yakubo, Bruce; Bai, Peng",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974240/,510

We consider the compounded challenges faced by marginalized communities in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and we follow this with reflections on the triumphs and tensions of emergent engagement practices. We then describe four exercises that we conducted before the onset of the pandemic in a research project exploring public engagement from the ground up in relation to policy-making, and we suggest how the lessons learned may be applied to contemporary decision making. Our overall goal is to illustrate how and why community engagement is particularly pressing in the current crisis, as pandemic restrictions have added new dimensions to long-standing practices of containment. We argue that although these most recent forms of engagement are contested and complex, they are essential to ensuring that policy-making is built on processes of equity, access, and inclusion.","Cattapan, Alana; Acker-Verney, Julianne M.; Dobrowolsky, Alexandra; Findlay, Tammy; Mandrona, April",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8091648/,510

53228,333 Management of Distal Radius Fractures During The COVID-19 Crisis,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims There is a need for accessible rheumatic patient education . Podcasts can be accessed globally, are simple and cheap to produce and enable access by patients who may have reading difficulties. They also allow local patients to connect personally with their rheumatology department staff. Hospital radio departments offer access to high quality recording equipment and often have spare capacity to facilitate recordings Methods RadioRheumatology podcasts are recorded by our rheumatology clinical team with technical support from RadioFrimleyPark volunteers.Hospital radio departments are often under-utilised and have enthusiastic volunteers. The podcasts are uploaded to our podcast hosting website Buzzsprout (accessible at www.rheumatology.buzzsprout.com) and then propagated to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Android Podcasts and other podcasts sites. Listeners can find our episodes via social media platforms or by searching their podcast provider of choice. We offer a 'QR' link to the podcasts for our patients in clinic and can send the link in a letter or email. In the last 11 months we have recorded podcasts on 'Steroids in Rheumatology', 'Methotrexate Overview' 'Early Inflammatory Arthritis' and 'Rheumatoid Arthritis'. Results RadioRheumatology has been received well both locally and internationally with listeners in 62 different countries. Statistical data is sent from the podcast website on a monthly basis including 'top episodes', 'top apps', listener locations and devices used (to listen to the podcasts): The 'Methotrexate' episode has been the most popular to date and has had over 550 listeners at the time of writing.The United Kingdom has had the most 'listens' (570) followed by The United States (428). We have had listeners as far afield as New Zealand and Malaysia. Within the UK Islington,had the most listens (105), followed by Blackheath (91) Apple iPhone is the most commonly used device used to access (with 694 listens). Feedback so far has been positive.We have have had 5 star reviews and positive feedback from both patients and healthcare professionals. 5* review: A very easy to understand guide to RA: “Fantastic podcast which really explains rheumatoid arthritis but more importantly the help and support available to patients. As a Biologic Specialist Nurse I will certainly be directing my patients and families to this podcast to help them manage their conditions effectively"" Conclusion Podcasts can be an effective and cost-effective way to deliver patient education They enable both local and wider patient contact. Podcasts are an increasingly popular medium, particularly since the advent of COVID-19; listener number feedback and reviews enable us to assess the popularity of our episodes and tailor future podcasts accordingly. Hospital radio volunteers have been central to the success of this project by offering their time and championing the use of hospital radio to support clinical teams in delivering patient education.

53250,258 Increase in Cycling Injuries During COVID-19: Unintended Consequences of Lockdown Restrictions in The United Kingdom,2021-05-04,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. PURPOSE AND METHODS: The Covid-19 pandemic has led to an increase in demand for Critical Patient Care Units. For this reason, level III Coronary Units have become a very valuable resource in the care of seriously ill patients, especially those due to covid. Level II Coronary Units could have assumed a greater number of acute heart patients, especially coronary, during the pandemic in hospitals that have coronary units of different levels. Our objective has been to compare the profile of patients who have been admitted to our level II Coronary Unit, retrospectively analyzing and comparing the demographic data and the reason for admission of the patients who were admitted between March and November 2019 (group I) with those who did so between the same months of 2020 (group II). RESULTS: Group I patients were 518 patients compared to 625 in group II. There was no difference between the age of the patients admitted (65.2 + 13 vs 65.1 + 13.8 years old). In the covid period, there were no significant differences between the classic risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidemia. There was a higher percentage of smoking among the patients. During the pandemic, the patients admitted had significantly less history of previous heart disease (40.2% vs 78%). There has been a significant increase in admissions for acute ischemic heart disease in our unit (60% vs 13.8% the previous year), at the expense of Acute coronary syndrome with ST elevation (STEMI), with a downward trend in pathologies such as arrhythmias (13.5% in 2020 vs 20.6% in 2019) and acute heart failure (11.1% in 2020 vs 12.1% in 2019). The average length of stay during the Covid-19 period was significantly shorter, 2.7 days, compared to 3.3 days in the 2019 period, at the expense of a higher turnover rate in the Unit (79.42 vs 74, 09). During the covid period, there were 36.67% more discharge. CONCLUSIONS: During the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant increase in acute ischemic heart disease (STEMI) has been observed in our level II Coronary unit, which is responsible for the greater number of discharges and the decrease in our average length of stay. This has allowed level III Coronary Units the ability to assume the excess of patients in need of intensive care that has been significantly increased by the Covid-19 pandemic","Campos Pareja, AM; Garcia Riesco, L; Frutos Lopez, M; Nevado Portero, J; Villa Gil Ortega, M",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135379/,510
53275,786 Retrospective analysis of paediatric ENT surgery outcomes during the COVID pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 120,000 UK deaths. Those with chronic inflammatory conditions or receiving immunosuppressive medications are at higher risk of COVID-19 than the general population. As a result, rheumatology patients taking b- or ts-DMARDs were advised to shield. We planned to observe COVID-19 related symptoms and anxiety levels reported by rheumatology patients during the pandemic. Methods From April 2020, 1,004 rheumatology patients from an advanced therapy database were invited to participate in the adult ImmunoCOVID study to collect daily symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath (SOB), sore throat, blocked nose, red-eye, headache, fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, chills, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting, loss of senses) and anxiety level using an online portal. Loss of senses were not recorded until week 7 as these were not officially recognized at the pandemic onset. Results 153 patients (rheumatoid arthritis, n = 75, psoriatic arthritis, n = 28, Axial spondyloarthropathy, n = 24, systemic lupus erythematosus, n = 2 and other connective tissue diseases, n = 24) consented and participated. By week 25, 142 patients remained. Among those, 36.57% (±6.09%) (average (±SD)) reported no symptoms over the 25 week period. The main symptoms reported were joint pain (mean=47.94%) followed by fatigue (27.17%). Few patients reported fever (0.94%), cough (8.34%), SOB (4.53%), or loss of senses (1.11%) with more symptoms reported during the first 8 weeks (April/May 2020) and another increase in September/October 2020. The anxiety score (pragmatic 10-point scale) mean (±SD) was 5.60 (±0.34) and remained elevated throughout the study though higher when lockdown began. Conclusion During the first peak of SARS-CoV-2, the number of patients reporting COVID-19 symptoms appeared high and was associated with high levels of anxiety. As only a small number have been swab-tested, this may suggest that larger numbers of untested individuals have had COVID-19 with mild symptoms. Features of inflammatory rheumatic illnesses may mimic COVID-19 symptoms and create diagnostic difficulty (joint pain and fatigue) whilst anxiety may lead to over-reporting of symptoms in the absence of infection. The key symptoms of fever, cough and SOB were less common and may be most reliable. Disclosure M. Lwin: None. C. Holroyd: None. D. Wallis: None. S. Faust: None. H. De Graaf: None. C.J.

53297,398 Theatre Waste Management and the Impact of COVID-19,2021-05-04,"Importance: Well-controlled glucose levels during hospitalization (i.e. 70–180 mg/dl) have been associated with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19. The recent addition of dexamethasone to COVID-19 treatment protocols has raised concerns about the negative metabolic consequences of dexamethasone including hyperglycemia. We developed a simplified, yet comprehensive, protocol to guide the management of dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objectives: To present our protocol for the management of dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia and examine its clinical effectiveness in the real world. Methods: An algorithm-based protocol that outlines all aspects of the inpatient management of dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients, from time of admission to discharge including guidance on insulin titration, was disseminated to the COVID-19 teams in our hospital. Medical records of 163 patients admitted between June and September, 2020 who tested positive for COVID-19 and developed dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia were reviewed. Fasting, pre-lunch, pre-dinner and bedtime glucose levels during the first five days of admission and day of discharge were compared between the 47 patients who were managed “Pre-Protocol” implementation and the 116 patients who were managed “Post-Protocol” implementation. Results: On admission, there were no significant differences in age, proportion of women, BMI, prevalence of diabetes, and Charlson score between the “Pre-Protocol” and “Post-Protocol” groups (56 vs 56 years old, 30 vs 32% women, 28 vs 29 kg/m(2), 45 vs 35% with diabetes, and 2 vs 2 median Charlson scores; respectively, all p>0.05). The “Post-Protocol” group had higher proportions of patients with well-controlled glucose (i.e. 70–180 mg/dL) compared to the “Pre-Protocol” group, across all pre-meals and bedtime glucose readings throughout the hospital stay. The differences between the “Post-Protocol” and “Pre-Protocol” groups were statistically significant (p<0.05) for fasting glucose on day 4, 5, and discharge day; pre-lunch glucose on discharge day; pre-dinner glucose on day 3, 5, and discharge day; and bedtime glucose on day 1. In regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, nationality, BMI, Charlson score, and diabetes status, the odds ratios of having well-controlled glucose were significantly higher in the “Post-Protocol” group versus the “Pre-Protocol” group for fasting glucose on day 4, 5, and on discharge; pre-lunch glucose on day 5 and on discharge day; pre-dinner glucose on day 3 and 5; and bedtime glucose on day 1. Conclusion: The implementation of a simplified protocol for the management of dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 results in more patients achieving well-controlled glucose levels that have been previously associated with lower mortality of COVID-19.","Asiri, Alanood Ahmed; AlGuwaihes, Abdullah; Jammah, Anwar Ali; Alfadda, Assim Abdulaziz; Al-Sofiani, Mohammed E",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135499/,510
53470,Reply to the Letter to the Editor “Pathogenesis of pneumoperitoneum in COVID-19 patients”(),2021-05-24,"INTRODUCTION: Surgical Ambulatory Units have emerged to refine the management of unscheduled care with the aim of reducing admissions and offering timely, accurate treatment strategies. There are 12 principles which underpin an efficient ambulatory Service, one of which is to have a 'Consultant led and delivered Service'. Consequent to the COVID Pandemic we reallocated Consultants to our Ambulatory Service and reviewed the impact of this initiative. METHOD: Two periods - Pre COVID 6-17/1/20 and Post COVID 27/4 -10/5/20 were compared with respect to volume, case mix, procedures performed and outcomes in terms of investigations, and completed episodes. Data was retrieved from case notes and electronic databases. RESULTS: There were no demographic differences across the groups. The case mix and referral patterns were similar as was the volume. There were no differences in procedures or investigations ordered. In the Pre COVID group 20% of sessions were Consultant led compared with 100% in the Post COVID group. In the post COVID group 64% of cases were completed on the index attendance compared with 27% in the pre COVID group. CONCLUSIONS: A Consultant presence in SAmS enhances decision making and risk management and is critical for the efficacy of the Service with respect to patient flow and resource management.","Clements, J; Olukoga, T; Clements, B",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135906/,510
53856,A sociology of anxiety: Western modern legacy and the Covid-19 outbreak,2021-06-03,"Given the tremendous growth of factor allocation strategies in active and passive fund management, we investigate whether factor or sector asset allocation strategies provide investors with a superior performance. Our focus is on comparing factor versus sector allocations as some recent empirical evidence indicates the dominance of sector over country portfolios. We analyze the performance and performance differences of sector and factor portfolios for various weighting and portfolio optimization approaches, including “equal-weighting” (1/N), “risk parity,” minimum-variance, mean-variance, Bayes–Stein and Black–Litterman. We employ a sample-based approach in which the sample moments are the input parameters for the allocation model. For the period from May 2007 to November 2020, our results clearly reveal that, over longer investment horizons, factor portfolios provide relative superior performances. For shorter periods, however, we observe time-varying and alternating performance dominances as the relative advantage of one over the other strategy depends on the economic cycle. One important insight is that during “normal” times factor portfolios clearly dominate sector portfolios, whereas during crisis periods sector portfolios are superior offering better diversification opportunities.

54757,A review on COVID-19 for medical students,2021-05-29,"The aim of this paper is to explore the importance of health satisfaction with a particular emphasis on how leisure-time spent in parks determines the overall well-being, including the health satisfaction among the park visitors. Our data have been collected from park visitors in four major public parks in urban Pakistan based on a multistage non-random sampling technique. The results from the regression analysis suggest that besides socio-economic characteristics like being well-educated and richer; the amount of weekly leisure-time spent in park plays a positive and significant role in well-being. In particular, health satisfaction mediates the relationship between the amount of weekly leisure-time spent in park and subjective well-being among the park visitors in the study area. Policy makers should hence put more emphasis on park facilitation to encourage park visitation to ensure greater happiness and better quality of life particularly in terms of health satisfaction.

All patients were treated with Jinkui Shenqi pills. All patients were first detected by color Doppler ultrasound and then by SMI. The results of color Doppler ultrasound were used as the control group, while those of color Doppler ultrasound combined with SMI were used as the experimental group. After that, the specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative detection results, and detection accuracy were compared between the two groups. The specificity and sensitivity in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The cases of positive and negative detection results in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The detection accuracy in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative detection results, and detection accuracy of color Doppler ultrasound combined with SMI in the detection of small renal tumors less than 3 cm treated with Jinkui Shenqi pills were all significantly higher than those of color Doppler ultrasound; therefore, the application of color Doppler ultrasound combined with SMI for the diagnosis of small renal tumors is of high value.","Gong, Yuping; Li, Shuhui",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8433002/,510

However, limited studies have addressed the involvement of interdisciplinarity into architectural undergraduate curricula. The study seeks to expand the literature on this topic, namely by offering an alternative model for teaching an Interdisciplinary Design Course (IDC), mainly in architectural engineering departments, with the participation of engineering departments. The authors hypothesize that by the adoption of the IDC, architecture students would have a better understanding of the nature of AEC interdisciplinary design knowledge. The study aims to highlight the value of the IDC and to test the hypothesis. A qualitative research methodology has been adopted, including the design of an experiment and then the application of a case study comprising four instructors and 24 students from four departments in the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University. Students’ design process, teamwork attitude, and own experiences on the IDC have been recorded using direct observation, interviews, and surveys. Data have been analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify the effectiveness and challenges of the experiment, in addition to the comparison with the traditional design studio. The results have shown the students’ satisfaction with collaboration with their peers from other disciplines, as it boosted their understanding of the integrated design process and increased their knowledge about each other’s discipline.

Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of self-management interventions for improving health-related outcomes of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) and identify the components that are most effective, particularly in low-resource settings with a high HIV burden. METHODS We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, non-randomised controlled trials (non-RCTs) and controlled before-after (CBA) studies. We did a comprehensive search up to 1 August 2019. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We synthesised results in a meta-analysis where studies were sufficiently homogenous. In case of substantial heterogeneity, we synthesised results narratively. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE and presented our findings as summaries in tabulated form. RESULTS We included 14 studies, comprising 12 RCTs and two non-RCTs. Most studies were conducted in the United States, one in Thailand and four in Africa. Interventions were diverse, addressing a variety of self-management domains and including a combination of individual, group, face-to-face, cell phone or information communication technology mediated approaches. Delivery agents varied from trained counsellors to healthcare workers and peers. Self-management interventions compared to usual care for ALHIV made little to no difference to most health-related outcomes, but the evidence is very uncertain. Self-management interventions may increase adherence and decrease HIV viral load, but the evidence is very uncertain. We could not identify any particular components of interventions that were more effective for improving certain outcomes. CONCLUSION Existing evidence on the effectiveness of self-management interventions for improving health-related outcomes of ALHIV is very uncertain. Self-management interventions for ALHIV should take into account the individual, social and health system contexts. Intervention components need to be aligned to the desired outcomes.

61751,"Critical Organizational Issues for Cardiologists in the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Frontline Experience From Milan, Italy.",2020-03-24,"BACKGROUND We examined whether COVID-19 could exert inequalities in socioeconomic conditions and health in Hong Kong, where there has been a relatively low COVID-19 incidence. METHODS 752 adult respondents from a previous random sample participated in a telephone survey from 20 April to 11 May 2020. We examined demographic and socioeconomic factors, worry of COVID-19, general health, economic activity, and personal protective equipment (PPE) and related hygiene practice by deprivation status. The associations between deprivation and negative COVID-19 related issues were analysed using binary logistic regressions, while the associations of these issues with health were analysed using linear regressions. Path analysis was conducted to determine the direct effect of deprivation, and the indirect effects via COVID-19 related issues, on health. Interactions between deprivation and the mediators were also tested. RESULTS Deprived individuals were more likely to have job loss/instability, less reserves, less utilisation and more concerns of PPE. After adjustments for potential confounders, being deprived was associated with having greater risk of low reserve of face masks, being worried about the disease and job loss/instability. Being deprived had worse physical (β=-0.154, p<0.001) and mental health (β=-0.211, p<0.001) and had an indirect effect on mental health via worry and job loss/instability (total indirect effect: β=-0.027, p=0.017; proportion being mediated=11.46%). In addition, significant interaction between deprivation and change of economic activity status was observed on mental health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION Even if the COVID-19 incidence was relatively low, part of the observed health inequality can be explained by people's concerns over livelihood and economic activity, which were affected by the containment measures. We should look beyond the incidence to address COVID-19 related health inequalities.","Chung, Roger Yat-Nork; Chung, Gary Ka-Ki; Marmot, Michael; Allen, Jessica; Chan, Dicken; Goldblatt, Peter; Wong, Hung; Lai, Eric; Woo, Jean; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong; Wong, Samuel Y S",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402396/,510
62082,Trends in COVID-19 Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates.,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND Physicians are at higher risk for burnout than workers in other fields. Burnout negatively impacts physician health, care delivery and healthcare cost. Existing studies quantify the workforce affected by burnout whilst qualitative studies use specific specialty groups limiting generalisability of solutions. This is important given increased stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE The study aimed to understand the causes of work-related burnout, identify what supportive resources physicians utilise, and to propose solutions. METHODS A questionnaire was circulated between March and May 2019 via the 'Doctors' Association UK' website and social media. RESULTS 721 responses were received. 94%of respondents worked in the NHS, with over half being either general practitioners (GPs) or consultants. One in two (53%) respondents felt unable to raise workplace concerns regarding wellbeing, stress or workload. Almost all respondents (97%) felt the NHS has a culture of viewing excessive stress and workload as the norm. Three themes emerged from qualitative analysis: negative workplace culture; high workload and lack of resources; and generational change. CONCLUSIONS Respondents described system-level factors which negatively impacted their wellbeing whilst organisations focused on physician-level factors. The research literature supports multi-level change beyond the individual tackling work unit and organisational factors. These include providing infrastructure to allow delegation of administrative work and physical space for relaxation and flexible work with time for leave. At a national level, there is greater urgency for an increase in healthcare funding and resourcing especially during increased clinician workloads during a pandemic where burnout rates will increase.","Dominic, Catherine; Gopal, Dipesh P; Sidhu, Amandip",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633337/,510

Our goal was to assess patients' perspectives regarding medication modifications and deviations from planned uses during the height of the pandemic. METHODS Adult patients of 13 rheumatologists at an academic center with physician-diagnosed rheumatic disease and prescribed disease modifying medications were interviewed by telephone and asked open-ended questions about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on their medications. Responses were analyzed with content and thematic analyses to generate categories that described patterns of medication modification. RESULTS 112 patients (mean age 50, 86% women, 34% non-white race or Latino ethnicity) with diverse diagnoses (30% lupus, 26% rheumatoid arthritis, 44% other), taking various medications were enrolled. Patients reported clinically-relevant issues that were iteratively reviewed to generate unique categories of medication modification: medications and increased or decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; role of hydroxychloroquine; maintaining medication status quo; role of glucocorticoids; increasing or decreasing existing medications in relation to clinical disease activity; postponing infusions; and medication plan if infected by SARS-CoV-2. Some modifications were suboptimal for disease control, but were made to mitigate infection risk and to minimize potential harm when patients were unable to obtain laboratory tests and physical examinations due to cessation of in-person office visits. CONCLUSION During the height of the pandemic, substantial medication modifications were made that, in some cases, were temporizing measures and deviations from planned regimens. Future studies will assess short- and long-term sequelae of these medication modifications.","Mancuso, Carol A; Duculan, Roland; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Barbhaiya, Medha; Bass, Anne R; Mandl, Lisa A; Mehta, Bella",Arthritis care & research,https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.24489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085850/,510
63915,Timing of Acute Stroke in COVID-19-A Health System Registry Study.,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting involves the creation of a low-resistance channel between the portal vein (PV) and the hepatic vein (HV), and is routinely performed under angiography. The aims were to evaluate (1) safety and technical feasibility; (2) procedural duration; and (3) subjective workload assessment of EUS-guided intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (EIPS). METHODS Five Yorkshire pigs were used in the study. The HV or inferior vena cava (IVC) was identified using a linear-array echoendoscope and accessed with a 19-G FNA needle preloaded with a digital pressure wire. Mean pressure was recorded. The needle was advanced into the PV, where pressure measurements were again taken, and ultimately exchanged over a guidewire. A lumen-apposing metal stent was deployed under EUS and fluoroscopic guidance, with distal and proximal ends positioned inside the PV and HV (IVC), respectively. Dilation was performed, and pressure measurements repeated. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index (TLI) was scored. Animals survived 2 weeks before necropsy. RESULTS EIPS was successful in 5 out of 5 pigs. Mean time required for EUS identification, needle access, pressure measurement, and stent placement was 43 (31-55) minutes. NASA TLI scores revealed moderate workload. Mean baseline pressure measurements were PV 7.0 (5-9) and HV/IVC 5.0 (3-7) mm Hg and PV 6.3 (5-7) and HV/IVC 6.0 (4-7) mm Hg after. All animals survived 2 weeks. No bleeding was seen on necropsy. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of EIPS using LAMS, with direct portal pressure measurement, in a survival model. In addition, the procedure was performed quickly with moderate technical demand.","Schulman, Allison R; Ryou, Marvin; Aihara, Hiro; Abidi, Wasif; Chiang, Austin; Jirapinyo, Pichamol; Sakr, Ayman; Ajeje, Eduarda; Ryan, Michele B; Thompson, Christopher C",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2016.07.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27468858/,510

A previously healthy 20-year-old man presented with leg and facial swelling. Laboratory investigation revealed nephrotic range proteinuria, acute kidney injury, hypocomplementaemia and a highly positive rapid plasma reagin. Kidney biopsy showed membranous nephropathy with 'full-house' immunofluorescence (IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q and C3), mimicking lupus nephritis class Vb. However, the patient had no features of SLE and had negative antinuclear and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. He was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil for lupus nephritis and with penicillin for syphilis. After 2 months of therapy, his proteinuria resolved, and his renal function and C4 level normalised. This case illustrates that syphilis infection can be a mimicker of lupus nephritis. A literature review suggests that ful-house nephropathy may occur independently of lupus nephritis and may or may not develop into SLE.","Scaperotti, Moira Marie; Kwon, DongHyang; Kallakury, Bhaskar V; Steen, Virginia",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-244466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413046/,510

64350,"Reader Comment Regarding ""Approach to Chilblains During the COVID-19 Pandemic"".",2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND Pneumonia is among the leading causes of illness and death in children <5 years of age worldwide. There is little information on the viral etiology of severe pneumonia in low-income countries, where the disease burden is particularly high. METHODS We analyzed nasopharyngeal aspirates from 629 children 2 to 35 months of age meeting World Health Organization criteria for severe pneumonia and presenting at Kanti Children's Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal, from January 2006 through June 2008. We examined one specimen from each child for 7 respiratory viruses using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS We detected one or more respiratory viruses in 188 (30%; confidence interval: 26.4%-33.7%) of the 627 specimens with a valid polymerase chain reaction result, of which 88 (14%) yielded respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 28 (4.5%) influenza A, 24 (5.8%) parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3, 23 (3.7%) PIV type 1, 17 (2.7%) influenza B, 9 (1.4%) human metapneumovirus, and 5 (0.8%) PIV type 2. Episodes of severe pneumonia occurred in an epidemic pattern with 2 main annual peaks, the viral infections contributing importantly to these epidemics. The largest peaks of severe pneumonia coincided with peaks of RSV infection, which occurred during the last part of the monsoon season and in winter. CONCLUSIONS RSV was the dominant respiratory viral pathogen detected in young Nepalese children hospitalized with severe pneumonia.","Mathisen, Maria; Basnet, Sudha; Sharma, Arun; Shrestha, Prakash S; Sharma, Biswa N; Valentiner-Branth, Palle; Sommerfelt, Halvor; Strand, Tor A",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31822f845f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21860338/,510

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate AVCA after TAVI and SAVR. METHODS AND RESULTS Among 50 patients undergoing TAVI and 25 patients undergoing SAVR a continuous 7-day Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded after the procedure. ECGs during TAVI and 12-lead ECGs before and 1 and 7 days after TAVI and SAVR were analyzed. At baseline, TAVI patients were older (mean 82.1 vs 75.4, P < 0.001), had a longer PR interval (median 200 milliseconds vs 175 milliseconds, P = 0.004) and broader QRS width (median 100 milliseconds vs 80 milliseconds, P = 0.007) than SAVR patients. New AVCA were observed among 29 TAVI patients (58%), mostly new left bundle branch block (76%). Predilatation induced new AVCA in 14 TAVI patients (28%). New AVCA resolved within 24 hours in 15 TAVI patients (30%), and persisted in 14 TAVI (28%) and 3 SAVR patients (12%, P = 0.12). Among patients with persistent QRS width <120 milliseconds during the first 24 hours after TAVI, QRS width remained stable during the remainder of the observation period. During Holter monitoring complete AV block was observed in 4 TAVI patients (8%) and 3 SAVR patients (12%; P = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS Almost half of AVCA during TAVI are induced by predilatation, but half of them resolve within 24 hours. Persistent AVCA are more frequently observed after TAVI than SAVR. If QRS width is below 120 milliseconds the first day after TAVI, the risk of late AVCA seems low.","Roten, Laurent; Stortecky, Stefan; Scarcia, Flavio; Kadner, Alexander; Tanner, Hildegard; Delacrétaz, Etienne; Meier, Bernhard; Windecker, Stephan; Carrel, Thierry; Wenaweser, Peter",Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-8167.2012.02354.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22587564/,510
65003,The economic and psychological impact of cancellations of elective spinal surgeries in the COVID-19 era.,2021-01-18,"INTRODUCTION Dual antiplatelet therapy, aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, is recommended to prevent thrombotic complications of acute coronary syndrome. Clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid combination is the most commonly used dual antiplatelet therapy recommended by international guidelines and in Chinese clinical practice. Poor adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy or premature interruption of dual antiplatelet therapy is an important contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lethal cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid fixed-dose combination enhances adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy. Herein, we aimed to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel in fixed-dose combination compared with simultaneous administration of their individual formulations in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. METHODS This was a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-sequence, three-period, two-treatment, crossover study with a washout period of 10 days conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive Co-Plavix® (test formulation- fixed-dose combination of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) once and reference formulations (coadministration of individual formulations of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) twice during the study period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed for acetylsalicylic acid, its metabolite salicylic acid, clopidogrel, and its metabolite SR26334. As acetylsalicylic acid shows high intrasubject variability, the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) approach was implemented for acetylsalicylic acid analysis, while bioequivalence of clopidogrel was assessed using the average bioequivalence method. Point ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC, AUClast, and Cmax for acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were calculated. RESULTS In total, 171 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomized and 170 subjects were treated with test or reference formulation; 164 subjects completed the study. Regarding acetylsalicylic acid exposure, as reference within-subject standard deviation (SDW) was at least 0.294 for acetylsalicylic acid Cmax, AUClast, and AUC, the RSABE analysis method was used to assess bioequivalence for all three parameters. The point estimates were within the 0.80-1.25 range (1.19, 1.09, and 1.04, respectively), and upper one-sided 95% CIs of scaled average bioequivalence metric were at most 0 (- 0.30, - 0.14, and - 0.10, respectively). Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated with acetylsalicylic acid. Bioequivalence was also achieved with clopidogrel as the 90% CIs for geometric mean ratios of clopidogrel Cmax, AUClast, and AUC were within the bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25). CONCLUSION Application of the reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid in Chinese male and female healthy volunteers under fasting conditions demonstrated bioequivalence of test and reference formulations.

65102,COVID-19 outbreak impact on neonatal emergency transport.,2020-06-23,"PURPOSE An incisional hernia may occur through the incision area following a surgical operation, through the trocar opening and even through drainage exit points. Various synthetic surgical meshes have recently been used for the surgical repair of incisional hernias. In this study, we analysed the burst strength forces of heavyweight mesh and lightweight mesh in an incisional animal model. METHODS Following experimental formation of incisional hernias in 32 Wistar albino rats, they were divided into four groups. Polypropylene suture was used for closure of the abdominal incision in Group 1. In Groups 2, 3 and 4, polyester, polypropylene + polyglactin and polypropylene meshes, respectively, were fixed on the surface of the fascia after closing the defects in the rats. Polypropylene and polyester meshes are classified as heavy mesh. Light mesh is composed of a non-absorbable part (polypropylene) and an absorbable part (polyglactin), which will disappear 80 days after implantation. The rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. The pullout force of the fascia and meshes were recorded by use of a digital tension meter. RESULTS The mean pullout forces for Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were found to be 123.4 +/- 13.3, 292.33 +/- 17.4, 281.66 +/- 16.3 and 310.60 +/- 26.1 N, respectively. CONCLUSION At the end of the experiment, the polypropylene (25 g/cm(2)) present in the lightweight mesh was found to lose only a small percentage of the burst strength compared to the polypropylene (85 g/cm(2)) present in the heavyweight mesh.","Muftuoglu, M A T; Gungor, O; Odabasi, M; Ekinci, O; Teyyareci, A; Sekmen, U; Saglam, A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-010-0647-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20229105/,510

METHOD A detailed search in eight databases sought studies that: (1) included participants aged 0 to 18 years with neurodisability and drooling; (2) provided behavioural interventions targeting drooling or a drooling-related behaviour; and (3) used experimental designs. Two reviewers extracted data from full-text papers independently. Results were tabulated for comparison. The Risk of Bias assessment in N-of-1 Trials scale for single case experimental designs (SCEDs) and the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were applied. RESULTS Of an initial yield of 763, seven SCEDs and one RCT were included. Behavioural interventions included the use of reinforcement, prompting, self-management, instruction, extinction, overcorrection, and fading. Each assessed body functions or structures' outcomes (drooling frequency and severity); three included activity outcomes (mouth drying, head control, eye contact, and vocalizations) and none assessed participation or quality of life. While each study reported positive effects of intervention, risk of bias was high. INTERPRETATION Low-level evidence suggests behavioural interventions may be useful for treatment of drooling in children with neurodisability. Well-designed intervention studies are urgently needed to determine effectiveness. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS Behavioural interventions used to treat drooling included reinforcement, prompting, self-management, extinction, overcorrection, instruction, and fading. Interventions targeted body structures and function-level outcomes and activity-level outcomes.

67405,Parenting Stress During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Factors and Implications for Children Emotion Regulation.,2020-09-28,"Bovine Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 (BPI3V) infections are often asymptomatic, causing respiratory tissue damage and immunosuppression, predisposing animals to severe bacterial pneumonia, the leading cause of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) mortality. As with many pathogens, routine BPI3V serology does not indicate the presence of damaged respiratory tissue or active infection. In vitro proteomic marker screening using disease relevant cell models could help identify markers of infection and tissue damage that are also detectable during in vivo infections. This study utilised a proteomic approach to investigate in vitro cellular responses during BPI3V infection to enhance the current understanding of intracellular host-virus interactions and identify putative markers of in vivo infection. Through 2D gel electrophoresis proteomic analysis, BPI3V Phosphoprotein P and host T-complex Protein 1 subunit theta were found to be accumulated at the latter stages of infection within bovine fibroblasts. These proteins were subsequently detected using targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry in the plasma of animals challenged with BPI3V, with differential protein level profiles observed dependant on animal vaccination status. Potential mechanisms by which BPI3V overcomes host cellular immune response mechanisms allowing for replication and production of viral proteins were also revealed. Assessment of circulating protein marker levels identified through an in vitro approach as described may enable more effective diagnosis of active viral infection and diseased or damaged respiratory tissue in animals and allow for more effective utilisation of preventative therapeutic interventions prior to bacterial disease onset and significantly aid the management and control of BRD.","Gray, Darren W; Welsh, Michael D; Doherty, Simon; Mooney, Mark H",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28619153/,510
67523,Vitamins and Minerals.,2018,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to clarify the technical feasibility and oncological efficacy of laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) for gastric cancer compared with open gastrectomy (OG). METHODS Between April 2002 and March 2008, a series of 623 patients with gastric cancer underwent R0 gastrectomy (314 LAG patients and 309 OG patients). Age, gender, lymph node dissection, and pathological stage were matched by propensity scoring, and 212 patients (106 LAG and 106 OG) were selected for analysis after the exclusion of 40 patients who had proximal gastrectomy. Intraoperative factors, postoperative morbidity, long-term quality of life (QOL), and survival were evaluated. Moreover, these outcomes were also compared between the laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) and the open total gastrectomy (OTG). RESULTS There was no significant difference in preoperative characteristics between the two patient groups. Regarding intraoperative characteristics, blood loss was significantly lower in the LAG group (143 ml) than in the OG group (288 ml), while operation time was significantly longer in the LAG group (273 min) than the OG group (231 min). The degree of lymph node dissection and number of retrieved lymph nodes did not differ between the two groups. There were no significant differences in postoperative courses or overall and disease-specific survival (89.8% vs. 83.6%, P = 0.0886; 100% vs. 95.2%, P = 0.1073) except time to first flatus and time to use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory derivatives between the two groups. Significantly fewer patients felt wound pain in the LAG group 1 year after surgery. Analyses between the LATG and OTG groups showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS LAG for gastric cancer may be both feasible and safe. However, it will be necessary to conduct a well-designed randomized controlled trial comparing short-term and long-term outcomes between LAG and OG in a larger number of patients.","Kunisaki, Chikara; Makino, Hirochika; Kosaka, Takashi; Oshima, Takashi; Fujii, Shoichi; Takagawa, Ryo; Kimura, Jun; Ono, Hidetaka A; Akiyama, Hirotoshi; Taguri, Masataka; Morita, Satoshi; Endo, Itaru",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1956-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002202/,510

Our aim was to test for a treatment-by-ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis interaction in a subgroup analysis of patients in the Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated with Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes (SOCRATES) trial. METHODS SOCRATES was a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial of ticagrelor versus aspirin in patients aged 40 years or older with a non-cardioembolic, non-severe acute ischaemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischaemic attack from 674 hospitals in 33 countries. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2-90, given orally) or aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2-90, given orally) within 24 h of symptom onset. Investigators classified all patients into atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic groups for the prespecified, exploratory analysis reported in this study. The primary endpoint was the time to occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat. The SOCRATES trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01994720. FINDINGS Between Jan 7, 2014, and Oct 29, 2015, we randomly allocated 13 199 patients (6589 [50%] to ticagrelor and 6610 [50%] to aspirin). Potentially symptomatic ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis was reported in 3081 (23%) of 13 199 patients. We found a treatment-by-atherosclerotic stenosis interaction (p=0·017). 103 (6·7%) of 1542 patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the ticagrelor group and 147 (9·6%) of 1539 patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the aspirin group had an occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days (hazard ratio 0·68 [95% CI 0·53-0·88]; p=0·003). In 10 118 patients with no ipsilateral stenosis, 339 (6·7%) of 5047 patients in the ticagrelor group had an occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days compared with 350 (6·9%) of 5071 in the aspirin group (0·97 [0·84-1·13]; p=0·72). There were no significant differences in the proportion of life-threatening bleeding or major or minor bleeding events in patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the ticagrelor group compared with the aspirin group. INTERPRETATION In this prespecified exploratory analysis, ticagrelor was superior to aspirin at preventing stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 90 days in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack when associated with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. An understanding of stroke mechanisms and causes is important to deliver safe and efficacious treatments for early stroke prevention.

However, with the development of new and less reactogenic vaccine antigens, which take advantage of molecular recombinant technologies, comes the need for more effective adjuvants that will facilitate the induction of adaptive immune responses. In this context, immunomodulatory biomaterials, particularly the ones based on biodegradable polymers, show great promise. This article discusses the various classes of immunomodulatory biomaterials and advocates a cross-disciplinary approach that brings together molecular concepts from various fields to rationally design vaccine adjuvants with immunomodulatory properties.","Mallapragada, Surya K; Narasimhan, Balaji",International journal of pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2008.06.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18662761/,510

Hospitals and intensive care units were suddenly faced with a ""tsunami"" warning requiring instantaneous implementation and escalation of disaster plans. EVIDENCE REVIEW An evidence-based question was developed and an extensive review of the literature was completed, resulting in a structured plan for the intensive care units to manage a surge of patients critically ill with COVID-19 in March 2020. Twenty-five sources of evidence focusing on pandemic intensive care unit and COVID-19 management laid the foundation for the team to navigate the crisis. Implementation The Critical Care Services task force adopted recommendations from the CHEST consensus statement on surge capacity principles and other sources, which served as the framework for the organized response. The 4 S's became the focus: space, staff, supplies, and systems. Development of algorithms, workflows, and new processes related to treating patients, staffing shortages, and limited supplies. New intensive care unit staffing solutions were adopted. EVALUATION Using a framework based on the literature reviewed, the Critical Care Services task force controlled the surge of patients with COVID-19 in March through May 2020. Patients received excellent care, and the mortality rate was 0.008%. The intensive care unit team had the needed respiratory and general supplies but had to continually adapt to shortages of personal protective equipment, cleaning products, and some medications. SUSTAINABILITY The intensive care unit pandemic response plan has been established and the team is prepared for the next wave of COVID-19.","Bader, Mary Kay; Braun, Annabelle; Fox, Cherie; Dwinell, Lauren; Cord, Jennifer; Andersen, Marne; Noakes, Bryan; Ponticiello, Daniel",Critical care nurse,https://doi.org/10.4037/ccn2020799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803240/,510

69119,Processing cataphors: Active antecedent search is persistent.,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND Whereas routine prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is frequently utilized in the West, Asian physicians employ it much less often, based on its recorded rarity amongst their patients. This study was designed to examine the incidence of VTE and to determine the optimal method of thromboembolic prophylaxis following gastrectomy for cancer. METHODS In this prospective, randomized trial, patients were assigned to either an intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) only or an IPC plus enoxaparin. The primary end point of this study was to determine the VTE incidence rate within 30 days of surgery. A history with physical examinations for VTE and a serum d-dimer test was scheduled on postoperative days (POD) 0, 1, 4, and 7. Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) was performed as an objective test for deep vein thrombosis at POD 4. An interim analysis was performed to determine if it was ethical to continue the study. This clinical trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01448746). RESULTS Among the 220 patients, 3 (all from the IPC group) were diagnosed with VTE; these cases were asymptomatic, having been detected only on DUS 4 days after surgery. Postoperative bleeding occurred in 12 cases, among which 11 patients were in the IPC plus enoxaparin group. CONCLUSIONS This interim analysis showed a higher incidence of VTE in the IPC group but a higher bleeding rate in the IPC plus enoxaparin group. We expect that this study, once completed, will provide information key to the determination of the optimal method for preventing VTE in Korean gastric cancer patients.","Song, Kyo Young; Yoo, Han Mo; Kim, Eun Young; Kim, Ji-Il; Yim, Hyeon Woo; Jeon, Hae Myung; Park, Cho Hyun",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-014-3893-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012265/,510
69951,Helping the Public Understand Adverse Events Associated With COVID-19 Vaccinations: Lessons Learned From Functional Neurological Disorder.,2021-04-09,"In current report, nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiONPs) were synthesized using leaf extract of Berberis balochistanica (BB) an endemic medicinal plant. The BB leaves extract act as a strong reducing, stabilizing, and capping agent in the synthesis of BB@NiONPs. Further, BB@NiONPs were characterized using Uv-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and average size was calculated ~21.7 nm). Multiple in vitro biological activities were performed to determine their therapeutic potentials. The BB@NiONPs showed strong antioxidant activities in term of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) with scavenging potential of 69.98 and 59.59% at 200 μg/ml, respectively. The antibacterial and antifungal testes were examined using different bacterial and fungal strains and dose-dependent inhibition response was reported. Laterally, cytotoxic and phytotoxic activities were studied using brine shrimp and radish seeds. The result determined potential cytotoxic activity with LD50 value (49.10 μg/ml) and outstanding stimulatory effect of BB@NiONPs on seed germination at lower concentrations as compared to control. Overall, result concluded that biosynthesis of NiONPs using leaf extracts of Berberis balochistanica is cheap, easy, and safe method and could be used in biomedical and agriculture field as nanomedicine and nano fertilizer.","Uddin, Siraj; Safdar, Luqman Bin; Iqbal, Javed; Yaseen, Tabassum; Laila, Sabiha; Anwar, Saeed; Abbasi, Banzeer Ahsan; Saif, Muhammad Saqib; Quraishi, Umar Masood",Microscopy research and technique,https://doi.org/10.1002/jemt.23756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763916/,510

Trifecta (total ischemia time < 25 minutes, negative surgical margins, and no surgical complications) is widely used to evaluate success after partial nephrectomy. We investigated factors affecting renal function preservation among patients not achieving trifecta after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. METHODS Sixty-six patients who underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for clinical T1a renal masses between December 2006 and March 2016 were examined. We defined preserved renal function as the preservation of an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 90% 1 year after surgery. We examined factors affecting renal function preservation among patients not achieving trifecta after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. RESULTS Thirty out of 66 patients (45%) did not achieve trifecta. In an evaluation of 66 patients, a multivariate analysis identified tumor size (P = .04) as an independent predictor affecting the achievement of trifecta. Tumor size was significantly smaller in the trifecta achievement group (1.9 ± 0.1 cm) than in the non-achievement group (2.2 ± 0.6 cm) (P = .04). We found that renal function was preserved 1 year after surgery in 14 out of the 30 patients not achieving trifecta. In univariate analysis, age (P = .01) was significantly associated with affecting the preservation of renal function among these patients. Patients with preserved renal function were significantly younger (47.8 ± 2.5 years) than those without (58.5 ± 2.9 years) (P = .01). CONCLUSION Renal function may be preserved in younger patients even if they do not achieve trifecta after partial nephrectomy for small renal masses.","Takeda, Toshikazu; Komatsuda, Akari; Yanai, Yoshinori; Tanaka, Nobuyuki; Matsumoto, Kazuhiro; Morita, Shinya; Kosaka, Takeo; Mizuno, Ryuichi; Shinojima, Toshiaki; Asanuma, Hiroshi; Oya, Mototsugu",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31814326/,510

71281,The potential for missed work days due to possible COVID-19 exposure at large scientific meetings.,2020-08-01,"AIMS Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is an established treatment option in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). ASA is ineffective in some: inaccurate infarct and inability to identify a vessel contribute. We aimed to improve accuracy of infarct using CT angiography guidance and provide a more predictable and satisfactory outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-one successive patients with symptomatic LVOT obstruction refractory to medication underwent CT angiography planning to guide ASA. CT was performed using a dual-source CT system. Alcohol was delivered to the artery identified from CT: in 17/21 this was a sub-branch of a septal artery, in 2/21 the septal vessel was identified from the circumflex artery. Peak gradient improved from 98 (IQR 89.50-111.50) mmHg to 14 (IQR 8.50-22) mmHg (p=0.003). Systolic anterior motion (SAM) improved in 18/20 patients. NYHA class improved by ≥1 in 18/20. Peak VO2 improved from 79.19% of predicted value (±14.01) to 91.62% (±12.02) predicted (p<0.0001). Success at the first procedure is greater with CT guidance, 17/20 vs. 50/75 with traditional methods (pre-CT guidance) (p=0.02); 9/20 had six-month CMR with target septum infarct in all. ASA-related RBBB reduced from 62% to 13% (p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS CT angiography planning improves localisation of infarct and procedural success at the first attempt in ASA when compared to traditional methods. Follow-up to six months suggests a symptomatic, functional and haemodynamic improvement.","Cooper, Robert M; Binukrishnan, Sukumaran R; Shahzad, Adeel; Hasleton, Jonathan; Sigwart, Ulrich; Stables, Rodney H",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.4244/eij-d-15-00159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27890861/,510

81764,"Supporting Self-Management of Cardiovascular Diseases Through Remote Monitoring Technologies: Metaethnography Review of Frameworks, Models, and Theories Used in Research and Development.",2020-05-21,"INTRODUCTION Epidemics of acute respiratory disease, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, and natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, have prompted planning in hospitals that offer adult critical care to increase their capacity and equipment inventory for responding to a major demand surge. However, planning at a national, state, or local level to address the particular medical resource needs of children for mass critical care has yet to occur in any coordinated way. This paper presents the consensus opinion of the Task Force regarding supplies and equipment that would be required during a pediatric mass critical care crisis. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS The Task Force endorsed the view that supplies and equipment must be available for a tripling of capacity above the usual peak pediatric intensive care unit capacity for at least 10 days. The recommended size-specific pediatric mass critical care equipment stockpile for two types of patients is presented in terms of equipment needs per ten mass critical care beds, which would serve 26 patients over a 10-day period. Specific recommendations are made regarding ventilator capacity, including the potential use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Other recommendations include inventories for disposable medical equipment, medications, and staffing levels.","Bohn, Desmond; Kanter, Robert K; Burns, Jeffrey; Barfield, Wanda D; Kissoon, Niranjan",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0b013e318234a6b9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067920/,510
82059,Increased Utilization of Social Media in Neurosurgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-11-01,"Introduction: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among young adults has increased dramatically in recent decades. The survey examined anthropometric indicators of fat tissue amount in the population of adult males and females from Slovenia from 1950 to 2019. Methods: From a large anthropometric database body height, body mass, seven circumferences (C: waist, hip, relaxed and flexed upper arm, forearm, middle thigh, medial calf) and seven skinfold thicknesses (SFT: triceps, biceps, subscapular, iliac crest, supraspinale, front thigh and medial calf) were obtained in different combinations for more than 3400 males and almost 4600 females of age 18 to 29 years, measured in the years between 1950 and 2019. To evaluate the secular trend, data were classified into 10-year periods and compared with ANOVA. Results: Body mass, waist-to-height ratio, waist-to-hip ratio, waist C, relaxed and flexed upper arm C, calf C, Triceps/subscapular ratio, biceps SFT, supraspinale SFT, front thigh SFT, and medial calf SFT increased (p < 0.001) over the last 70 years, however, thigh C decreased (p < 0.001) over the last 30 years. Body mass index and forearm C increased in males and decreased in females. Triceps and subscapular SFT`s increased till 2009 and then decreased in next decade in both sexes. Body fat % increased over the 70-years observed period from 12% to almost 15% in males and from 24% to more than 26% in females. Conclusion: From 1950 to 2009 or even to 2019, large amount of body fat clearly became more prevalent in young adults from Slovenia, which mostly is in line with secular trend in fat tissue in other parts of the world; however, in many measurements this trend slows down or even reverses after 2009 in Slovenia. Slovenian population appears to be leaner compared to other populations.","Robič Pikel, Tatjana",Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht uber die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur,https://doi.org/10.1127/anthranz/2021/1324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369960/,510
82916,Saliva: an important alternative for screening and monitoring of COVID-19 in children.,2020,"Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruit domain (ASC) encoded by PYCARD gene, is a 22 kDa small molecule which aggregates into ASC specks during inflammasome activation. ASC protein is an adaptor protein present in several inflammasome complexes that performs several intra and extracellular functions, in monomeric form or as ASC specks, during physiological and pathological processes related to inflammation and adaptive immunity. Extracellular ASC specks (eASC specks) released during cell death by pyroptosis, can contribute as a danger signal to the propagation of inflammation via phagocytosis and activation of surrounding cells. ASC specks are found in the circulation of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and have been considered as relevant blood biomarkers of inflammation. eASC amplifies the inflammatory signal, may induce the production of autoantibodies, transports molecules that bind to this complex, contributing to the generation of antibodies and can induce the maturation of cytokines promoting the modeling of the adaptive immunity. Although several advances have been registered in the last 21 years, there are numerous unknown or enigmatic gaps in the understanding of the role of eASC specks in the organism. Here we provide an overview about the ASC protein focusing on the probable roles of eASC specks in several diseases, up to the most recent studies concerning COVID-19.","de Souza, Jean Gabriel; Starobinas, Nancy; Ibañez, Olga Celia Martinez",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042182/,510

The purpose of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of percutaneous ablation in achieving pain palliation and local tumor control of osseous metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS A retrospective review was performed of 76 musculoskeletal metastases in 45 patients treated with percutaneous ablation. 63% (48/76) were treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 35% (27/76) with cryoablation, and 1.3% (1/76) with microwave ablation (MWA). In 70% (53/76) of cases, associated cementoplasty was performed. Primary outcomes measured were pre- and post-procedure pain scores 4 weeks after treatment and local tumor control at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. RESULTS Mean age of the cohort was 63.6 ± 9.5 years. Median tumor diameter was 3.60 cm (range 1.0-10.0 cm). Mean and median pain scores before treatment were 7.5 ± 2.3 and 8.0, respectively. Post-procedure, patients reported significantly decreased pain scores at 4 weeks (mean, 3.7 ± 3.5; median, 3.0; p < 0.00001). Radiographic local tumor control rates were 83% (35/42) at 3 months, 77% (23/30) at 6 months, and 68% (17/25) at 12 months after treatment. The overall complication rate was 2.6% (2/76). CONCLUSION Percutaneous tumor ablation is a well-tolerated, minimally invasive procedure associated with improving pain palliation and achieving local tumor control of osseous metastases from NSCLC.

85671,"Covid-19: Risk of second wave is very real, say researchers.",2020-06-09,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already became a public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19 related cardiac injury remains largely unclear. Methods We retrospectively analyzed demographic, clinical, laboratory and cardiovascular imaging data of all consecutively admitted adult COVID-19 patients in Zhuhai, China from January 17th, 2020 to February 18th, 2020. Results A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Acute cardiac injury was found in 9 (9.7%) COVID-19 patients with median level of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) to be 0.085 µg/L (IQR 0.027-0.560 µg/L). Compared with patients without cardiac injury, the median age of patients with cardiac injury was significantly older (65.0 vs. 44.0, P<0.05), hypertension was significantly more common (44.4% vs. 14.3%, P<0.05), and the proportion of severe-critical cases were greater (77.8% vs. 17.9%, P<0.05). Patients with cardiac injury were more likely have elevation of N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) in comparison (66.7% vs. 10.0%, P<0.05). There was no significant difference in echocardiographic parameters between patients with and without cardiac injury. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that older age (OR: 1.093, 95% CI: 1.011-1.182) and increased NT-proBNP (OR: 10.979, 95% CI: 2.024-59.555) were independent risk factors for cardiac injury. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging performed on three patients at around one month after they underwent significant hs-cTnI elevation showed that they had underlying cardiovascular comorbidities. Conclusions Acute cardiac injury was seen in the minority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Zhuhai, China. Older age and increased NT-proBNP were associated with acute cardiac injury.

86744,Assessment-related anxiety among older adults: development of a measure.,2020-09-27,"BACKGROUND The Bushen Huoxue prescription is a traditional Chinese medicine formula treating diabetic retinopathy, which was developed by our research group. Catalpol, puerarin, salvianolic acid B, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rd are six of main effective components, which could be partly representative of this prescription. The corona charged aerosol detector (corona CAD) is one kind of universal detectors equipped with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The CAD has many advantages for the analysis of complex mixtures, but too few applications in traditional Chinese medicine compounds. OBJECTIVE The aims of this study are to establish a method for the determination of six components in Bushen Huoxue prescription, and to increase the use of the CAD in traditional Chinese medicine compounds. METHODS HPLC-CAD analysis was performed on an Inertsil ODS-SP (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.5 % formic acid solution(A)-acetonitrile(B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (0-7 min, 1 % B; 7-12 min, 1 %-12 % B; 12-22 min, 12 %-19 % B; 22-40 min, 19 %-28 % B; 40-43 min, 28 %-33 % B; 43-50 min, 33 % B; 50-65 min, 33 %-42 % B). The column temperature maintained at 30 ℃, the injection volume was 20 μL, the atomization temperature mode was LOW, the filtration constant (filter) was 3.6 and data collection rate was 10 Hz. The methodology was examined and the linearity of regression of different functions was compared. Sixteen batches of samples were prepared and their contents were determined. RESULTS The six compounds showed a better linearity (R2 > 0.9990) in their concentration ranges when using the linear function. The average recoveries were 99.18 %-101.30 %. Although the RSD value of puerarin and ginsenoside Rg1 was slightly out of 3 % during the average recovery investigation, all the other methodological investigations of the six components were within 3 %. The precision, stability and repeatability of the method were good. In sixteen batches of Bushen Huoxue prescription samples, the contents of six components were 0.3138 %-0.6042 % for catalpol, 0.8095 %-1.2917 % for puerarin, 0.7416 %-1.1189 % for salvianolic acid B, 0.0231 %-0.0418 % for ginsenoside Rg1, 0.0702 %-0.1724 % for ginsenoside Rb1, 0.0384 %-0.1196 % for ginsenoside Rd. CONCLUSION In this experiment, a method for the determination of six components in Bushen Huoxue prescription based on HPLC-CAD was established with high accuracy, good repeatability and simple operation, and it can provide references for the improvement of quality standard of the Bushen Huoxue prescription. It is reasonable and accessible for the CAD application in the determination of traditional Chinese medicine compound prescriptions.","Xie, Mengjun; Yu, Yueting; Zhu, Ziyu; Deng, Liping; Ren, Bo; Zhang, Mei",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2021.114087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932858/,510

This study compares novice surgeons' suturing performance by 3D-CL and RAL using Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS), an objective, validated scoring tool. Twenty-two surgeons with no robotic experience completed a standardized suturing task in an experimental setup by both 3D-CL and RAL in a randomized, cross-over design. Two experienced surgeons blindly assessed their performance using OSATS. Median (interquartile range) OSATS scores for 3D-CL and RAL were, respectively, 22.8 (17.4 to 25.8) versus 25.0 (21.9 to 26.5), P=0.032. There was no association between laparoscopic experience and robotic-assisted suturing performance. Thus, this study is, to our knowledge, the first to compare novice surgeons' suturing performance by 3D-CL and RAL using an objective, validated scoring tool and to show better suturing performance when assisted by the robot regardless of experience level.","Møller, Sofie G; Dohrn, Niclas; Brisling, Steffen K; Larsen, Jens C R; Klein, Mads","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32039938/,510

While many literature sources and guidance point to the inadequacy of individual informed consent for any genetically modified mosquito release, including gene drive ones, (outside of epidemiological studies that might require blood samples) and at the need for a community-level decision, researchers often find themselves with no specific guidance on how that decision should be made, expressed and by whom. Target Malaria, the Kenya Medical Research Institute and the Pan African Mosquito Control Association co-organised a workshop with researchers and practitioners on this topic to question the model proposed by Target Malaria in its research so far that involved the release of genetically modified sterile male mosquitoes and how this could be adapted to future studies involving gene drive mosquito releases for them to offer reflections about potential best practices.

These receptors are widely expressed and regulate numerous physiological processes including cardiovascular and metabolic functions and airway tone. The βARs are also important targets in the treatment of many diseases including hypertension, heart failure and asthma. In some cases, the use of current βAR ligands to treat a disease is suboptimal and can lead to severe side effects. One strategy to potentially improve such treatments is the development of biased agonists that selectively regulate a subset of βAR signaling pathways and responses. Here we discuss the compounds identified to date that preferentially activate a Gs- or β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathway through βARs. Mechanistic insight on how these compounds bias signaling sheds light on the potential development of even more selective compounds that should have increased utility in treating disease.","Ippolito, Michael; Benovic, Jeffrey L",Cellular signalling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385503/,510

87793,Editorial: social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic - IBD patients cannot stay at home forever.,2020-08-01,"Organic nitrates (R-ONO2; R, organic residue) such as nitroglycerin are used as drugs in part for more than a century. Their pharmacological use is associated with clinically relevant tolerance which is reportedly known since 1888. The underlying mechanisms of both, the mechanisms of action and the main pharmacological effect, which is vasodilatation and reduction of blood pressure, and the development of tolerance, which means increasing need of drug amount in sustained long-term therapy, are still incompletely understood. William B. Jakoby and associates were the first to report the biotransformation of organic nitrates, notably including nitroglycerin (i.e., glycerol trinitrate; GTN), by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-catalyzed conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to the nitrogen atom of one of the three nitrate groups of GTN to generate glutathione sulfenyl nitrite (glutathione thionitrate, S-nitroglutathione; GSNO2). Jakoby's group was also the first to suggest that GSNO2 reacts with a second GSH molecule to produce inorganic nitrite (ONO‒) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) without the catalytic involvement of GST. This mechanism has been adopted by others to the biotransformation of GTN by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (mtALDH-(CysSH)2) which does not require GSH as a substrate. The main difference between these reactions is that mtALDH forms an internal thionitrate (mtALDH-(CysSH)-CysSNO2) which releases inorganic nitrite upon intra-molecular reaction to form mtALDH disulfide (mtALDH-(CysS)2). Subsequently, ONO‒ and GSNO2 are reduced by several proteins and enzymes to nitric oxide (NO) which is a very potent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase to finally relax the smooth muscles thus dilating the vasculature. GSNO2 is considered to rearrange to GSONO which undergoes further reactions including GSNO and GSSG formation. The present article is an appraisal of the pioneering work of William B. Jakoby in the area of the biotransformation of organic nitrates by GST. The two above mentioned enzymatic reactions are discussed in the context of tolerance development to organic nitrates, still a clinically relevant pharmacological concern.","Tsikas, Dimitrios; Surdacki, Andrzej",Analytical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2020.113993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080215/,510

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system has successfully been demonstrated to excise or inactivate integrated HIV-1 provirus from infected cells by targeting the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. However, the guide RNAs (gRNAs) have classically avoided transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are readily observed and known to be important in human promoters. Although conventionally thought unfavorable due to potential impact on human promoters, our computational pipeline identified gRNA sequences that were predicted to inactivate HIV-1 transcription by targeting the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) binding sites (gNFKB0, gNFKB1) with a high safety profile (lack of predicted or observed human edits) and broad-spectrum activity (predicted coverage of known viral sequences). Genome-wide, unbiased identification of double strand breaks (DSBs) enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) showed that the gRNAs targeting NF-κB binding sites had no detectable CRISPR-induced off-target edits in HeLa cells. 5' LTR-driven HIV-1 transcription was significantly reduced in three HIV-1 reporter cell lines. These results demonstrate a working model to specifically target well-known TFBSs in the HIV-1 LTR that are readily observed in human promoters to reduce HIV-1 transcription with a high-level safety profile and broad-spectrum activity.","Chung, Cheng-Han; Allen, Alexander G; Atkins, Andrew J; Sullivan, Neil T; Homan, Greg; Costello, Robert; Madrid, Rebekah; Nonnemacher, Michael R; Dampier, Will; Wigdahl, Brian",Molecular therapy.

91591,Unexpected Benefits to Virtual Care During COVID-19.,2020-06-25,"Background Radial access (RA) is increasingly used in chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention with encouraging results. However, there are concerns about its safety and efficacy because of higher complexity and the need for strong guide catheter support. Methods and Results We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies published through November 2018 reporting the outcomes of RA versus femoral access in CTO percutaneous coronary intervention. Outcomes included major bleeding, access-site complications, in-hospital major adverse events, and technical success. Nine observational studies with 10 590 patients (10 617 lesions) were included in the meta-analysis. CTO lesions attempted using RA had lower Japan-CTO score (2.3±1.2 versus 2.5±1.3; P<0.001). Use of RA was associated with similar technical success (78.7% versus 78.5%; odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.94-1.31; P=0.24; I2=23%), lower risk of access-site complications (0.73% versus 1.79%; odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.51; P<0.001; I2=0%) and major bleeding (0.18% versus 0.9%; odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.45; P<0.001; I2=0%), and similar risk of in-hospital adverse events and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.12-1.07; P=0.07; I2=0%) as compared to femoral access. Results were similar when analyzing radial-only versus any femoral access and when excluding the largest study. Conclusions As compared with femoral access, RA is used in CTO percutaneous coronary intervention of less complex lesions and is associated with fewer access-site complications and major bleeding and comparable technical success.","Megaly, Michael; Karatasakis, Aris; Abraham, Bishoy; Jensen, Joseph; Saad, Marwan; Omer, Mohamed; Elbadawi, Ayman; Sandoval, Yader; Shishehbor, Mehdi H; Banerjee, Subhash; Alaswad, Khaldoon; Rinfret, Stéphane; Burke, M Nicholas; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Circulation.

Participants: Participants were 100 students enrolled in 4-year universities. Methods: Each participant attended a virtual visit to complete a series of gold-standard mental health assessments, and then used a mobile app for 28 days to complete mood assessments and allow for passive collection of GPS, accelerometer, phone call, and screen time data. Students completed another virtual visit at the end of the study to collect a second round of mental health assessments. Results: In-app daily mood assessments were strongly correlated with their corresponding gold standard clinical assessment. Sleep variance among students was correlated to depression scores (ρ = .28) and stress scores (ρ = .27). Conclusions: Digital Phenotyping among college students is feasible on both an individual and a sample level. Studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to understand population trends, but there are practical applications of the data today.","Melcher, Jennifer; Lavoie, Joel; Hays, Ryan; D'Mello, Ryan; Rauseo-Ricupero, Natali; Camacho, Erica; Rodriguez-Villa, Elena; Wisniewski, Hannah; Lagan, Sarah; Vaidyam, Aditya; Torous, John",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2021.1905650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769927/,510

MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched up to April 2020. Clinical and radiographic studies reporting on BBT of maxillary anterior teeth, with at least 10 patients were included. A meta-analysis was performed using random effect models to report differences of BBT. RESULTS 50 studies were included. Using bone crest (BC) as a reference point, no significant differences were found in BBT between different tooth types, except for 0.16 mm (95%-CI:0.02-0.30) increased mid-root thickness of premolars compared to canines. Using the CEJ as a reference point, canines presented with a significantly increased thickness of 0.32 mm (95%-CI:0.11-0.54) coronally compared to laterals. When BC was used as reference, males demonstrated a significantly increased thickness of 0.21 mm (95%-CI:0.15-0.27) apically, while middle-aged adults showed a 0.06 mm (95%-CI:-0.12,-0.01) statistically significant increase in the coronal level compared to older adults. CONCLUSIONS Few maxillary anterior teeth have BBT greater than 1mm. Buccal bone tends to get thicker from a coronal to apical position along the root surface and from an anterior to posterior position in the arch.","Tsigarida, Alexandra; Toscano, Jeremy; de Brito Bezerra, Beatriz; Geminiani, Alessandro; Barmak, Abdul Basir; Caton, Jack; Papaspyridakos, Panos; Chochlidakis, Konstantinos",Journal of clinical periodontology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpe.13347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691437/,510

This report is an update with 10 additional patients in the series and includes bacterial contamination data. METHODS The patients in this human trial were scheduled to undergo diagnostic laparoscopy for abdominal staging of a pancreatic head mass. A second surgeon, blinded to the laparoscopic findings, performed a transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy (TEP). The findings of laparoscopic exploration were compared with that those of the TEP. Diagnostic findings, operative times, and clinical course were recorded. Bacterial contamination data were collected for the second cohort of 10 patients. Bacterial samples were collected from the scope before use and the abdominal cavity before and after creation of the gastrotomy. Samples were assessed for bacterial counts and species identification. Definitive care was rendered based on the findings from laparoscopy. RESULTS In this study, 20 patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy followed by DTEP. The average time for completion of diagnostic laparoscopy was 10 min compared with 21 min for TEP. The experience acquired during the initial 10 procedures translated to a 7-min decrease in TEP time for the second 10 cases. For 19 of the 20 patients, DTEP corroborated laparoscopic findings for surgical decision making. One endoscopic and five laparoscopic biopsies were performed. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed for 14 patients and palliative gastrojejunostomy for 6 patients. No cross-contamination of the peritoneum or infectious complications were noted. No significant complications related to either the endoscopic or laparoscopic approach occurred. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the authors' previous conclusions that the transgastric approach to diagnostic peritoneoscopy is feasible, safe, and accurate. The lack of documented bacterial contamination further supports the use of this technique. Technical issues, including intraabdominal manipulation and gastric closure, require further investigation.","Nau, Peter; Anderson, Joel; Yuh, Benjamin; Muscarella, Peter; Christopher Ellison, E; Happel, Lynn; Narula, Vimal K; Melvin, W Scott; Hazey, Jeffrey W",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0797-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20054581/,510

METHODS Case report. RESULTS A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with aSAH complicated by acute hydrocephalus. An EVD was placed and set to 15 mmHg. After nearly 72 h, she clinically deteriorated. A computed tomography (CT) perfusion scan showed hypoperfusion in the watershed regions in both hemispheres and CT angiogram showed mild segmental arterial narrowings. After the EVD was lowered to 5 mmHg, the radiologic perfusion abnormalities and clinical symptoms resolved. CONCLUSIONS We postulate a mechanism by which CSF diversion could decrease the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH: CSF drainage at low levels of intracranial pressure (e.g., 5 mmHg) could improve blood flow in the microcirculation, and thus improve tissue perfusion.","Fugate, Jennifer E; Rabinstein, Alejandro A; Wijdicks, Eelco F M; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-012-9723-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22644888/,510

Given the drastic changes to resident roles, expectations, and responsibilities, many valuable lessons regarding resident concerns and wellness can be garnered from this unique experience. METHODS A voluntary survey was sent to 179 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited orthopaedic surgery residency program directors to distribute to their residents. Questions focused on issues that may have occurred, program's responses, and expectations of programs during the pandemic. RESULTS In total, 507 residents completed the survey, and 10% reported being deployed to do nonorthopaedic-related care, with junior classes being more likely to receive this assignment (P < 0.001). The greatest concern for respondents was the possibility of getting family members sick (mean = 3.89, on scale of 1-5), followed by personally contracting the illness (mean = 3.38). DISCUSSION The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous changes and novel sources of adversity for the orthopaedic surgery resident. Contrary to popular opinion, most residents are comfortable with the proposition of providing nonorthopaedic care. The possibility of bringing a pathogen to the home environment and infecting family members seems to be an overarching concern, and efforts to ensure resident and family safety are key.","Nolte, Michael T; Tornetta, Paul; Mehta, Samir; Ponce, Brent A; Grabowski, Gregory; Turner, Norman S; Spitnale, Michael J; Kogan, Monica",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.5435/jaaos-d-20-01372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33651749/,510

Due to these characteristics, systemic risks are overextending established risk management and create new, unsolved challenges for policymaking in risk assessment and risk governance. Their negative effects are often pervasive, impacting fields beyond the obvious primary areas of harm. This article addresses these challenges of systemic risks from different disciplinary and sectorial perspectives. It highlights the special contributions of these perspectives and approaches and provides a synthesis for an interdisciplinary understanding of systemic risks and effective governance. The main argument is that understanding systemic risks and providing good governance advice relies on an approach that integrates novel modeling tools from complexity sciences with empirical data from observations, experiments, or simulations and evidence-based insights about social and cultural response patterns revealed by quantitative (e.g., surveys) or qualitative (e.g., participatory appraisals) investigations. Systemic risks cannot be easily characterized by single numerical estimations but can be assessed by using multiple indicators and including several dynamic gradients that can be aggregated into diverse but coherent scenarios. Lastly, governance of systemic risks requires interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral cooperation, a close monitoring system, and the engagement of scientists, regulators, and stakeholders to be effective as well as socially acceptable.","Renn, Ortwin; Laubichler, Manfred; Lucas, Klaus; Kröger, Wolfgang; Schanze, Jochen; Scholz, Roland W; Schweizer, Pia-Johanna",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331037/,510

METHODS In 34 consecutive patients with secondary or primary liver tumors scheduled for RE, the following cytokines were measured prior to and 2 h, 3 days, and 6 weeks after RE: interleukin (IL) -1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-γ. Liver function impairment was defined as an elevation of liver-related laboratory values as graded by CTCAE ≥ 2 and/or serum bilirubin ≥30 µmol/l and/or development of ascites at 6-week follow-up. RESULTS Significant changes over time were seen in IL-1 (increase from 0.4 pg/ml (±0.7) at baseline to 1.1 pg/ml (±1.4) 3 days after RE (p = 0.02)), and in IL-6 (increase from 16.8 pg/ml (±21.8) at baseline to 54.6 pg/ml (±78.2) 3 days after RE (p = 0.003)). Baseline values of IL-6 and IL-8 were independently associated with liver function impairment at follow-up as well as decreased survival with an optimal cutoff at 6.53 and 60.8 pg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION Expected changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after RE were shown. Furthermore, baseline values of IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with later liver dysfunction and survival.

Treatment with oral anticoagulation is often used in patients with positive results for the inherited thrombophilias. METHODS We reviewed the literature focusing on case-control studies of the 5 most commonly inherited disorders of coagulation: protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, and the factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations in patients with stroke. We also analyzed the available data on stroke patients with inherited thrombophilia and patent foramen ovale. RESULTS Multiple case-control studies have not convincingly shown an association of the inherited thrombophilias with ischemic stroke, even in young patients and patients with patent foramen ovale. CONCLUSIONS If there is an association between the inherited thrombophilias and arterial stroke, then it is a weak one, likely enhanced by other prothrombotic risk factors. The consequences of ordering these tests and attributing causality to an arterial event can result in significant costs to the health care system and pose a potential risk to patients, because this may lead to inappropriate use of long-term oral anticoagulants, exposing patients to harm without a clearly defined benefit.","Morris, Jane G; Singh, Swaraj; Fisher, Marc",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.110.595199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947844/,510

In the literature complications after implantation are well documented but fatal or near-fatal events during implantation are seldom reported. In this article 3 such cases from a single tertiary center over a period of more than 10 years are presented and discussed. The (near) fatal complications occurred despite experienced surgeons and the use of ultrasound and fluoroscopy during implantation. Although the incidence is estimated to be much less than 1% at this centre, implantation of a tunnelled hemodialysis catheter is demanding, a thorough evaluation of vascular structures in advance is mandatory and experiencend professionals with high index of suspicion are essential. Performing the procedure with the patient under conscious sedation has benefits compared to general anesthesia. If the patient indicates atypical pain, the procedure should be stopped immediately and re-evaluated for any cause. If a perforation with relevant vascular damage is suspected, we recommend leaving the dilator/introducer/catheter in place to reduce major hemorrhage until the vascular or cardiothoracic surgeon can fix the problem.","Schuepfer, Anne-Catherine; Schuepfer, Guido; Mauch, Jacqueline",Der Anaesthesist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-021-01013-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292357/,510

Among various PMs, bioaerosols are airborne particles that are either living organisms (bacteria, viruses, and fungi) or originated from living organisms (endotoxin, allergen etc). PMs and/or bioaerosols have adverse health effects of infection, allergy, and irritation. Proper management and source identification of PMs and bioaerosols will reduce their negative health impact. In this review, we will discuss the analytical technologies and sensors for PMs and bioaerosols. We will first introduce four types of PM analyser, namely filter-based gravimetric method (GMM), optical method, β-ray absorption method (BAM), and tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM). We will provide examples of how commercial analyzers of different principles have been compared and calibrated for specific applications under different climate conditions of specific geographic locations. For bioaerosols, having more complex biological and biochemical identity, we will start from air sampling techniques, followed by the discussion of various detection methods (plate culture, molecular methods, immunoassays and biosensors) in association with compatible sampling technologies. Using Influenza A (H1N1) virus and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus as examples, we have highlighted the differential air sampling and detection challenges for viral aerosols relative to bacterial and fungal aerosols.

OBJECTIVE To assess the prognostic value of cerebral oxygen saturation measurement (rSO2) for assessing prognosis on patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. DESIGN Retrospective analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS We analyzed 25 post-CPR patients (12 female and 13 male). All the patients were cooled to a target temperature of 33-34°C. The Glascow Coma Scale (GCS), Corneal Reflexes (CR), Pupillary Reflexes (PR), arterial Base Excess (BE) and rSO2 measurements were taken on admission. The rewarming GCS, CR, PR, BE and rSO2 measurements were made after the patient's temperature reached 36°C. RESULTS In survivors, the baseline rSO2 value was 67.5 (46-70) and the percent difference between baseline and rewarming rSO2 value was 0.03 (0.014-0.435). In non-survivors, the baseline rSO2 value was 30 (25-65) and the percent difference between baseline and rewarming rSO2 value was 0.031 (-0.08 to -20). No statistical difference was detected on percent changes between baseline and rewarming values of rSO2. Statistically significant difference was detected between baseline and rewarming GCS groups (p=0.004). No statistical difference was detected between GCS, CR, PR, BE and rSO2 to determine the prognosis. CONCLUSION Despite higher values of rSO2 on survivors than non-survivors, we found no statistically considerable difference between groups on baseline and the rewarming rSO2 values. Since the measurement is simple, and not affected by hypotension and hypothermia, the rSO2 may be a useful predictor for determining the prognosis after CPR.","Inal, Mehmet Turan; Memiş, Dilek; Yıldırım, Ilker; Uğur, Hüseyin; Erkaymaz, Aysegul; Turan, F Nesrin",Revista brasileira de anestesiologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjan.2016.07.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28412053/,510
104600,Covid-19: challenges for people with intellectual disability.,2020-04-29,"Lung ultrasound is increasingly used in emergency departments, medical wards, and critical care units-adult, pediatric, and neonatal. In vitro and in vivo studies show that the number and type of artifacts visualized change with lung density. This has led to the idea of a quantitative lung ultrasound approach, opening up new prospects for use not only as a diagnostic but also as a monitoring tool. Consequently, the multiple scoring systems proposed in the last few years have different technical approaches and specific clinical indications, adaptable for more or less time-dependent patients. However, multiple scoring systems may generate confusion among physicians aiming at introducing lung ultrasound in their clinical practice. This review describes the various lung ultrasound scoring systems and aims to clarify their use in different settings, focusing on technical aspects, validation with reference techniques, and clinical applications.","Mongodi, Silvia; De Luca, Daniele; Colombo, Andrea; Stella, Andrea; Santangelo, Erminio; Corradi, Francesco; Gargani, Luna; Rovida, Serena; Volpicelli, Giovanni; Bouhemad, Bélaid; Mojoli, Francesco",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000003757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819339/,510

The Epidemiology of Pediatric Fractures During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-05-19,"Introduction: Human adenovirus (HAdV)-derived vectors have been used in numerous pre-clinical and clinical trials during the last 40 years. Current research in HAdV-based vaccines focuses on improving transgene immunogenicity and safety. Because pre-existing humoral immunity against HAdV types correlate with reduced vaccine efficacy and safety, many groups are exploring the development of HAdV types vectors with lower seroprevalence. However, global seroepidemiological data are incomplete. Areas covered: The goal of this review is to centralize 65 years of research on (primarily) HAdV epidemiology. After briefly addressing adenovirus biology, we chronical HAdV seroprevalence studies and highlight major milestones. Finally, we analyze data from about 50 studies with respect to HAdVs types that are currently used in the clinic, or are in the developmental pipeline. Expert opinion: Vaccination is among the most efficient tools to prevent infectious disease. HAdV-based vaccines have undeniable potential, but optimization is needed and antivector immunity remains a challenge if the same vectors are to be administrated to different populations. Here, we identify gaps in our knowledge and the need for updated worldwide epidemiological data.","Mennechet, Franck J D; Paris, Océane; Ouoba, Aline Raissa; Salazar Arenas, Sofia; Sirima, Sodiomon B; Takoudjou Dzomo, Guy R; Diarra, Amidou; Traore, Isidore T; Kania, Dramane; Eichholz, Karsten; Weaver, Eric A; Tuaillon, Edouard; Kremer, Eric J",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2019.1588113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132024/,510
106887,Alcohol consumption in the Covid-19 Era.,2020-03-27,"The period during and after World War II saw enormous changes in the practice and status of anaesthesia, as well as in female participation. This article offers an account of three South African (SA) women who trained in anaesthetics before and during the War and participated in these changes. By the mid-1960s, they presided over the three independent anaesthetic departments at Johannesburg's three main teaching hospitals, teaching generations of junior doctors. The first woman to register as a specialist anaesthetist in SA, Miriam (Mollie) Barlow, broke the glass ceiling in her own career by lobbying for the professional rights of medical women, although working within the constraints of the medical and political establishment. She also contributed to important SA research on malignant hyperthermia. Hilde Ginsberg collaborated with Barlow in the 1950s, reducing intraoperative and perioperative mortality at Coronation Hospital, and fought for key interventions in anaesthetic practice and policy through the South African Society of Anaesthetists (SASA), becoming its most long-serving and honoured female member. Kathleen Barbara Vetten's exemplary career in academic medicine, including pioneering animal research (developing anaesthetic techniques for open-heart surgery in dogs and protocols for liver transplantation in primates) and a successful operation to separate craniopagus twins, shows both the achievement of and limits to female achievement at the end of this period.

METHODOLOGY A retrospective cohort study among HIV-infected patients at two intermediate hospitals. A decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significant if it was ≥25% and included a change to a lower eGFR stage. New-onset RI was defined as an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 . RESULTS 10 387 patients were included: 11.4% (n = 1182) experienced the decline in eGFR. Of these, 0.6% (n = 62) migrated to eGFR stages IV and V. The incidence was 4.5 (95% CI: 4.3-4.8) per 100 patient years. RI developed in 400 patients for an incidence rate of 2.4 (95% CI: 2.2-2.6) cases per 100 patient years. Risk factors with effect sizes >2.0, for decline-in-eGFR were baseline eGFR >60 (aHR = 15.6); hyperfiltration (aHR = 5.0); and pregnancy (aHR = 2.4); while for RI, they were hyperfiltration (aHR = 4.1) and pregnancy (aHR = 29). CONCLUSION The incidence of decline-in-eGFR was higher than in other sub-SSA countries, but not RI. A high baseline eGFR had the greatest risk for the decline, and hyperfiltration for the RI.","Kalemeera, Francis; Godman, Brian; Stergachis, Andy; Rennie, Timothy",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.5125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006803/,510

TBI initiates a complex cascade of events which can lead to significant secondary brain damage. Great interest exists in directly measuring cerebral oxygen delivery and demand after TBI to prevent this secondary injury. Several invasive, catheter-based devices are now available which directly monitor the partial pressure of oxygen in brain tissue (PbtO2), yet significant equipoise exists regarding their clinical use in severe TBI. RECENT FINDINGS There are currently three ongoing multicenter randomized controlled trials studying the use of PbtO2 monitoring in severe TBI: BOOST-3, OXY-TC, and BONANZA. All three have similar inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment protocols, and outcome measures. Despite mixed existing evidence, use of PbtO2 is already making its way into new TBI guidelines such as the recent Seattle International Brain Injury Consensus Conference. Analysis of high-fidelity data from multimodal monitoring, however, suggests that PbtO2 may only be one piece of the puzzle in severe TBI. SUMMARY While current evidence regarding the use of PbtO2 remains mixed, three ongoing clinical trials are expected to definitively answer the question of what role PbtO2 monitoring plays in severe TBI.","Leach, Matthew R; Shutter, Lori A",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560016/,510
110283,COVID-19 and African American Religious Institutions.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Human blood and saliva are increasingly under investigation for the detection of biomarkers for early diagnosis of non-communicable diseases like cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, etc. as well as communicable diseases like coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Exploring the potential application of human tears, an easily accessible body fluid, for the diagnosis of various diseases is the need of the hour. A thin layer of tears covers the ocular surface, which acts as a mechanical and antimicrobial obstacle and maintains the optical refractive property. Variations in the composition of tears and its quantities in eyes can be reflection of the health status of eyes. In this respect, tear analysis is getting extreme attention from the ophthalmology community. This review deals with a comprehensive account of applications of tear analysis using different techniques, their comparison and overall progress achieved till now.Areas covered:This report presents an assessment of the analysis of tears like that of other body fluids, for clinical applications both for ophthalmic and other conditions like different cancers, diabetes, coronary diseases etc. At present the techniques used for tear fluid analysis are separation methods like HPLC/UPLC/SDS-PAGE, CE etc., together with complex detection techniques like ELISA, MS etc. But, advances in instrumentation and data processing methods like PCA, ANN, it has become easy to couple the various separation methods with highly sensitive optical techniques for the analysis of complex systems like many body fluids: blood, Saliva, Tears etc.Expert opinion:Tear analysis can provide valuable information about the health condition of eyes since it contains several organic and inorganic constituents, and their relative concentrations may alter under abnormal conditions. Tear analysis has the advantage that it is totally non-invasive, easily accessible and is thus acceptable to all age groups and genders, who otherwise may be reluctant to undergo personally invasive diagnostic methods. Our report strongly recommends tear fluid as clinical sample probed by highly sensitive optical techniques to evaluate different health conditions, with special emphasis on diagnosis of eye diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome).","Adigal, Sphurti S; Rizvi, Alisha; Rayaroth, Nidheesh V; John, Reena V; Barik, Ajayakumar; Bhandari, Sulatha; George, Sajan D; Lukose, Jijo; Kartha, Vasudevan B; Chidangil, Santhosh",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737159.2021.1941879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115952/,510

The measurement of blood pressure (BP) is critical in monitoring and managing cardiovascular disease hence new wearable devices are being developed to make BP more accessible to physicians and patients. Several wearables utilize photoplethysmography from the wrist vasculature to derive BP assessment although many of these devices are still at the experimental stage. With the ultimate goal of supporting instrument development, we have developed a model of the photoplethysmographic waveform derived from the radial artery at the volar surface of the wrist. To do so we have utilized the relation between vessel biomechanics through Finite Element Method and Monte Carlo light transport model. The model shows similar features to that seen in PPG waveform captured using an off the shelf device. We observe the influence of body mass index on the PPG signal. A degradation the PPG signal of up to 40% in AC to DC signal ratio was thus observed.","Boonya-Ananta, Tananant; Rodriguez, Andres J; Ajmal, Ajmal; Du Le, Vinh Nguyen; Hansen, Anders K; Hutcheson, Joshua D; Ramella-Roman, Jessica C",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82124-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33510428/,510

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Anaesthesia was induced with xylazine 20 µg/g by intraperitoneal injection and maintained with propofol or isoflurane. Myocardial IRI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 1 hour. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the expression of RACK1 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and the heart injury score were compared between the two groups. Results: Cardiomyocyte apoptosis with ROS was significantly lower in the propofol group than in the isoflurane group. The propofol group had significantly higher RACK1 expression and lower TLR4 expression, compared with the isoflurane group (RACK1, 1970.50 ± 120.50 vs. 1350.20 ± 250.30, p<0.05; TLR4, 980.50 ± 110.75 vs. 1275.50 ± 75.35, p<0.05). However, the heart injury scores in the two groups did not differ significantly (3.56 ± 0.29 vs. 4.33 ± 0.23 in the propofol and isoflurane groups, respectively, p=0.33). Conclusion: There were significant differences in inflammation and apoptosis, including the expression of RACK1 and TLR4, after myocardial IRI between the propofol and isoflurane groups. However, both groups had similar heart injury scores.","Seo, Eun-Hye; Song, Ga-Yun; Namgung, Ji Hyeon; Oh, Chung-Sik; Lee, Seung Hyun; Kim, Seong-Hyop",International journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.22591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511370/,510

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three different c-Met inhibitors in combination with a pan-HER inhibitor (crizotinib/afatinib, tivantinib/afatinib and cabozantinib/afatinib) were investigated for their anti-tumor effects on SCCHN cell lines in vitro. In vivo activity of the combinations was tested in SCCHN cell line xenografts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) animal models generated from patients with recurrent SCCHN. RESULTS Western blot assay indicated that activation of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and c-Met was blocked by all three combinations and the downstream PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways were inhibited. Sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay revealed SCCHN cell growth was more effectively inhibited by the combinations than by single agents, particularly in cell lines with high c-Met expression. Furthermore, the combinations were more potent in inducing apoptosis than each of the single agents. In the PDX models, the combination treatments exhibited significantly better efficacy in tumor growth inhibition compared to the respective single agents. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we demonstrated that the simultaneous targeting of EGFR, HER2, and c-Met is more effective than the individual inhibition of these targets in vitro and in SCCHN cell line xenograft and PDX models.

However, success of PN interventions will depend on the willingness of users to subscribe. This study investigates the factors associated with potential users' perceived value of PN and heterogeneity in these values. METHODS A discrete choice experiment was carried out in a representative sample (N = 429 valid responses) from the adult population in Spain. The results were analysed in line with McFadden's Random Utility Theory, using conditional and mixed logit models in addition to a latent class logit model. RESULTS The conditional and mixed logit models revealed the existence of a significant preference and willingness to pay for personalised nutrition, but the effect on average was not large for the highest level of personalisation. The latent class logit revealed four classes of respondent: those who would be likely to pay for a high level of personalised nutrition service, those who would use it if it were heavily subsidised, those who would use only a basic nutrition service, and those who would not be willing to engage. These results could be useful for the design and targeting of effective personalised nutrition services. CONCLUSIONS Over half of adults currently perceive some individual benefit in a high level of PN, which may justify some degree of public subsidy in investment and delivery of such a service.","Pérez-Troncoso, Daniel; Epstein, David M; Castañeda-García, José A",Applied health economics and health policy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40258-021-00647-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900567/,510

Only 10% of conventionally treated patients reach these goals as a composite endpoint. The efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in meeting this composite endpoint has not been reported. METHODS We compared our database of patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing RYGB to a database of patients with medically managed type 2 diabetes and at least 2 years of follow-up data. RESULTS Ultimately, 152 RYGB patients were compared to 115 routine medical management (RMM) patients for whom data on the composite endpoint were available over 2 years. The results show significant decrease in body mass index (kilograms per square meter) in the RYGB group compared to the RMM group (P < 0.001). HbA1C, LDL cholesterol, and SBP all significantly improved in the RYGB group (all P ≤ 0.01) and did not demonstrate any significant change in the RMM group. Over 2 years, when evaluating all three endpoints, the RYGB group (10.5% to 38.2%, P < 0.001) demonstrated increased achievement of the ADA goals compared to the RMM group (13.9% to 17.4%, P = 0.47). There was a significant decrease in medication use in the RYGB cohort; however, discontinuation of medications was sometimes inappropriate.

114896,The Psychodynamic Psychiatrist and Psychiatric Care in the Era of COVID-19.,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas are commonly missed on imaging or misdiagnosed as inflammatory or neoplastic processes. We reviewed a consecutive series of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas referred to our institution that were missed or misdiagnosed on initial imaging and studied the clinical consequences of missing or misdiagnosing the lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas diagnosed at our institution between January 1, 2000, and November 1, 2014. A lesion was defined as ""misdiagnosed"" if initial MR imaging or CT myelography demonstrated characteristic imaging features of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula but the patient was clinically or radiologically misdiagnosed. Outcomes included length of delay of diagnosis, increased disability (increase in mRS or Aminoff motor disability of ≥1 point) between initial imaging evaluation and diagnosis date, and posttreatment disability. RESULTS Fifty-three consecutive spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas that were initially misdiagnosed despite having characteristic imaging findings on MR imaging or CT myelography were included in our study. Eight patients (18.9%) underwent spinal angiography before referral, which was interpreted as having negative findings but was either incomplete (6 cases) or retrospectively demonstrated the spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (2 cases). The median time of delayed diagnosis was 6 months (interquartile range, 2-14 months). Fifty-one patients (96.2%) had increased disability between the initial study, which demonstrated features of a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, and diagnosis. Thirty-two patients (60.4%) developed a new requirement for a walker or wheelchair. Following treatment, 21 patients (41.2%) had an improvement of 1 point on the mRS or Aminoff motor disability scale. CONCLUSIONS Delayed diagnosis of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula with characteristic imaging features results in high rates of additional disability that are often irreversible despite surgical or endovascular treatment of the fistula.","Brinjikji, W; Nasr, D M; Morris, J M; Rabinstein, A A; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

115565,Status of Pituitary Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020,"Bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics is of major concern. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered as excellent alternatives. Among them, D-cateslytin (D-Ctl, derivative of a host defense peptide), has shown high efficiency against a broad spectrum of bacteria. The first target of AMPs is the outer membrane of the bacterium. However, the role of bacterial cell-wall structures on D-Ctl mechanism of action has not yet been understood. In this study, we investigated the activity of D-Ctl on two isogenic strains of E. coli: one is nude of any parietal structures, the other constitutively overexpresses only Type 1 fimbriae. We studied the damages caused by D-Ctl at several initial concentrations of bacteria and D-Ctl, and times of exposure to D-Ctl were examined using a combination of epifluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR-FTIR). The analysis of nanomechanical and spectrochemical properties related to the antibacterial mechanism showed a concentration dependent activity. Whereas the membrane permeabilization was evidenced for all concentrations of D-Ctl and both mutants, no pore formation was observed. The bacterial stiffness is modified dramatically concomitantly to major membrane damages and changes in the spectral fingerprints of the bacteria. In case of the occurrence of Type 1 fimbriae only, an intracellular activity was additionally detected. Our results evidenced that D-Ctl activity is highly impacted by the cell-wall external structures and surface properties of the bacteria.","Quilès, Fabienne; Barth, Danielle; Peric, Oliver; Fantner, Georg E; Francius, Grégory",ACS chemical biology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.0c00622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935970/,510

We report a unique case of a new strain of Clostridium sordellii (not present in the Center for Disease Control (CDC) database) infection induced toxic shock syndrome in a previously healthy two-year-old male with colitis-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The patient presented with dehydration, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. He was transferred to the pediatric critical care unit (PICU) for initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Due to increased edema and intolerance of PD, he was transitioned to hemodialysis through a femoral vascular catheter. He subsequently developed severe septic shock with persistent leukocytosis and hypotension, resulting in subsequent death. Stool culture confirmed Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli 0157:H7. A blood culture was positively identified for Clostridium sordellii.

We evaluated trends in outcomes and management of tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulas and performed a meta-analysis evaluating clinical and angiographic outcomes by treatment technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search for studies on surgical and endovascular treatment of tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulas. We compared the proportion of patients undergoing endovascular, surgical, and combined endovascular/surgical management; the proportion of patients presenting with ruptured tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulas; and proportion of patients with good neurologic outcome across 3 time periods: 1980-1995, 1996-2005, and 2006-2014. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis, evaluating the rates of occlusion, long-term good neurologic outcome, perioperative morbidity, and resolution of symptoms for the 3 treatment modalities. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies with 274 patients were included. The proportion of patients treated with surgical treatment alone decreased from 38.7% to 20.4% between 1980-1995 and 2006-2014. The proportion of patients treated with endovascular therapy alone increased from 16.1% to 48.0%. The proportion of patients presenting with ruptured tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulas decreased from 64.4% to 43.6%. The rate of good neurologic outcome increased from 80.7% to 92.9%. Complete occlusion rates were highest for patients receiving multimodality treatment (84.0%; 95% CI, 72.0%-91.0%) and lowest for endovascular treatment (71.0%; 95% CI, 56.0%-83.0%; P < .01). Long-term good neurologic outcome was highest in the endovascular group (89.0%; 95% CI, 80.0%-95.0%) and lowest for the surgical group (73.0%; 95% CI, 51.0%-87.0%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS Patients with tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulas are increasingly presenting with unruptured lesions, being treated endovascularly, and experiencing higher rates of good neurologic outcomes. Endovascular treatment was associated with superior neurologic outcomes but lower occlusion rates.","Cannizzaro, D; Brinjikji, W; Rammos, S; Murad, M H; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

Even as technologies continue to evolve and develop, interest in some of the advantages of specimen retrieval transvaginally has been roused and we describe a case of combined laparoscopic splenectomy and hysterectomy with transvaginal retrieval of both specimens. PRESENTATION OF CASE Patient underwent laparoscopic splenectomy and robot-assisted hysterectomy with transvaginal delivery of specimens. Total operative time was 245min with no complications. Closure of the colpotomy was achieved laparoscopically. Post-operative course was unremarkable. Patient has done well clinically at 18 months follow-up except for an episode of post-coital spotting, which resolved spontaneously. DISCUSSION We explored the technical feasibility of concurrent laparoscopic splenectomy and hysterectomy along with transvaginal retrieval of both solid organs without morcellation. We wanted to illustrate the fact that transvaginal organ extraction may be performed safely in a community or district hospital with standard instruments without incurring additional cost, morbidity or increased operating time. CONCLUSION Transvaginal specimen retrieval was technically easy to accomplish. Our patient has not experienced any infectious complications or sexual dysfunction to date. For surgeons exploring an alternative to transabdominal specimen retrieval, transvaginal NOSE is an attractive proposition with several advantages. When combined with a gynecological procedure that involves a colpotomy, this may present a unique opportunity to explore the utility of NOSE.","Ramalingam, Mohan; King, Jon; Jaacks, Lisa",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.07.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24270286/,510

METHODS The data in this registry were drawn from implantation centers, which voluntarily completed a data collection sheet. RESULTS In 2020, 7056 implant sheets were received compared with 7106 reported by Eucomed (European Confederation of Medical Suppliers Associations), indicating that data were collected from 99% of the devices implanted in Spain. Completion of the implant sheet ranged from 99.8% for the field ""name of the implanting hospital"" to 2.6% for the variable ""referral hospital"". A total of 173 hospitals performed ICD implants and participated in the registry, which is a similar figure to that in 2019 (n=172). The total rate of registered implants was 149/million inhabitants (150 according to Eucomed), revealing a slight reduction in implants in Spain in 2020 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduction was uneven among the autonomous communities. CONCLUSIONS The Spanish Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Registry for 2020 shows an improvement in the rate of implants reported and a reduction in the number of ICD implants, which likely reflects the decrease in hospital activity not related to the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Similar to previous years, the total number of implants in Spain is still much lower than the average for the European Union, with an increase in the differences between Spanish autonomous communities.","Fernández Lozano, Ignacio; Osca Asensi, Joaquín; Alzueta Rodríguez, Javier",Revista espanola de cardiologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rec.2021.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583912/,510

METHODS The three children and their parents were subjected to whole exome sequencing, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS All patients had ocular anomalies including microphthalmia, microcornea, lens opacity, and coloboma of iris, optic nerve, retina and choroid. And all were found to carry heterozygous variants of the CHD7 gene, which included two frameshifting variant, namely c.1447delG (p.Val483Leufs*12) and c.1021_1048delAATCAGTCCGTACCAAGATACCCCAATG (p.Asn341Leufs*2) in exon 2, which were unreported previously and were pathogenic based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards and guidelines (PVS1+PM2+PM6), and a nonsense variant c.7957C>T (p.Arg2653*) in exon 36, which was known to be likely pathogenic (PVS1+PM2+PP4). Sanger sequencing confirmed that the two frameshifting mutations were de novo, and the nonsense mutation was also suspected to be de novo.

A total of 2601 women living in Spain aged 14-35 years completed questionnaire measures of SNS use, self-esteem, body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness. In the survey, participants were asked about their use of SNS at the moment of answering the survey and before lockdown. A statistically significant increase was found in the frequency of use of all studied SNS (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook) during lockdown, as well as in the number of women following appearance-focused Instagram accounts. Moreover, significant relationships were found between the frequency of Instagram use and body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and low self-esteem in the younger age group (14-24), and between the frequency of Instagram use and drive for thinness in the older age group (25-35). Following appearance-focused accounts on Instagram was related to body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness in the younger group, and only to drive for thinness in the older group (25-35). Following appearance-focused accounts on Instagram and a higher frequency of use of Instagram significantly predicted higher levels of drive for thinness. These results suggest that lockdown has had an impact on SNS use, and this might be linked to increased drive for thinness and eating disorder risk among adolescents and young women.","Vall-Roqué, Helena; Andrés, Ana; Saldaña, Carmina",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662532/,510

Diffusion is activated using laser light or solvent vapour jets-a process that can be finely modulated down to molecule-on-demand deposition precision with almost photolithographic resolution (<5 μm) and speeds (3 mm s-1). Examples of principal pattern types are presented including molecular conformation for integrated photonics; chain orientation for polarised security features and micro-engineered electronics; and doping with local conductivity values >3 S cm-1 for improved electronic devices.

Since 2013, India has been regulating prices of drugs included in its national list of essential medicines (NLEM). Here we evaluate the cost variations among available cardiovascular drugs and perform cost-analysis comparing essential and non-essential drugs. METHODS Data on listed prices of selected cardiovascular drugs -essential (NLEM) and non-essential (NNLEM), were sourced from multiple drug information compendia. Price of medications was calculated in cost-per-defined-daily-dose (DDD)-units and NLEM vs. NNLEM drugs were compared. Regression analysis was used to explore the determinants of percentage cost variation (PCV) of drugs. RESULTS The median-cost/DDD of essential medicines was lower as compared to non-essential ones for all therapeutic drug classes, with greatest difference observed for antianginals and least for heart failure medicines. There were substantial cost variations with values in excess of 1000% for six medicines, all being essential. The regression analysis failed to demonstrate a significant effect of essentiality on PCV (β=0.19, P=0.314). CONCLUSIONS Our analyses demonstrate considerable cost variations for essential cardiovascular medicines. Given the need for prolonged and often, lifelong-treatment, there is significant potential for cost savings based on chosen brand, highlighting the need for patient as well as prescriber education.","Khanijo, Simran; Kakkar, Ashish Kumar; Kumar, Rohit; Patil, Amol; Bhusal, Gomata; Vishwas, Gopal; Arora, Gitika",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2020.1783248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32552127/,510

Project BioShield, managed by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA), guides and supports academia and industry with potential MCMs through the Food & Drug Administration's approval process and ultimately supports the acquisition of successful products into the SNS. Public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ever-increasing number of MCMs in the SNS present logistical and financial challenges to its maintenance. While MCMs for biological agents have been readily adopted, those for chemical agents have required sustained investments.

We provide an update on changes in the epidemiology of 25 selected infectious, wildlife-related diseases in Europe (from 2010-16) that had an impact, or may have a future impact, on the health of wildlife, livestock, and humans. These pathogens were selected based on their: 1) identification in recent Europe-wide projects as important surveillance targets, 2) inclusion in European Union legislation as pathogens requiring obligatory surveillance, 3) presence in recent literature on wildlife-related diseases in Europe since 2010, 4) inclusion in key pathogen lists released by the Office International des Epizooties, 5) identification in conference presentations and informal discussions on a group email list by a European network of wildlife disease scientists from the European Wildlife Disease Association, or 6) identification as pathogens with changes in their epidemiology during 2010-16. The wildlife pathogens or diseases included in this review are: avian influenza virus, seal influenza virus, lagoviruses, rabies virus, bat lyssaviruses, filoviruses, canine distemper virus, morbilliviruses in aquatic mammals, bluetongue virus, West Nile virus, hantaviruses, Schmallenberg virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, African swine fever virus, amphibian ranavirus, hepatitis E virus, bovine tuberculosis ( Mycobacterium bovis), tularemia ( Francisella tularensis), brucellosis ( Brucella spp.), salmonellosis ( Salmonella spp.), Coxiella burnetii, chytridiomycosis, Echinococcus multilocularis, Leishmania infantum, and chronic wasting disease. Further work is needed to identify all of the key drivers of disease change and emergence, as they appear to be influencing the incidence and spread of these pathogens in Europe. We present a summary of these recent changes during 2010-16 to discuss possible commonalities and drivers of disease change and to identify directions for future work on wildlife-related diseases in Europe. Many of the pathogens are entering Europe from other continents while others are expanding their ranges inside and beyond Europe. Surveillance for these wildlife-related diseases at a continental scale is therefore important for planet-wide assessment, awareness of, and preparedness for the risks they may pose to wildlife, domestic animal, and human health.","Yon, Lisa; Duff, J Paul; Ågren, Erik O; Erdélyi, Károly; Ferroglio, Ezio; Godfroid, Jacques; Hars, Jean; Hestvik, Gete; Horton, Daniel; Kuiken, Thijs; Lavazza, Antonio; Markowska-Daniel, Iwona; Martel, An; Neimanis, Aleksija; Pasmans, Frank; Price, Stephen J; Ruiz-Fons, Francisco; Ryser-Degiorgis, Marie-Pierre; Widén, Frederik; Gavier-Widén, Dolores",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://doi.org/10.7589/2017-07-172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30284963/,510

DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional study including healthcare professionals in the emergency department and other units serving patients with COVID-19, of a training and research hospital in Turkey. METHODS 210 volunteers, including 105 healthcare professionals in the emergency department and 105 healthcare professionals working in other departments rendering services for COVID-19 patients, were included in this study. A sociodemographic data form and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF-TR) and Religious Orientation Scale were applied to the volunteers. RESULTS The perceived stress levels and PSQI subscores were found to be significantly higher among the volunteers working in the emergency department than among those in other departments. The risk of development of anxiety among women was 16.6 times higher than among men. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare professionals on the frontline need systematic regular psychosocial support mechanisms.

Limited data are available regarding robotic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLA) in this setting. OBJECTIVE Analyze our experience performing robotic extended PLA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 143 consecutive men with intermediate- or high-risk clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent robotic extended PLA and radical prostatectomy between September 2010 and November 2011 by a single surgeon. SURGICAL PROCEDURE Lymph node packets were sent separately from bilateral common, external, and internal iliacs, obturators, node of Cloquet, and anterior prostatic fat. MEASUREMENTS Descriptive statistics were used to summarize lymph node yields and positive nodes. Clinical variables were examined in logistic regression models to predict lymph node positivity. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Median lymph node yield was 20 (range: 9-65, interquartile range: 15-25). Eighteen patients (13%) were found to have metastatic prostate cancer in the lymph nodes. The mean number of positive nodes found was 2.9 (range: 1-11). In 14 of 18 node-positive patients (78%), the extent of nodal invasion was outside the boundaries of a limited PLA. For four patients with positive nodes (22%), prostate biopsy predicted unilateral disease but PLA revealed contralateral positive lymph nodes. A total of 82% of patients experienced no complications, and most Clavien grade 1-2 complications consisted of anastomotic leakage, urinary retention, ileus, and lymphocele. Only 4% of patients experienced a grade 3 complication. Under multivariate regression analysis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage, and maximum biopsy core tumor volume were identified as significant predictors of finding positive pelvic lymph nodes (area under the curve: 91%). The main limitations include short follow-up and lack of randomization. CONCLUSIONS Robotic extended bilateral PLA for prostate cancer up to the common iliac bifurcation increases nodal yield and positive nodal rate and can be performed safely. PSA, clinical stage, and maximum biopsy core volume are predictors for lymph node invasion. Long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate for therapeutic benefit.","Yuh, Bertram E; Ruel, Nora H; Mejia, Rosa; Wilson, Chelsea M; Wilson, Timothy G",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2012.01.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366188/,510

Therefore we aimed to evaluate the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on the treatment of type 2 diabetes. METHODS All patients, who underwent morbid obesity surgery during 2013-2014 and had a HbA1c >6 % were included in this prospective study. Demographical data, usage of oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin were recorded, and laboratory findings as HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at the 6th and 12th months. Diabetes remission criteria were used to assess success of the surgical treatment. RESULTS Totally 88 patients were included in this study. 55 patients were using oral antidiabetic drugs and 33 patients were using insulin. At the 6th month complete remission was observed in 80 (90.9 %), partial remission in 3 (3.4 %) and persistent diabetes in 5 (5.6 %) patients. At the 12th month complete remission was observed in 84 (95.4 %), partial remission in 1 (1.1 %) and persistent diabetes in 3 (3.4 %) patients.

The current review meticulously summarizes the COVID-19 pandemic situation through the lens of science from the inception of the outbreak to the current progression, which is valuable to mitigate the current pandemic situation. METHODS We reviewed all the relevant literature available on PubMed, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and World Health Organization (WHO) website related to COVID-19 from the inception of the outbreak to 18 June 2020. We selected ninety different scientific studies and reports to compile the current review. RESULTS Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a betacoronavirus with four major structural proteins encoded by S, M, E, and N genes and distinct in morphology. The potential provenance of SARS-Cov-2 is zoonotic, and it binds to the host cell receptors by spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle carries on through direct contact, air, inanimate objects, and contaminated surfaces. The reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is 2 to 3.5, representing that one infected patient can spread this virus to two to three people. An expeditious laboratory diagnosis has a pivotal role in patient management and prevention. Due to the lack of definitive treatment, symptomatic medication regimen and supportive organ therapies are adapted for debilitated patients. CONCLUSIONS Nucleoside analogs and protease-inhibitors have approved to attenuate the viral infection until the discovery of a specific drug.

128462,Rotating between day and night shifts: Factors influencing sleep patterns of hospital nurses.,2021-05-27,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation are the two most utilized forms of ablative therapy, and the most mature. Recent follow-up studies have been published that further highlight their possible roles as relevant treatment options for select patients with renal cell carcinoma. RECENT FINDINGS Three- and five-year outcomes following cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation have recently been published, respectively, each showing 93-98% cancer-specific survival in small cohorts. Several other single-institution series have been published showing favorable outcomes based on imaging findings alone, albeit with much shorter follow-up times. These findings are mitigated by the probability that some of the treated small tumors may have been benign and those that were malignant may have been indolent. SUMMARY The longest-term outcomes of probe-ablative therapy with cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation suggest satisfactory outcomes by imaging when careful patient selection and rigorous attention to technical details are utilized. Imaging findings alone usually provide the only surrogate measure of success. Given the limitations of current imaging techniques and the indolent growth rate of many of these tumors, however, continued stringent selection criteria and rigorous follow-up of all patients undergoing ablative therapy is required.","Matin, Surena F; Ahrar, Kamran",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0b013e3282f4a869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18303535/,510

129651,Evaluation of Patients Presenting to the Ophthalmology Department of a Tertiary Hospital for Nonemergency Reasons During the Covid-19 Pandemic.,2020,"STUDY DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional study OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of adding haptic input during walking in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). SETTING Research laboratory. METHODS Participants with iSCI and age- and sex-matched able-bodied (AB) individuals walked normally (SCI n = 18, AB n = 17) and in tandem (SCI n = 12, AB n = 17). Haptic input was added through light touch on a railing. Step parameters, and mediolateral and anterior-posterior margins of stability (means and standard deviations) were calculated. Surface electromyography data were collected bilaterally from the tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), and gluteus medius (GMED) and integrated over a stride. Repeated measures ANOVAs examined within- and between-group differences (α = 0.05). Cutaneous and proprioceptive sensation of individuals with iSCI were correlated to changes in outcome measures that were affected by haptic input. RESULTS When walking normally, adding haptic input decreased stride velocity, step width, stride length, MOSML, MOSML_SD, MOSAP, and MOSAP_SD, and increased GMED activity on the limb opposite the railing. During tandem walking, haptic input had no effect; however, individuals with iSCI had a larger step width SD and MOSML_SD compared with the AB group. Sensory abilities of individuals with iSCI were not correlated to any of the outcome measures that significantly changed with added haptic input. CONCLUSIONS Added haptic input improved balance control during normal but not in tandem walking. Sensory abilities did not impact the use of added haptic input during walking.","Oates, Alison R; Arora, Tarun; Lanovaz, Joel L; Musselman, Kristin E",Spinal cord,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-020-0516-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647327/,510

We examined the added utility of analyzing Twitter data to improve USC monitoring. METHODS Georgia public school data were obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics. We identified school and district Twitter accounts with 1 or more tweets ever posted (""active""), and their USC-related tweets in the 2015-16 and 2016-17 school years. CDC researchers provided OSS-identified USC reports. Descriptive statistics, univariate, and multivariable logistic regression were computed. RESULTS A majority (1,864/2,299) of Georgia public schools had, or were in a district with, active Twitter accounts in 2017. Among these schools, 638 were identified with USCs in 2015-16 (Twitter only, 222; OSS only, 2015; both, 201) and 981 in 2016-17 (Twitter only, 178; OSS only, 107; both, 696). The marginal benefit of adding Twitter as a data source was an increase in the number of schools identified with USCs by 53% (222/416) in 2015-16 and 22% (178/803) in 2016-17.

Reports of using laparoscopic splenorraphy for spleen salvage were fewer and mainly limited to lower grades of injuries. No study has focused on the role of laparoscopic splenorraphy in the treatment of patients with high grades of splenic injuries. METHODS Medical records of 15 patients with high grades of splenic injuries that required an operation for failed nonoperative management were retrospectively reviewed. They underwent a new technique of sandwich repair laparoscopically for spleen salvage by 3 surgeons who had adequate training in laparoscopy for trauma. Preoperative parameters, sandwich repair technique, perioperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Fourteen of the 15 (93.3%) patients underwent the technique successfully with 1 patient converting to laparotomy. The median (interquartile range) time to reach hemostasis was 30.0 (26.0-40.0) minutes, and the median overall operation time was 135.0 (120.0-165.0) minutes. Median blood loss amount was 1300.0 (750.0-2300.0) mL. The median length of hospital stay was 8.0 (7.0-11.0) days, and the intensive care unit stay was 2.0 (0.0-4.0) days. No mortality was noted. No rebleeding, total splenic infarction, or intra-abdominal abscess was noted during 3-month follow-up after the operation.

At the time, Duke and other universities across the country were wrestling with the question of how to safely welcome students back to campus in the Fall. Because of this, our project focused on using mathematical models to evaluate strategies to suppress the spread of the virus on campus, specifically in dorms and in classrooms. For dorms, we show that giving students single rooms rather than double rooms can substantially reduce virus spread. For classrooms, we show that moving classes with size above some cutoff online can make the basic reproduction number $ R_0 < 1 $, preventing a wide spread epidemic. The cutoff will depend on the contagiousness of the disease in classrooms.","Borowiak, Molly; Ning, Fayfay; Pei, Justin; Zhao, Sarah; Tung, Hwai-Ray; Durrett, Rick",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2021030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525107/,510

However, in severe environments where electrical power supply and cable connection are not available, the sensing of air flow in a self-powered way is a challenging issue. In this work, we reported a tribo-induced smart reflector to achieve the self-powered wireless sensing of the air flow by combining an aerodynamics-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a silver-coated polymer network liquid crystal. Upon being driven by the air flow, the developed reflector performed specular and diffused reflectance without and with charging by the TENG, respectively, enabling wireless sensing through mechanical-electrical-optical signal conversion. In the developed sensing paradigm, the sensing module can be fully self-powered without the need of signal pre-amplification, which is electrically separated from the light source and detection modules without cable connections. The applications of self-powered wireless wind speed sensing and breath monitoring were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed paradigm toward self-powered wireless sensing nodes in the internet of things.","Wang, Jiaqi; Liu, Pengcheng; Meng, Cuiling; Kwok, Hoi Sing; Zi, Yunlong",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c04048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913332/,510

134256,Drug Shortage and Critical Medication Inventory Management at a Children's Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021,"Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting a relatively small proportion of the global population, its effects have already reached everyone. The pandemic has the potential to differentially disadvantage chronically ill patients, including those with Parkinson's disease (PD). The first health care reaction has been to limit access to clinics and neurology wards to preserve fragile patients with PD from being infected. In some regions, the shortage of medical staff has also forced movement disorders neurologists to provide care for patients with COVID-19. Objective To share the experience of various movement disorder neurologists operating in different world regions and provide a common approach to patients with PD, with a focus on those already on advanced therapies, which may serve as guidance in the current pandemic and for emergency situations that we may face in the future. Conclusion Most of us were unprepared to deal with this condition given that in many health care systems, telemedicine has been only marginally available or only limited to email or telephone contacts. In addition, to ensure sufficient access to intensive care unit beds, most elective procedures (including deep brain stimulation or the initiation of infusion therapies) have been postponed. We all hope there will soon be a time when we will return to more regular hospital schedules. However, we should consider this crisis as an opportunity to change our approach and encourage our hospitals and health care systems to facilitate the remote management of chronic neurological patients, including those with advanced PD.","Fasano, Alfonso; Antonini, Angelo; Katzenschlager, Regina; Krack, Paul; Odin, Per; Evans, Andrew H; Foltynie, Thomas; Volkmann, Jens; Merello, Marcelo",Movement disorders clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1002/mdc3.12965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373652/,510
134928,"The Role of Virtual Physical Therapy in a Post Pandemic World - Pearls, Pitfalls, Challenges, and Adaptations.",2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral repair is safe, with lower wound infection rates compared with open repair. 'Venetian blinds' technique of plication in combination with mesh reinforcement, is totally intra-corporeal, with hernia defect and sac plication to reduce seroma formation. While laparoscopic suturing of the abdominal wall can represent a technical challenge, pre-operative botulinum toxin A (BTA) injections as an adjunct can assist. This study aims to demonstrate feasibility and efficacy of this technique in abdominal wall hernia repair, with BTA adjunct in midline hernias. METHODS A single-centre case series was conducted using minimally invasive 'Venetian blinds' technique for repair of complex ventral abdominal hernias. Twelve patients (seven midline, five non-midline) underwent repair (11 laparoscopic; one robotic). Midline hernias received BTA (200-300 units Botox) 4-6 weeks prior to surgery. Repairs were mesh-reinforced following fascial closure. RESULTS Twelve (10 female, two male) patients, with a median age 72 years (range 31-83) and body mass index of 27.3 kg/m2 (range 22.8-61.7) were included. The median length of operation was 133 min (range 45-290) and length of hospital stay 3 days (range 1-28). To date there has been no recurrence of hernia. A single symptomatic seroma was treated with antibiotics and did not require mesh removal. One patient developed hospital-acquired pneumonia and pseudomembranous colitis. CONCLUSION Minimally invasive 'Venetian blinds' technique has promising early results with both midline and non-midline ventral hernias. The addition of BTA is a novel and feasible combination for repair of midline ventral hernias.","Chan, Daniel L; Ravindran, Praveen; Fan, Howard S; Elstner, Kristen E; Jacombs, Anita S W; Ibrahim, Nabeel; Talbot, Michael L",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.15438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566297/,510
135795,Handwashing revisited in dental practice during the COVID-19 outbreak.,2021-06-08,"Between 2007 and 2014, 337 free-living red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) on Jersey, Channel Islands, were examined post mortem as part of a mortality and disease surveillance scheme. Road traffic accidents (RTAs) were attributable for 50.7 per cent (171/337) of the casualties, 34.4 per cent (116/337) succumbed to diseases including fatal exudative dermatitis (FED), 7.1 per cent (24/337) to predation, 6.5 per cent (22/337) to other trauma and 1.2 per cent (4/337) to suspected poisoning. Cat predation accounted for 5 per cent (17/337) of mortalities. Pathologies were diverse and individual animals were often identified with more than one disease process. Squirrelpox virus (SQPV) particles were not detected in selected cases examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Amyloid was identified in 19.3 per cent (65/337) of squirrels, often in conjunction with inflammatory lesions like hepatic capillariasis. A consistent cause of amyloid accumulation was not identified, although there was a significant association of amyloidosis with hepatic capillariasis and FED. In addition to RTAs, amyloidosis and FED have been identified as important causes of squirrel morbidity and mortality on Jersey, while the underlying aetiology and predisposing factors for these two disease complexes are presently unclear. Disease, fragmented woodlands, an increasingly suburban habitat, along with various anthropogenic factors, may jeopardise the long-term viability of this island red squirrel population.","Blackett, Tiffany Anne; Simpson, Vic R; Haugland, Sean; Everest, David J; Muir, Clare F; Smith, Kenneth C; Mill, Aileen C",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.104779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30181130/,510

Here, we longitudinally profiled vaccine responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals for 6 months after vaccination. Antibodies declined from peak levels but remained detectable in most subjects at 6 months. We found mRNA vaccines generated functional memory B cells that increased from 3-6 months post-vaccination, with the majority of these cells cross-binding the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants. mRNA vaccination further induced antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and early CD4+ T cell responses correlated with long-term humoral immunity. Recall responses to vaccination in individuals with pre-existing immunity primarily increased antibody levels without substantially altering antibody decay rates. Together, these findings demonstrate robust cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination.","Goel, Rishi R; Painter, Mark M; Apostolidis, Sokratis A; Mathew, Divij; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M; Lundgreen, Kendall A; Reynaldi, Arnold; Khoury, David S; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Gouma, Sigrid; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Hicks, Philip; Dysinger, Sarah; Hicks, Amanda; Sharma, Harsh; Herring, Sarah; Korte, Scott; Baxter, Amy E; Oldridge, Derek A; Giles, Josephine R; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Awofolaju, Moses; Tanenbaum, Nicole; Drapeau, Elizabeth M; Dougherty, Jeanette; Long, Sherea; D'Andrea, Kurt; Hamilton, Jacob T; McLaughlin, Maura; Williams, Justine C; Adamski, Sharon; Kuthuru, Oliva; Frank, Ian; Betts, Michael R; Vella, Laura A; Grifoni, Alba; Weiskopf, Daniela; Sette, Alessandro; Hensley, Scott E; Davenport, Miles P; Bates, Paul; Luning Prak, Eline T; Greenplate, Allison R; Wherry, E John; Adamski, S; Alam, Z; Addison, M M; Byrne, K T; Chandra, A; Descamps, H C; Han, N; Kaminskiy, Y; Kammerman, S C; Kim, J; Greenplate, A R; Hamilton, J T; Markosyan, N; Noll, J Han; Omran, D K; Pattekar, A; Perkey, E; Prager, E M; Pueschl, D; Rennels, A; Shah, J B; Shilan, J S; Wilhausen, N; Vanderbeck, A N",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm0829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34648302/,510

136758,The Relationship Between Media Involvement and Death Anxiety of Self-Quarantined People in the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: The Mediating Roles of Empathy and Sympathy.,2020-09-21,"BACKGROUND Absorbed doses for α-emitters are different from those for β-emitters, as the high linear energy transfer (LET) nature of α-particles results in a very dense energy deposition over a relatively short path length near the point of emission. This highly localized and therefore high energy deposition can lead to enhanced cell-killing effects at absorbed doses that are non-lethal in low-LET type of exposure. Affinities of DOTA-DPhe1-Tyr3-octreotate (DOTATATE), 115In-DOTATATE, 175Lu-DOTATATE and 209Bi-DOTATATE were determined in the K562-SST2 cell line. Two other cell lines were used for radiation response assessment; BON and CA20948, with a low and high expression of somatostatin receptors, respectively. Cellular uptake kinetics of 111In-DOTATATE were determined in CA20948 cells. CA20948 and BON were irradiated with 137Cs, 177Lu-DTPA, 177Lu-DOTATATE, 213Bi-DTPA and 213Bi-DOTATATE. Absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRDcell dosimetry method for the specific binding and a Monte Carlo model of a cylindrical 6-well plate geometry for the exposure by the radioactive incubation medium. Absorbed doses were compared to conventional irradiation of cells with 137Cs and the relative biological effect (RBE) at 10% survival was calculated. RESULTS IC50 of (labelled) DOTATATE was in the nM range. Absorbed doses up to 7 Gy were obtained by 5.2 MBq 213Bi-DOTATATE, in majority the dose was caused by α-particle radiation. Cellular internalization determined with 111In-DOTATATE showed a linear relation with incubation time. Cell survival after exposure of 213Bi-DTPA and 213Bi-DOTATATE to BON or CA20948 cells showed a linear-exponential relation with the absorbed dose, confirming the high LET character of 213Bi. The survival of CA20948 after exposure to 177Lu-DOTATATE and the reference 137Cs irradiation showed the typical curvature of the linear-quadratic model. 10% Cell survival of CA20948 was reached at 3 Gy with 213Bi-DOTATATE, a factor 6 lower than the 18 Gy found for 177Lu-DOTATATE and also below the 5 Gy after 137Cs external exposure. CONCLUSION 213Bi-DTPA and 213Bi-DOTATATE lead to a factor 6 advantage in cell killing compared to 177Lu-DOTATATE. The RBE at 10% survival by 213Bi-ligand compared to 137Cs was 2.0 whereas the RBE for 177Lu-DOTATATE was 0.3 in the CA20948 in vitro model.","Chan, Ho Sze; de Blois, Erik; Morgenstern, Alfred; Bruchertseifer, Frank; de Jong, Marion; Breeman, Wouter; Konijnenberg, Mark",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28732021/,510

However, no prospective study has compared the outcomes of chemotherapy with bevacizumab (BEV) versus cetuximab (CET). METHODS The ATOM study is the first randomised trial comparing BEV and CET for initially unresectable CRLM. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive mFOLFOX6 plus either BEV or CET. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS Between May 2013 and April 2016, 122 patients were enrolled. Median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI 9.2-13.3 months) in the BEV group and 14.8 months (95% CI 9.7-17.3 months) in the CET group (hazard ratio 0.803; P = 0.33). Patients with a smaller-number but larger-sized metastases did better in the CET group. In the BEV and CET groups, the response rates were 68.4% and 84.7% and the resection rates were 56.1% and 49.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION Although CET achieved a better response rate than BEV for patients with a small number of large liver metastases, both biologics had similar efficacy regarding liver resection and acceptable safety profiles. To achieve optimal PFS, biologics should be selected in accordance with patient conditions.

Available techniques are hampered by limited success, need for a separate delayed session for ERCP, potential complications,and/or invasiveness. This paper reports on a novel technique that involves endoscopic ultrasound(EUS)-guided access into the remnant stomach and sutured gastropexy for transgastric ERCP in a single combined session. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 10 patients with RYGB underwent transgastric ERCP using the novel technique. EUS was used to puncture the excluded stomach through the gastric pouch or jejunum,the stomach was insufflated, and a direct percutaneous gastrostomy puncture followed by sutured gastropexy was performed. ERCP was performed by passing a duodenoscope through the gastrostomy. RESULTS Technical success of EUS-assisted sutured gastropexy was achieved in nine patients (90 %),with immediate, same-session ERCP in all nine.There were no adverse events.

The difference in the median randomisation to delivery interval between immediate delivery and deferred delivery was four days (median: 0.9 (inter-quartile range (IQR) 0.4 to 1.3) days for immediate delivery, median: 4.9 (IQR 2.0 to 10.8) days in the delay group).There was no clear difference in the primary outcomes of extended perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 2.04, one trial, 587 babies, moderate-quality evidence) or the composite outcome of death or disability at or after two years of age (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.75, one trial, 573 babies, moderate-quality evidence) with immediate delivery compared to deferred delivery. The results for these outcomes are consistent with both appreciable benefit and harm. More babies in the immediate delivery group were ventilated for more than 24 hours (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.97, one trial, 576 babies). There were no differences between the immediate delivery and deferred delivery groups in any other infant mortality outcome (stillbirth, neonatal mortality, postneonatal mortality > 28 days to discharge), individual neonatal morbidity or markers of neonatal morbidity (cord pH less than 7.00, Apgar less than seven at five minutes, convulsions, interventricular haemorrhage or germinal matrix haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and periventricular leucomalacia or ventriculomegaly).Some important outcomes were not reported, in particular infant admission to neonatal intensive care or special care facility, and respiratory distress syndrome. We were not able to calculate composite rates of serious neonatal morbidity, even though individual morbidities were reported, due to the risk of double counting infants with more than one morbidity.More children in the immediate delivery group had cerebral palsy at or after two years of age (RR 5.88, 95% CI 1.33 to 26.02, one trial, 507 children). There were, however, no differences in neurodevelopment impairment at or after two years (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.41, one trial, 507 children), death at or after two years of age (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63, one trial, 573 children), or death or disability in childhood (six to 13 years of age) (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.40, one trial, 302 children). More women in the immediate delivery group had caesarean delivery than in the deferred delivery group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.24, one trial, 547 women, high-quality evidence). Data were not available on any other maternal outcomes.There were several methodological weaknesses in the included study, and the level of evidence for the primary outcomes was graded high for caesarean section and moderate for extended perinatal mortality and death or disability at or after two years. The evidence was downgraded because the CIs for these outcomes were wide, and were consistent with both appreciable benefit and harm. Bias may have been introduced by several factors: blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention, data for childhood follow-up were incomplete due to attrition, and no adjustment was made in the analysis for the non-independence of babies from multiple pregnancies (39 out of 548 pregnancies). This study only included cases of suspected fetal compromise where there was uncertainty whether immediate delivery was indicated, thus results must be interpreted with caution. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Currently there is insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of immediate delivery compared with deferred delivery in cases of suspected fetal compromise at preterm gestations to make firm recommendations. There is a lack of trials addressing this question, and limitations of the one included trial means that caution must be used in interpreting and generalising the findings. More research is needed to guide clinical practice.Although the included trial is relatively large, it has insufficient power to detect differences in neonatal mortality. It did not report any maternal outcomes other than mode of delivery, or evaluate maternal satisfaction or economic outcomes. The applicability of the findings is limited by several factors: Women with a wide range of obstetric complications and gestational ages were included, and subgroup analysis is currently limited. Advances in Doppler assessment techniques may diagnose severe compromise more accurately and help make decisions about the timing of delivery. The potential benefits of deferring delivery for longer or shorter periods cannot be presumed.Where there is uncertainty whether or not to deliver a preterm fetus with suspected fetal compromise, there seems to be no benefit to immediate delivery. Deferring delivery until test results worsen or increasing gestation favours delivery may improve the outcomes for mother and baby.There is a need for high-quality randomised controlled trials comparing immediate and deferred delivery where there is suspected fetal compromise at preterm gestations to guide clinical practice. Future trials should report all important outcomes, and should be adequately powered to detect differences in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.","Stock, Sarah J; Bricker, Leanne; Norman, Jane E; West, Helen M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd008968.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27404120/,510
141393,Preprocedure COVID-19 Testing in Early Phase of Pandemic.,2021,"This review provides results obtained by scientists from different countries on the antiviral activity of medicinal mushrooms against influenza viruses that can cause pandemics. Currently, the search for antiviral compounds is relevant in connection with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medicinal mushrooms contain biologically active compounds (polysaccharides, proteins, terpenes, melanins, etc.) that exhibit an antiviral effect. The authors present the work carried out at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology Vector in Russia, whose mission is to protect the population from biological threats. The research center possesses a collection of numerous pathogenic viruses, which allowed screening of water extracts, polysaccharides, and melanins from fruit bodies and fungal cultures. The results of investigations on different subtypes of influenza virus are presented, and special attention is paid to Inonotus obliquus (chaga mushroom). Compounds produced from this mushroom are characterized by the widest range of antiviral activity. Comparative data are presented on the antiviral activity of melanin from natural I. obliquus and submerged biomass of an effective strain isolated in culture against the pandemic strain of influenza virus A/California/07/09 (H1N1 pdm09).","Teplyakova, Tamara V; Ilyicheva, Tatyana N; Kosogova, Tatiana A; Wasser, Solomon P",International journal of medicinal mushrooms,https://doi.org/10.1615/intjmedmushrooms.2020037460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33639077/,510
141468,Blessings and Cursings: The Liberating Gift of Profanity in Clinical Pastoral Education.,2020-10-01,"After hypoxic brain injury, maintaining blood pressure within the limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation is critical to preventing secondary brain injury. Little is known about the effects of prolonged hypothermia or rewarming on autoregulation after cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that rewarming would shift the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA), that this shift would be detected by indices derived from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and that rewarming would impair autoregulation during hypertension. Anesthetized neonatal swine underwent sham surgery or hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest, followed by 2 h of normothermia and 20 h of hypothermia, with or without rewarming. Piglets were further divided into cohorts for cortical laser-Doppler flow (LDF) measurements during induced hypotension or hypertension. We also tested whether indices derived from NIRS could identify the LDF-derived LLA. The LLA did not differ significantly among groups with sham surgery and hypothermia (29 ± 8 mmHg), sham surgery and rewarming (34 ± 7 mmHg), arrest and hypothermia (29 ± 10 mmHg), and arrest and rewarming (38 ± 11 mmHg). The LLA was not affected by arrest (P = 0.60), temperature (P = 0.08), or interaction between arrest and temperature (P = 0.73). The NIRS-derived indices detected the LLA accurately, with the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves of 0.81-0.96 among groups. In groups subjected to arrest and hypothermia, with or without rewarming, the slope of LDF relative to cerebral perfusion pressure during hypertension was not significantly different from zero (P > 0.10). In conclusion, rewarming did not shift the LLA during hypotension or affect autoregulation during hypertension after asphyxic cardiac arrest. The NIRS-derived autoregulation indices identified the LLA accurately.","Larson, Abby C; Jamrogowicz, Jessica L; Kulikowicz, Ewa; Wang, Bing; Yang, Zeng-Jin; Shaffner, Donald H; Koehler, Raymond C; Lee, Jennifer K",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00238.2013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24009008/,510

Disinformation campaigns targeting health crisis communication during this pandemic seek to cripple the medical response to the novel coronavirus and instrumentalize the pandemic for political purposes. Propaganda from Russia and other factions is increasingly infiltrating public and social media in Ukraine. Still, scientific literature has only a limited amount of evidence of hybrid attacks and disinformation campaigns focusing on COVID-19 in Ukraine. We conducted a review to retrospectively examine reports of disinformation surrounding health crisis communication in Ukraine during the COVID-19 response.

142854,Deliberate practice and mastery learning in resuscitation education: A scoping review.,2021-06-01,"Marrow adipose tissue may be modulated by physical activity and reambulation after inactivity. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of reambulation for up to 2 years after 60 days of bed rest on the lumbar bone marrow composition. METHODS In a prospective clinical trial, 20 healthy men participated in a 60-day, 6-degree head-down tilt bed rest study. Serial 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measures of the lumbar spine were performed at baseline, after 57 days of bed rest, and at 30, 360, and 720 days of reambulation (100 MR imaging scans). Proton density with and without fat saturation, 2-point Dixon, and single-voxel MR spectroscopy techniques were used to assess bone marrow composition (300 measures). Erythropoiesis was measured using hematocrit, reticulocyte, and ferritin. Also, participants randomly received either a nutritional intervention composed of polyphenols, omega-3, vitamin E, and selenium or a normal diet. RESULTS Thirty days of reambulation after 60 days of bed rest caused a marked decrease of the mean lumbar vertebral fat fraction (VFF) (-9.2 ± 1.6 percentage points, -8.0 ± 1.3 percentage points, and -12.7 ± 1.2 percentage points compared with baseline using proton density, Dixon, MR spectroscopy, respectively; all 3, P < 0.05). Reambulation also decreased the fat saturation index (-5.3 ± 1.1 percentage points compared with baseline; P < 0.05). These coincided with lower hematocrit and ferritin and with increased reticulocytes at reambulation day 13 compared with baseline (all 3, P < 0.05). After 57 days of bed rest, the VFF was unchanged from baseline (all 3 MR techniques, P > 0.05); reambulation for 2 years returned the lumbar VFF to baseline values. INTERPRETATION This longitudinal trial established that 30 days of reambulation after 60 days of bed rest constituted a powerful stimulus for bone marrow reconversion. In this model, the enhanced erythropoiesis coupled with preferential consumption of fatty acids from regulated marrow adipose tissue to supply energy for erythropoiesis and bone anabolism may explain the lumbar vertebrae reconversion. These results will help interpreting bone marrow signal in ambulatory patients after long periods of bed rest.","Liu, Tammy; Melkus, Gerd; Ramsay, Tim; Sheikh, Adnan; Laneuville, Odette; Trudel, Guy",Investigative radiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038096/,510

The objectives of this preliminary study were to compare responses of pulmonary circulation parameters to 100% oxygen (O2 ) and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in infants with BPD and PH using echocardiography. Responses between fetal growth restriction (FGR) and appropriate for gestational age infants were compared. Ten infants <28 weeks GA at birth were assessed at ≥36 weeks corrected gestation. Baseline echocardiography1 was performed which was repeated (echocardiography2) after 30 minutes of O2 . After a gap of 2-3 hours, iNO was administered for 15 minutes and echocardiography3 was performed, followed by iNO weaning. The gestation and birthweight of the cohort were 25.9 ± 1.6 weeks and 612 ± 175 g. Assessments were performed at 38.7 ± 1.4 weeks corrected gestational age. Baseline time to peak velocity: right ventricular ejection time (TPV/RVETc) increased from 0.24 ± 0.02 to 0.27 ± 0.02 (O2 , p = .01) and 0.31 ± 0.03 (iNO, p < .001), indicating a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR]. Baseline tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) increased from 8.1 ± 0.6 mm to 9.3 ± 0.7 mm (O2 , p = .01) and 10.5 ± 1.1 mm (iNO, p = .0004), indicating improved ventricular systolic performance. Percentage change for all parameters was greater with iNO. Significant correlations between cardiac performance and PVR were noted. FGR infants noted higher baseline PVR (TPV/RVETc, 0.21 ± 0.02 vs. 0.25 ± 0.01, p = .002), lower ventricular performance (TAPSE, 7 ± 1.2 mm vs. 8.6 ± 6 mm, p = .003), and lower percentage change with O2 and iNO.

It involves the interaction of different physiological systems at varying degrees of activity. When environmental challenges exceed the individual ability to cope, then allostatic overload ensues. Allostatic load is identified by the use of biomarkers and clinical criteria. OBJECTIVE To summarize the current knowledge on allostatic load and overload and its clinical implications based on a systematic review of the literature. METHODS PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to December 2019. A manual search of the literature was also performed, and reference lists of the retrieved articles were examined.We considered only studies in which allostatic load or overload were adequately described and assessed in either clinical or non-clinical adult populations. RESULTS A total of 267 original investigations were included. They encompassed general population studies, as well as clinical studies on consequences of allostatic load/overload on both physical and mental health across a variety of settings. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that allostatic load and overload are associated with poorer health outcomes. Assessment of allostatic load provides support to the understanding of psychosocial determinants of health and lifestyle medicine. An integrated approach that includes both biological markers and clinimetric criteria is recommended.","Guidi, Jenny; Lucente, Marcella; Sonino, Nicoletta; Fava, Giovanni A",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799204/,510

Imaging techniques e.g., PET are not considered. A total of 281 studies were included, the majority described patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). All tools for oxygen monitoring are safe. Parenchymal brain oxygen (PbtO2) monitoring is accurate to detect brain hypoxia, and it is recommended to titrate individual targets of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), ventilator parameters (PaCO2, PaO2), and transfusion, and to manage intracranial hypertension, in combination with ICP monitoring. SjvO2 is less accurate than PbtO2. Given limited data, NIRS is not recommended at present for adult patients who require neurocritical care.

The p.D620N mutation of VPS35 causes an autosomal-dominant form of Parkinson's disease (PD), clinically representing typical PD. OBJECTIVE Most of the studies on p.D620N VPS35 were performed on human tumor cell lines, rodent models overexpressing mutant VPS35, or in patient-derived fibroblasts. Here, based on identified target proteins, we investigated the implication of mutant VPS35 in autophagy, lysosomal degradation, and mitochondrial function in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from a patient harboring the p.D620N mutation. METHODS We reprogrammed fibroblasts from a PD patient carrying the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene and from two healthy donors in induced pluripotent stem cells. These were subsequently differentiated into neuronal precursor cells to finally generate midbrain dopaminergic neurons. RESULTS We observed a decreased autophagic flux and lysosomal mass associated with an accumulation of α-synuclein in patient-derived neurons compared to controls. Moreover, patient-derived neurons presented a mitochondrial dysfunction with decreased membrane potential, impaired mitochondrial respiration, and increased production of reactive oxygen species associated with a defect in mitochondrial quality control via mitophagy. CONCLUSION We describe for the first time the impact of the p.D620N VPS35 mutation on autophago-lysosome pathway and mitochondrial function in stem cell-derived neurons from an affected p.D620N carrier and define neuronal phenotypes for future pharmacological interventions. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","Hanss, Zoé; Larsen, Simone B; Antony, Paul; Mencke, Pauline; Massart, François; Jarazo, Javier; Schwamborn, Jens C; Barbuti, Peter A; Mellick, George D; Krüger, Rejko",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.28365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142012/,510

Most sphingolipidoses have a neurodegenerative manifestation characterized by innate immune activation in the brain. However, the role of the immune response in disease progression is ill-understood. In contrast to infectious diseases, immune activation is unable to eliminate the offending agent in sphingolipidoses resulting in ineffective, chronic inflammation. This paradox begs two fundamental questions: why has this immune response evolved in sphingolipidoses? What role does it play in disease progression? Here, starting from the observation that sphingolipids are elevated also in infectious diseases, I discuss the possibility that activation of the brain immune response by sphingolipids has evolved as a part of the immune response against pathogens and plays no major role in sphingolipidoses.","Vitner, Einat B",FEBS letters,https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.13980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131047/,510

Within this retrospective single centre study, we examined our experience in this critically ill patient cohort to assess outcomes and clinical parameters by comparison of ECLS with or without selective left ventricular decompression. METHODS Between 2004 and 2014 we evaluated 48 adult patients with INTERMACS level 1 heart failure (age 49.7 ± 19.5 years), who received either central ECLS with (n = 20, 41.7%) or ECLS without (n = 28, 58.3%, including 10 peripheral ECLS) integrated left ventricular vent in our retrospective single centre trial. RESULTS Follow up was 100% with a mean of 0.83 ± 1.85 years. Bridge to ventricular assist device was feasible in 29.2% (n = 14), bridge to transplant in 10.4% (n = 5) and bridge to recovery in 8.3% (n = 4). Overall 30-day survival was 37.5%, 6-month survival 27.1% and 1-year survival 25.0%. ECLS support with left ventricular decompression showed favourable 30-day survival compared to ECLS without left ventricular decompression (p = 0.034). Thirty-day as well as long-term survival did not differ between the subgroups (central ECLS with vent, ECLS without vent and peripheral ECLS without vent). Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age and gender revealed ECLS without vent as independent factor influencing 30-day survival. CONCLUSION ECLS is an established therapy for patients in severe cardiogenic shock. Independent of the ECLS approach, 30-day mortality is still high but with superior 30-day survival for patients with ECLS and left ventricular venting. Moreover, by unloading the ventricle, left ventricular decompression may provide an important time window for recovery or further treatment, such as bridge to bridge or bridge to transplant.","Schmack, Bastian; Seppelt, Philipp; Weymann, Alexander; Alt, Christina; Farag, Mina; Arif, Rawa; Doesch, Andreas O; Raake, Philip W; Kallenbach, Klaus; Mansur, Ashham; Popov, Aron-Frederik; Karck, Matthias; Ruhparwar, Arjang",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28975053/,510
150331,Men's Knowledge of Anticipatory Guidance Topics: Results from a Nationally Representative Survey.,2021-03-24,"Mosquito borne diseases are a group of infections that affect humans. Emerging or reemerging diseases are those that (re)occur in regions, groups or hosts that were previously free from these diseases: dengue virus; chikungunya virus; Zika virus; West Nile fever and malaria. In Europe, these infections are mostly imported; however, due to the presence of competent mosquitoes and the number of trips both to and from endemic areas, these pathogens are potentially emergent or re-emergent. Present and future climatic conditions, as well as meteorological, environmental and demographic aspects are risk factors for the distribution of different vectors and/or diseases.This review aimed to identify and analyze the existing literature on the transmission of mosquito borne diseases and those factors potentially affecting their transmission risk of them in six southern European countries with similar environmental conditions: Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In addition, we would identify those factors potentially affecting the (re)introduction or spread of mosquito vectors. This task has been undertaken with a focus on the environmental and climatic factors, including the effects of climate change. We undertook a systematic review of the vectors, diseases and their associations with climactic and environmental factors in European countries of the Mediterranean region. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and used explicit and systematic methods to identify, select and critically evaluate the studies which were relevant to the topic.We identified 1,302 articles in the first search of the databases. Of those, 160 were selected for full-text review. The final data set included 61 articles published between 2000 and 2017. 39.3% of the papers were related with dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus or their vectors. Temperature, precipitation and population density were key factors among others. 32.8% studied West Nile virus and its vectors, being temperature, precipitation and NDVI the most frequently used variables. Malaria have been studied in 23% of the articles, with temperature, precipitation and presence of water indexes as the most used variables. The number of publications focused on mosquito borne diseases is increasing in recent years, reflecting the increased interest in that diseases in southern European countries. Climatic and environmental variables are key factors on mosquitoes´ distribution and to show the risk of emergence and/or spread of emergent diseases and to study the spatial changes in that distributions.","Brugueras, Silvia; Martinez, Beatriz Fernandez; Martinez de la Puente, Josué; Figuerola, Jordi; Porro, Tomas Montalvo; Rius, Cristina; Larrauri, Amparo; Gomez-Barroso, Diana",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810503/,510

We report the emergency use of immunomodulatory therapy utilizing an extracorporeal selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in two patients with elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and refractory COVID-19 ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The two patients were selected based upon clinical criteria and elevated levels of IL-6 (> 100 pg/mL) as a biomarker of inflammation. Once identified, emergency/expanded use permission for SCD treatment was obtained and patient consented. Six COVID-19 patients (4 on ECMO) with severe ARDS were also screened with IL-6 levels less than 100 pg/mL and were not treated with SCD. The two enrolled patients' PaO2/FiO2 ratios increased from 55 and 58 to 200 and 192 at 52 and 50 hours respectively. Inflammatory indices also declined with IL-6 falling from 231 and 598 pg/mL to 3.32 and 116 pg/mL respectively. IL-6/IL-10 ratios also declined from 11.8 and 18 to 0.7 and 0.62 respectively. The two patients were successfully weaned off ECMO after 17 and 16 days of SCD therapy respectively. The results observed with SCD therapy on these two critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS and elevated IL-6 is encouraging. A multicenter clinical trial is underway with a FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption to evaluate the potential of SCD therapy to effectively treat COVID-19 ICU patients.","Yessayan, Lenar; Szamosfalvi, Balazs; Napolitano, Lena; Singer, Benjamin; Kurabayashi, Katsuo; Song, Yujing; Westover, Angela; Humes, David",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701630/,510

While directly acting antiviral (DAA) drugs are now able to cure virtually all hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, even in subjects with advanced liver disease, what happens to the liver and progression of the disease after DAA-induced cure of viremia is only beginning to emerge. Several large-scale clinical studies in different patient populations have shown that patients with advanced liver disease maintain a risk for developing HCC even when the original instigator, the virus, is eliminated by DAAs. Here we review emerging studies derived from multiple, complementary experimental systems involving patient liver tissues, human liver cell cultures, human liver slice cultures, and animal models, showing that HCV infection induces epigenetic, signaling, and gene expression changes in the liver associated with altered hepatic innate immunity and liver cancer risk. Of critical importance is the fact that these virus-induced abnormalities persist after DAA cure of HCV. These nascent findings portend the discovery of pathways involved in post-HCV immunopathogenesis, which may be clinically actionable targets for more comprehensive care of DAA-cured individuals.","Polyak, Stephen J; Crispe, I Nicholas; Baumert, Thomas F",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10010044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430338/,510

The first anticytokine therapy was conducted in 1975. Anti-interferon-gamma has brought improved and often striking results in the treatment of various T-helper 1-mediated autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory skin diseases. Anti-interferon-gamma may be a universal treatment for these conditions. In AIDS and other virus-induced autoimmune diseases, the virus may stimulate cytokines (interferons), which increase, rather than halt, viral replication. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors have also shown good clinical results, however, they may result in complications and are ineffective in some autoimmune diseases.","Skurkovich, Simon; Skurkovich, Boris; Kelly, Jeanne",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1586/1744666x.1.1.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20477651/,510

OBJECTIVES Investigate the effectiveness of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with and without enrofloxacin in the treatment of moderate grade dog bite wounds (DBW). To describe common pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a single-centre parallel group pragmatic trial, 50 dogs presenting with moderate grade DBW were prospectively randomised to receive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (group A) or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and enrofloxacin (group B). Swabs were taken for culture and susceptibility testing at admission. Stabilisation, wound care and surgical debridement were performed at the discretion of admitting clinicians. The primary outcome was complication due to infection at 10 days, with Bayesian inference used to estimate the difference in proportions between treatment groups. RESULTS Of the 24 dogs in treatment group A, 1 required the addition of enrofloxacin at re-examination. None of the 26 dogs in group B required alteration of antimicrobial coverage. The difference in complication rate due to infection between treatment groups was 4.2%. Twenty-one different organisms were identified: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Neisseria spp., Pasteurella multocida and P. canis were the most common. Over 90% of gram-negative and gram-positive isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Ninety-six percent of gram-negative and 86% of gram-positive isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an appropriate empirical antimicrobial choice for moderate DBW in South East Queensland. Reduced empirical enrofloxacin use will promote antimicrobial stewardship and potentially antimicrobial resistance.","Kalnins, N J; Haworth, M; Croton, C; Gibson, J S; Stewart, A J; Purcell, S L",Australian veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/avj.13093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151420/,510

In the last decades, disease outbreaks due to such zoonotic pathogens have appeared with an accelerated rate, which calls for an urgent development ofadaptive (smart) therapeutics. Here, we develop a computational strategy to adaptively evolve peptides that could selectively inhibit mutating S protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) of different SARS-CoV-2 viral strains from binding to their human host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Starting from suitable peptide templates, based on selected ACE2 segments (natural RBD binder), we gradually modify the templates by random mutations, while retaining those mutations that maximize their RBD-binding free energies. In this adaptive evolution, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the template-RBD complexes are iteratively perturbed by the peptide mutations, which are retained under favorable Monte Carlo decisions. The computational search will provide librariesof optimized therapeutics capable of reducing the SARS-CoV-2 infection on a global scale. .","Chaturvedi, Parth; Han, Yanxiao; Kral, Petr; Vukovic, Lela",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.12622667.v2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32676578/,510

Inoculation of the allantoic cavity and use of allantoic fluid is a common method of passaging isolated avian influenza viruses. In the present study, 2490 fresh fecal samples and 4967 old fecal samples were investigated and subjected to conventional passaging (allantoic fluid method). Two newly developed methods-the allantochorion and allantoic fluid mixed method and the chick embryo and allantoic fluid mixed method-were also examined. The rates of influenza virus isolation for these three methods were compared. There appeared to be little difference among these methods when fresh fecal samples were used. However, for the old fecal samples, isolation rates for influenza virus were significantly higher for the chick embryo and allantoic fluid mixed method compared with the conventional allantoic fluid method. All viruses isolated using the conventional allantoic fluid method were isolated successfully using the two newly developed methods. These results suggest that using chick embryos in conjunction with allantoic fluid is effective for early virus isolation, especially for fecal samples that are not fresh. Additionally, practical chick embryo passage methods are described that improve significantly the rate of isolation of influenza viruses from fecal samples of migratory birds in a complex wild ecological environment.","Tang, Shuang; Li, Yongdong; Xia, Han; Huang, Juan; Zhang, Zhong; Zhu, Na; Zhao, Jiuru; Li, Tianxian",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.09.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261812/,510

Most current usage is off-label, and the endovascular community is nearer the beginning than the end of the learning curve, given the number of devices in development. A comprehensive overview of technical specifications alongside key outcome data is essential both for clinical decision-making and to direct further investigations. Most-studied has been the Pipeline Embolization Device, which has undergone a transition to the Pipeline Flex for which outcome data are sparse or heterogeneous. Alternative endoluminal devices do not appear to be outperforming the Pipeline Embolization Device to date, though prospective studies and long-term data mostly are lacking, and between-study comparisons must be treated with caution. Nominal technical specifications may be unrelated to in situ performance, emphasizing the importance of correct radiologic sizing and device placement. Devices designed specifically for bifurcation aneurysms also lack long-term outcome data or have only recently become available for clinical use. There are no major studies directly comparing a flow-diverting device with standard coiling or microsurgical clipping. Data on flow-diverting stents are too limited in terms of long-term outcomes to reliably inform clinical decision-making. The best available evidence supports using a single endoluminal device for most indications. Recommendations on the suitability and choice of a device for bifurcation or ruptured aneurysms or for anatomically complex lesions cannot be made on the basis of current evidence. The appropriateness of flow-diverting treatment must be decided on a case-by-case basis, considering experience and the relative risks against standard approaches or observation.","Dmytriw, A A; Phan, K; Moore, J M; Pereira, V M; Krings, T; Thomas, A J",AJNR.

We hypothesized that unique mesh constructs might alter the ability of various synthetic meshes to clear bacterial contamination. To evaluate this, we studied commercially available synthetic meshes ability to clear a bacterial contamination with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. METHODS Two hundred and eighty-three rats underwent hernia repair with one of nine synthetic materials. Control animals were closed, and the remainder was inoculated with either 10(4) or 10(6) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Animals were survived for 30 days without systemic antibiotics. At necropsy, the mesh was harvested and quantitative cultures and bacterial clearance assessed. RESULTS All clean repairs remained sterile. Rates of bacterial clearance for 10(4) repairs revealed that unprotected monofilament materials cleared significantly more bacteria than composite meshes and multifilament meshes (p = <0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). At higher levels of bacterial contamination (10(6)), all materials had a reduction in bacterial clearance, although monofilament materials had higher bacterial clearance compared to composite meshes (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Monofilament unprotected polypropylene and polyester mesh can clear a large percentage of MRSA contaminants. Multifilament, composite anti-adhesive barrier meshes, and laminar antimicrobial impregnated mesh are not able to clear bacterial contamination with MRSA. Unique properties of synthetic material should be considered when evaluating a prosthetic for high-risk incisional hernia repair.","Blatnik, Jeffrey A; Krpata, David M; Jacobs, Michael R; Gao, Yue; Novitsky, Yuri W; Rosen, Michael J",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-012-1992-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22907777/,510

Whilst efforts to reduce food waste are laudable, a significant proportion of food and drink manufacturer waste is unavoidable. On the one hand, there is a drive from industry to reclaim as much value from this waste as possible, for example, by conversion to valuable products in what is known as ""valorisation"". At the same time, growing social and legislative pressures mean that any attempts to valorise food waste must be performed in a sustainable manner. However, for every company and its specific food wastes, there will be multiple valorisation possibilities and few tools exist that allow food and drink manufacturers to identify which is most profitable and sustainable for them. Such a decision would need to not only consider environmental, social and economic performance, but also how ready the technology is and how well it aligns with that company's strategy. In response, this paper develops and presents a hybrid framework that guides a company in modelling the volumes/seasonality of its wastes, identifying potential valorisation options and selecting appropriate indicators for environmental, social and economic performance as well as technological maturity and alignment with company goals. The framework guides users in analyzing economic and environmental performance using Cost-Benefit Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment respectively. The results can then be ranked alongside those for social performance, technological maturity and alignment with company goals using a weighted sum model variant of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to facilitate easy visual comparison. This framework is demonstrated in the form of a case study with a major UK fruit consolidator to identify the optimal strategy for managing their citrus waste. Possibilities identified included sale of imperfect but still edible waste via wholesale at a significantly reduced profit and the investment in facilities to extract higher value pectin from the same waste stream using a microwave assisted pectin extraction process. Results suggest that continued sale of waste to wholesale markets is currently the most beneficial in terms of economic viability and environmental performance, but that in the medium to long term, the projected growth in the market for pectin suggests this could become the most viable strategy.","Stone, Jamie; Garcia-Garcia, Guillermo; Rahimifard, Shahin",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31254758/,510

BACKGROUND DATA The optimal surgical technique for creation of an anastomosis in the neck after esophagectomy is unclear. METHODS Patients with esophageal cancer undergoing esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction and cervical anastomosis were eligible for participation after written informed consent. Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio. Primary endpoint was anastomotic leak rate defined as external drainage of saliva from the site of the anastomosis or intra-thoracic manifestation of leak. Secondary endpoints included anastomotic stricture rate at one year follow up, number of endoscopic dilatations, dysphagia-score, hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. Patients were blinded for intervention. RESULTS Between August 2011 and July 2014, 174 patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy.

162902,P-EP021. Impact of COVID-19 on people with epilepsy: Understanding their needs,2021,"The understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and clinical progression is incomplete because of the variable contribution of host, immune and viral factors. The involvement of viral factors has been investigated in extreme clinical phenotypes from rapid progressors to long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). Among HIV-1 proteins, the envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) has concentrated many studies for its important role in the immune response and in the first steps of viral replication. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of 41 Envs from 24 patients with different clinical progression rates and viral loads (VLs), LTNP-Elite Controllers (LTNP-ECs); Viremic LTNPs (vLTNPs), and non-controller’s individuals contemporary to LTNPs or recent, named Old and Modern progressors. We analyzed the Env expression, the fusion and cell-to-cell transfer capacities as well as viral infectivity. The sequence and phylogenetic analysis of Envs were also performed. In every functional characteristic, the Envs from subjects with viral control (LTNP-ECs and vLTNPs) showed significant lower performance compared to those from the progressor individuals (Old and Modern). Regarding sequence analysis, the variable loops of the gp120 subunit of the Env (i.e., V2, V4 and mainly V5) of the progressor individuals showed longer and more glycosylated sequences than controller subjects. Therefore, HIV-1 Envs presenting poor viral functions and shorter sequences were associated with viremic control and the non-progressor clinical phenotype, whereas functional Envs were associated with the lack of virological control and progressor clinical phenotypes. These correlations support the central role of Env genotypic and phenotypic characteristics in the in vivo HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The role of the virus in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection has not been investigated in isolates from individuals with different progression rates. In this work, we studied the properties of the envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) in individuals with different progression rates to elucidate its role in pathogenesis. We estimated the Env expression, the CD4 binding, the fusion and cell-to-cell viral transfer capacities that affect the infectivity of the viral Envs in recombinant viruses. The Envs from individuals which control viral replication and lack clinical progression (LTNP-ECs and vLTNPs) showed lower functional capacities than from subjects with clinical progression (Old and Modern). The functional increase of the Envs characteristics was associated with an increase in viral infectivity and in increased length of variable loops and the number of glycosylation sites of the Env (gp120/SU). These results support the concept that viral characteristics contribute to viral infection and pathogenesis.","Pérez-Yanes, Silvia; Pernas, Maria; Marfil, Silvia; Cabrera-Rodríguez, Romina; Ortiz, Raquel; Rovirosa, Carla; Estévez-Herrera, Judith; Olivares, Isabel; Casado, Concepción; Lopez-Galindez, Cecilio; Blanco, Julià; Valenzuela-Fernández, Agustin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.451566,510

However, a limited number of studies have analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on the psychological aspects of the elderly using longitudinal data. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to clarify the changes in self-rated overall daily life satisfaction among community dwelling elderly in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the longitudinal data of 5176 individuals aged 15 years and older from the first and second internet surveys on “Changes in Daily Life Awareness and Behavior under the Influence of the New Coronavirus Infection” conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan. The estimation result of the mixed-effects model indicated that elderly people were more adversely affected by the first wave of the pandemic (May 2020) compared to their younger counterparts. However, by the beginning of the third wave (December 2020), they had largely recovered to the same level as that of before the COVID-19 pandemic, which suggested that the elderly managed to cope with psychological distress to some extent during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.","Ishida, Akira Ishida Emiko",Journal of Ageing and Longevity,https://doi.org/10.3390/jal1010002,510

However, health professionals’ perception towards the e-consultation is not well addressed. This study aimed to explore health workers’ perception on e-consultation to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic at the University of Gondar specialized hospital. A qualitative study was undertaken to explore health workers’ perception on e-consultation to tackle COVID-19 pandemic. Eight health-care workers were purposively selected from the University of Gondar specialized hospital. Medical doctors, nurses, medical laboratory professionals and public health officers were selected as key informants for in-depth interview. A thematic analysis was carried out. The analysis was performed with four identified themes, namely e-consultation benefit, technical skill, barriers of e-consultation and facilitators of e-consultation. All the respondents were aware of e-consultation service as a solution in the health-care system to tackle the spread of pandemic. Some had the experience of reminding their clients to take drugs by using their mobile phone. They also expressed their feelings that using e-consultation would have an impact on health professional and client satisfaction by reducing the fear of transmission of the pandemic. Health workers believe that e-consultation solutions can reduce the spread of the pandemic at the point of service delivery. Technical skills, organizational setup and information technology-related factors were major contributing ones. Health professionals’ perception could not be a problem in implementing e-consultation service to tackle the spread of the pandemic.","Guadie, H. A.; Kalayou, M. H.; Endehabtu, B.

These models can help to control and prevent the outbreak of these infections. In this paper, we make long-term predictions based on the number of current confirmed cases, accumulative recovered cases, and dead cases of COVID-19 in some countries by the modeling approach. We use the SIRD (S: susceptible, I: infected, R: recovered, D: dead) epidemic model which is a nonautonomous dynamic system with incubation time delay to study the evolution of COVID-19 in some countries. From the analysis of the recent data, we find that the cure and death rates may not be constant and, in some countries, they are piecewise functions. They can be estimated from the delayed SIRD model by the finite difference method. According to the recent data and its subsequent cure and death rates, we can accurately estimate the parameters of the model and then predict the evolution of COVID-19 there. Through the predicted results, we can obtain the turning points, the plateau period, and the maximum number of COVID-19 cases. The predicted results suggest that the epidemic situation in some countries is very serious. It is advisable for the governments of these countries to take more stringent and scientific containment measures. Finally, we studied the impact of the infection rate β on COVID-19. We find that when the infection rate β decreases, the cumulative number of confirmed cases and the maximum number of currently infected cases will greatly decrease. The results further affirm that the containment techniques taken by these countries to curb the spread of COVID-19 should be strengthened further.","Pei, Lijun Zhang Mengyu",Complexity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6692678,510

169973,Healthcare management through mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic with leafy vegetables,2021,"Concussion is a global health concern. Despite its high prevalence, a sound understanding of the mechanisms underlying this type of diffuse brain injury remains elusive. It is, however, well established that concussions cause significant functional deficits; that children and youths are disproportionately affected and have longer recovery time than adults; and recovering individuals are more prone to suffer additional concussions, with each successive injury increasing the risk of long term neurological and mental health complications. Currently, concussion management faces two significant challenges: there are no objective, clinically accepted, brain-based approaches for determining (i) whether an athlete has suffered a concussion, and (ii) when the athlete has recovered. Diagnosis is based on clinical testing and self-reporting of symptoms and their severity. Self-reporting is highly subjective and symptoms only indirectly reflect the underlying brain injury. Here, we introduce a deep learning Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network that is able to distinguish between healthy and acute post-concussed adolescent athletes using only a short (i.e. 90 seconds long) sample of resting state EEG data as input. The athletes were neither required to perform a specific task nor subjected to a stimulus during data collection, and the acquired EEG data was neither filtered, cleaned of artefacts, nor subjected to explicit feature extraction. The LSTM network was trained and tested on data from 27 male, adolescent athletes with sports related concussion, bench marked against 35 healthy, adolescent athletes. During rigorous testing, the classifier consistently identified concussions with an accuracy of >90% and its ensemble-median Area Under the Curve (AUC) corresponds to 0.971. This is the first instance of a high-performing classifier that relies only on easy-to-acquire resting state EEG data. It represents a key step towards the development of an easy-to-use, brain-based, automatic classification of concussion at an individual level.","Thanjavur, Karun; Babul, Arif; Foran, Brandon; Bielecki, Maya; Gilchrist, Adam; Hristopulos, Dionissios T.; Brucar, Leyla R.; Virji-Babul, Naznin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.192138,510

Objectives: This study aimed to provide an emergency scoring tool for predicting 30-day adverse outcomes in non-critical new-onset COVID-19 patients. Methods: This derivation study was conducted on new-onset COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department of an urban teaching hospital in Tehran, Iran, between 20 February and 20 March 2020. The total lobe severity score (TSS), age, history of comorbidities, and 30-day adverse outcomes (death, ICU admission or intubation) were taken into account to produce three prediction models. Results: Overall, 137 patients were included in the study. Their mean age was 59.9±16.8 years and 62% were male. The ground glass nodule, patch B/punctate ground-glass opacity, fibrous stripes, and air bronchogram sign with perihilar distribution, bilateral and ≥ 2 affected lobes were the most common findings. The mean TSS (model 1) was significantly higher in patients with an adverse outcome (9.4±3.2) compared to the discharged patients (7.2±3.3) (p<0.001, AUC: 0.703, sensitivity: 64.4% and specificity: 74.1%). The optimal cut-off point of model 2 (TSS and age) had the following parameters: AUC: 0.721, sensitivity: 71.2% and specificity: 67.2%. The optimal cut-off point of model 3 (TSS, age, comorbidities) had: AUC: 0.755, sensitivity: 79.7% and specificity: 65.5%.

However, the continued success of SMC is threatened by the spread of resistance against one of its main preventive ingredients, Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine(SP), operational challenges in delivery, and incomplete adherence to the regimens. Via a simulation study with an individual-based model of malaria dynamics, we provide quantitative evidence to assess long-acting injectables (LAIs) as potential alternatives to SMC. We explored the predicted impact of a range of novel preventive LAIs as a seasonal prevention tool in children aged three months to five years old during late-stage clinical trials and at implementation. LAIs were co-administered with a blood-stage clearing drug once at the beginning of the transmission season. We found the establishment of non-inferiority of LAIs to standard 3 or 4 rounds of SMC with SP-amodiaquine was challenging in clinical trial stages due to high intervention deployment coverage. However, our analysis of implementation settings where the achievable SMC coverage was much lower, LAIs with fewer visits per season are potential suitable replacements to SMC. Suitability as a replacement with higher impact is possible if the duration of protection of LAIs covered the duration of the transmission season. Furthermore, optimizing LAIs coverage and protective efficacy half-life via simulation analysis in settings with an SMC coverage of 60% revealed important trade-offs between protective efficacy decay and deployment coverage. Our analysis additionally highlights that for seasonal deployment for LAIs, it will be necessary to investigate the protective efficacy decay as early as possible during clinical development to ensure a well-informed candidate selection process.","Burgert, L.; Reiker, T.; Golumbeanu, M.; Moehrle, J.

Many local authorities enforced a cordon sanitaire to contain the rapid spread of the disease. Travelers can only pass the cordon after the disease screening. This paper aims to propose a method to design a traffic inflow control scheme for onramp metering to maximize urban freeway network throughput with an endurable queuing delay constraint at all offramps around cordon sanitaire. A bilevel programming model is formulated where the lower level is transportation system equilibrium to predict link traffic flows. The upper level is onramp metering optimization that is nonlinear programming. A stochastic queuing model is used to represent the waiting phenomenon at each offramp where the disease testing is conducted. A heuristic algorithm is designed to solve the proposed bilevel programming model where the method of successive averages (MSA) is adopted for the lower-level model, and a genetic algorithm (GA) with elite strategy is adopted for the upper-level model. An experimental study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and algorithm. The results show that these methods can find a good heuristic optimal solution. These methods are useful for freeway operators to determine the optimal onramp control for disease control and prevention.

In addition to the known challenges of foster parenting in Ghana (stigma, financial challenges and emotional strain, inexperience of the foster parents), the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 restrictions may worsen caregivers’ burden and negatively affect children in care. This study explored how foster parents are meeting their caregiving demands during the COVID-19 pandemic in the face of existing and new challenges. Following a participatory practice research approach, a co-constructed interview guide by the researchers and a practitioner was used to conduct in-depth telephone interviews with 13 foster parents. Findings from thematic analysis of the interviews showed challenges, including increased cost of caregiving and multiple caregiving duties as challenges facing foster parents whereas children’s knowledge about the virus, informal support and religious beliefs collectively enhanced caregiving during the pandemic. The findings provide learning about ways to alleviate parenting challenges for foster parents during and after the pandemic.

174742,Online Exercise Classes during the COVID-19 Related Lockdown in Germany: Use and Attitudes,2021,"Interferons establish an antiviral state in responding cells through the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs antagonize viral pathogens directly through diverse mechanisms acting at different stages of viral life cycles, and indirectly by modulating cell cycle and promoting programmed cell death. The mechanisms of action and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable the high throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating the potentially confounding effects of endogenous IFN and potential antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG induction in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to IFN. Engineered CRISPRa cell lines demonstrated inducible, robust, and specific gRNA-directed expression of ISGs, which are functional in restricting viral infection. Using this platform, we screened for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 as well as multiple novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of candidate hits by complementary targeted CRISPRa and ectopic cDNA expression infection experiments, which, among other hits, confirmed OAS1 as a SARS-CoV-2 restriction factor. OAS1 exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, and these effects required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a robust, high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by the identification of multiple novel SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.","Danziger, Oded; Patel, Roosheel S; DeGrace, Emma J; Rosen, Mikaela R; Rosenberg, Brad R",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.461286,510

Multiple options for each trial component, allowing for flexibility should care disruptions occur, were identified and pretested (N=5). HSOR approaches are effective to rapidly adapt trial design components, even during healthcare delivery disruptions that threaten research. Application of these approaches should be considered as a strategy to design resilient, flexible, and effective pragmatic trials.","Wax, Pamela Khorzad Rebeca Yu Cheong M.; Touma, Emilie K.; Rosales, Amador Prince Grace Coyne Kasey Bailey Stacy Pollack Teresa Barnard Cynthia Ackermann Ronald T.; Holl, Jane L.; Wallia, Amisha",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-826-p,510

In Indonesia, economic growth is predicted to be negative and recession is happening, starting from the third quarter of 2020. Ironically, Islamic social activities including charity giving has shown an encouraging development during the COVID-19 period as collected charity funds has been the highest amidst the height of pandemic. While this phenomenon seems to be impossible, it is definitely worth a research. This study analyses charity behavior during COVID-19 pandemic and aims to elaborate its significant determinants. Although the economy is badly affected by pandemic situation, people are still eagerly giving charity as to implement Islamic value of brotherhood and helping each other, especially during this difficult period. Logistic regression is used as method to assess whether the society tend to give charity or not amidst the pandemic. Income, shopping habit during pandemic, investment habit during pandemic, religiosity and subjective norm are found to have significant effects on charity giving during the pandemic. Suitable and effective efforts to assist the poor during and post-COVID-19 period can be strategize based on the factors identified in this study.

The Moroccan University Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah of Fez mobilized to develop platforms for distance learning. New tools for e-learning (online learning) were developed, and advanced learning management systems (LMSs) were deployed. Predicting student's performance is more difficult because of the large amount of data including the huge number of learners and the educational content variety. Currently, in the University of Fez, the lack of current mechanisms to assess and control the development and performance of the students is not discussed. In this context, Cloud computing is becoming a hot research subject when faced with large-scale data and is commonly used to solve this issue. Big Data is a leading concept because of its permanent optimization and opportunities offering data collection, analysis, storage, optimization, processing, and data representation to e-learning professionals.

The spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of RaTG13 contains a large number of amino acid substitutions when compared to SARS-CoV-2, likely impacting affinity for the ACE2 receptor. Antigenic differences between the viruses are less well understood, especially whether RaTG13 spike can be efficiently neutralised by antibodies generated from infection with, or vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. Using RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes we compared neutralisation using convalescent sera from previously infected patients as well as vaccinated healthcare workers. Surprisingly, our results revealed that RaTG13 was more efficiently neutralised than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, neutralisation assays using spike chimeras and mutants harbouring single amino acid substitutions within the RBD demonstrated that both spike proteins can tolerate multiple changes without dramatically reducing how efficiently they are neutralised. Moreover, introducing the 484K mutation into RaTG13 resulted in increased neutralisation, in contrast to the same mutation in SARS-CoV-2 (E484K). This is despite E484K having a well-documented role in immune evasion in variants of concern (VOC) such as B.1.351 (Beta). These results indicate that the immune-escape mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs might be driven by strong antibody pressures, and that the future spill-over of RaTG13 and/or related sarbecoviruses could be mitigated using current SARS-CoV-2-based vaccination strategies.","Cantoni, Diego; Mayora-Neto, Martin; Thakur, Nazia; Elrefaey, Ahmed ME; Newman, Joseph; Vishwanath, Sneha; Nadesalingam, Angalee; Chan, Andrew; Smith, Peter; Castillo-Olivares, Javier; Baxendale, Helen; Charleston, Bryan; Heeney, Jonathan; Bailey, Dalan; Temperton, Nigel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.17.456606,510
179628,Role of functional food components in COVID-19 pandemic: A review,2021,"IntroductionResearch following the Covid-19 pandemics has shown that psychological reactions to the pandemic and its constraints can vary significantly depending on personality. One of the traits that has not been studied yet, but can play a harmful role in the COVID-19 psychological impact is perfectionism. This trait, characterized by setting excessively high standards of performance and striving for flawlessness, has increased in recent years and is considered a transdiagnostic process involved in several (mental) health problems (Curran & Hill 2019).ObjectivesTo analyze the role of Perfectionism in the levels of fear of COVID19 and of perception of infection risk by COVID-19.Methods234 adults (75.6% women;mean age=29.53±12.51) completed an on-line survey with the Portuguese validated versions of Covid-19 Perceived Risk Scale (C19PRS;Pereira et al. 2020), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FC19S;Cabaços et al. 2020) and Big Three Perfectionism Scale (BTPS;Garrido et al. 2020). SPSS was used to perform correlation and regression analysis.ResultsPerceived Risk and Fear of COVID-19 were significantly correlated with perfectionism (.243, .228, respectively) (both, p<.01). Perfectionism explains 5.5% (Adjusted R2) of the FC19S variance (Beta=.243, p<.001) and 4.8% of the C19PRS variance (Beta=.228, p=.01).ConclusionsThis study provides preliminary, but completely innovative evidence that perfectionism contribute to the psychological impact of Covid-19 pandemics. In the near future we will test the hypothesis that the nature of unpredictability and the limitations imposed by the global crisis may be exacerbating the already high levels of psychological distress that affect negative perfectionists.","Pereira, A.

John Paul II endorsed the establishment of the first Vatican website and an official papal e-mail account, which provided Catholics a new form of communication with the Holy Father. During the pontificate of Benedict XVI, the papacy created several Twitter accounts, which would become the backbone of papal digital mobilization. Francis built on the success of his predecessors as he initiated the modernization of the Holy See’s media department. However, with the growth of the Internet and the stress test of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mechanics of mobilization, pilgrimage and power have considerably changed.

Design/methodology/approach - This is a mixed-methods research. One hundred students, registered in the last English course of their curriculum, took part in the investigation. They filled out a Likert-scale survey using the criteria for CALL evaluation. During the data analysis of the quantitative section of the research, a chi-square of 15.0672 and a p-value of 0.519719 were obtained, making this result not significant at p < 0.05. A Levene test of variance equality was performed on the resulting data to confirm the results. Personal interviews were carried out to triangulate the previous results. Findings - This study determined that Ecuadorian undergraduate students have a negative perception of the usefulness of using a digital class to learn English. These results have important implications for teachers who must work harder during these times of COVID-19 to attain students' attention. Research limitations/implications - This research is limited by its conception of qualitative methods. This limitation also opens the door for further studies. The quantitative and mixed methods studies are suggested to confirm the results obtained here. Practical implications - This study has practical implications for teachers and language center managers. They can use the information attained to adapt their teachings in order to improve these results. Managers will benefit from it as they can plan for teacher training considering the comments given by students. Social implications - The social implication of this study is that the students, through their comments, have implied the need of having some sort of socialization and ERT does not permit such. Originality/value - This paper has value as it closes the gap of information regarding the use of this new teaching modality attained from Latin American countries and more specifically from Ecuador.","Estrella, F.",Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education,https://doi.org/10.1108/jarhe-05-2021-0194,510

These signs constitute a heterogeneous group named long COVID or persistent COVID. Objective: The aim of this study is to describe persisting symptoms six months after COVID-19 diagnosis in a prospective cohort in the Northwest Spain Design. This is a prospective cohort study performed in the COVID-19 Cohort of Galicia Sur Health Institute (COHVID-GS). Participants: This cohort includes patients in clinical follow-up in a health area of 569,534 inhabitants after SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were collected during the follow up. Main measures and key results. A total of 284 patients completed 6 months follow-up, 176 (69.4%) required hospitalization and 29 (10.2%) of them needed critical care. At six months, 119 (48.0%) patients described one or more persisting symptoms. The most prevalent were: extra-thoracic symptoms (39.1%), chest symptoms (27%), dyspnoea (20.6%), and fatigue (16.1%). These symptoms were more common in hospitalized patients (52.3% vs 38.2%) and in women (59.0% vs 40.5%). The multivariate analysis identified Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), female gender and tobacco consumption as risk factors for long COVID. Conclusions. Persisting symptoms are common after COVID-19 especially in hospitalized patients compared to outpatients (52.3% vs. 38.2%). Based on these findings, special attention and clinical follow-up after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection should be provided for hospitalized patients with previous lung diseases, tobacco consumption, and females.","Perez Gonzalez, A.; Araujo-Ameijeiras, A.; Fernandez-Villar, A.; Crespo, M.; Poveda, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.05.21261634v1?rss=1,510
183181,Saving Limited Resources During Covid-19 Pandemic,2020-12-31,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of online reviews on consumers' intention to visit restaurants, with the moderating role of involvement. Design/methodology/approach The research framework was built on signaling theory, message appeals and involvement theory. To test the proposed framework, three experiments were conducted online with real customer samples. T-tests, ANOVA and SPSS PROCESS macro were used for data analysis. Findings The results revealed that online reviews with higher online ratings and emotional appeal led to higher restaurant visit intention. Review appeal significantly moderated the effect of online ratings on restaurant visit intention. Customers with low restaurant involvement were more impacted by emotional comments than by functional comments. Research limitations/implications The present study extends our knowledge on the effects of online reviews moderated by levels of customer involvement. By combining signaling theory with involvement theory, it adds value to the literature on customer online behavior, especially in the foodservice context. The present study has limitations that might provide opportunities for future research. It used evaluations (TripAdvisor scores) and only positive reviews (texts), so customers' intentions considering negative reviews could not be examined. The level of hedonism concerning consumption in restaurants and prior knowledge regarding restaurant reviews was not controlled for. It is possible that the level of hedonism perceived and prior review knowledge may moderate the customers' intention to visit the restaurant. Practical implications The present study shows the importance of online comments for the promotion of restaurants that have low evaluation scores. It is essential that restaurant owners and managers encourage potential customers by using comments to elaborate on their marketing strategies and promotion. At the same time, they should invite customers to share their emotional experiences, and not just their views on service efficiency (a functional aspect). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of the internet and mobile devices has become more prominent. Managers could therefore use emotional messages on the restaurant's website or apps to attract customers with low restaurant involvement. Also, a system to identify the involvement of customers with restaurants could be implemented online or on mobile devices to present specific messages. The present study also recommends the use of online tools as virtual tours, photographs taken from different angles, smiling faces, floor plans and sittings and pre-determined emotional expressions. Also, the restaurant could promote lives on cooking different dishes to motive customer's interaction and comments. These would help to increase customers' visit intentions. Originality/value This study extends knowledge about the effect of restaurant online reviews (both ratings and appeals) moderated by the level of customer involvement. The present study also adds value to the customer online behavior literature showing that customers with low involvement are more sensitive to emotional content as they use the affective route to process information rather than the central route.","Aureliano-Silva, L.; Leung, X.; Spers, E.

Much effort has been devoted to measuring these phenotypes, but predicting their impact on the course of the pandemic - especially that of immune escape - remains a challenge. Here, we use a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of wildtype and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of vaccine rollout and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We show that variants with enhanced transmissibility easily rise to high frequency, whereas partial immune escape, on its own, often fails to do so. However, when these phenotypes are combined, enhanced transmissibility can carry the variant to high frequency, at which point partial immune escape may limit the ability of vaccination to control the epidemic. Our findings suggest that moderate immune escape poses a low risk unless combined with a substantial increase in transmissibility.","Bushman, M.; Taylor, B. P.; Kahn, R.; Lipsitch, M.; Hanage, W.

185179,Wuhan Coronavirus (Covid-19): Yet Another Bat Virus Zoonotic.,2020,"Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) represent a major mechanism that bacteria use to sense and respond to their environment. Prototypical TCSs are composed of a membrane-embedded histidine kinase (HK), which senses an environmental stimulus and subsequently phosphorylates a cognate partner protein called a response regulator (RR) that regulates gene expression in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Vibrio cholerae uses the hybrid HK ChiS to activate the expression of the chitin utilization program, which is critical for the survival of this facultative pathogen in its aquatic reservoir. A cognate RR for ChiS has not been identified and the mechanism of ChiS-dependent signal transduction remains unclear. Here, we show that ChiS is a noncanonical membrane-embedded one-component system that can both sense chitin and directly regulate gene expression via a cryptic DNA binding domain. Unlike prototypical TCSs, we find that ChiS DNA binding is diminished, rather than stimulated, by phosphorylation. Finally, we provide evidence that ChiS likely activates gene expression by directly recruiting RNA polymerase. Together, this work addresses the mechanism of action for a major transcription factor in V. cholerae and highlights the versatility of signal transduction systems in bacterial species. Significance Statement From bacteria to humans, the ability to properly respond to environmental cues is critical for survival. The cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae uses one protein, ChiS, to sense chitin in its environmental reservoir to regulate the expression of genes that are critical for the survival and evolution of this pathogen in this niche. Here, we study how the chitin sensor ChiS works, and discover that it regulates gene expression in an unexpected and unorthodox manner. Thus, this study uncovers how the major regulator ChiS works in this important human pathogen and highlights the versatile mechanisms that living systems use to respond to their environment.","Klancher, Catherine A.; Yamamoto, Shouji; Dalia, Triana N.; Dalia, Ankur B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.10.902320,510

A better understanding of pollen-mediated gene flow is needed within the species for both conservation and breeding efforts as cultivation occurs within the species natural range and spatially-isolated, paddy structures are limited within breeding programs. Widely cited pollen travel research in NWR demonstrated that pollen could travel at least 3200m. However, a population segregating for male sterility was used as the pollen recipient in the study and was determined to not be adequate for NWR pollen travel studies. Here, we present the characterization of a recessive white male floret (WMF) population in contrast to the dominant, purple male floret (PMF) color of cultivated NWR along with estimates of pollen-mediated gene flow in a cultivated paddy setting. Studies conducted in 2018 and 2019 revealed that the primary amount of pollen-mediated gene flow occurred within the first 7m from the PMF donor source with no gene flow detected past 63m. These results suggest that the likelihood of pollen-mediated gene flow between cultivated NWR and natural stands remains low. We also identified a strong linkage between male floret, auricle, and culm color. This study demonstrates that the WMF trait is an excellent candidate for use in pollen-mediated gene flow studies in NWR.","Gietzel, Clare; Duquette, Jacques; McGilp, Lillian; Kimball, Jennifer",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428335,510
185570,Orthopedic Surgery Residency Application Process in 2020 - Has Diversity been Affected?,2021,"Background: Public health authorities advocate vaccinations for the general population, including cancer patients and survivors. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, its vaccine has been eagerly awaited, but the extent of cancer patients' willingness to get vaccinated is not clear. As health promotion is crucial for these individuals, it is important to measure and analyze their willingness to receive the vaccine. Methods: A few days after the regulatory approval for the first COVID-19 vaccine, the CareAcross online interactive platforms were used to evaluate the willingness of patients to get vaccinated. Through an online survey, within a few hours, 1106 cancer patients selected either 'Yes, I plan to get the vaccine' or 'No, I will not get the vaccine'. The patients were from the UK, Germany, France, Spain or Italy;they had been diagnosed with breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer. Their responses were analyzed to determine how their cancer diagnosis (including date, metastatic status, and other aspects), and their country of origin, affected their reported willingness to get vaccinated. Results: Overall, 70.6% of patients indicated willingness to get the vaccine (WTV), and 29.4% reported the opposite (NWTV). The strongest determinant of WTV was the patient's country of origin: patients in the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany and France reported WTV of 84.1%, 64.2%, 58.7%, 47.4% and 38.3%, respectively. The next strongest determinant was the time elapsed since the patient's diagnosis: for the largest population with available diagnosis date (451 UK patients), the average time since diagnosis for patients with WTV vs NWTV was: breast, 3.5 vs 2.5 years;lung, 1.6 vs 1.4 years;prostate, 2.4 vs 3.3 years;colorectal, 1.9 vs 1.5 years. Among patients from other countries with available diagnosis date: as the time since diagnosis increased, among 148 Italian patients WTV gradually increased;among 94 Spanish patients, WTV substantially decreased;among 85 French patients, WTV gradually decreased;among 50 German patients, WTV substantially increased. There was no significant correlation of WTV percentages with cancer type;metastatic status;triple negative vs non-triple negative among breast cancer patients;non-small cell vs small cell among lung cancer patients. Conclusions: Despite longstanding efforts of the scientific community for health promotion through the COVID-19 vaccine, a substantial percentage of cancer patients reported no willingness to get vaccinated. This appeared to depend on each patient's country of origin, and the time elapsed since their diagnosis. This patient input was collected shortly after the first vaccine's approval. With increasing evidence of efficacy and safety through more vaccinations of citizens and patients, willingness is expected to increase.

The city and its health care system faced enormous challenges in responding to this new infectious disease, learning about its transmission, diagnosis and treatment, in containing its spread and in coping with its socioeconomic impact. As the site of a significant cluster of cases in the second wave of the outbreak, North York General Hospital (NYGH) quickly adapted many components of its operations, focusing on the fight against SARS. In order to assess potential SARS cases in a safe, efficient and effective manner, NYGH established a SARS assessment clinic. We describe the design features, construction, layout and operation of this clinic. This type of clinic can be rapidly deployed and may be of great value during future infectious outbreaks, including pandemic influenza.","Rutledge, Tim; Penciner, Rick; Popovich, Karyn",CJEM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17355672/,510

Many critical ethical issues have arisen in the healthcare context. While response from healthcare professionals to participating in the care of patients in the era of COVID-19 has generally been positive, there have also been disturbing experiences on the ground. The practice of medicine is a social contract with humanity. Challenges have arisen because the patient is both a victim and a vector of the coronavirus. All humans should have a natural instinct to care for those in need. Ethically and legally, healthcare professionals cannot be expected to assume a significant and unreasonable risk of harm. While fear is understandable, altruism and interest in serving the sick exemplify the value of solidarity. Social harms like stigmatisation and discrimination can occur. Concerns have been raised regarding protection of privacy and respect for rights of infected individuals. In the era of COVID-19, fear, misinformation and a detachment from one's calling put professionalism strongly to the test.","Dhai, A; Veller, M; Ballot, D; Mokhachane, M",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880548/,510

They apply this method to the well-documented cases of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States and France. In the United States (using data for 1972-2002), the authors observed strong short-range correlations between several states and their immediate neighbors, as well as robust long-range spreading patterns resulting from large domestic air-traffic flows. The stability of these results over time allowed the authors to draw conclusions about the possible impact of travel restrictions on epidemic spread. The authors also applied this method to the case of France (1984-2004) and found that on the regional scale, there was no transportation mode that clearly dominated disease spread. The simplicity and robustness of this method suggest that it could be a useful tool for detecting transmission channels in the spread of epidemics.","Crépey, Pascal; Barthélemy, Marc",American journal of epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17938424/,510

There is evidence to suggest that the incidence of otitis media is increasing. The major cause of otitis media is infection of the middle ear with microbes from the nasopharynx. The anatomical orientation of the eustachian tube, in association with a number of risk factors, predisposes infants and young children to the infection. Bacteria are responsible for approximately 70% of cases of acute otitis media, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis predominating as the causative agents. The respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza and influenza, account for 30% of acute otitis media cases. Over the past decade, there has been a profound increase in the reported resistance to antibiotics, which, with increased disease burden, has focussed attention on vaccine development for otitis media. A polymicrobial formulation containing antigens from all major pathogens would have the greatest potential to deliver a sustained reduction in the disease burden globally. The disappointing outcomes for otitis media seen with the polysaccharide pneumococcal conjugate vaccine have raised major challenges for the vaccination strategy. Clearly, more knowledge is required concerning immune mechanisms in the middle ear, as well as vaccine formulations containing antigens that are more representative of the polymicrobial nature of the disease. Antigens that have been extensively tested in animal models are now available for testing in human subjects.","Cripps, Allan W; Otczyk, Diana C",Expert review of vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16989632/,510

With E. coli alone, a dose of 2 x 10(8) bacteria administered 24 hours after birth causes a mild attack of diarrhoea, whereas 1 x 10(10) bacteria leads to dehydration and death. An inoculation of rotavirus is followed by diarrhoea which always contains large quantities of rotavirus. These animals were anorectic for a time, but none was dehydrated or died. With coronavirus, there were large quantities of watery diarrhoea, which led to dehydration and death. The inoculation of rotavirus, not lethal in itself, followed by a similarly non lethal inoculation of E. coli in doses of 3 x 10(8) to 2 x 10(9) led to dehydration and death.

Xenogeneic DNA immunization against gp75/TRP-1 generates antibody-dependent tumor immunity and autoimmune depigmentation. In contrast xenogeneic TRP-2 DNA immunization induces immunity mediated by CD8+ T-cells. The role of IFN-gamma in the generation of tumor immunity and autoimmune depigmentation in these two models was investigated. No tumor protection and minimal depigmentation was observed after immunization with human TRP-2 DNA in mice deficient in IFN-gamma ligand. Repletion with recombinant murine IFN-gamma restored tumor immunity. Experiments using IL4 deficient mice demonstrated that tumor immunity was unaffected but that autoimmune depigmentation was potentially accelerated, consistent with down-modulation of autoimmunity against TRP-2 by IL4. In contrast, IFN-gamma was not required for the generation of immunity to gp75/TRP-1. In fact, exogenous IFN-gamma ablated autoantibody responses against gp75/TRP-1 after xenogeneic DNA immunization, consistent with a down-regulatory effect of IFN-gamma. These results show that immunity to TRP-2 following DNA immunization uses an IFN-gamma-dependent Th1 pathway, but immunity to gp75/TRP-1 is down-regulated by IFN-gamma.","Wolchok, J D; Srinivasan, R; Perales, M A; Houghton, A N; Bowne, W B; Blachere, N E",Cancer immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12747770/,510

The age range of the mothers was 15-44 years. Obstetric histories and information regarding the infants were obtained from the hospital notes. The mothers were interviewed in the hospital, usually within 24 hours of delivery. At 3 weeks postpartum, all but 1 of the mothers was visited at home. The mothers were asked to attend 10 clinics. At all visits or clinics the infants' method of feeding, infections, the family income and expenditure on food were recorded. Most mothers breast fed fully (65%) in the hospital, but by 3 weeks only 25% were still breast feeding fully. Partial breast feeding was not prolonged. At 5 months only 38% of the infants were still breast fed. More women aged 27 years or older tended to breast feed for 4 months or longer (69%) although they appeared less successful at complete breast feeding in hospital (41%) than younger women (77%). This decline in breast feeding occurred in a context of poverty in which the majority of the mothers' weekly income (88%) was spent on food. As the program to promote breast feeding could not be exactly defined, the relationship between the program and the infant feeding practices was unclear.","Landman, J P; Shaw-Lyon, V",The West Indian medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1266210/,510

PATIENTS AND METHODS TE in the prone position was performed in 58 patients with esophageal cancer using slender tracheal forceps. Perioperative and postoperative clinical data were compared against those of 61 patients who underwent transthoracic open esophagectomy (OE). RESULTS The mean duration of thoracic manipulation was significantly longer in the TE than OE group: 226.2 versus 171.3 minutes (p<0.0001). Mean blood loss was significantly lower in the TE than OE group: 39.9 versus 176.8 g (p<0.0001). A mean of 23.4 mediastinal lymph nodes were dissected in the TE group and 25.1 in the OE group. The timing of extubation tended to be earlier in the TE group. Postoperative morbidity did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION Slender tracheal forceps are acceptable for fine mediastinal lymphadenectomy in thoracoscopic surgery for esophageal cancer, and the technique could contribute to development of minimally invasive surgery.","Nakajima, Masanobu; Takahashi, Masakazu; Domeki, Yasushi; Satomura, Hitoshi; Muroi, Hiroto; Kikuchi, Maiko; Ogata, Hideo; Yamaguchi, Satoru; Sasaki, Kinro; Sakai, Makoto; Sohda, Makoto; Miyazaki, Tatsuya; Kuwano, Hiroyuki; Kato, Hiroyuki",In vivo,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27815477/,510
191217,"Clustering of Road Traffic Injuries During the 7-day Songkran Holiday, Thailand: A Spatial Analysis.",2019,"Nidoviruses produce an extensive 3'-coterminal nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, which are used to express structural proteins and sometimes accessory proteins. In arteriviruses and coronaviruses, these mRNAs contain a common 5' leader sequence, derived from the genomic 5' end. The joining of the leader sequence to different segments derived from the 3'-proximal part of the genome (mRNA bodies) presumably involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis in which base pairing between sense and antisense transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) plays an essential role. The leader TRS is present in the loop of a hairpin structure that functions in sg mRNA synthesis. In this study, the minimal sequences in the 5'-proximal region of the Equine arteritis virus genome that are required for sg RNA synthesis were delimited through mutagenesis. A full-length cDNA clone was engineered in which this domain was duplicated, allowing us to make mutations and monitor their effects on sg RNA synthesis without seriously affecting genome replication and translation. The leader TRS present in the duplicated sequence was used and yielded novel sg mRNAs with significantly extended leaders. Our combined findings suggest that the leader TRS hairpin (LTH) and its immediate flanking sequences are essential for efficient sg RNA synthesis and form an independent functional entity that could be moved 300 nucleotides downstream of its original position in the genome. We hypothesize that a conformational switch in the LTH region regulates the role of the 5'-proximal region of the arterivirus genome in subgenomic RNA synthesis.","van den Born, Erwin; Posthuma, Clara C; Gultyaev, Alexander P; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15858015/,510

Peptide-conjugated PMOs (P-PMOs) supplied in cell culture medium at micromolar concentrations were efficiently taken up by Vero-E6 cells and were minimally cytotoxic. The P-PMOs were designed to base pair to RNA sequences involved in different aspects of EAV amplification: genome replication, subgenomic mRNA synthesis, and translation of genome and subgenomic mRNAs. A novel recombinant EAV, expressing green fluorescent protein as part of its replicase polyproteins, was used to facilitate drug screening. A moderate reduction of EAV amplification was observed with relatively high concentrations of P-PMOs designed to anneal to the 3'-terminal regions of the viral genome or antigenome. To determine if the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs could be specifically reduced, transcription-regulating sequences essential for their production, but not for the production of genomic RNA, were targeted, but these P-PMOs were found to be ineffective at transcription interference. In contrast, all four P-PMOs designed to base pair with targets in the genomic 5' untranslated region markedly reduced virus amplification in a sequence-specific and dose-responsive manner. At concentrations in the low micromolar range, some of the P-PMOs tested completely inhibited virus amplification. In vitro translation assays showed that these P-PMOs were potent inhibitors of translation. The data suggest that these compounds could be useful as reagents for exploring the molecular mechanics of nidovirus translation and have anti-EAV potential at relatively low concentrations.","van den Born, Erwin; Stein, David A; Iversen, Patrick L; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16227231/,510

CASE PRESENTATION This report describes the response of a multisite integrated system to the COVID-19 pandemic through activation of the Hospital Incident Command System. DISCUSSION A robust emergency response plan with multidisciplinary involvement can help to ensure clear lines of accountability and expedite decision-making. Consistent physician input across affected specialties allows for a robust understanding of impacted areas, peer-to-peer communication, and a sense of ownership across the medical staff. The necessity of effective communication with staff and patients during times of crisis cannot be understated. The potential for information overload in a pandemic is significant but can be overcome through consistent and transparent communication from leadership. CONCLUSION Health systems should have a well-organized emergency response system prepared to launch in small-scale or large-scale situations.

Analyses to date have been unable to identify the precise origin of the SARS coronavirus. We used Bayesian, neighbor-joining, and split decomposition phylogenetic techniques on the SARS virus replicase, surface spike, matrix, and nucleocapsid proteins to reveal the evolutionary origin of this recently emerging infectious agent. The analyses support a mammalian-like origin for the replicase protein, an avian-like origin for the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins, and a mammalian-avian mosaic origin for the host-determining spike protein. A bootscan recombination analysis of the spike gene revealed high nucleotide identity between the SARS virus and a feline infectious peritonitis virus throughout the gene, except for a 200- base-pair region of high identity to an avian sequence. These data support the phylogenetic analyses and suggest a possible past recombination event between mammalian-like and avian-like parent viruses. This event occurred near a region that has been implicated to be the human receptor binding site and may have been directly responsible for the switch of host of the SARS coronavirus from animals to humans.","Stavrinides, John; Guttman, David S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14671089/,510

We used a non-statistical nominal group technique to generate evaluations of the plausibility, formal validity (verification) and predictive validity of the simulation. A health-effect assessment structure was used as a framework for data collection. FINDINGS The unpredictability of social order during disasters was not adequately addressed by simulation methods; even minor disruptions of the social order may invalidate key infrastructural assumptions underpinning current pandemic simulation models. Further, a direct relationship between model flexibility and computation time was noted. Consequently, simulation methods cannot, in practice, support integrated modifications of microbiological, epidemiological and spatial submodels or handle multiple parallel scenarios. CONCLUSION The combination of incomplete surveillance data and simulation methods that neglect social dynamics limits the ability of national public health agencies to provide policy-makers and the general public with the critical and timely information needed during a pandemic.","Timpka, Toomas; Eriksson, Henrik; Gursky, Elin A; Nyce, James M; Morin, Magnus; Jenvald, Johan; Strömgren, Magnus; Holm, Einar; Ekberg, Joakim",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19551239/,510

It has multiple important physiological functions, one of which is to act as an immune mechanism against intracellular microbes.(1,2) Bacteria and viruses targeted for destruction are sequestered into large double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and subsequently delivered to the lysosomes where they are consumed by resident hydrolases. Unfortunately, conserved cellular pathways are often exploited by pathogens to facilitate their entry or replication, and autophagy is no exception. It has become clear that certain bacteria and viruses subvert this process to their advantage.(3) Nidoviruses, which comprise coronaviruses and arteriviruses, might be among the successful.

The SARS epidemic earlier this year affected more than 30 countries and regions, with a cumulative global total of 8098 cases. It is caused by a novel coronavirus, probably of animal origin. The mean incubation period is 6.4 days (range 2-11 days). Patients usually present with high fever, chills, myalgia and dry cough, with or without chest X-ray evidence of pneumonia at the onset of disease. A history of contact with or travel to an area with local transmission is common. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, as a valid rapid diagnostic test is not yet available. There is no specific antiviral therapy for this disease, and no controlled clinical trial for any treatment modality has been conducted. In several retrospective studies steroids have been shown to be useful in a proportion of patients who deteriorated despite antibiotics and supportive treatment. SARS has a high morbidity (about 25% required intensive care) and fatality (9.6%). A high index of suspicion for the disease, isolation of patients, strict observation of infection control practices and compliance with use of personal protective equipment are necessary to prevent nosocomial infection. Contact tracing and quarantine are essential measures to prevent community spread of disease. Prevention of future outbreaks requires strengthening of infection control practices in hospitals, development of a rapid diagnostic test and a vaccine, and removal of any animal reservoir and environmental conditions that led to the spread of the disease.","Chan-Yeung, M; Ooi, G C; Hui, D S; Ho, P L; Tsang, K W",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14677886/,510

196367,Time Series Forecasting of US COVID-19 Transmission.,2021-01-08,"In addition to the RI (replicative intermediate RNA) and native RF (replicative form RNA), mouse hepatitis virus-infected cells contained six species of RNA intermediates active in transcribing subgenomic mRNA. We have named these transcriptive intermediates (TIs) and native transcriptive forms (TFs) because they are not replicating genome-sized RNA. Based on solubility in high salt solutions, approximately 70% of the replicating and transcribing structures that accumulated in infected cells by 5-6 h post-infection were multi-stranded intermediates, the RI/TIs. The other 30% were in double-stranded structures, the native RF/TFs. These replicating and transcribing structures were separated by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients or by gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose 2B and Sephacryl S-1000, and migrated on agarose gels during electrophoresis, according to their size. Digestion with RNase T1 at 1-10 units/microgram RNA resolved RI/TIs into RF/TF cores and left native RF/TFs intact, whereas RNase A at concentrations of 0.02 microgram/microgram RNA or higher degraded both native RF/TFs and RI/TIs. Viral RI/TIs and native RF/TFs bound to magnetic beads containing oligo(dT)(25), suggesting that the poly(A) sequence on the 3' end of the positive strands was longer than any poly(U) on the negative strands. Kinetics of incorporation of [(3)H]uridine showed that both the RI and TIs were transcriptionally active and the labelling of RI/TIs was not the dead-end product of aberrant negative-strand synthesis. Failure originally to find TIs and TF cores was probably due to overdigestion with RNase A.","Sawicki, D; Wang, T; Sawicki, S",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11161278/,510

Although treatment of chronic or relapsing otitis media with effusion is considered imperative, none of the preventative or nonsurgical management measures currently available have proven effective. Tympanostomy tube placement remains the recommended treatment option for high-risk children or for cases of unresponsive otitis media with effusion. This can be attributed to the uncertainties surrounding its pathogenesis. Multiple factors and several possible pathogenetic models have been proposed to explain the production and persistence of middle-ear effusion; only a few of them are supported by sufficient evidence. In this review, the authors will present current knowledge on the pathogenesis, consequences, diagnosis and management of otitis media with effusion. An effort will be made to clarify those aspects sufficiently supported by evidence-based studies, and to underline those that remain unfounded.","Chantzi, Fotini-Maria; Bairamis, Theodoros; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Kafetzis, Dimitris A",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15757462/,510

The two common available systems are by a continuous (high/low) flow system and by a mechanical ventilator. Aim of this study was to compare the mechanical performance of the CPAP systems in intubated and not intubated patients. Medical literature databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched for articles on ""clinical trials"" and ""randomized controlled trials"". The key words ""continuous positive airway pressure"" and ""CPAP"", were combined with any of these key words: adult, work of breathing, continuous flow, mechanical valve, water valve, balloon reservoir, mechanical ventilator, pressure triggering, flow triggering, lung model, demand valve, equipment. Thirty-two articles (18 human and 14 bench studies) met the inclusion criteria. The continuous flow systems are able to maintain acceptable airway pressure variations during normal breathing. The most recent mechanical ventilators equipped with flow by systems compared to the first one, presented a similar or better work of breathing compared to the continuous flow systems due to the application of a little amount of pressure support. Although the use of a continuous flow is cheaper compared to mechanical ventilators, it does not allow a continuous respiratory monitoring.","Chiumello, D; Esquinas, A M; Moerer, O; Terzi, N",Minerva anestesiologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23044739/,510

The purpose of this study was to assess the odds ratio for dysgeusia associated with COVID-19 in a pediatric population of a major health center. Methods: Deidentified aggregate data, provided by the chief data officer (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside-I2B2) from June 2015 to October 2020, was used for correlation using the dysgeusia code (ICD 10 R43.2) with and without positivity for COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were measured from January 2020 to October 2020. Results: Among the 552 children who tested positive for COVID-19, nine also tested positive for dysgeusia and were older than nine years of age (odds ratio equals 149.5; 95 percent confidence interval equals 66.9 to 334.3; P<0.001).

199461,Challenges Faced by Medical Journals During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus causing COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan City, China towards the end of 2019. At present, there is no evidence that pregnant women are more likely to be severely ill, need ICU care, or die from the illness in comparison to non-pregnant adults. Evidences suggest that vertical transmission, might be possible. We searched and retrieved the published literature from PubMed and Google Scholar using various keywords. We further searched the official webpages of various organizations for the updated information. Pregnant individuals in particular are encouraged to take all available precautions to optimize health and avoid exposure to COVID-19. Adequate Testing should be prioritized in pregnant women admitted with suspected COVID-19. When a pregnancy is complicated by critical illness, the pregnant patient should ideally be cared for at a Level III or IV hospital. In the face of COVID-19, antenatal fetal surveillance and ultrasonography should continue as medically indicated when possible and elective ultrasound examinations should not be performed. Maternal immunizations continue to be an essential component of prenatal care and Obgyns should screen all pregnant individuals for mental health issues. Although the most commonly reported sign in COVID-19 is fever, nevertheless, other causes of intrapartum fever should not be overlooked. Cesarean delivery should be based on obstetric indications and not COVID-19 status alone. Infants born to patients with known COVID-19 should be considered infants with suspected COVID-19. The suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mother and infant can be allowed to remain together with enhanced precautions and suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19 is not a contraindication to breastfeeding. If both the mother and the infant are healthy, it may be prudent to expedite discharge, so as to limit the risk of inadvertent exposure and infection. The Ob-gyns should commit to providing necessary care, although modifications to health care delivery approaches may be necessary.","Shrestha, N; Dangal, G",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605241/,510

ARB is well known in Russia and China, although to a lesser extent in western countries. Unlike other broad-spectrum antivirals, ARB has an established molecular mechanism of action against influenza A and B viruses, which is different from that of available influenza antivirals, and a more recently established mechanism of inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV). For both viral infections the anti-viral mechanism involves ARB inhibition of virus-mediated fusion with target membrane and a resulting block of virus entry into target cells. However, ARB inhibition of fusion exploits different ARB modalities in case of influenza viruses or HCV. This review aims to summarize the available evidence of ARB effects against different groups of viruses, also, to compare various aspects of ARB anti-fusion mechanisms against influenza virus and HCV (with reference to different stringency of pH-dependence of these two viral fusogens) and to discuss further prospects for ARB and its improved derivatives of the parent compounds.","Boriskin, Y S; Leneva, I A; Pécheur, E-I; Polyak, S J",Current medicinal chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18393857/,510

We aimed to describe the psychological and occupational impact of this event within a large hospital in the first 4 weeks of the outbreak and the subsequent administrative and mental health response. METHODS Two principal authors met with core team members and mental health care providers at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, to compile retrospectively descriptions of the experiences of staff and patients based on informal observation. All authors reviewed and analyzed the descriptions in an iterative process between Apr. 3 and Apr. 13, 2003. RESULTS In a 4-week period, 19 individuals developed SARS, including 11 health care workers. The hospital's response included establishing a leadership command team and a SARS isolation unit, implementing mental health support interventions for patients and staff, overcoming problems with logistics and communication, and overcoming resistance to directives. Patients with SARS reported fear, loneliness, boredom and anger, and they worried about the effects of quarantine and contagion on family members and friends. They experienced anxiety about fever and the effects of insomnia. Staff were adversely affected by fear of contagion and of infecting family, friends and colleagues. Caring for health care workers as patients and colleagues was emotionally difficult. Uncertainty and stigmatization were prominent themes for both staff and patients. INTERPRETATION The hospital's response required clear communication, sensitivity to individual responses to stress, collaboration between disciplines, authoritative leadership and provision of relevant support. The emotional and behavioural reactions of patients and staff are understood to be a normal, adaptive response to stress in the face of an overwhelming event.","Maunder, Robert; Hunter, Jonathan; Vincent, Leslie; Bennett, Jocelyn; Peladeau, Nathalie; Leszcz, Molyn; Sadavoy, Joel; Verhaeghe, Lieve M; Steinberg, Rosalie; Mazzulli, Tony",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12743065/,510

The use of operating rooms (ORs) and the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) for intensive care is part of surge response planning. We aim to describe and discuss some of the practical considerations involved in a large tertiary hospital in Singapore. Firstly, considerations for setting up a level III intensive care unit (ICU) include that of space, staff, supplies and standards. Secondly, oxygen supply of the entire hospital is a major determinant of the number of ventilators it can support, including those on non-invasive forms of oxygen therapy. Thirdly, air flows due to positive pressure systems within the OR complex need to be addressed. In addition, due to the worldwide shortage of ICU ventilators, the US Food and Drug Administration has granted temporary approval for the use of anaesthesia gas machines for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Lastly, planning of logistics and staff deployment needs to be carefully considered during a crisis. Although OR and PACU are not designed for long-term care of critically ill patients, they may be adapted for ICU use with careful planning in the current pandemic.","Tan, Zihui; Phoon, Priscilla Hui Yi; Tien, Claudia Jong-Chie; Katijo, Johari; Ng, Shin Yi; Goh, Meng Huat","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33463659/,510
200027,Emergency response to COVID-19 epidemic: One Chinese blood centre's experience,2020,"To test the hypothesis that the 65-nucleotide (nt) leader on subgenomic mRNAs suffices as a 5'-terminal cis-acting signal for RNA replication, a corollary to the notion that coronavirus mRNAs behave as replicons, synthetic RNA transcripts of a cloned, reporter-containing N mRNA (mRNA 7) of the bovine coronavirus with a precise 5' terminus and a 3' poly(A) of 68 nt were tested for replication after being transfected into helper virus-infected cells. No replication was observed, but synthetic transcripts of a cloned reporter-containing defective interfering (DI) RNA differing from the N mRNA construct by 433 nt of continuous 5'-proximal genomic sequence between the leader and the N open reading frame did replicate and become packaged, indicating the insufficiency of the leader alone as a 5' signal for replication of transfected RNA molecules. The leader was shown to be a necessary part of the cis-acting signal for DI RNA replication, however, since removal of terminal bases that destroyed a predicted intraleader stem-loop also destroyed replicating ability. Surprisingly, when the same stem-loop was disrupted by base substitutions, replication appeared only minimally impaired and the leader was found to have rapidly reverted to wild type during DI RNA replication, a phenomenon reminiscent of high-frequency leader switching in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. These results suggest that once a minimal structural requirement for leader is fulfilled for initiation of DI RNA replication, the wild-type leader is strongly preferred for subsequent replication. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to reported natural mouse hepatitis coronavirus DI RNAs, the DI RNA of the bovine coronavirus does not require sequence elements originating from discontinuous downstream regions within the polymerase gene for replication or for packaging.","Chang, R Y; Hofmann, M A; Sethna, P B; Brian, D A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7966615/,510
200175,Fiberoptic bronchoscopy via intubation box during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Global travel and transport play a critical role in the spread of infections. We see this clearly in the first two pandemics of the 21st century: SARS and influenza H1N1-2009. Although air travel contributed to dissemination in these two pandemics, the travel restrictions, quarantines, and heightened vigilance which resulted had an impact on maritime health. Seasonal, pandemic, and avian influenza have some important differences with regards to exposure risks, infectivity, and severity. Most of the data for maritime influenza outbreaks focus on seasonal influenza on cruise ships, but influenza among crew members occurs due to close working conditions and is potentially preventable with staff vaccination programs. To date, avian influenza has low human-to-human transmission; infection typically requires close contact with poultry, but presents with severe disease and a high fatality rate. Pandemic (swine) influenza was readily transmitted between people, including young adults, and caused severe illness in high-risk groups including pregnant women, children, and those with co-morbidities and obesity. In contrast, SARS had lower infectivity compared to influenza, and a longer incubation period. These characteristics slowed its propagation enough that outbreak control measures, such as isolation of infected cases and quarantine of exposed but well persons, were effective in terminating this pandemic. No effective vaccine exists for SARS at this time, whereas countries were able to deploy millions of doses of pandemic influenza vaccine within 7 months after the outbreak was first recognized in Mexico. The lack of a protective vaccine and the higher case fatality rate in SARS will mean that stringent quarantine measures may still be required for outbreak control if SARS ever occurs again. Compliance with international health regulations, and the ability to adapt these to maritime health needs, will be important in the shipping industry.","Lim, Poh Lian",International maritime health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258842/,510

The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes.2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated.3.

However, this approach has several shortcomings in practical applications. For example, large scale production of protein pharmaceutics frequently requires laborious amplification of the inserted genes to optimize the gene expression. The random chromosomal insertion of exogenous DNA also results occasionally in malignant transformation of normal tissue cells, raising safety concerns in medical applications. Here we report a novel cytoplasmic RNA replicon capable of expressing installed genes stably without chromosome insertion. This system is based on the RNA genome of a noncytopathic variant Sendai virus strain, Cl.151. We found that this variant virus establishes stable symbiosis with host cells by escaping from retinoic acid-inducible gene I-interferon regulatory factor 3-mediated antiviral machinery. Using a cloned genome cDNA of Sendai virus Cl.151, we developed a recombinant RNA installed with exogenous marker genes that was maintained stably in the cytoplasm as a high copy replicon (about 4 x 10(4) copies/cell) without interfering with normal cellular function. Strong expression of the marker genes persisted for more than 6 months in various types of cultured cells and for at least two months in rat colonic mucosa without any apparent side effects.

METHODS The current study aimed to identify the incidence of positivity of lupus anticoagulant in Covid-19 patients and analyze the association between LA and D-dimer in predicting thrombosis and mortality in one-hundred and five hospitalized adult (age >14 years) patients and forty-three hospitalized pediatric (age <14 years) patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 between June 2020 and September 2020. RESULTS Twenty-one (20%) adult patients were tested positive for PTT LA, of which nine (8.6%) turned out to be confirmed positive for LA through StaClot and DRVVT Ratio tests. Six (14%) pediatric patients were positive for PTT LA, and only one (2.3%) had positive StaClot. Median D-dimer at admission was positively correlated with age and CRP among adult patients and was significantly higher in expired cases (P=0.001). No association between any of the coagulation tests and thrombosis or mortality was observed in the pediatric cohort.

Here we show that the signal for localizing the Uukuniemi virus (a phlebovirus) spike protein complex to the Golgi complex resides in the cytoplasmic tail of G1. We constructed chimeric proteins in which the ectodomain, transmembrane domain (TMD), and cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Uukuniemi virus G1 were exchanged with the corresponding domains of either vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV G), chicken lysozyme, or CD4, all proteins readily transported to the plasma membrane. The chimeras were expressed in HeLa or BHK-21 cells by using either the T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus system or the Semliki Forest virus system. The fate of the chimeric proteins was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence, and their localizations were compared by double labeling with markers specific for the Golgi complex. The results showed that the ectodomain and TMD (including the 10 flanking residues on either side of the membrane) of G1 played no apparent role in targeting chimeric proteins to the Golgi complex. Instead, all chimeras containing the CT of G1 were efficiently targeted to the Golgi complex and colocalized with mannosidase II, a Golgi-specific enzyme. Conversely, replacing the CT of G1 with that from VSV G resulted in the efficient transport of the chimeric protein to the cell surface. Progressive deletions of the G1 tail suggested that the Golgi retention signal maps to a region encompassing approximately residues 10 to 50, counting from the proposed border between the TMD and the tail. Both G1 and G2 were found to be acylated, as shown by incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the viral proteins. By mutational analyses of CD4-G1 chimeras, the sites for palmitylation were mapped to two closely spaced cysteine residues in the G1 tail. Changing either or both of these cysteines to alanine had no effect on the targeting of the chimeric protein to the Golgi complex.","Andersson, A M; Melin, L; Bean, A; Pettersson, R F",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9151865/,510
201983,Decline in Motor Function during the COVID-19 Pandemic Restrictions and Its Recovery in a Child with Cerebral Palsy: A Case Report,2021,"We have sequenced 200 to 240 bases of the matrix (M) glycoprotein gene of 23 strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) representing the A (D207), B (D3896), C (D3128), D (D212), Massachusetts (Mass), UK11 and UK12 serotypes. The bases examined code for the external, hydrophilic region and the first membrane-embedded hydrophobic region of M, both regions comprising approximately 20 amino acids. As predicted from protein Mr studies the A/D and B/C serotypes had two and one potential glycosylation sites respectively. This variation appeared to derive from a combination of base substitutions and deletions/insertions. The glycosylation sequence Asn-Cys-Thr was highly conserved. Overall, the exposed part of M exhibited a fourfold greater extent of amino acid variation than did the membrane-embedded sequence. The transcription-associated homology region sequence (CUUAACAA) in the 5' intergenic region was identical in all strains but there was considerable variation as to its location. The M gene of UK12 appeared to have evolved from a group A-like M gene by a two stage process involving a base substitution in the intergenic region which generated a new AUG translation start codon followed by deletion of the original AUG. Isolate UK11 closely resembled Mass strains in the intergenic region but was dissimilar from all strains in the protein coding region. The M sequences of serotypes B and C were identical and those of the A and D serotypes very similar. These results are discussed in relation to recent sequencing of part of the spike glycoprotein gene of some of these strains and the discovery of in vitro recombination of murine hepatitis coronavirus.","Cavanagh, D; Davis, P J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2832526/,510

202363,Resumption of Endodontic Practices in COVID-19 Hardest-Hit Area of China: A Web-based Survey,2020,"RESEARCH QUESTION: Discontinuation of IVF cycles has been part of the radical transformation of healthcare provision to enable reallocation of staff and resources to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to estimate the impact of cessation of treatment on individual prognosis and US population live birth rates. DESIGN: Data from 271,438 ovarian stimulation UK IVF cycles was used to model the effect of age as a continuous, yet non-linear, function on cumulative live birth rate. This model was recalibrated to cumulative live birth rates reported for the 135,673 stimulation cycles undertaken in the USA in 2016, with live birth follow-up to October 2018. The effect of a 1-month, 3-month and 6-month shutdown in IVF treatment was calculated as the effect of the equivalent increase in a woman's age, stratified by age group. RESULTS: The average reduction in cumulative live birth rate would be 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-0.3), 0.8% (95% CI 0.8-0.8) and 1.6% (95% CI 1.6-1.6) for 1-month, 3-month and 6-month shutdowns. This corresponds to a reduction of 369 (95% CI 360-378), 1098 (95% CI 1071-1123) and 2166 (95% CI 2116-2216) live births in the cohort, respectively. Th e greatest contribution to this reduction was from older mothers. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the discontinuation of fertility treatment for even 1 month in the USA could result in 369 fewer women having a live birth, due to the increase in patients' age during the shutdown. As a result of reductions in cumulative live birth rate, more cycles may be required to overcome infertility at individual and population levels.","Smith, Andrew D A C; Gromski, Piotr S; Rashid, Karema Al; Tilling, Kate; Lawlor, Deborah A; Nelson, Scott M",Reprod Biomed Online,,510

204767,Treatments for COVID-19: emerging drugs against the coronavirus,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which reported in an outbreak in 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus belongs to the beta-coronavirus class, along with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. Interestingly, the virus binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 found in host cells, through the spike (S) protein that exists on its surface. This binding causes the entry of the virus into cells of the host organism. The actual mechanism used by the COVID-19 virus to induce disease is still speculative. A total of 44,322,504 cases, a 1,173,189 death toll and 32,486,703 recovery cases have been reported in 217 countries globally as of 28 October 2020. Symptoms from the infection of the virus include chest pain, fever, fatigue, nausea, and others. Acute respiratory stress syndrome, arrhythmia, and shock are some of the chronic manifestations recorded in severe COVID-19. Transmission is majorly by individual-to-individual through coughing, sneezing, etc. The lack of knowledge regarding the mechanism of and immune response to the virus has posed a challenge in the development of a novel drug and vaccine. Currently, treatment of the disease involves the use of anti-viral medications such as lopinavir, remdesivir, and other drugs. These drugs show some efficacy in the management of COVID-19. Studies are still on-going for the development of an ideal and novel drug for treatment. In terms of natural product intervention, Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) have been employed to alleviate the clinical manifestation and severity of the disease and have shown some efficacy. This review presents an updated detailed overview of COVID-19 and the virus, concerning its structure, epidemiology, symptoms and transmission, immune responses, and current interventions, and highlights the potential of TCM. It is anticipated that this review will further add to the understanding of COVID-19 and the virus, hence opening new research perspectives.","Rauf, Abdur; Abu-Izneid, Tareq; Olatunde, Ahmed; Ahmed Khalil, Anees; Alhumaydhi, Fahad A; Tufail, Tabussam; Shariati, Mohammad Ali; Rebezov, Maksim; Almarhoon, Zainab M; Mabkhot, Yahia N; Alsayari, Abdulrhman; Rengasamy, Kannan R R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,510
204908,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Stroke Patients,2020,"Aim To assess the changes induced by the COVID-19 lockdown on cardiac biometric variables recorded using an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) in a patient population monitored for syncope work-up, as well to assess whether there has been an effect on arrhythmic events among the patients. Methods Longitudinal cohort study. We included 245 adult patients monitored with an ICM indicated for the investigation of syncope. The records from days 1 to 12 March 2020 (prior to the institution of lockdown by the state government) with days 16 to 28 March 2020 were compared. Results Daily physical exercise reduced markedly after the imposition of lockdown (132 [55–233] minutes vs. 78 [21–154] minutes). The mean daytime HR prior to lockdown was 77 [69–85] bpm, whereas during lockdown it was 74 [66–81] bpm. During the lockdown period, a drop in the variability in heart rate (114 [94–136] ms vs. 111 [92–133] ms) was observed. Although the incidence of AF was similar over both periods, the daily AF burden was significantly higher post-lockdown (405 [391–425] minutes vs. 423 [423–537] minutes). No differences in the number of other arrhythmias were found. Conclusions The establishment of mandatory lockdown has led to a marked drop in daily physical activity in this population which probably explains changes observed in other cardiac biometric variables. Although, in the short term, we have not documented an increased risk of arrhythmia, we cannot rule out an effect in the medium to long term or in other populations of at-risk patients. Resumen Objetivo Evaluar los cambios inducidos por el confinamiento durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en las variables biométricas cardiacas registradas, utilizando un monitor cardíaco implantable (ICM) en una población de pacientes monitorizada para el diagnóstico de síncope, así como evaluar si ha habido un efecto sobre los eventos arrítmicos. Métodos Estudio de cohorte prospectivo. Se incluyeron 245 pacientes adultos monitorizados con un ICM indicado para la investigación del síncope. Se compararon los registros de los días uno al 12 de marzo del 2020 (antes del establecimiento del confinamiento por parte del gobierno estatal) con los días 16 al 28 de marzo del 2020. Resultados El ejercicio físico diario se redujo notablemente después de la imposición del confinamiento (132 [55 a 233] vs. 78 [21 a 154] min). La frecuencia cardiaca diurna media antes del confinamiento fue de 77 (69 a 85) lpm, mientras que durante el mismo fue de 74 (66 a 81) lpm. Durante el período de confinamiento, se observó una disminución de la variabilidad de la frecuencia cardiaca (114 [94 a 136] vs. 111 [92 a 133] ms). Aunque la incidencia de fibrilación auricular (FA) fue similar en ambos períodos, la carga diaria de FA fue significativamente mayor después del bloqueo (405 [391 a 425] vs. 423 [423 a 537] min). No se encontraron diferencias en el número de otras arritmias. Conclusiones El establecimiento de un confinamiento obligatorio ha provocado un marcado descenso de la actividad física diaria en esta población, lo que probablemente explica los cambios observados en otras variables biométricas cardiacas. Si bien, a corto plazo, no se ha documentado un aumento del riesgo de arritmia, no podemos descartar un efecto a medio-largo plazo o en otras poblaciones de pacientes de riesgo.","Francisco-Pascual, Jaume Rivas-Gándara Núria Santos-Ortega Alba Pérez-Rodón Jordi Benito Begoña Belahnech Yassin Ferreira-González Ignacio",Medicina Clínica (English Edition),,510

DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study. RESULTS: Of 172 patients, 97.6% were very satisfied or satisfied (83.7% of the patients were very satisfied) with their telemedicine appointment. In 44.4% of the cases, the physical medicine and rehabilitation physician prescribed medication to the patient, and in 21.6% of the cases, either an injection or radiofrequency ablation was ordered. Most patients (87%) did not have any issues during their encounter. Lastly, 64.5% of the patients preferred telemedicine over in-person appointments, whereas 56.1% of the patients who are 60 yrs and older responded the same. A total of 67.4% of those who had a follow-up visit would choose telemedicine over in-person. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that telemedicine can provide very effective and satisfactory care in a physical medicine and rehabilitation spine practice. This was especially notable with follow-up visits where imaging and treatment plan can easily be discussed over telemedicine. Stay-at-home orders and improved reimbursement during the COVID-19 pandemic have spurred adoption of telemedicine with high patient satisfaction. We hope that physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians will be able to continue expanding patient access in the postpandemic world.","Bhuva, Sheena; Lankford, Craig; Patel, Nayan; Haddas, Ram",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,510
205388,"The Spanish flu, COVID-19 and Malta's reactions: Contrasts and similarities",2020,"BACKGROUND: This article aims to summarize the key characteristics of registered trials of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), in terms of their spatial and temporal distributions, types of design and interventions, and patient characteristics among others. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the registered COVID-19 trials has been performed on platforms including ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (CHiCTR), Australian Clinical Trials Registry, Britain's National Research Register (BNRR), Current Control Trials (CCT), and Glaxo Smith Kline Register. Trials registered at the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak are included, without language restrictions. For each study, the registration information, study design, and administrator information are collected and summarized. RESULTS: A total of 220 registered trials were evaluated as of February 27, 2020. Hospital-initiated trials were the majority and account for 80% of the sample. Among the trials, pilot studies and phase 4 trials are more common and represent 35% and 19.1% of the sample, respectively. The median sample size of the registered trials is 100, with interquartile range 60-240. Further, 45.9% of the trials mentioned information on a data monitoring committee. 54.5% of the trials did not specify the disease severity among patients they intend to recruit. Four types of interventions are most common in the experimental groups across the registered studies: antiviral drugs, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), biological agents, and hormone drugs. Among them, the TCM and biological agents are frequently used in pilot study and correspond to a variety of primary endpoints. In contrast, trials with antiviral drugs have more targeted primary outcomes such as ""COVID-19 nucleic acid test"" and ""28-day mortality."" CONCLUSIONS: We provide an evidence mapping and analysis of registered COVID-19 clinical trials in China. In particular, it is critical for ongoing and future studies to refine their research hypothesis and better identify their intervention therapies and the corresponding primary outcomes. It is also imperative for multiple public health divisions and research institutions to work together for integrative clinical data capture and sharing, with a common objective of improving future studies that evaluate COVID-19 interventions.","Lu, Liming; Li, Fan; Wen, Hao; Ge, Shuqi; Zeng, Jingchun; Luo, Wen; Wang, Lai; Tang, Chunzhi; Xu, Nenggui",BMC Med,,510

Italy, May to June 2020",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the resumption of endodontic practices in Hubei Province, China 1 month after the end of the lockdown. METHODS: A Web-based survey was sent to 1069 active endodontic specialists and general dentists who provided endodontic care in Hubei Province from May 7 to May 9, 2020. The survey consisted of 18 questions on demographics, the current situation of endodontic practice for the participants, and concerns regarding contracting or spreading the virus in newly opened endodontic practices. RESULTS: A total of 322 participants completed the survey. Most respondents (62%) were from Wuhan. Almost 83% of the respondents have resumed their endodontic practice partially or fully. Most respondents in practice (99%) would take measures to screen patients before treatment including paid screening measures. More than 93% of the respondents reported having taken special measures for routine endodontic treatment at this stage, with the most common measure taken being wearing an N95 mask. The rubber dam was recognized as efficient in preventing infection by most respondents. Many respondents were concerned about contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of routine endodontic practice at this stage, and respondents with more than 11 years of endodontic experience were significantly less concerned about infection compared with those with fewer than 5 years of experience (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a fear of contracting/spreading COVID-19 among endodontic clinicians, the fear is negatively associated with years of practice, and most clinicians believe that rubber dam isolation can protect them and their patients from COVID-19.","Yu, Jingjing; Hua, Fang; Shen, Ya; Haapasalo, Markus; Qin, Danchen; Zhao, Dan; Peng, Bin; Fouad, Ashraf F",J. endod,,510

Since the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 can be more severe in patients with underlying cardiorespiratory diseases, we aimed at verifying the impact of a preexisting cardiorespiratory comorbidity on multidisciplinary rehabilitation in post-COVID-19 patients. We enrolled 95 consecutive patients referring to the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri Spa SB, IRCCS of Telese Terme, Benevento, Italy after being discharged from the COVID-19 acute care ward and after recovering from acute COVID-19 pneumonia. Forty-nine of them were not suffering from underlying comorbidities, while 46 had a preexisting cardiorespiratory disease. Rehabilitation induced statistically significant improvements in respiratory function, blood gases and the ability to exercise both in patients without any preexisting comorbidities and in those with an underlying cardiorespiratory disease. Response to the rehabilitation cycle tended to be greater in those without preexisting comorbidities, but DLco%-predicted was the only parameter that showed a significant greater improvement when compared to the response in the group of patients with underlying cardiorespiratory comorbidity. This study suggests that multidisciplinary rehabilitation may be useful in post-COVID-19 patients regardless of the presence of preexisting cardiorespiratory comorbidities.","Maniscalco, Mauro; Fuschillo, Salvatore; Ambrosino, Pasquale; Martucci, Michele; Papa, Antimo; Matera, Maria Gabriella; Cazzola, Mario",Respir Med,,510

Purinergic signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of several viral infections which makes the purinergic system a potential target of investigation in COVID-19. During viral infections, the ATP release initiates a cascade that activates purinergic receptors. This receptor activation enhances the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and performs the chemotaxis of macrophages and neutrophils, generating an association between the immune and the purinergic systems. This review was designed to cover the possible functions of purinergic signaling in COVID-19, focusing on the possible role of purinergic receptors such as P2X7 which contributes to cytokine storm and inflammasome NLRP3 activation and P2Y1 that activates the blood coagulation pathway. The possible role of ectonucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73, which have the function of dephosphorylating ATP in an immunosuppressive component, adenosine, are also covered in detail. Moreover, therapeutic combination or association possibilities targeting purinergic system components are also suggested as a possible useful tool to be tested in future researches, aiming to unveil a novel option to treat COVID-19 patients.","Franciosi, Maria Luiza Mukai; Lima, Millena Daher Medeiros; Schetinger, Maria Rosa Chitolina; Cardoso, Andréia Machado",Mol. cell. biochem,,510

As ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19 in newborns are still unknown, it is important to clarify if SARS-CoV-2 could be associated with ocular abnormalities. Objective: To determine whether exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with outcomes in the eyes of newborns. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series enrolled newborns from April to November 2020 from 3 different maternity hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil. The diagnosis of COVID-19 in mothers and newborns was based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays with material obtained from oronasopharyngeal swab sample; positive IGM serology was also considered as a diagnostic test for mothers. Newborns were excluded if they had any evidence of another congenital infection. All infants underwent external ocular examination and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Exposures: Serology test for COVID-19 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oronasopharyngeal specimen using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay on both mothers and newborns. Main Outcomes and Measures: Screening for ophthalmologic manifestation in newborns after maternal COVID-19 infection. Results: A total of 165 newborns (age range at examination, 1 to 18 days) were evaluated. Of these, 123 (74.5%) were born at full term, and 42 (25.4%) were born preterm. Maternal gestational age at the time of COVID-19-positive test varied from first to 40th gestational weeks. Six newborns (3.6%) had positive polymerase chain reaction findings for SARS-CoV-2. One newborn tested positive within 18 days (horizontal transmission), and 5 newborns tested positive in the first day of life (possible vertical transmission). None had ocular abnormalities. Concerning exposed newborns with negative test results, 1 presented with venous engorgement and vascular tortuosity, 7 had intraretinal hemorrhages, and 2 were diagnosed as having retinopathy of prematurity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this uncontrolled case series of Brazilian newborns of mothers with COVID-19 infection, a low rate of COVID-19 infection was found among newborns, and none had ocular abnormalities. Additional controlled studies may be warranted to confirm these findings.","Kiappe, Olívia Pereira; Santos da Cruz, Natasha Ferreira; Rosa, Paulo Alberto Cervi; Arrais, Luciana; Bueno de Moraes, Nilva Simeren",JAMA Ophthalmol,,510

210567,Perspectives of physicians in general and ophthalmologists in particular about restarting services post-COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 regularly infect host tissues that express antiviral proteins (AVPs) in abundance. Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of infection. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter frequently deaminates C into U residues which could generate notable viral sequence variations. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP impose selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus. Our investigation considered a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS infecting Homo sapiens, Bovine CoV infecting Bos taurus, MHV infecting Mus musculus, HEV infecting Sus scrofa, and CRCoV infecting Canis lupus familiaris). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas those that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. Among the coronaviruses surveyed herein, CpG is most deficient in SARS-CoV-2 and a temporal analysis showed a marked increase in C to U mutations over four months of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution. Furthermore, the preferred motifs in which these C to U mutations occur are the same as those subjected to APOBEC3 editing in HIV-1. These results suggest that both ZAP and APOBEC3 shape the SARS-CoV-2 genome: ZAP imposes a strong CpG avoidance, and APOBEC3 constantly edits C to U. Evolutionary pressures exerted by host immune systems onto viral genomes may motivate novel strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.","Wei, Yulong; Silke, Jordan R; Aris, Parisa; Xia, Xuhua",PLoS One,,510

211980,Preparing ophthalmologists for the use of mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUNDRecent studies have reported T cell immunity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in unexposed donors, possibly due to crossrecognition by T cells specific for common cold coronaviruses (CCCs). True T cell crossreactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2.METHODSWe used the viral functional expansion of specific T cells (ViraFEST) platform to identify T cell responses crossreactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC crossreactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system.RESULTSMemory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.CONCLUSIONSOur data confirm, for what we believe is the first time, the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes crossrecognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of crossreactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that preexisting CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these crossreactive T cell responses affect clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.FUNDINGNIH funding (U54CA260492, P30CA006973, P41EB028239, R01AI153349, R01AI145435-A1, R21AI149760, and U19A1088791) was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

METHODS: The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiological assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. RESULTS: The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-dimer, LDH and lactate levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19 we summarized, which would be helpful to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.","Li, Xun; Wang, Luwen; Yan, Shaonan; Yang, Fan; Xiang, Longkui; Zhu, Jiling; Shen, Bo; Gong, Zuojiong",Int J Infect Dis,,510

However, there is a lack of data targeting the role of ACEs for one of the most prevalent mental health problems in health-care professionals: burnout. Objective We aimed to assess the relationship between ACEs and the core burnout dimension ‘emotional exhaustion’ (EE). As health-care professionals have been facing particular challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, we furthermore aimed to assess the role of COVID-19 associated burden in the interplay between ACEs and EE. Methods During the first lockdown in Germany, a total of 2500 medical healthcare professionals were questioned in a cross-sectional online survey. Questions targeted, among others, sociodemographics, ACEs, COVID-19-associated problems (e.g. increase of workload, worries about relatives and patients) and emotional exhaustion, measured by the respective dimension of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results In German health-care professionals, ACEs were associated with a higher EE score. The number of experienced ACEs was associated with the majority of assessed COVID-19-associated problems. An increasing number of ACEs predicted higher EE scores, controlling for gender. The association between ACEs and EE was mediated significantly by COVID-19-associated problems. These included maladaptive coping strategies such as increased smoking, drinking and use of antidepressants/tranquilizers, feeling less protected by measures of the employee or the state, a greater feeling of being burdened by COVID-19-associated problems and greater exhaustion and sleep problems. Conclusion Our findings suggest ACEs as significant risk factor for EE in German health-care professionals. The current pandemic means a significant burden that further pronounces this risk. HIGHLIGHTS Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) predicted higher scores of emotional exhaustion (EE) in German healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 associated problems mediated the association between ACEs and EE.

216514,Prevalence of Alcohol and Tobacco Use in India and Implications for COVID-19 - Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata Study Projections,2020,"The WHO 2020 global TB Report estimates that in 2019 there were an estimated 500,000 cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) of which only 186,772 MDR-TB cases were diagnosed, and positive treatment outcomes were achieved in 57% of them. These data highlight the need for accelerating and improving MDR-TB screening, diagnostic, treatment and patient follow-up services. The last decade has seen three new TB drugs being licensed; bedaquiline, delamanid and pretomanid, and combinations these new, existing and repurposed drugs are leading to improved cure rates. The all oral six month WHO regimen for MDR-TB is more tolerable, has higher treatment success rates and lower mortality. However, the unprecedented ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is having major direct and indirect negative impacts on health services overall, including national TB programs and TB services. This adds further to longstanding challenges for tackling MDR-TB such as cost, rollout of diagnostics and drugs, and implementation of latest WHO guidelines for MDR-TB. In light of COVID-19 disruption of TB services, it is anticipated the numbers of MDR-TB cases will rise in 2021 and 2022 and will affect treatment outcomes further. Investing more in development of new TB drugs and shorter MDR-TB treatment regimens is required in anticipation of emerging drug resistance to new TB drug regimens. There is an urgent need for protecting current investments in TB services, sustaining gains being made in TB control and accelerating roll out of TB diagnostic and treatment services.","Tiberi, Simon; Vjecha, Michael J; Zumla, Adam; Galvin, Jessica; Migliori, Giovanni Battista; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int. j. infect. dis,,510

217422,Exploring salivary diagnostics in COVID-19: a scoping review and research suggestions,2021,"PURPOSE: Nationwide mass vaccination against Covid-19 started in Israel in late 2020. Soon we identified on [18F]FDG PET-CT studies vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (VAHL) in axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes (ASLN) ipsilateral to the vaccination site. Sometimes, differentiation between the malignant and benign nature of the hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (HLN) could not be made, and equivocal HLN (EqHL) was reported. The purpose of the study was to determine the overall incidence of VAHL after BNT162b2 vaccination and also its relevance to PET-CT interpretation in oncologic patients. METHODS: A total of 951 consecutive patients that underwent [18F]FDG PET-CT studies in our department were interviewed regarding the sites and dates of the vaccine doses. A total of 728 vaccinated patients (All-Vac group) were included: 346 received the first dose only (Vac-1 group) and 382 received the booster dose as well (Vac-2 group). Studies were categorized as no HLN, malignant-HLN (MHL), VAHL, or EqHL. In studies with VAHL, location, [18F]FDG-intensity uptake and nodes size were recorded. RESULTS: The incidences of HLN were 45.6%, 36.4%, and 53.9% in All-Vac, Vac-1, and Vac-2 groups, respectively. VAHL was reported in 80.1% of vaccinated patients with HLN. Lower incidences of VAHL were found during the first 5 days or in the third week after the first vaccine and beyond 20 days after the booster dose. In 49 of 332 (14.8%) vaccinated patients, we could not determine whether HLN was MHL or VAHL. Breast cancer and lymphoma were the leading diseases with EqHL. CONCLUSION: VAHL is frequently observed after BNT162b2 administration, more commonly and with higher intensity following the booster dose. To minimize false and equivocal reports in oncological patients, timing of [18F]FDG PET-CT should be based on the time intervals found to have a lower incidence of VAHL, and choice of vaccine injection site should be advised, mainly in patients where ASLN are a relevant site of tumor involvement.","Cohen, Dan; Krauthammer, Shir Hazut; Wolf, Ido; Even-Sapir, Einat",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,,510

217956,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education,2020,"Managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a challenge faced by clinicians and their patients, especially concerning whether to proceed with biologics and immunosuppressive agents in the background of a global outbreak of a highly contagious new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2). The knowledge about the impact of this virus on patients with IBD, although it is still scarce, is rapidly evolving. In particular, concerns surrounding medications' impact for IBD on the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection or developing COVID-19, and potentially exacerbate viral replication and the COVID-19 course, are a current thinking of both practicing clinicians and providers caring for patients with IBD. Managing patients with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 depends on both the clinical activity of the IBD and the occasional development and severity of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the current data regarding gastrointestinal involvement by SARS-CoV-2 and pharmacologic and surgical management for IBD concerning this infection, and the COVID-19 impact on both the patient's psychological functioning and endoscopy services, and we concisely summarize the telemedicine roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chebli, Júlio Maria Fonseca; Queiroz, Natália Sousa Freitas; Damião, Adérson Omar Mourão Cintra; Chebli, Liliana Andrade; Costa, Márcia Henriques de Magalhães; Parra, Rogério Serafim",World J Gastroenterol,,510

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was used to investigate attitudes, moods and behavior during lockdown in England. ALSPAC participants were invited to complete online questionnaires in May 2020, including a set of questions about frequency of gambling and gambling activities which had been asked three years previously. Mental health and wellbeing data and alcohol use were also collected as part of lockdown questionnaires. Gambling questions were completed by 2632 young adults, 71% female, with a mean age of 27.8 years. Overall, gambling frequency reduced during lockdown for both males and females, but more males engaged in regular (weekly) gambling. Gambling activities became more restricted compared to previous reports, but online gambling (e.g. online poker, bingo, casino games) was more frequent. Previous gambling behaviour predicted gambling frequency during lockdown. No associations were apparent between gambling frequency and measures of mental health and well-being. Heavy alcohol use was strongly linked with regular gambling during lockdown. Gamblers were more than twice as likely as non-gamblers to have experienced financial difficulties pre-COVID, but gambling frequency was not related to employment status during lockdown. Online gambling increased during lockdown, whilst offline gambling activities decreased in frequency.

218747,Respiratory epidemics and older people,2020,"The global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought the world to a grinding halt. A major cause of concern is the respiratory distress associated mortality attributed to the cytokine storm. Despite myriad rapidly approved clinical trials with repurposed drugs, and time needed to develop a vaccine, accelerated search for repurposed therapeutics is still ongoing. In this review, we present Nitazoxanide a US-FDA approved antiprotozoal drug, as one such promising candidate. Nitazoxanide which is reported to exert broad-spectrum antiviral activity against various viral infections, revealed good in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture assays, suggesting potential for repurposing in COVID-19. Furthermore, nitazoxanide displays the potential to boost host innate immune responses and thereby tackle the life-threatening cytokine storm. Possibilities of improving lung, as well as multiple organ damage and providing value addition to COVID-19 patients with comorbidities, are other important facets of the drug. The review juxtaposes the role of nitazoxanide in fighting COVID-19 pathogenesis at multiple levels highlighting the great promise the drug exhibits. The in silico data and in vitro efficacy in cell lines confirms the promise of nitazoxanide. Several approved clinical trials world over further substantiate leveraging nitazoxanide for COVID-19 therapy.","Lokhande, Amit S; Devarajan, Padma V",Eur J Pharmacol,,510

219276,COVID-19 Crisis Collaboration: The Poison Center and Health Department in the Time of Pandemic,2020,"The Vero cell line is considered the most used continuous cell line for the production of viral vectors and vaccines. Historically, it is the first cell line that was approved by the WHO for the production of human vaccines. Comprehensive experimental data on the production of many viruses using the Vero cell line can be found in the literature. However, the vast majority of these processes is relying on the microcarrier technology. While this system is established for the large-scale manufacturing of viral vaccine, it is still quite complex and labor intensive. Moreover, scale-up remains difficult and is limited by the surface area given by the carriers. To overcome these and other drawbacks and to establish more efficient manufacturing processes, it is a priority to further develop the Vero cell platform by applying novel bioprocess technologies. Especially in times like the current COVID-19 pandemic, advanced and scalable platform technologies could provide more efficient and cost-effective solutions to meet the global vaccine demand. Herein, we review the prevailing literature on Vero cell bioprocess development for the production of viral vectors and vaccines with the aim to assess the recent advances in bioprocess development. We critically underline the need for further research activities and describe bottlenecks to improve the Vero cell platform by taking advantage of recent developments in the cell culture engineering field.","Kiesslich, Sascha; Kamen, Amine A",Biotechnol Adv,,510

Many hospitalized patients may continue testing COVID-19 positive even after the resolution of symptoms. Thus, a pressing concern for clinicians is the safety of discharging these asymptomatic patients if they have any remaining infectivity. This case report explores the viral viability in a patient with persistent COVID-19 over the course of a 2-month hospitalization. Positive nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and isolated in the laboratory and analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR), and serology was tested for neutralizing antibodies throughout the hospitalization period. The patient experienced waning symptoms by hospital day 40 and had no viable virus growth by hospital day 41, suggesting no risk of infectivity, despite positive RT-PCR results which prolonged his hospital stay. Notably, this case showed infectivity for at least 24 days after disease onset, which is longer than the discontinuation of transmission-based precautions recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Thus, our findings suggest that the timeline for discontinuing transmission-based precautions may need to be extended for patients with severe and prolonged COVID-19 disease. Additional large-scale studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions on the appropriate clinical management for these patients. â.","Wan, Xiu-Feng; Tang, Cynthia Y; Ritter, Detlef; Wang, Yang; Li, Tao; Segovia, Karen; Kosikova, Martina; Johnson, Marc; Kwon, Hyung J; Xie, Hang; Hammer, Richard D; McElroy, Jane A; Hamid, Aws; Collins, Natalie D; Hang, Jun; Camp, Simone",J Med Virol,,510

However, little is known about its hallmarks compared to other infectious diseases. Here, we report the single-cell transcriptional landscape of longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in both COVID-19- and influenza A virus (IAV)-infected patients. We observed increase of plasma cells in both COVID-19 and IAV patients and XIAP associated factor 1 (XAF1)-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and FAS-induced T cell apoptosis in COVID-19 patients. Further analyses revealed distinct signaling pathways activated in COVID-19 (STAT1 and IRF3) versus IAV (STAT3 and NF&#954;B) patients and substantial differences in the expression of key factors. These factors include relatively increase of interleukin (IL)6R and IL6ST expression in COVID-19 patients but similarly increased IL-6 concentrations compared to IAV patients, supporting the clinical observations of increased proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we provide the landscape of PBMCs and unveil distinct immune response pathways in COVID-19 and IAV patients.","Zhu, Linnan; Yang, Penghui; Zhao, Yingze; Zhuang, Zhenkun; Wang, Zhifeng; Song, Rui; Zhang, Jie; Liu, Chuanyu; Gao, Qianqian; Xu, Qumiao; Wei, Xiaoyu; Sun, Hai-Xi; Ye, Beiwei; Wu, Yanan; Zhang, Ning; Lei, Guanglin; Yu, Lingxiang; Yan, Jin; Diao, Guanghao; Meng, Fanping; Bai, Changqing; Mao, Panyong; Yu, Yeya; Wang, Mingyue; Yuan, Yue; Deng, Qiuting; Li, Ziyi; Huang, Yunting; Hu, Guohai; Liu, Yang; Wang, Xiaoqian; Xu, Ziqian; Liu, Peipei; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Yi; Zhang, Shaogeng; Chen, Zhihai; Wang, Jian; Xu, Xun; Wu, Guizhen; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Gao, George F; Liu, Longqi; Liu, William J",Immunity,,510
225026,"COVID-19 pandemic, information and recommendations for the pulmonologist",2020,"The aim of the present study is to discuss the design of peptide vaccines and peptidomimetics against SARS-COV-2, to develop and apply a method of protein structure analysis that is particularly appropriate to applying and discussing such design, and also to use that method to summarize some important features of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein sequence. A tool for assessing sidechain exposure in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is described. It extends to assessing accessibility of sidechains by considering several different three-dimensional structure determinations of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. The method is designed to be insensitive to a distance limit for counting neighboring atoms and the results are in good agreement with the physical chemical properties and exposure trends of the 20 naturally occurring sidechains. The spike protein sequence is analyzed with comment regarding exposable character. It includes studies of complexes with antibody elements and ACE2. These indicate changes in exposure at sites remote to those at which the antibody binds. They are of interest concerning design of synthetic peptide vaccines, and for peptidomimetics as a basis of drug discovery. The method was also developed in order to provide linear (one-dimensional) information that can be used along with other bioinformatics data of this kind in data mining and machine learning, potentially as genomic data regarding protein polymorphisms to be combined with more traditional clinical data.","Robson, B",Comput Biol Med,,510

The article's main goal is to identify areas of human resources management for which agricultural companies in the Czech Republic use information systems to increase the efficiency of processes and evaluate the development of their usage with regard to the support of digitisation. The data, which were subjected to factor analysis, were obtained via a questionnaire survey from selected 70 agricultural companies in the Czech Republic and via qualitative research (focus group, n = 7). The largest share of monitored agricultural holdings is using IT systems in the area of personal data, while the smallest share of monitored agricultural holdings is using software for monitoring education and knowledge transfer. Factor analysis identified 4 factors that characterise agricultural companies according to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in human resource management. The results show that in terms of the current shift of the entire agriculture towards digitisation, the use of ICT in staff management of companies cannot be neglected. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the use of ICT.

225284,Second wave of COVID-19: Emergency situation in India,2021,"Recognition of foreign or misplaced nucleic acids is one of the principal modes by which the immune system detects pathogenic entities. When cytosolic DNA is sensed, a signal is relayed via the cGAS-STING pathway: this involves the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS) and generation of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, followed by the induction of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway responds to viral, bacterial, and self-DNA. Whereas it generally mediates immune surveillance and is often neuroprotective, excessive engagement of the system can be deleterious. This is relevant in aging and age-related neurological diseases, where neuroinflammation contributes to disease progression. This review focuses on cGAS-STING signaling in aging, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation, and on therapeutic implications.","Paul, Bindu D; Snyder, Solomon H; Bohr, Vilhelm A",Trends neurosci,,510
225285,Second wave of COVID-19: Emergency situation in India,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent declaration of pandemic was an unprecedented event, which created different complex situations for treatment of cancer patients. A critical assessment of the response to this calamity and its impact on healthcare workers (HCWs) and patient care in a dedicated cancer hospital is analyzed. SITE OF STUDY: Indrayani Cancer Hospital, Alandi, Pune, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to the pandemic, standard operating protocols were decided on for each department. Analysis of the impact on healthcare was done by comparing the number of patients taking treatment in the lockdown period in India with the previous year's data in the same corresponding period in all three departments. The impact of COVID infection on the HCW and its repercussions were analyzed. RESULTS: There was a marked decrease in the total number of patients during the lockdown period. The most affected department was surgical oncology. None of our patients contracted COVID-19, but one HCW was found to be positive. CONCLUSION: Strict adherence to protocols along with the support of the government authorities can prevent the spread of this virus thus providing optimal patient outcomes. The treatment of patients with cancer should not be delayed, even in times of a pandemic.","Deshmukh, Sanjay; Naik, Shailesh; Zade, Bhooshan; Patwa, Raunak; Gawande, Jayant; Watgaonkar, Ravi; Wagh, Sachin; Deshmukh, Sonali; Gautam, Pratik; Gandhi, Vidhyachandra; Ankolikar, Shrikant; Gosavi, Nitin",J. surg. oncol,,510
225649,Covid-19 Outcomes among Racial and Ethnic Minority Individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in the United States,2021,"The activation of NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and/or its components is associated with the physio-pathogenesis of many respiratory diseases including asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), SARS Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), and in several autoimmune diseases. Hibiscus noldeae Baker f. has been widely reported to be traditionally used in the treatment of different ailments, some of which are of inflammatory background such as asthma, wounds, headache, etc. However, the claims have not been supported by evidence at the molecular and functional levels. Here, we report on the bio-guided fractionation of H. noldeae and assessment of the inhibitory properties of some fractions and purified compounds on NLRP3 inflammasome and Interleukin 6 (IL-6). The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was determined by detecting the activity of caspase-1 and the production of Interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß) in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP-stimulated Tamm-Horsfall Protein 1 (THP-1) macrophages, while the production of IL-6 was studied in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. It was observed that hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the crude extract of the aerial parts of H. noldeae, as well as caffeic acid, isoquercetin, and ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions revealed significant inhibitory effects on Caspase-1 activities, and on IL-1ß and IL-6 production. The ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions downregulated the production of IL-1ß and IL-6, in a similar range as the caspase-1 inhibitor AC-YVAD-CHO and the drug Dexamethasone, both used as controls, respectively. Overall, our work does provide the very first scientific based evidence for Hibiscus noldeae anti-inflammatory effects and widespread use by traditional healers in Rwanda for a variety of ailments.","Tomani, Jean Claude Didelot; Kagisha, Vedaste; Tchinda, Alembert Tiabou; Jansen, Olivia; Ledoux, Allison; Vanhamme, Luc; Frederich, Michel; Muganga, Raymond; Souopgui, Jacob",Molecules (Basel),,510

226816,Impact of the covid 19 pandemy on the emergency endoscopic activity,2021,"Background: The detection and quantification of nucleic acids traditionally relies on PCR, which requires the use of expensive thermocyclers with integrated fluorescence detection of amplicons While isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies eliminate the need for thermocycling, fluorescence-based detection of products is still required for real-time, quantitative readout Several commercially available isothermal heaters with integrated fluorescence detection exist, but the cost of these devices remains a significant barrier to the use of isothermal nucleic acid amplification in low-resource settings A low-cost device for nucleic acid amplification detection could be used to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the current pandemic as well as other disease targets in the future Increasing COVID-19 testing capacity is particularly relevant when variations of the virus that appear to be more infectious are spreading rapidly and efforts to scale up delivery of COVID-19 vaccines are in the early stages Here, we describe a modular, low-cost fluorimeter for use in resource-limited settings that lack access to and infrastructure for traditional testing platforms Methods: We present a fluorimeter that is constructed from off-the-shelf components enclosed in a compact 3D printed housing that removes the need for specialised optical alignment The fluorimeter is designed to be placed atop a commercially available heat block holding a PCR-tube and was optimised to detect fluorescein (FITC) dye The modular design allows it to be easily adapted for use with other dyes commonly used as reporters in nucleic acid amplification reactions Findings: Clinical applicability of the system was demonstrated using the system to measure amplification with two different isothermal amplification technologies with significantly different temperature, volume, and fluorescence requirements: recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) RPA detection was demonstrated with a positive control DNA provided in a commercial kit while RT-LAMP detection of clinically meaningful levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was demonstrated in a custom RT-LAMP assay In a preliminary analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples from 74 individuals, the custom RT-LAMP assay showed a positive agreement of 92·3% and a negative agreement of 91·4% with the SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Interpretation: This open-source system was designed to improve accessibility to nucleic acid testing with isothermal amplification methods The system can be easily produced using only a low-end 3D printer Moreover, the use of single-board computers obviates the need to produce printed circuit boards At a time when global supply chains are at their most fragile, open-source diagnostic equipment has the potential to reduce pandemic-related health inequities Funding: International AIDS vaccine Initiative IAVI and USAID: award AID-OAA-A16-00032","Coole, J.; Kortum, A.; Tang, Y.; Vohra, I.; Natoli, M.; Kundrod, K.; Richards-Kortum, R.",The Lancet Global Health,,510

Studies showed the decreasing of peripheral blood lymphocytes in a majority of patients. In this study, we have reported the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, the frequency of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations, and their apoptosis pattern in Iranian coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) patients. Demographic and clinical data of 61 hospitalized confirmed cases with COVID-19 at Imam Khomeini Hospital were collected and analyzed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from all samples and the apoptosis pattern was evaluated using Annexin V/propidium iodide method. The frequency of lymphocyte subsets, including T-CD4+ , T-CD8+ , NK, B cells, and monocytes, was measured in all patients and 31 controls by flow cytometry. Our findings demonstrated that the percentage of lymphocytes, CD4+ , and CD8+ T cells were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared with the control group. Regarding the clinical severity, the number of lymphocytes, CD4+ , CD8+ T cells, and NK cells were also decreased in severe cases when compared with mild cases. Finally, our data have also indicated the increase in apoptosis of mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients which was more remarkable in severe clinical cases. The frequency of immune cells is a useful indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. These results could help to explain the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and introducing novel biomarkers, therapeutic strategies, and vaccine candidates.","Taghiloo, Saeid; Aliyali, Masoud; Abedi, Siavash; Mehravaran, Hossein; Sharifpour, Ali; Zaboli, Ehsan; Eslami-Jouybari, Mohammad; Ghasemian, Roya; Vahedi-Larijani, Laleh; Hossein-Nattaj, Hadi; Amjadi, Omolbanin; Rezazadeh, Hadiseh; Ajami, Abolghasem; Asgarian-Omran, Hossein",J Med Virol,,510

Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochran Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for the relevant records up to April 2021. Moreover, we scanned medRxiv, Google Scholar, and clinical registry databases to identify additional records. We have used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the quality of studies. This Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software (version 5.3). Results: Fourteen studies were included. No significant difference was observed between lopinavir/ritonavir and non-antiviral treatment groups in terms of negative rate of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on day 7 (risk ratio [RR]: 0.83;95% CI: 0.63 to 1.09;P=0.17), and day 14 (RR: 0.93;95% CI: 0.81 to 1.05;P=0.25), PCR negative conversion time (mean difference [MD]: 1.09;95% CI:-0.10 to 2.29;P=0.07), secondary outcomes, and adverse events (P&gt;0.05). There was no significant difference between lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine as well as lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine regarding the efficacy outcomes (P&gt;0.05). However, lopinavir/ritonavir showed significantly lower efficacy than arbidol for primary outcomes (P&lt;0.05). Lopinavir/ritonavir plus arbidol was effective compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone in terms of the negative rate of PCR on day 7 (P=0.02). However, this difference was not significant regarding other efficacy outcomes (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Lopinavir/ritonavir has no more treatment effects than other therapeutic agents in COVID-19 patients.","Amani, B.; Khanijhani, A.; Hashemi, P.",Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences,,510

Some research reports have shown that traditional Chinese medicine has a significant effect on COVID-19 infection, and the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine is used in some special people, such as children. At present, there is a lack of high-quality systematic reviews on the safety and efficacy of using Chinese medicine to treat children with novel coronavirus pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We will search Cochran library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), China Biomedical Database (CBM), VIP Database (VIP), and Wanfang database for research. This study includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, and uses the Cochrane systematic review to review the safety and efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in preventing and treating children with novel coronavirus pneumonia. RCT research tools and quantitative research quality assessment tools for non-randomized studies will be used to assess the risk of bias in studies included in the systematic review. We will use Revman 5.3 software for meta-analysis, the main result is odds ratio, and then a subgroup analysis will be performed based on the age, intervention degree, and disease severity of the patients reviewed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review protocol is designed to provide evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of children with COVID-19, such evidence may be useful and important for clinical treatment decisions. The results should be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Since the data and results used in the systematic review will be extracted exclusively from published studies, approval from an ethics committee will not be required.

A cohort of 10 ADA SCID patients, aged 3 months to 15 years, underwent GT in a Phase II clinical trial between 2009 and 2012. Autologous bone marrow CD34+ cells were transduced ex vivo with the MND-ADA gamma-retroviral vector (gRV) and infused following busulfan reduced intensity conditioning. These patients were monitored in a long-term follow-up protocol over 8-11 years. Nine of ten patients have sufficient immune reconstitution to protect against serious infections, and have not needed to resume ERT or proceed to secondary allogeneic HSCT. ERT was restarted 6 months after GT in the oldest patient who had no evidence of benefit from GT. Four of nine evaluable patients with the highest gene marking and B cell numbers remain off immunoglobulin replacement therapy and responded to vaccines. There were broad ranges of responses in normalization of ADA enzyme activity and adenine metabolites in blood cells, and levels of cellular and humoral immune reconstitution. Outcomes were generally better in younger patients and those receiving higher doses of gene-marked CD34+ cells. No patient experienced a leukoproliferative event after GT, despite persisting prominent clones with vector integrations adjacent to proto-oncogenes. These long-term findings demonstrate enduring efficacy of GT for ADA SCID, but risks of genotoxicity with gRVs.

This acute pandemic has spread from the East and has been overlaid onto a slow pandemic of metabolic diseases of obesity and diabetes consequent from the increasing adoption of a Western-lifestyle characterized by excess calorie consumption with limited physical activity. It has become clear that these conditions predispose individuals to a more severe COVID-19 with increased morbidity and mortality. There are many features of diabetes and obesity that may accentuate the clinical response to SARS-CoV-2 infection: including an impaired immune response, an atherothrombotic state, accumulation of advanced glycation end products and a chronic inflammatory state. These could prime an exaggerated cytokine response to viral infection, predisposing to the cytokine storm that triggers progression to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure. Infection leads to an inflammatory response and tissue damage resulting in increased metabolic activity and an associated increase in the mechanisms by which cells ingest and degrade tissue debris and foreign materials. It is becoming clear that viruses have acquired an ability to exploit these mechanisms to invade cells and facilitate their own life-cycle. In obesity and diabetes these mechanisms are chronically activated due to the deteriorating metabolic state and this may provide an increased opportunity for a more profound and sustained viral infection.","Holly, Jeff M P; Biernacka, Kalina; Maskell, Nick; Perks, Claire M",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,510

This study constitutes the first report of a low-melting temperature, polymer- extrusion process for the smart delivery of thermally-sensitive antimicrobial bioactives, including generally-regarded-as-safe (GRAS) bioactives derived from various sources. Bioactives were assessed before and after extrusion by determining their respective minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). WHO-priority AMR-bacterial isolates causing zoonotic infections were evaluated along with use of standard ATCC strains. Findings revealed that this copolymer method was capable of delivering thermally-sensitive bioactives with varying degrees of growth inhibition against the AMR-bacterial strains. The extrusion process was found to increase the effect of nisin against MRSA (4-fold increase) and L. monocytogenes (6.4-fold increase), silver nitrate (AgNO3) against E. coli (3.6-fold increase) and S. epidermidis (1.25-fold increase), and chitosan against S. aureus (1.25-fold). Findings show the potential applicability of this polymer extrusion process for developing future bioactive-loaded polymer compounds; thus, highlighting the potential of converging bio-based industry with novel materials for enabling 'One-Health' solutions.","Masterson, Kevin; Meade, Elaine; Garvey, Mary; Lynch, Mark; Major, Ian; Rowan, Neil J",Sci Total Environ,,510
235462,"The COVID-19 outbreak increases maternal stress during pregnancy, but not the risk for postpartum depression",2021,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-Barré syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-Barré syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-Barré syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.","Shahrizaila, Nortina; Lehmann, Helmar C; Kuwabara, Satoshi",Lancet,,510

We investigated the cause of this ARI outbreak. METHODS: In partnership with the local center for disease control, we collected a total of twelve pharyngeal swab specimens as well as demographic information for the affected patients. We used multiplex real-time PCR to screen for sixteen common respiratory viruses in these samples. To isolate HAdV, we inoculated Hep-2 cells with the human adenovirus (HAdV)-positive samples and then carried out sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the hexon, fiber, and penton genes of the isolated adenoviruses. In addition, we analyzed the entire genome of one strain isolated from the index case to identify single-nucleotide substitutions. RESULTS: We identified ten HAdV-positive students using multiplex real-time PCR. None of the students were co-infected with other viruses. We successfully isolated seven HAdV strains from the pharyngeal swab specimens. The coding sequences of the hexon, fiber, and penton genes of these seven HAdV strains were identical, suggesting that they represented seven strains from a single virus clone. One HAdV isolate obtained from the index case, BJDX-01-2015, was selected for whole genome analysis. From this isolate, we obtained a 34,774-nucleotide sequence. The genome of BJDX-01-2015 clustered with HAdV-B55 in phylogenetic analyses and had 99.97% identity with human adenovirus 55 isolate HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55 (GenBank accession no. JX491639). CONCLUSIONS: We identified HAdV-B55 as the strain associated with the August 2015 ARI outbreak at a training base in Beijing. This was the first reported outbreak in Beijing due to HAdV-B55. Continuous surveillance of respiratory adenoviruses is urgently needed to understand the epidemiological and evolutionary features of HAdV-B55, and an epidemiological modeling approach may provide further insights into this emerging public health threat. Furthermore, the clinical laboratory data from this outbreak provides important reference for the clinical diagnosis and may ultimately aid in informing the development of strategies to control and prevent respiratory tract infections caused by HAdV-B55.","Lu, Guilan; Peng, Xiaomin; Li, Renqing; Liu, Yimeng; Wu, Zhanguo; Wang, Xifeng; Zhang, Daitao; Zhao, Jiachen; Sun, Ying; Zhang, Li; Yang, Peng; Wang, Quanyi",BMC Infect Dis,,510

The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the literature on the salivary glands and saliva in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A brief discussion of taste disturbances and oral findings in COVID-19 patients is also presented. The literature shows that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the salivary glands. It is not possible, however, to make speculations regarding them as reservoirs for the SARS-CoV-2. In addition, patients with COVID-19 presented several oral repercussions, including hyposalivation and taste disturbances. A few reports showed oral ulcers and blisters associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it remains not fully understood and might lead to erroneous assumptions.

The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5-6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences. FINDINGS: In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57·0 (IQR 47·0-65·0) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186·0 (175·0-199·0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5-6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5-6, and median CT scores were 3·0 (IQR 2·0-5·0) for severity scale 3, 4·0 (3·0-5·0) for scale 4, and 5·0 (4·0-6·0) for scale 5-6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1·61 (95% CI 0·80-3·25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4·60 (1·85-11·48) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0·88 (0·66-1·17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1·77 (1·05-2·97) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0·74 (0·58-0·96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2·69 (1·46-4·96) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96·2% vs 58·5%) and median titres (19·0 vs 10·0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 at follow-up. INTERPRETATION: At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

Methods: We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients. Findings: Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. COVID-19 patients were sub-classified into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. Medical records were reviewed and patients were risk stratified based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 27·8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, increased red blood cell distribution width, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin. Interpretation: There are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza. Risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using laboratory data could be useful to predict clinical outcomes and pathophysiology of these patients.

239183,No Time for Complacency: Near-Term Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Author Gender in Radiology,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care services and overall (direct and indirect) excess deaths in people with cancer. METHODS: We employed near real-time weekly data on cancer care to determine the adverse effect of the pandemic on cancer services. We also used these data, together with national death registrations until June 2020 to model deaths, in excess of background (pre-COVID-19) mortality, in people with cancer. Background mortality risks for 24 cancers with and without COVID-19-relevant comorbidities were obtained from population-based primary care cohort (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) on 3 862 012 adults in England. RESULTS: Declines in urgent referrals (median=-70.4%) and chemotherapy attendances (median=-41.5%) to a nadir (lowest point) in the pandemic were observed. By 31 May, these declines have only partially recovered; urgent referrals (median=-44.5%) and chemotherapy attendances (median=-31.2%). There were short-term excess death registrations for cancer (without COVID-19), with peak relative risk (RR) of 1.17 at week ending on 3 April. The peak RR for all-cause deaths was 2.1 from week ending on 17 April. Based on these findings and recent literature, we modelled 40% and 80% of cancer patients being affected by the pandemic in the long-term. At 40% affected, we estimated 1-year total (direct and indirect) excess deaths in people with cancer as between 7165 and 17 910, using RRs of 1.2 and 1.5, respectively, where 78% of excess deaths occured in patients with &#8805;1 comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Dramatic reductions were detected in the demand for, and supply of, cancer services which have not fully recovered with lockdown easing. These may contribute, over a 1-year time horizon, to substantial excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity. It is urgent to understand how the recovery of general practitioner, oncology and other hospital services might best mitigate these long-term excess mortality risks.","Lai, Alvina G; Pasea, Laura; Banerjee, Amitava; Hall, Geoff; Denaxas, Spiros; Chang, Wai Hoong; Katsoulis, Michail; Williams, Bryan; Pillay, Deenan; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Linch, David; Hughes, Derralynn; Forster, Martin D; Turnbull, Clare; Fitzpatrick, Natalie K; Boyd, Kathryn; Foster, Graham R; Enver, Tariq; Nafilyan, Vahe; Humberstone, Ben; Neal, Richard D; Cooper, Matt; Jones, Monica; Pritchard-Jones, Kathy; Sullivan, Richard; Davie, Charlie; Lawler, Mark; Hemingway, Harry",BMJ Open,,510

This study aimed to identify major challenges associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine clinical trials among healthcare workers and staff in Uganda. Methods-a rapid exploratory survey was conducted over 5 weeks among 260 respondents (66% male) from healthcare centers across the country using an online questionnaire. Twenty-seven questions assessed knowledge, confidence, and trust scores on COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials from participants in 46 districts in Uganda. Results-we found low levels of knowledge (i.e., confusing COVID-19 with Ebola) with males being more informed than females (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.7-3.0), and mistrust associated with policy decisions to promote herbal treatments in Uganda and the rushed international clinical trials, highlighting challenges for the upcoming Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinations. Knowledge, confidence and trust scores were higher among the least educated (certificate vs. bachelor degree holders). We also found a high level of skepticism and possible community resistance to DNA recombinant vaccines, such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Preference for herbal treatments (38/260; 14.6%, 95% CI: 10.7-19.3) currently being promoted by the Ugandan government raises major policy concerns. High fear and mistrust for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials was more common among wealthier participants and more affluent regions of the country. Conclusion-our study found that knowledge, confidence, and trust in COVID-19 vaccines was low among healthcare workers in Uganda, especially those with higher wealth and educational status. There is a need to increase transparency and inclusive participation to address these issues before new trials of COVID-19 vaccines are initiated.","Kasozi, Keneth Iceland; Laudisoit, Anne; Osuwat, Lawrence Obado; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber; Al Omairi, Naif E; Aigbogun, Eric; Ninsiima, Herbert Izo; Usman, Ibe Michael; DeTora, Lisa M; MacLeod, Ewan Thomas; Nalugo, Halima; Crawley, Francis P; Bierer, Barbara E; Mwandah, Daniel Chans; Kato, Charles Drago; Kiyimba, Kenedy; Ayikobua, Emmanuel Tiyo; Lillian, Linda; Matama, Kevin; Nelly Mak, Shui Ching; Onanyang, David; Pius, Theophilus; Nalumenya, David Paul; Ssebuufu, Robinson; Rugambwa, Nina Olivia; Musoke, Grace Henry; Bardosh, Kevin; Ochieng, Juma John; Ssempijja, Fred; Kyamanywa, Patrick; Tumwine, Gabriel; Alzahrani, Khalid J; Welburn, Susan Christina",,,510

This airborne virus has affected the daily lives, social interactions and education of highly populated cities. Universities have faced many challenges in this pandemic to reduce likelihood of infection in the highly dense student population;by transitioning from traditional teaching to e-learning. The University of Sulaimani, based in Kurdistan Region of Iraq suspended the majority of classes on campus to reduce rates of infection. The adaptation of using e-learning system was novel for the University of Sulaimani, due to socio-economic factors, and lack of experience. This study employed a quantitative approach, by using a self-report questionnaire for collecting primary data. The data has been collected via an online survey in the University of Sulaimani to analyse the e-learning experience, from students and teaching staff perspective during COVID-19 pandemic. The results revealed a variety of factors impacting on the e-learning experience. This included a lack of facilities ICT infrastructures, e-resources and access to the internet. Thus, the ICT infrastructure needs to be updated with e-resources and appropriate IT facilities, with support for students who do not have access to electronic equipment. In this way e-learning would be successfully deployed in higher education during any crises, such as COVID-19 pandemic.

242201,Management of Asthma in Children during COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Saliva has been proposed as an alternative to upper airway swabs when testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although some studies have suggested higher viral loads and clinical sensitivity when testing saliva, studies have been relatively small and have given rise to contradictory results. To better understand the relative performance characteristics of saliva and upper airway samples, I performed a rapid systematic review (registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020205035), focusing on studies that included at least 20 subjects who provided diagnostic saliva and upper airway samples on the same day, which were tested by nucleic acid amplification methods and for which a confusion matrix could be constructed for based on a composite reference standard. Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a meta-analysis using a random effects model, which suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drive-through centers or community health centers. Nevertheless, the difference is small, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference. Conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity of disease prevalence in the study populations and variation in the approaches to saliva sample collection.","O039,; Leary, Timothy J",J. mol. diagn,,510

The case fatality rate is higher in cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Other comorbidities do not seem to confer the same risk, therefore the understanding of the relationship between infection and cardiovascular system could be a crucial point for the fight against the virus. A great interest is directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE 2) which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure. All cardiovascular conditions share an imbalance of the renin angiotensin system in which ACE 2 plays a central role. In the early pandemic period, much confusion has appeared about the management of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers especially in infected patients and in those at risk of critical illness in case of infection. In this article we will try to reorder the major opinions currently emerging on this topic.","Infusino, Fabio; Cimino, Sara; Lombardi, Marco; Mancone, Massimo; Cavarretta, Elena; Frati, Giacomo; Pugliese, Francesco; Fedele, Francesco; Biondi Zoccai, Giuseppe",Minerva Cardioangiol,,510

Prominent computational and mathematical models have been unreliable due to the complexity of the spread of infections. Moreover, lack of data collection and reporting makes any such modelling attempts unreliable.

We select states with COVID-19 hotpots in terms of the rate of infections and compare with states where infections have been contained or reached their peak and provide two months ahead forecast that shows that cases will slowly decline. Our results show that long-term forecasts are promising which motivates the application of the method in other countries or areas. We note that although we made some progress in forecasting, the challenges in modelling remain due to data and difficulty in capturing factors such as population density, travel logistics, and social aspects such culture and lifestyle.","Chandra, Rohitash; Jain, Ayush; Chauhan, Divyanshu Singh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11881v1.pdf,510

We do not find any evidence of a sizable COVID-19 harvesting effect, neither in the summer months after the slowdown of the first wave nor at the beginning of the second wave. According to our estimates, only a minor share of the total excess deaths detected in Northern Italian municipalities over the entire period under scrutiny (February - November 2020) can be attributed to an anticipatory role of COVID-19. A slightly higher share is detected for the most severely affected areas (the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia, in particular), but even in these territories, the harvesting effect can only account for less than 20% of excess deaths. Furthermore, the lower mortality rates observed in these areas at the beginning of the second wave may be due to several factors other than a harvesting effect, including behavioral change and some degree of temporary herd immunity. The very limited presence of short-run mortality displacement restates the case for containment policies aimed at minimizing the health impacts of the pandemic.","Cerqua, Augusto; Stefano, Roberta Di; Letta, Marco; Miccoli, Sara",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01812v3.pdf,510

With increase in number of cases and mortality from Covid, the primary focus is shifted to the management of the Covid crisis and other health emergencies thus affecting normal health services and routine treatment of other diseases like cancer. METHODS: This article reviews the published literature and guidelines on Covid and cancer and discusses them to optimize the care of cancer patients during Covid pandemic to improve treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The results of the review of published literature show a twofold increase in probability of getting CoV2 infection by the cancer patients and a four-fold increase in chance of death. On the other hand, if left untreated a 20% increase in cancer death is expected. Data further show that none of the medicines like remdesivir, hydroxy chloroquin, dexamethasone, or azithromycin improves survival and response to Covid in cancer patients. Surgical results too show similar outcome before and after the pandemic though most of these report on highly selected patients populations. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid 2019 pandemic places cancer patients in a very difficult situation wherein if they seek treatment, they are exposing themselves to a risk of developing CoV2 infection and if they do not, the probability of dying without treatment increases. Hence, for them it is a choice between the devil and deep sea, and it is for the healthcare providers to triage patients and treat who cannot wait even though the data from the carefully selected cohort of patients show no increase in mortality or morbidity from treatment during Covid.","Chakraborty, Mainak; Pandey, Manoj",World J Surg Oncol,,510

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to encourage home-based dialysis options have increased due to risks of infective transmission for patients receiving hemodialysis in center-based units. There are various practical and clinical advantages for patients receiving hemodialysis at home. However, the lack of caregiver support, cognitive and physical impairment, challenges of vascular access, and preparation and training for home hemodialysis (HHD) initiation may present as barriers to successful implementation of HHD in the older dialysis population. Assessment of an older patient's frailty status may help clinicians guide patients when making decisions about HHD. The development of an assisted HHD care delivery model and advancement of telehealth and technology in provision of HHD care may increase accessibility of HHD services for older patients. This review examines these factors and explores current unmet needs and barriers to increasing access, inclusion, and opportunities of HHD for the older dialysis population.","Wu, Henry H L; Nixon, Andrew C; Dhaygude, Ajay P; Jayanti, Anu; Mitra, Sandip",Hemodial. int,,510

Although the first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019, the primary source and intermediate host have not been confirmed, but human-to-human transmission has been universally accepted. The main mode of transmission of the virus is through respiratory droplets along with prominent respiratory system involvement. However, fecal-oral transmission due to the shedding of the virus in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may continue for up to 10 weeks after respiratory clearance and is fast becoming important. SARS-CoV-2 shows a high affinity to ACE2 receptors, making sites of high ACE2 receptor expression, such as lungs, GI tract, brain, kidneys, heart, liver and immune system, a prime target for infection. Through this literature review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge of immunological pathways that contribute to the disease with a focus specifically on the GI tract involvement. We direct attention to the pathophysiological mechanism of involvement of the GI tract leading to symptomatic manifestations, track GI organ-specific viral loads to compare and contrast with other organ systems. We briefly detail specific treatment strategies from a GI disease standpoint and mention special considerations when there is involvement of the GI tract.","Dahiya, Dushyant Singh; Kichloo, Asim; Albosta, Michael; Pagad, Sukrut; Wani, Farah",J. invest. med,,510

On the other hand, the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and its targeting of the human lung has caused many deaths worldwide. The main aim of this study was to provide a biologically and mechanically suitable 3D printed scaffold using chitosan/polycaprolactone bioink for lung tissue engineering. Design-Expert software was employed for studying various compositions for 3D printing. The selected scaffolds underwent physiochemical, biological and mechanical studies to evaluate if they are capable of MRC-5 cell line growth, proliferation, and migration. Based on the results, the average diameter of the chitosan/polycaprolactone strands was measured at 360 μm. Chitosan concentration controlled the printability, while changes in polycaprolactone content did not affect printability. The scaffolds showed excellent potential in swelling, degradation, and mechanical behavior, although they can be modified by adjusting the polycaprolactone content. The scaffolds also revealed notable cell adhesion, nontoxicity, low apoptosis, high proliferation, and cell biocompatibilityin vitro. To sum up, scaffold 3 (chitosan/polycaprolactone ratio: 4 : 1) revealed better activity for MRC-5 cell culture. Thereby, this scaffold can be a good candidate for lung tissue engineering and may be applicable for more studies on the COVID-19 virus. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.","Rezaei, F.

247794,Social workers helping each other during the COVID-19 pandemic: Online mutual support groups,2021,"We have studied the non-covalent interaction between PF-07321332 and SARS-CoV2 main protease at the atomic level using a computational approach based on extensive molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. PF-07321332, whose chemical structure has been recently disclosed, is a promising oral antiviral clinical candidate with well-established anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. The drug, currently in phase III clinical trials in combination with ritonavir, relies on the electrophilic attack of a nitrile warhead to the catalytic cysteine of the protease. Nonbonded interaction between the inhibitor and the residues of the binding pocket, as well as with water molecules on the protein surface, have been characterized using two different force fields and the two possible protonation states of the main protease catalytic dyad HIS41-CYS145. When the catalytic dyad is in the neutral state, the non-covalent binding is likely to be stronger. Molecular dynamics simulations seems to lend support for an inhibitory mechanism in two steps: a first non-covalent addition with the dyad in neutral form and then the formation of the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair and the ligand relocation for finalising the electrophilic attack.

247979,Qualitative Interdisciplinary Learning Reviews of Non-COVID-19 Patients' Journeys During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Surgical strategies are being adapted to face the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations on the management of acute appendicitis have been based on expert opinion, but very little evidence is available. This study addressed that dearth with a snapshot of worldwide approaches to appendicitis. METHODS: The Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe designed an online survey to assess the current attitude of surgeons globally regarding the management of patients with acute appendicitis during the pandemic. Questions were divided into baseline information, hospital organization and screening, personal protective equipment, management and surgical approach, and patient presentation before versus during the pandemic. RESULTS: Of 744 answers, 709 (from 66 countries) were complete and were included in the analysis. Most hospitals were treating both patients with and those without COVID. There was variation in screening indications and modality used, with chest X-ray plus molecular testing (PCR) being the commonest (19·8 per cent). Conservative management of complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis was used by 6·6 and 2·4 per cent respectively before, but 23·7 and 5·3 per cent, during the pandemic (both P < 0·001). One-third changed their approach from laparoscopic to open surgery owing to the popular (but evidence-lacking) advice from expert groups during the initial phase of the pandemic. No agreement on how to filter surgical smoke plume during laparoscopy was identified. There was an overall reduction in the number of patients admitted with appendicitis and one-third felt that patients who did present had more severe appendicitis than they usually observe. CONCLUSION: Conservative management of mild appendicitis has been possible during the pandemic. The fact that some surgeons switched to open appendicectomy may reflect the poor guidelines that emanated in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2.","Ielpo, B; Podda, M; Pellino, G; Pata, F; Caruso, R; Gravante, G; Di Saverio, S",Br. j. surg,,510

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and its related formulations in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv data and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials for published articles that reported the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or its compounds was done. We identified 1071 published studies and 7 studies were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of a total of 4984 patients, of which 1721 (34.5%) received hydroxychloroquine or its congeners (HCQ group) while 3091 (62.01%) received standard of care or had included antiviral medication (control group). The pooled estimate of successful treatment in the hydroxychloroquine group and the control group was 77.45% and 77.87% respectively, which indicated similar clinical outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group. The odds ratio of a favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine was 1.11 (95 CI 0.72 to 1.69) (p = 0.20). The pooled risk difference of favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine versus control group was 0.00 (95 CI -0.03 to 0.03) which was statistically not significant (p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: The present evidence shows no benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients affected by mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. However, now several trials on HCQ are ongoing and hopefully more data will be available soon. Hence, the management of COVID-19 is set to change for better in the future.","Pathak, Dr Subodh Kumar; Salunke, Dr Abhijeet Ashok; Thivari, Dr Praveen; Pandey, Apurva; Nandy, Dr Kunal; Harish V K Ratna, Dr; Pandey, Dr Sanjay; Chawla, Dr Jasneet; Mujawar, Dr Jalil; Dhanwate, Dr Anant; Menon, Dr Vivek",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,510

Obesity is one of the proven risk factors causing NCDs and can influence outcomes of COVID-19 patients. It is closely related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The increased risk of COVID-19 and reduced access to treatment of non-COVID conditions during the pandemic may increase the stress in obese patients with OSA. This situation makes it necessary for them to cope with their condition by themselves. This review aimed at the effect of this pandemic on these patients and coping strategies for them. Methods: Databases like PubMed and Scopus were searched using a combination of key words. Full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. Results: The search yielded eight studies, discussing about the potential interactions between the COVID-19, obesity and OSA, the impact of COVID-19 on them, and management of these patients. Conclusions: Increased prevalence of COVID-19 was found among obese patients with OSA. The fear of COVID-19 and shift of health care workers to manage COVID-19 patients has affected their regular visits to the hospital. However, there is lack of coping strategies for them, which should soon be established for these patients.","K, Vaishali; Gatty, Aishwarya; Srivastav, Prateek; Amin, Revati Ravi",Obes Med,,510

In spite of all rapidly and widely emerging scientific data on epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 disease, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing to propagate in lack of definitive and specific therapeutic agents. Current therapeutic strategies are mainly focused on viral inhibition by antiviral drugs and hampering the exuberant immune response of the host by immunomodulatory drugs. In this review, we have studied the reports of the largest clinical trials intended to COVID-19 treatment published during the first year of the pandemics. In general, these results concentrate on seven therapeutic options: remdesivir, chloroguine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir combination, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies. In line with the reviewed data, as of January 2021, most of the evidence support the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease and provide reliable data on the substantial beneficial effect of corticosteroids in patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Moreover, preliminary RECOVERY trial results have demonstrated the efficacy of tociluzumab in the treatment of critically ill patients.

249509,The process to cope with COVID-19 supported by the control environment,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has mandated rapid adoption of telehealth for surgical care. However, many surgical providers may be unfamiliar with telehealth. This study evaluates the perspectives of surgical providers practicing telehealth care during COVID-19 to help identify targets for surgical telehealth optimization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single tertiary care center with telehealth capabilities, all department of surgery providers (attending surgeons, residents, fellows, and advanced practice providers) were emailed a voluntary survey focused on telehealth during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U analyses were performed as appropriate on responses. Text responses were thematically coded to identify key concepts. RESULTS: The completion rate was 41.3% (145/351). Providers reported increased telehealth usage relative to the pandemic (P < 0.001). Of respondents, 80% (116/145) had no formal telehealth training. Providers estimated that new patient video visits required less time than traditional visits (P = 0.001). Satisfaction was high for several aspects of video visits. Comparatively lower satisfaction scores were reported for the ability to perform physical exams (sensitive and nonsensitive) and to break bad news. The largest barriers to effective video visits were limited physical exams (55.6%; 45/81) and lack of provider or patient internet access/equipment/connection (34.6%; 28/81). Other barriers included ineffective communication and difficulty with fostering rapport. Concerns regarding video-to-telephone visit conversion were loss of physical exam/visual cues (34.3%; 24/70), less personal interactions (18.6%; 13/70), and reduced efficiency (18.6%; 13/70). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth remains a new experience for surgical providers despite its expansion. Optimization strategies should target technology barriers and include specialized virtual exam and communication training.","Kemp, Michael T; Liesman, Daniel R; Williams, Aaron M; Brown, Craig S; Iancu, Ariella M; Wakam, Glenn K; Biesterveld, Ben E; Alam, Hasan B",J Surg Res,,510
249639,Importance of vegetables as healthier diet in the management of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The current understanding of ambient temperature and its link to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the environmental and climatic risk factors for SARS-CoV-2. For this study, we analyzed the data at the beginning of the outbreak (from 20 January to 31 March 2020) to avoid the influence of preventive or control measures. We obtained the number of cases and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2, international tourism, population age, universal health coverage, regional factors, the SARS-CoV-2 testing rate, and population density of a country. A total of 154 countries were included in this study. There were high incidence rates and mortality risks in the countries that had an average ambient temperature between 0 and 10 °C. The adjusted incidence rate for temperatures between 0 and 10 °C was 2.91 (95% CI 2.87-2.95). We randomly divided the data into a training set (80% of data) for model derivation and a test set (20% of data) for validation. Using a random forest statistical model, the model had high accuracy for predicting the high epidemic status of a country (ROC = 95.5%, 95% CI 87.9-100.0%) in the test set. Population age, temperature, and international tourism were the most important factors affecting the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in a country. An understanding the determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak can help to design better strategies for disease control.

A Position Statement From the Hellenic Pediatric Respiratory Society,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to discuss the most recent data describing the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the pediatric population with chronic pulmonary disease. We specifically focus on children with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and lung transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: Children with asthma, CF, and lung transplant recipients do not appear to have an increased risk of morbidity or mortality with COVID-19 infection compared to the general pediatric population. Data does not support the change or withdrawal of any asthma or CF maintenance medications; however, does advocate for the cessation of aerosolized medications whenever possible to minimize transmission risk. It may not be necessary to adjust immunosuppressive therapy when managing COVID-19 in pediatric lung transplant patients. Mechanisms of infection in airway epithelial cells in children may differ from adults, resulting in a milder phenotype. SUMMARY: Current data about pediatric patients with chronic lung disease infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is promising but remains scarce. Additional study is needed to definitively understand the complex interplay of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the airway of children with chronic lung disease, how it differs from adults, and how best to manage the symptoms of acute infection.","Palla, John; Laguna, Theresa A",Curr Opin Pediatr,,510

However, the magnitude of this association still needs to be defined. Furthermore, clinical predictors of thrombogenesis, and the relationship with the inflammatory status are currently unknown. On this basis, we conducted a retrospective, observational study on 259 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to an academic tertiary referral hospital in Northern Italy between March 19th and April 6th, 2020. Records of COVID-19 patients with a definite VTE event were reviewed for demographic information, co-morbidities, risk factors for VTE, laboratory tests, and anticoagulation treatment. Twenty-five cases among 259 COVID-19 patients developed VTE (9.6%), all of them having a Padua score > 4, although being under standard anticoagulation prophylaxis since hospital admission. In the VTE subcohort, we found a significant positive correlation between platelet count (PLT) and either C reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.0001) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0013), while a significant inverse correlation was observed between PLT and mean platelet volume (p < 0.0001). Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio significantly correlated with CRP (p < 0.0001). The majority of VTE patients was male and younger compared to non-VTE patients (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005, respectively). No significant difference was found in D-dimer levels between VTE and non VTE patients, while significantly higher levels of LDH (p = 0.04) and IL-6 (p = 0.04) were observed in VTE patients in comparison to non-VTE patients. In conclusion, our findings showed a quite high prevalence of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Raised inflammatory indexes and increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines should raise the clinical suspicion of VTE.","Melazzini, Federica; Colaneri, Marta; Fumoso, Federica; Freddi, Giulia; Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Pieri, Teresa Chiara; Piloni, Davide; Noris, Patrizia; Pieresca, Carla; Preti, Paola Stefania; Russo, Mariaconcetta; Corsico, Angelo; Tavazzi, Guido; Baldanti, Fausto; Triarico, Antonio; Mojoli, Francesco; Bruno, Raffaele; Di Sabatino, Antonio",Intern. emerg. med,,510

Taiwan has been successful in countering the COVID-19 outbreak, however, the potential risk for asymptomatic infections and the prevalence rates remain unknown. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Taiwan via serologically testing hospital patients with neither symptoms indicative of nor positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Residual specimens from laboratory blood tests for outpatient and emergency department patients visiting a medical centre in Taipei, Taiwan, within one week in May and another in July, 2020, were collected. We used Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Assay to screen and further validated cases with high cutoff index by a confirmatory ELISA assay. We also analysed antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 along disease progression in four nucleic acid test confirmed COVID-19 patients. Findings: Blood samples from a total of 14,765 patients were tested. The unweighted seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0â¢07% [95% CI, 0â¢04%-0â¢13%]; after weighting with the population demographics of Taiwan, the estimated overall seroprevalence was 0â¢05% [95% CI, 0â¢02%-0â¢10%]. Furthermore, based on data of the four COVID-19 cases, the seroconversion dates for IgM were as early as 9 days and that for IgG 11 days after symptoms onset. Interpretation: We screened the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a small-scale population-based study and observed an approximately 0â¢05% seroprevalence of COVID-19, indicating that the current containment protocols emphasising mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing and mandatory quarantine for all incomers are effective in Taiwan.

The intramuscular-alum-only vaccine induced robust binding and neutralizing antibody and persistent cellular immunity systemically and mucosally, whereas intranasal boosting with nanoparticles, including IL-15 and TLR agonists, elicited weaker T cell and Ab responses but higher dimeric IgA and IFN-&#945;. Nevertheless, following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, neither group showed detectable subgenomic RNA in upper or lower respiratory tracts versus naive controls, indicating full protection against viral replication. Although mucosal and systemic protective mechanisms may differ, results demonstrate both vaccines can protect against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In summary, we have demonstrated that the mucosal vaccine was safe after multiple doses and cleared the input virus more efficiently in the nasal cavity and thus may act as a potent complementary reinforcing boost for conventional systemic vaccines to provide overall better protection.","Sui, Yongjun; Li, Jianping; Zhang, Roushu; Prabhu, Sunaina Kiran; Andersen, Hanne; Venzon, David; Cook, Anthony; Brown, Renita; Teow, Elyse; Velasco, Jason; Greenhouse, Jack; Putman-Taylor, Tammy; Campbell, Tracey-Ann; Pessaint, Laurent; Moore, Ian N; Lagenaur, Laurel; Talton, Jim; Breed, Matthew W; Kramer, Josh; Bock, Kevin W; Minai, Mahnaz; Nagata, Bianca M; Lewis, Mark G; Wang, Lai-Xi; Berzofsky, Jay A",JCI insight,,510

As oral and maxillofacial departments enter the recovery phase of the COVID-19 pandemic there are many considerations to make regarding standard operating procedures. Thus, this survey was conducted to identify areas of consensus and divergence in practice during the recovery phase of the pandemic for local anaesthetic procedures in oral and maxillofacial units. Our findings show there are some areas of inconsistency of practice particularly in preoperative risk management and self-isolation as well as fallow time between patients for aerosol generated procedures and non-aerosol generated procedures.","Graham, C; Mizen, K D",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,,510
253324,Sports medicine in COVID Era,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-COV-2 pandemic is a worldwide public health problem due to the large medical burden and limited number of therapies available. Corticosteroids have a rather unclear efficacy in viral non-SARS-COV-2 pneumonias and therefore their use is not universally recommended. In SARS-COV-2 pneumonia however, it is expected that they are able to reduce the deleterious consequences of the virus-related systemic inflammation. AREAS COVERED: a MEDLINE search covering the period 1995-2020 was completed in order to identify relevant papers. SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is very complex and is represented by the interplay of many cytokine-driven inflammation pathways. Its most severe form is named cytokine storm, which is an exaggerate reaction of the host infected by the virus and can rapidly result in multiple organ dysfunction (MODS). Corticosteroids have the potential to blunt the inflammation response in such patients, but their efficacy is not the same for all patients. Further on the certainties and uncertainties regarding the efficacy of this therapy in SARS-COV-2 pneumonia are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: in patients with severe SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, corticosteroids can be efficacious, but it is still not clear if they can be safely used in patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease or how the optimal duration of therapy can be established.","Crisan Dabija, Radu; Antohe, Ileana; Trofor, Antigona; Antoniu, Sabina A",Expert rev. ant. infect. ther,,510

Alcohol-based hand rubs have been recommended for maintaining hand hygiene when the hands are visibly not dirty, but they have no role in the prevention and treatment of the disease on consumption. It is important to note that in order to reduce the risk of transmission of the infection, many nations have imposed a complete lockdown, and such compulsory restrictions have even affected the sale of alcohol in various consumable forms. From the public health perspective, it should be considered as a window of opportunity to motivate people who are planning to quit drinking or at least significantly reduce the consumption of alcohol. In conclusion, the intake of alcohol does not have any role in the prevention or treatment of the COVID-19 infection. On the contrary, it will be ideal to consider the settings of lockdown as an event which should be utilized for quitting alcohol forever without being exposed to stigma.","Shrivastava, S.

Despite being positioned throughout all levels of government, and in the private sector, EMs and ESSDs fulfill roles which occur largely behind the scenes. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the roles of EMs and ESSDs from different regions across Canada. Specifically, we wanted to understand their perceptions of barriers, vulnerabilities and capabilities within the context of their roles. EMs (n=15) and ESSDs (n=6) from six Canadian provinces participated in semi-structured telephone interviews. Through content analysis, five themes and one model were generated from the data: 1) Emergency management is not synonymous with first response, 2) Unrealistic expectations for a ""side-of-desk"" role, 3) Minding the gap between academia and practice with a 'whole-society' approach, 4) Personal preparedness tends to be weak, 5) Behind the scenes roles can have mental health implications. We present a model, based on these themes, which makes explicit the occupational risks that EMs and ESSDs may encounter in carrying out the skills, tasks, and roles of their jobs. Identification of occupational risks is a first step towards reducing vulnerabilities and supporting capability. This is particularly relevant in our current society as increased demands placed on these professionals coincides with the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters due to climate change and the emergence of the world wide COVID-19 pandemic.","Oostlander, Samantha A; Bournival, Vanessa; O039,; Sullivan, Tracey L",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,,510

No optical counterparts associated with a gravitational wave event was found. However, thanks to its network of telescopes, the average area visible to at least one ASAS-SN site during the first 10 hours after the trigger contained $\sim$30\% of the integrated source location probability. Through a combination of normal operations and target-of-opportunity observations, ASAS-SN observations of the highest probability fields began within one hour of the trigger for four of the events. After 24 hours, ASAS-SN observed $>$60\% of total probability for three events and $>$40\% for all but one of the events. This is the largest area coverage to a depth of $g = 18.5$ mag from any survey with published coverage statistics for seven of the nine events.

254460,Infographic. Football-specific strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in Wuhan China has generated substantial morbidity and mortality impact around the world during the last four months. The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government. While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.","Munayco, César V; Tariq, Amna; Rothenberg, Richard; Soto-Cabezas, Gabriela G; Reyes, Mary F; Valle, Andree; Rojas-Mezarina, Leonardo; Cabezas, César; Loayza, Manuel; Chowell, Gerardo",Infect Dis Model,,510

Many governments enforce the use of PPE as an efficient and inexpensive way to reduce the transmission of the virus. However, this may pose a new challenge to solid waste management and exacerbate plastic pollution. The aim of the present study was to report the occurrence and distribution of COVID-19-associated PPE along the coast of the overpopulated city of Lima, Peru, and determine the influence of the activities carried out in each study site. In general terms, 138 PPE items were found in 11 beaches during 12 sampling weeks. The density was in the range of 0 to 7.44 × 10-4 PPE m-2. Microplastic release, colonization of invasive species, and entanglement or ingestion by apex predators are some of the potential threats identified. Recreational beaches were the most polluted sites, followed by surfing, and fishing sites. This may be because recreational beaches are many times overcrowded by beachgoers. Additionally, most of the PPE was found to be discarded by beachgoers rather than washed ashore. The lack of environmental awareness, education, and coastal mismanagement may pose a threat to the marine environment through marine litter and plastic pollution. Significant efforts are required to shift towards a sustainable solid waste management. Novel alternatives involve redesigning masks based on degradable plastics and recycling PPE by obtaining liquid fuels through pyrolysis.","De-la-Torre, Gabriel E; Rakib, Md Refat Jahan; Pizarro-Ortega, Carlos Ivan; Dioses-Salinas, Diana Carolina",Sci Total Environ,,510

METHODS: An intensive longitudinal design was applied in which 25 FCs underwent in-home assessments for up to 56 days. At baseline, demographic data and employment status were collected. FCs wore a wrist-worn device with an accelerometer to assess objective total sleep time (TST) for consecutive 24-hour periods. FCs answered the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) every night before sleep. Linear mixed model analysis was used to examine the effect of objective sleep status on ZBI and PANAS scores the following day. RESULTS: Mean participant age was 66.3 ± 10.8 years (72.0% female), and mean survey period was 29.1 ± 9.6 days (866 observations). Mean TST of FCs was 5.7 ± 1.4 hours. In total, 32.0% of FCs were employed either full- or part-time. TST of employed FCs was significantly associated with care burden and negative affect (B = -0.4 and -1.3, respectively); however, positive affect was not associated with TST. FCs who were unemployed experienced less care burden and negative affect (rate of change: -7.7 and -8.0, respectively). Additionally, TST of unemployed FCs was associated with negative affect; thus, when they slept 1 hour longer than their mean TST, they experienced less negative affect the following day. CONCLUSION: A reduction in TST could lead to increased care burden and more severe negative affect the following day, which may be moderated by employment status.","Ryuno, Hirochika; Yamaguchi, Yuko; Greiner, Chieko",J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol,,510
256398,Stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic;a global challenge,2020,"High-purity and size-controlled Rh nanocubes (RhNCs) with plasmonic responses in the ultraviolet spectrum range were synthesized; the ultraviolet plasmonic features of RhNCs have potential applications in wide bandgap semiconductors and optoelectronic devices because of their optical tunability and stability, as well as the compatibility with neighboring semiconductor micro/nanostructures. In this work, by incorporating RhNCs, the near-band-edge emission of a single ZnO microwire is considerably enhanced. When optically pumped by a fs pulsed laser at room temperature, RhNCs-plasmon enhanced high-performance whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing characteristics, including lower lasing threshold, higher Q-factor, and lasing output enhancement, can be achieved from a single ZnO microwire covered by RhNCs. To further probe the modulation effect of RhNCs plasmons on the lasing characteristics of the ZnO microwires, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and electromagnetic simulation analyses were also performed. Based on our results, it can be concluded that size-controlled RhNCs with ultraviolet energy-tunable plasmons have the potential for use in optoelectronic devices requiring stable and high-performance in the short wavelength spectrum band owing to their unique ultraviolet plasmonic features.","Miao, Changzong; Xu, Haiying; Jiang, Mingming; Liu, Yang; Wan, Peng; Kan, Caixia",Opt Express,,510

The ravages of COVID-19 are leading to profound crises across the world. There is an urgent requirement for analyzing the current pandemic situation, predicting trends over time, and assessing the effectiveness of containment measures. Thus, numerous statistical models, primarily based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered or removed (SEIR) model, have been established. However, these models are highly technical, which are difficult for the public and governing bodies to understand and use. To address this issue, we developed a simple operating software based on our improved K-SEIR model termed as the kernelkernel SEIR simulator (K-SEIR-Sim). This software includes natural propagation parameters, containment measure parameters, and certain characteristic parameters that can deduce the effects of natural propagation and containment measures. Further, the applicability of the proposed software was demonstrated using the example of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States and the city of Wuhan, China. Operating results verified the potency of the proposed software in evaluating the epidemic situation and human intervention during COVID-19. Importantly, the software can perform real-time, backward-looking, and forward-looking analysis by functioning in data-driven and model-driven ways. All of them have considerable practical values in their applications according to the actual needs of personal use. Conclusively, K-SEIR-Sim is the first simple customized operating software that is highly valuable for the global fight against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","Wang, Hongzhi; Miao, Zhiying; Zhang, Chaobao; Wei, Xiaona; Li, Xiangqi",,,510

Spirulina-based nutraceuticals boost the adaptive and innate immunity, and bioactive compounds, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor peptides, phycobiliproteins, sulfated polysaccharides, and calcium-Spirulan, can serve as antiviral agents. The presence of these molecules indicates its potential role in resisting infection and COVID-19 disease progression. This review focuses on the potential role of algal nutraceuticals as immune boosters to combat the human coronavirus and other viral diseases.

This systematic review focuses on sedentary behaviour resulting from this quarantine period which may elevate the cardiovascular disease risk, obesity, hypertension, cancer and mental health illness. METHODS: Evidence of breaking sedentary behaviour and global recommendations were investigated. Potential unanswered questions regarding sedentary behaviour and physical activity during lockdown were explored. RESULTS: Five systematic reviews and six prospective trials explored the effect of sedentarism affecting chronic disease through potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Sedentary behaviour especially prolonged sitting is found to be a pleiotropic risk factor with altered energy expenditure, adipogenic signalling, immunomodulation, autonomic stability and hormonal dysregulation perpetuating underlying chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders.

Hitherto, there has been no approved drug or vaccine for this disease. Therefore, the use of general antiviral drugs is at the first line of treatment, though complicated with limited effectiveness and systemic side effects. Given the pathophysiology of the disease, researchers have proposed various strategies not only to find a more specific therapeutic way but also to reduce the side effects. One strategy to accomplish these goals is to use CRISPR/Cas13 system. Recently, a group of scientists have used the CRISPR/Cas13 system, which is highly effective to eliminate the genome of RNA viruses. Due to the RNA nature of the coronavirus genome, it seems that this system can be effective against the disease. The main challenge regarding the application of this system is to deliver it to the target cells efficiently. To solve this challenge, it seems that using virosomes with protein S on their membrane surface can be helpful. Studies have shown that protein S interacts with its specific receptor in target cells named as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we propose if CRISPR/Cas13 gene constructs reach the infected cells efficiently using a virosomal delivery system, the virus genome will be cleaved and inactivated. Considering the pathophysiology of the disease, an important step to implement this hypothesis is to embed protein S on the membrane surface of virosomes to facilitate the delivery of gene constructs to the target cells.","Goudarzi, Kazem Abaszadeh; Nematollahi, Mohammad Hadi; Khanbabaei, Hashem; Nave, Hossein Hosseini; Mirzaei, Hamid Reza; Pourghadamyari, Hossein; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Curr pharm. biotechnol,,510

We examine differences in how media institutions reported the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic in China during the pre-crisis period from 1 January 2020 to 20 January 2020 in terms of both the ""vertical"" or hierarchical positions of media institutions in the Chinese media ecosystem and the ""horizontal"" positions of media institutions' social proximity to Wuhan in terms of geographical human traffic flows.

260357,Tocilizumab for treating COVID-19: a systemic review and meta-analysis of retrospective studies,2020,"Background and study aims; There is a consensus among gastroenterology organizations that elective endoscopic procedures should be deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the decision to perform urgent procedures and to defer entirely elective procedures is mostly evident, there is a wide middle ground of time-sensitive but not technically urgent or emergent endoscopic interventions. We aimed to survey gastroenterologists worldwide using Twitter to help elucidate these definitions using commonly encountered clinical scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods; A 16-question survey was designed by the authors to include common clinical scenarios that do not have clear guidelines regarding the timing or urgency of endoscopic evaluation. This survey was posted on Twitter. The survey remained open to polling for 48 hours. During this time, multiple gastroenterologists and fellows with prominent social media presence were tagged to disseminate the survey. Results; The initial tweet had 38,795 impressions with a total of 2855 engagements. There was significant variation in responses from gastroenterologists regarding timing of endoscopy in these semi-urgent scenarios. There were only three of 16 scenarios for which more than 70% of gastroenterologists agreed on procedure-timing. For example, significant variation was noted in regard to timing of upper endoscopy in patients with melena, with 44.5% of respondents believing that everyone with melena should undergo endoscopic evaluation at this time. Similarly, about 35% of respondents thought that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should only be performed in patients with choledocholithiasis with abdominal pain or jaundice. Conclusion; Our analysis shows that there is currently lack of consensus among gastroenterologists in regards to timing of semi-urgent or non-life-threatening procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results support the need for the ongoing development of societal guidance for these semi-urgent scenarios to help gastroenterologists in making difficult triage decisions.","Bilal, Mohammad; Simons, Malorie; Rahman, Asad Ur; Smith, Zachary L.; Umar, Shifa; Cohen, Jonah; Sawhney, Mandeep S.; Berzin, Tyler M.; Pleskow, Douglas K.",Endosc.

There are significant concerns that the arrival of COVID-19 is currently overlapping with other viruses, particularly dengue, in various endo-epidemic regions across South America. In this report, we analyzed trends for both viral infections in Colombia during the first 20 epidemiological weeks (EWs) of 2020. From 1st January to 16th May 2020 (EWs, 1-20), a total of 52 679 cases of dengue and 14 943 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Colombia. As both conditions may potentially lead to fatal outcomes, especially in patients with chronic co-morbidities, overlapping infections, and co-occurrence may increase the number of patients requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. In regions, such as Valle del Cauca, intensified preparation for such scenarios should be pondered, and further studies should be performed to address this critical issue in a timely matter.","Cardona-Ospina, Jaime A; Arteaga-Livias, Kovy; Villamil-Gómez, Wilmer E; Pérez-Díaz, Carlos E; Katterine Bonilla-Aldana, D; Mondragon-Cardona, Álvaro; Solarte-Portilla, Marco; Martinez, Ernesto; Millan-Oñate, Jose; López-Medina, Eduardo; López, Pio; Navarro, Juan-Carlos; Perez-Garcia, Luis; Mogollon-Rodriguez, Euler; Rodríguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto",J. med. virol,,510

263474,Is Religious Behavior Harbinger for COVID-19 - Indian Perspective?,2020,"The Fisher market is one of the most fundamental models for resource allocation problems in economic theory, wherein agents spend a budget of currency to buy goods that maximize their utilities, while producers sell capacity constrained goods in exchange for currency. However, the consideration of only two types of constraints, i.e., budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods, makes Fisher markets less amenable for resource allocation settings when agents have additional linear constraints, e.g., knapsack and proportionality constraints. In this work, we introduce a modified Fisher market, where each agent may have additional linear constraints and show that this modification to classical Fisher markets fundamentally alters the properties of the market equilibrium as well as the optimal allocations. These properties of the modified Fisher market prompt us to introduce a budget perturbed social optimization problem (BP-SOP) and set prices based on the dual variables of BP-SOP's capacity constraints. To compute the budget perturbations, we develop a fixed point iterative scheme and validate its convergence through numerical experiments. Since this fixed point iterative scheme involves solving a centralized problem at each step, we propose a new class of distributed algorithms to compute equilibrium prices. In particular, we develop an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with strong convergence guarantees for Fisher markets with homogeneous linear constraints as well as for classical Fisher markets. In this algorithm, the prices are updated based on the tatonnement process, with a step size that is completely independent of the utilities of individual agents. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally, overcomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher markets, which only consider capacity and budget constraints.","Jalota, Devansh; Pavone, Marco; Qi, Qi; Ye, Yinyu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10412v1.pdf,510
263485,First wave of COVID-19 did not reach the homeless population in Aarhus,2020,"Vitamin D is customarily involved in maintaining bone and calcium homeostasis. However, contemporary studies have identified the implication of vitamin D in several cellular processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation, wound healing, repair and regulatory systems inclusive of host defence, immunity, and inflammation. Multiple studies have indicated corelations between low serum levels of vitamin D, perturbed pulmonary functions and enhanced incidences of inflammatory diseases. Almost all of the pulmonary diseases including acute lung injury, cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD, Pneumonia and Tuberculosis, all are inflammatory in nature. Studies have displayed strong inter-relations with vitamin D deficiency and progression of lung disorders; however, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Vitamin D has emerged to possess inhibiting effects on pulmonary inflammation while exaggerating innate immune defenses by strongly influencing functions of inflammatory cells including dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages, T cells, and B cells along with structural epithelial cells. This review dissects the effects of vitamin D on the inflammatory cells and their therapeutic relevance in pulmonary diseases. Although, the data obtained is very limited and needs further corroboration but presents an exciting area of further research. This is because of its ease of supplementation and development of personalized medicine which could lead us to an effective adjunct and cost-effective method of therapeutic modality for highly fatal pulmonary diseases.","Ahmad, Shaniya; Arora, Shweta; Khan, Salman; Mohsin, Mohd; Mohan, Anant; Manda, Kailash; Syed, Mansoor Ali",J Nutr Biochem,,510

The number of infections has continued to rise and had reached 30,000 worldwide at the time this paper was written. Because of the high risk of nosocomial transmission, medical health care workers may be experiencing substantial psychological stress. This descriptive study aimed to identify psychosocial effects on hospital staff associated with working in a hospital environment during the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our survey participants included 57 frontline clinicians working at Wuhan First Hospital and 157 medical students working at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaire we adopted included questions regarding the participants' personal well-being, sociodemographic characteristics, and psychological status. METHODS: 57 frontline clinicians working in Wuhan First Hospital and 157 medical training students working in Jiangsu Provincial Peoples Hospital during this outbreak participated in our survey. The questionnaire we adopted included questions regarding the participants' personal well-being, sociodemographic characteristics and the psychological status. RESULTS: The COVID-19 outbreak had psychological impacts both on formal workers and medical students. The psychological effects included sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. There was no significant difference between the group of formal workers and medical students (P=.85), and more than 50% (30/54, 56%, vs. 83/157, 52.9%) of the respondents reported pandemic-related mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure caused substantial psychological stress among health care workers. This finding emphasizes the need to promote psychological crisis intervention for medical personnel during this epidemic.","Ni, Jie; Wang, Fang; Liu, Yihai; Wu, Mingyue; Jiang, Yan; Zhou, Yujie; Sha, Dujuan",JMIR Ment Health,,510
265631,Urgent Considerations for the Neuro-oncologic Treatment of Patients with Gliomas During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Introduction: A decline in suspected acute stroke (W“code strokeW”) presentations in the United States (US) during the first COVID surge has been previously reported. While state emergency declarations may have contributed to the decline and rebound of weekly code stroke activations in our region, the exact temporal relationship of those declarations relative to weekly code stroke volumes is unclear. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) to identify the impact of the first reported COVID case in North Carolina (NC) and subsequent statewide executive orders (SEOs) on weekly code stroke activation trends across our regional stroke network's 20 facilities during a 33- week period (December 8, 2019 to July 25, 2020). We included the following time epochs: the first reported COVID case in NC, the NC SEO prohibiting mass gatherings and closing public schools, the stay-at-home NC SEO, and the NC phase 1 and phase 2 reentry orders, which eased restrictions. Results: Utilizing our integrated healthcare network's code stroke registry, we evaluated 3740 code stroke activations over a 33-week period. We performed two ITSA considering different starting points for the first intervention-one defined as the first COVID case and the other the first SEO. For both models the end of the first-time interval ended with the second SEO. Most of the downward trend in code stroke activation volume was temporally after the first COVID case (p=0.0029), not after the first SEO. After the second SEO, which increased social restrictions, there was a significant increased trend in code stroke activation volume (p=0.0047), while the phase 1 and 2 reopening SEOs were not associated with a significant increase in weekly code stroke activations. Conclusion: Our data indicate that in our region, the decreased trend in code stroke activations preceded the first SEO and started temporally after the first reported COVID case in NC. The overall decrease in code stroke volume was not significantly associated with increasing statewide restrictions and lessening of those restrictions was not significantly associated with a rebounding trend. Restrictive and reentry SEOs do not explain changes in weekly code stroke activation trends our region experienced during its first COVID surge.","Macko, L.; Prasad, T.; Karamchandani, R.

266335,Turkey's Battle with Covid-19: A Multifaceted Investigation,2020,"This paper reports a study on teaching and learning strategies during the COVID-19 lockdown period (CLP) that were used by the secondary government school teachers and students in Eastern India. These teaching and learning strategies were analysed in relation to their engagement with an initiative called Integrated approach to Technology in Education (ITE). ITE engagement in the pre-CLP involved using project-based learning (PBL) with technology and continuous, practise-based professional development for teachers focusing on integrating constructivist use of technology in their curriculum and pedagogy. A survey and interviews of teachers revealed that teachers with higher ITE engagement in the pre-CLP were more likely to use PBL with technology during the CLP. Students' interviews indicated that this PBL involved deep research and technical skills that were also practised during the CLP using distance technologies. Thus, the study demonstrated adaptation of ITE innovation into a distance mode; the introduction of WebQuests during the CLP improved the likelihood of teachers engaging in project-based teaching and PBL during the CLP. Policymakers, practitioners and researchers are recommended to adopt and continue to study the sustainability of ITE approach in new contexts such as the CLP.","Charania, Amina; Bakshani, Uchita; Paltiwale, Sumegh; Kaur, Ishmeet; Nasrin, Nikhat",British journal of educational technology,,510

Although glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia (GCIH) is well-known, there is no report describing the glycemic profile following a single dose of IV dexamethasone as captured on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a patient with diabetes treated with insulin. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old woman with diabetes and pancreatic adenocarcinoma was treated with chemotherapy containing dexamethasone every other week. CGM data of 23 cycles revealed a reproducible triphasic glycemic pattern consisting of a constant hyperglycemia period, followed by a transient improvement, and ending with another hyperglycemic plateau. Given this recurrent pattern, basal insulin and correction insulin were adjusted with subsequent GCIH attenuation. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of CGM glycemic profile following recurring doses of IV dexamethasone in a patient with diabetes treated with basal-bolus insulin. The understanding of triphasic glycemic pattern allows optimal glycemic management.","Zhang, Fan; Karam, Jocelyne G",Am J Case Rep,,510

Researchers all across the globe started working to find out its possible treatments. However, most of initiatives taken were based on various hypotheses and till date no successful treatments have been achieved. Some strategies adopted by China where existing antiviral therapy was initially used to treat COVID-19 have not given very successful results. Researchers from Thailand explored the use of combination of anti-influenza drugs such as Oseltamivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir to treat it. In some cases, combination therapy of antiviral drugs with chloroquine showed better action against COVID-19. Some of the clinical studies showed very good effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, however, they were not recommended due to serious clinical toxicity. In some cases, use of rho kinase inhibitor, fasudil was found very effective. In some of the countries, antibody-based therapies have proved fairly successful. The use of BCG vaccines came in light; however, they were not found successful due to lack of full-proof mechanistic studies. In Israel as well as in other developed countries, pluristems allogeneic placental expanded cell therapy has been found successful. Some phytochemicals and nutraceuticals have also been explored to treat it. In a recent report, the use of dexamethasone was found very effective in patients suffering from COVID-19. Its effect was most striking among patients on ventilator. The research for vaccines that can prevent the disease is still going on.

267910,Is It Safe to Use Long-Acting G-CSF for Febrile Neutropenia Prophylaxis in COVID-19 Pandemic?,2021,"During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak occurred following attendance of a symptomatic index case at a weekly rehearsal on 10 March of the Skagit Valley Chorale (SVC). After that rehearsal, 53 members of the SVC among 61 in attendance were confirmed or strongly suspected to have contracted COVID-19 and two died. Transmission by the aerosol route is likely; it appears unlikely that either fomite or ballistic droplet transmission could explain a substantial fraction of the cases. It is vital to identify features of cases such as this to better understand the factors that promote superspreading events. Based on a conditional assumption that transmission during this outbreak was dominated by inhalation of respiratory aerosol generated by one index case, we use the available evidence to infer the emission rate of aerosol infectious quanta. We explore how the risk of infection would vary with several influential factors: ventilation rate, duration of event, and deposition onto surfaces. The results indicate a best-estimate emission rate of 970 ± 390 quanta/h. Infection risk would be reduced by a factor of two by increasing the aerosol loss rate to 5 h-1 and shortening the event duration from 2.5 to 1 h.","Miller, Shelly L; Nazaroff, William W; Jimenez, Jose L; Boerstra, Atze; Buonanno, Giorgio; Dancer, Stephanie J; Kurnitski, Jarek; Marr, Linsey C; Morawska, Lidia; Noakes, Catherine",Indoor air,,510

Due to the unobservability, the time interval between transmission generations (TG), though important for understanding the disease transmission patterns, of COVID-19 cannot be directly summarized from surveillance data. In this study, we develop a likelihood framework to estimate the TG and the pre-symptomatic transmission period from the serial interval observations from the individual transmission events. As the results, we estimate the mean of TG at 4.0 days (95%CI: 3.3-4.6), and the mean of pre-symptomatic transmission period at 2.2 days (95%CI: 1.3-4.7). We approximate the mean latent period of 3.3 days, and 32.2% (95%CI: 10.3-73.7) of the secondary infections may be due to pre-symptomatic transmission. The timely and effectively isolation of symptomatic COVID-19 cases is crucial for mitigating the epidemics.","Zhao, Shi",Math Biosci Eng,,510

272921,A Global Survey on the Impact of COVID-19 on Urological Services,2020,"The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii infection in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) in eastern China. Therefore, 287 primary CRC patients and 287 age-matched healthy control subjects were recruited to estimate the seroprevalence of T. gondii and identify the risk factors of infection. Enzyme-linked immunoassays were used to test for anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies. Forty-six (16%) samples were positive for anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies in patients with CRC, compared with 26 (9.1%) in the healthy controls, a significant difference (P = 0.007). By contrast, eight (2.8%) patients tested positive for T. gondii IgM antibodies, compared with three (1.1%) in the controls, a difference that was not significant (P = 0.13). Multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that a rural residence (OR 2.83; 95% CI 1.15-7.01; P = 0.024) and treatment with chemotherapy (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.02-4.57; P = 0.045) were risk factors for T. gondii infection in patients with CRC. Thus, T. gondii infection is serious in patients with CRC, and a rural residence and treatment with chemotherapy are independent risk factors for infection by this parasite. Therefore, medical professionals should be aware of this pathogen in patients with CRC, and the causes of T. gondii infection in these patients need to be explored further.","Yu, Yang; Guo, Dong; Qu, Tingting; Zhao, Shuchao; Xu, Chang; Wang, Longlong; Wang, Zhongjun; Fu, Haiyang; Zhang, Xiangyan; Zhou, Na",Biomed Res Int,,510

These patients are expected to be at a higher risk for exacerbation of lung inflammation during viral infection. We investigated the putative interplay existing between allergen-specific immunotherapy and COVID-19 infection in Hymenoptera venom-allergic population. We evaluated the frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of 211 subjects referring to our Center for the regular administration of venom immunotherapy (VIT). Our result showed that the median age of our cohort is similar to the one that in our region has been associated with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection, increased hospitalization and mortality rates. We reported only an isolated positivity of COVID-19 in the overall group, whereas none suffered from upper airway symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnoea, sore throat, anosmia and/or ageusia). Even though the demographic characteristics pose a substantial risk for such a population, we suggest that a regular administration of VIT may help to the development of an immunological milieu able to down modulate the Th1/Th17 environment that has been linked to inflammatory manifestations of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the incidence of COVID-19 infection in Hymenoptera venom allergic patients treated with VIT, suggesting indirectly that venom immune tolerance-inducing treatment may be capable of reducing the aberrant inflammatory response induced by the virus in this specific population.","Dell039,; Edera, Alessandro; Borghesan, Franco; Favero, Elisabetta; Rattazzi, Marcello; Scarpa, Riccardo; Tartaglia, Leonardo; Agostini, Carlo; Cinetto, Francesco",World Allergy Organ J,,510

DESIGN: A cross-sectional online thirty-six-item Google Survey. The survey queried demographics and information on usage and perceived telemedicine quality. SETTING: The survey was distributed to Israeli Dietetic Association (ATID) mailing list between 31 March and 5 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Clinical dietitians, members of ATID, who consented to participated in the survey. RESULTS: Three hundred dietitians (12 % of ATID members; 95 % women; mean age 4·41 (sd 10·2) years) replied to the survey. Most dietitians reported a significant â¼30 % decrease in work hours due to the pandemic. The most prevalent form of alternative nutrition counselling (ANC) was over the phone (72 %); 53·5 % used online platforms. Nearly 45 % had no former ANC experience. Both ANC formats were reported inferior to face-to-face nutritional consultation (consultation quality median scores 8 and 7, on a 1-10 scale, for online and phone, respectively). ANC difficulties on either phone or online platforms were technical (56 and 47 %, respectively), lack of anthropometric measurements (28 and 25 %, respectively) and interpersonal communication (19 and 14·6 %, respectively). Older age and former phone counselling experience were associated with higher quality scores, respectively (OR = 1·046, 95 % CI 1·01, 1·08, P = 0·005), (95 % CI 1·38, 4·52, P = 0·02). Those who continued to work full time had five-time greater odds for a higher quality score using online platforms (OR = 5·33, 95 % CI 1·091, 14·89, P = 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest telemedicine holds considerable promise for dietary consultation; however, additional tools and training are needed to optimise remote ANC, especially in light of potential crisis-induced lockdown.","Kaufman-Shriqui, Vered; Sherf-Dagan, Shiri; Boaz, Mona; Birk, Ruth",Public Health Nutr,,510

The expectation of policy makers was that schools and universities would continue to provide lessons online and that students would engage in home learning. How much home learning has there been? We use nationally representative, longitudinal data on 14- to 25-year-old Swiss students to analyze the effects of school closures on studying time. Our results show that students reduced, on average, their studying time from 35 to 23 hours per week. This reduction was stronger for students in secondary school age than for students older than 18. Contrary to our expectations, these reductions in studying time did not vary between male and female students. In addition, children from families with highly educated parents reduced their studying time in absolute terms more than children from families with low educated parents. In relative terms, reductions in children's studying time did not vary by parental education. We also found some variation in the reduction in studying time across the three linguistic regions in Switzerland. Taken together, our findings show that studying time was considerably reduced during the closure of schools. We therefore conclude by suggesting political measures that can compensate for the loss in studying time a generation of Swiss students experienced between March and July 2020.","Michael, Grätz; Oliver, Lipps",Res Soc Stratif Mobil,,510

METHODS: We evaluated published information in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020, with available data on acute kidney injury (AKI), renal replacement therapy (RRT), intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and death and compared clinical outcomes in KTR vs nontransplant recipients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 19 published articles were identified, including a total of 88 KTR and 5342 nontransplant patients. The sample size varied between 2 and 2634. Mean age was 58.6 years vs 58.9 years in KTR vs nontransplant patients. Patient-level incidence of AKI (27.5% vs 13.3%, P < .001), RRT (15.4% vs 3.3%, P < .001), ICU stay (34.1% vs 15.1%, P < .001), and death (22.7% vs 16.2%, P = .10) was higher in KTR, representing relative risks of 2.06 (1.44, 2.96), 4.72 (2.62, 8.51), 2.25 (1.67, 3.03), and 1.41 (0.95, 2.08), respectively.

275293,Role of Social Media and Telemedicine in Diagnosis & Management of COVID-19; An Experience of the Iranian Society of Radiology,2020,"T cell immunity toward SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-), membrane (M-), and nucleocapsid (N-) proteins may define COVID-19 severity. Therefore, we compare the SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses in moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients and unexposed donors. Overlapping peptide pools of all three proteins induce SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell response with dominance of CD4+ over CD8+ T cells and demonstrate interindividual immunity against the three proteins. M-protein induces the highest frequencies of CD4+ T cells, suggesting its relevance for diagnosis and vaccination. The T cell response of critical COVID-19 patients is robust and comparable or even superior to non-critical patients. Virus clearance and COVID-19 survival are not associated with either SARS-CoV-2 T cell kinetics or magnitude of T cell responses, respectively. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19. Conversely, it indicates that activation of differentiated memory effector T cells could cause hyperreactivity and immunopathogenesis in critical patients.","Thieme, Constantin J; Anft, Moritz; Paniskaki, Krystallenia; Blazquez-Navarro, Arturo; Doevelaar, Adrian; Seibert, Felix S; Hoelzer, Bodo; Konik, Margarethe Justine; Berger, Marc Moritz; Brenner, Thorsten; Tempfer, Clemens; Watzl, Carsten; Meister, Toni L; Pfaender, Stephanie; Steinmann, Eike; Dolff, Sebastian; Dittmer, Ulf; Westhoff, Timm H; Witzke, Oliver; Stervbo, Ulrik; Roch, Toralf; Babel, Nina",Cell Rep Med,,510

We conducted an observational study (CORONATION-TR registry). All patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Turkey between March 11 and June 22, 2020 were included. We developed the model and validated both temporal and geographical models. Model performances were assessed by area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC or c-index), R2 , and calibration plots. The study population comprised a total of 60,980 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Of these patients, 7688 (13%) were transferred to intensive care unit, 4867 patients (8.0%) required mechanical ventilation, and 2682 patients (4.0%) died. Advanced age, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, albumine, and D-dimer levels, and pneumonia on computed tomography, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure status at admission were found to be the strongest predictors of death at 30 days in the multivariable logistic regression model (area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic = 0.942; 95% confidence interval: 0.939-0.945; R2 = .457). There were also favorable temporal and geographic validations. We developed and validated the prediction model to identify in-hospital deaths in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our model achieved reasonable performances in both temporal and geographic validations.","Tanboga, Ibrahim Halil; Canpolat, Ugur; Çetin, Elif Hande Özcan; Kundi, Harun; Çelik, Osman; Çaglayan, Murat; Ata, Naim; Özeke, Özcan; Çay, Serkan; Kaymaz, Cihangir; Topaloglu, Serkan",J Med Virol,,510
276108,Community Participation: Key to an Improved Covid-19 Response,2020,"Purpose To generate an understanding of the primary concerns facing medical physicists regarding integration of a demanding technical career with their personal lives. Methods and Materials In 2019, we recruited 32 medical physics residents, faculty, and staff via emails to U.S. medical physics residency program directors. Subjects participated in a 1-hour, semi-structured interview that elicited their thoughts on several topics, including work-life integration. Standard techniques of qualitative thematic analysis were used to generate the research findings. Results Participants were 50% women, 69% non-Hispanic white, with a mean age of 37.5 (SD 7.4). They were evenly split between faculty/staff and residents. Participant responses centered around five primary themes: the gendered distribution of household responsibilities, the impact of career/work on home and family life, the impact of family on career/work, support and strategies for reconciling work-life conflicts, and the role of professional societies in addressing work-life integration. Participants expressed concern about the impact of heavy workloads on home life, with women respondents more likely to report carrying the majority of the household burden. Conclusions Medical physicists experience challenges in managing work-life conflict amidst a diverse array of personal and professional responsibilities. Further investigations are needed to quantitatively assess the division of work and household labor by gender in medical physics, particularly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, but these qualitative findings suggest that the profession should consider ways to address root causes of work-life conflict to promote the future success and wellbeing of all medical physicists, and perhaps women in particular.","Paradis, Kelly C.; Ryan, Kerry A.; Schmid, Spencer Moran Jean M.; Laucis, Anna M.; Chapman, Christina H.; Bott-Kothari, Terri Prisciandaro Joann I.; Simiele, Samantha J.; Balter, James M.; Matuszak, Martha M.; Narayana, Vrinda Jagsi Reshma",Advances in Radiation Oncology,,510

Primary schools in South Africa were forced to shift to emergency remote teaching abruptly relying on using a Learning Management System (LMS) to aid their teaching. LMSs helped primary schools build resilience to cope with unexpected events. An opportunity rose to study the affordances and constraints faced when using a LMS for remote teaching, specifically for primary school learners ('Gen Z') - a largely ignored area of research. Through a case study of 6 schools, this research describes the affordances and constraints of the LMS supported teaching system in use in primary schools. Affordances related to schools, learners and teachers while constraints were classified from a financial, technological, school, learner and teacher perspective. Noteworthy affordances included using LMSs as notice boards and satisfying parents, the key stakeholders. In terms of constraints, the digital divide was a recurring theme while device and data costs were consistently a limitation. There were many cases of schools not realizing the full potential of LMS usage. This research should be useful for primary schools wanting to use a LMS for their teaching.","Canani, Ammar; Seymour, Lisa F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09764v1.pdf,510

COVID-19-TB co-infection is also reported but there are limited number of studies which analyze the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in TB diagnosis and management. In this retrospective study, we observed that the TB diagnosis was reduced in pandemic time. Before COVID-19 pandemic (March–December 2019), there were 644 TB tests out of which 127 were TB positive. In ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (January–October 2020), 484 TB tests were performed and 146 patients were TB positive. Male accounted for 64%/57% of TB cases in 2019/2020 whereas female patients were 35%/42% in 2019/2020. Increase in female TB positive cases was a noticeable feature. The newly diagnosed with TB cases in 2019/2020 were 112/130 respectively. Though, we have seen only 7 COVID-TB co-infection cases, we could not establish the causal relationship in COVID-TB co-infection. The increase in the number of TB positive cases during COVID-19 pandemic clearly showed how adversely COVID-19 has affected TB diagnosis and management. Anticipating the increase in TB cases in future, we emphasize the need to ensure continuous TB testing and treatment despite the pandemic burden. Further study on the COVID-TB co-infection in high TB-burden countries like India, is required to enable analyses of interactions, risk factors in COVID-19-TB co-infection.","Srivastava, S.; Jaggi, N.",Indian Journal of Tuberculosis,,510

METHOD: We analysed the somatic mutations of whole exome sequencing data in 392 patient tumour and normal tissue pairs based on the corresponding blood samples across 10 tumour types. RESULTS: Many of the mutations involved in oncogenic pathways such as PI3K, NOTCH and TP53, were identified in the normal tissues. The ageing-related mutational signature was the most prominent contributing signature found and the mutations in the normal tissues were frequently in genes involved in late replication time (p<0.0001). Variants were rarely overlapping across tissue types but shared variants between normal and matched tumour tissue were present. These shared variants were frequently pathogenic when compared with non-shared variants (p=0.001) and showed a higher variant-allele-fraction (p<0.0001). Normal tissue-specific mutated genes were frequently non-cancer-associated (p=0.009). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 6 normal tissues and were harboured by all of the matched cancer tissues. Multiple types of PIK3CA mutations were found in normal breast and matched cancer tissues. The PIK3CA mutations exclusively present in normal tissue may indicate clonal expansions unrelated to the tumour. In addition, PIK3CA mutation was appeared that they arose before the occurrence of the allelic imbalance. CONCLUSION: Our current results suggest that somatic mutant clones exist in normal tissues and that their clonal expansion could be linked to cancer development.","Oh, Ji-Hye; Sung, Chang Ohk",J. medical. genet,,510

The allied healthcare professionals (AHPs) play a pivotal role against COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To appraise the knowledge and attitude about COVID-19 of AHPs working across Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using Qualtrics software to gather data from all five regions of Saudi Arabia during the nationwide lockdown in April 2020. Complete responses of 195 AHPs were considered for analysis. The questionnaire consisted of 15 and 14 questions on knowledge and attitude, respectively. The overall scores of each domain were calculated and modified Bloom's criterion was applied to categorize them into a three-point ordinal scale. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square test along with multivariate logistic regression for significant parameters. RESULTS: The AHPs displayed a moderate level of knowledge (58.2%) and a good level of attitude (80%). The AHPs were found to have a non-significant (Pâ> â0.05) difference in the level of knowledge within age, gender, region, occupation, educational level, organizational setup and years of experience. The attitude of AHPs working in a private setup has shown a 2.8 times (Pâ=â0.020) higher risk for having moderate/poor attitude compared to the AHPs working in a government organization.

Furthermore, strategies should be developed in the private sector to positively reinforce the attitude of AHPs.","Shrivastava, Deepti; Alduraywish, Abdulrahman A; Srivastava, Kumar Chandan; Alsharari, Abdalkarem F; Al-Johani, Khalid; Sghaireen, Mohammed G; Alam, Mohammad Khursheed",Work,,510
280654,Immediate and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular clinical trials: considerations for study conduct and endpoint determination,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many intensive care units have been overwhelmed by unprecedented levels of demand. Notwithstanding ethical considerations, the prioritization of patients with better prognoses may support a more effective use of available capacity in maximizing aggregate outcomes. This has prompted various proposed triage criteria, although in none of these has an objective assessment been made in terms of impact on number of lives and life-years saved. DESIGN: An open-source computer simulation model was constructed for approximating the intensive care admission and discharge dynamics under triage. The model was calibrated from observational data for 9505 patient admissions to UK intensive care units. To explore triage efficacy under various conditions, scenario analysis was performed using a range of demand trajectories corresponding to differing nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: Triaging patients at the point of expressed demand had negligible effect on deaths but reduces life-years lost by up to 8.4% (95% confidence interval: 2.6% to 18.7%). Greater value may be possible through ""reverse triage"", that is, promptly discharging any patient not meeting the criteria if admission cannot otherwise be guaranteed for one who does. Under such policy, life-years lost can be reduced by 11.7% (2.8% to 25.8%), which represents 23.0% (5.4% to 50.1%) of what is operationally feasible with no limit on capacity and in the absence of improved clinical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of simple triage is limited by a tradeoff between reduced deaths within intensive care (due to improved outcomes) and increased deaths resulting from declined admission (due to lower throughput given the longer lengths of stay of survivors). Improvements can be found through reverse triage, at the expense of potentially complex ethical considerations.","Wood, Richard M; Pratt, Adrian C; Kenward, Charlie; McWilliams, Christopher J; Booton, Ross D; Thomas, Matthew J; Bourdeaux, Christopher P; Vasilakis, Christos",Med Decis Making,,510

In this study, we have aimed to delineate CAD-specific epigenetic signatures by investigating the methylation and expression of 11 candidate genes i.e. ABCG1, LIPC, PLTP, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, F2RL3, FGF2, P66 and TGFBR3. The methylation-specific PCR and qRT-PCR were used to assess the methylation status and the expression of candidate genes, respectively. CAD patients showed the upregulation of IL-6, TNF-&#945;, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, F2RL3, FGF2, P66, and TGFBR3. Hypomethylation of CDKN2A loci was shown to increase risk for CAD by 1.79-folds (95% CI 1.22-2.63). Classification and regression tree (CART) model of gene expression showed increased risk for CAD with F2RL3 > 3.4-fold, while demonstrating risk reduction with F2RL3 < 3.4-fold and IL-6 < 7.7-folds. This CAD prediction model showed the excellent sensitivity (0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.00), specificity (0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.92), positive predictive value (0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.84), and negative predictive value (0.99, 95% CI 0.94-1.00) with an overall accuracy of 92.8% (95% CI 87.0-94.1%). Folate and B12 deficiencies were observed in CAD cases, which were shown to contribute to hypomethylation and upregulation of the prime candidate genes i.e. CDKN2A and F2RL3. Early onset diabetes was associated with IL-6 and TNF-&#945; hypomethylation and upregulation of CDKN2A. The expression of F2RL3 and IL-6 (or) hypomethylation status at CDKN2A locus are potential biomarkers in CAD risk prediction. Early epigenetic imprints of CAD were observed in early onset diabetes. Folate and B12 deficiencies are the contributing factors to these changes in CAD-specific epigenetic signatures.","Indumathi, Bobbala; Oruganti, Sai Satish; Naushad, Shaik Mohammad; Kutala, Vijay Kumar",Mol.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed and compared the demographic data, radiological workups and patient-reported outcomes of 39 patients treated with rPELD and 78 patients treated with fluoroscopy-assisted PELD (fPELD) at our institution between January 2019 and December 2019. RESULTS: Our data showed a single-shot puncture in rPELD group was significantly more precise compared to 4.12 ± 1.71 trials in fPELD group (p < 0.001). There was an overall reduction of fluoroscopy (21.33 ± 3.89 vs. 33.06 ± 2.92 times, p < 0.001), puncture-channel time (13.34 ± 3.03 mins vs. 15.03 ± 4.5 mins, p = 0.038) as well as total operation time (57.46 ± 7.49 mins vs. 69.40 ± 12.59 mins, p < 0.001) using the rPELD technique against the fPELD technique. However, there were no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes, length of hospital stay, and complication rate between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data indicate that rPELD provides a precise skin entry point and optimal trajectory for puncture, which increases the success rate of PELD, thus negates the need for a revision surgery. However, further studies are required to confim the superiority and application rPELD technique.","Jin, Mengran; Lei, Longyue; Li, Fengqing; Zheng, Biao",World neurosurgery (Online),,510

283274,Lessons learnt from group work during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines appears to depend in complex ways on the vaccine dosage and the interval between the prime and boost doses. Unexpectedly, lower dose prime and longer prime-boost intervals have yielded higher efficacies in clinical trials. To elucidate the origins of these effects, we developed a stochastic simulation model of the germinal centre (GC) reaction and predicted the antibody responses elicited by different vaccination protocols. The simulations predicted that a lower dose prime could increase the selection stringency in GCs due to reduced antigen availability, resulting in the selection of GC B cells with higher affinities for the target antigen. The boost could relax this selection stringency and allow the expansion of the higher affinity GC B cells selected, improving the overall response. With a longer dosing interval, the decay in the antigen with time following the prime could further increase the selection stringency, amplifying this effect. The effect remained in our simulations even when new GCs following the boost had to be seeded by memory B cells formed following the prime. These predictions offer a plausible explanation of the observed paradoxical effects of dosage and dosing interval on vaccine efficacy. Tuning the selection stringency in the GCs using prime-boost dosages and dosing intervals as handles may help improve vaccine efficacies.","Garg, Amar K; Mittal, Soumya; Padmanabhan, Pranesh; Desikan, Rajat; Dixit, Narendra M",,,510
283717,COVID-19 outbreak impact in Spain: A role for tobacco smoking?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Both humoral and cell-mediated responses are associated with immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although our understanding of the potential role of T-cell responses in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly increasing, more information is still needed. OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the role of T-cell immunity in COVID-19, in the context of natural infection and post-vaccination, and discuss the potential utility of measuring SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses, drawing on experience of the use of interferon-Î³ release assays (IGRAs) in tuberculosis (TB). SOURCES: PubMed articles up to 16 April 2021. CONTENT: T-cell responses can be detected very early in the course of COVID-19, earlier than the detection of antibody responses, and are correlated with COVID-19 outcome. Lower CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts are markers of more severe disease, longer duration of viral RNA positivity and increased mortality. In line with natural infection, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination stimulates robust T-cell responses, which probably play an important role in protection; data on long-term T-cell responses are currently limited. The utility of measuring T-cell responses is already well established in both aiding the diagnosis of TB infection using IGRAs, and evaluation of T-cell responses to TB vaccine candidates. A variety of assays have already been developed to measure SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses, including IGRAs, intracellular cytokine staining and activation-induced markers. IGRAs based on SARS-CoV-2 antigens can distinguish between convalescent and uninfected healthy blood donors. IMPLICATIONS: Simple assays for measuring the quantity and function of T-cell responses may have utility in the prognostication of COVID-19, and for monitoring immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and population-based immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest.","Goletti, Delia; Petrone, Linda; Manissero, Davide; Bertoletti, Antonio; Rao, Sonia; Ndunda, Nduku; Sette, Alessandro; Nikolayevskyy, Vladyslav",Clin. microbiol. infect,,510

284558,Research Roundup,2021,"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. COVID-19 was first reported in China (December 2019) and is now prevalent across the globe. Entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 into mammalian cells requires the binding of viral Spike (S) proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Once entered, the S protein is primed by a specialized serine protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 in the host cell. Importantly, besides the respiratory symptoms that are consistent with other common respiratory virus infections when patients become viremic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities. We explored whether a specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to survey the human liver and identified potentially implicated liver cell-type for viral ingress. We analyzed ~300,000 single cells across five different (i.e., human fetal, healthy, cirrhotic, tumor, and adjacent normal) liver tissue types. This study reports on the co-expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 in a TROP2(+) liver progenitor population. Importantly, we detected enrichment of this cell population in the cirrhotic liver when compared with tumor tissue. These results indicated that in COVID-19-associated liver dysfunction and cell death, a viral infection of TROP2(+) progenitors in the liver might significantly impair liver regeneration in patients with liver cirrhosis.","Seow, J.

286431,Environmental and Regulatory Concerns During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from the Pandemic Food and Stigma Survey,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the general population. However, less is known about its impact on vulnerable populations, such as veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Data were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative cohort of U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) were examined in veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. 19.2% of veterans screened positive for SI peri-pandemic. Relative to veterans without SI, they had lower income, were more likely to have been infected with COVID-19, reported greater COVID-19-related financial and social restriction stress, and increases in psychiatric symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. A multivariable analysis revealed that older age, greater pre-pandemic psychiatric symptom severity, past-year SI, lifetime suicide attempt, psychosocial difficulties, COVID-19 infection, and past-year increase in psychiatric symptom severity were linked to peri-pandemic SI, while pre-pandemic higher income and purpose in life were protective. Among veterans who were infected with COVID-19, those aged 45 or older and who reported lower purpose in life were more likely to endorse SI. Monitoring for suicide risk and worsening psychiatric symptoms in older veterans who have been infected with COVID-19 may be important. Interventions that enhance purpose in life may help protect against SI in this population.","Na, Peter J; Tsai, Jack; Hill, Melanie L; Nichter, Brandon; Norman, Sonya B; Southwick, Steven M; Pietrzak, Robert H",J Psychiatr Res,,510

In this study, COVID-19 patients showed decreased CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells but increased neutrophils in circulation, exhibiting upregulated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio. IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-18, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-10, Tim-3, IL-8, neutrophil extracellular trap-related proteinase 3, and S100A8/A9 were elevated, whereas IFN-Î³ and C-type lectin domain family 9 member A (clec9A) were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. When compared with influenza patients, the expressions of TNF-&#945;, IL-18, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-8, S100A8/A9 and Tim-3 were significantly increased in critical COVID-19 patients, and carcinoembryonic Ag, IL-8, and S100A8/A9 could serve as clinically available hematologic indexes for identifying COVID-19 from influenza.

287758,The Role of Chest Imaging in Patient Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multinational Consensus Statement From the Fleischner Society,2020,"Large-scale re-engineering of synonymous sites is a promising strategy to generate vaccines either through synthesis of attenuated viruses or via codon optimized genes in DNA vaccines. Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinucleotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies that aim to force nucleotide usage against the direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards U. In turn, analysis of observed synonymous site composition implicates selection against U. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed UU content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. Possible mechanisms of selection against U mutations includes selection for higher expression, for high mRNA stability or lower immunogenicity of viral genes. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV-2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily-informed approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","Rice, Alan M; Morales, Atahualpa Castillo; Ho, Alexander T; Mordstein, Christine; Mühlhausen, Stefanie; Watson, Samir; Cano, Laura; Young, Bethan; Kudla, Grzegorz; Hurst, Laurence D",Mol. biol. evol,,510

Patients with thoracic cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.69; 95% CI, 1.13-2.53, p = .01), younger age (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.15-2.01, p < .01), and body temperature at admission &#8805;37°C (OR, 9.52; 95% CI, 5.44-16.6, p < .0001) had increased risk of positive triage. Direct hospital access was warranted to 93.5% of cases, a further 6% was accepted after medical evaluation, whereas 0.5% was refused at admission. CONCLUSION: A self-report questionnaire has a low positive predictive value to triage patients with cancer and suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) symptoms. Differential diagnosis with tumor- or treatment-related symptoms is always required to avoid unnecessary treatment delays. Body temperature measurement improves the triage process's overall sensitivity, and widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing should be implemented to identify asymptomatic carriers. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This is the first study to provide data on the predictive performance of a triage system in the oncological setting during the coronavirus disease outbreak. A questionnaire-based triage has a low positive predictive value to triage patients with cancer and suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) symptoms, and a differential diagnosis with tumor- or treatment-related symptoms is mandatory to avoid unnecessary treatment delays. Consequently, adequate recourses should be reallocated for a triage implementation in the oncological setting. Of note, body temperature measurement improves the overall sensitivity of the triage process, and widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be implemented to identify asymptomatic carriers.","Fasola, Gianpiero; Pelizzari, Giacomo; Zara, Diego; Targato, Giada; Petruzzellis, Giuseppe; Minisini, Alessandro Marco; Bin, Alessandra; Donato, Raffaela; Mansutti, Mauro; Comuzzi, Chiara; Candoni, Anna; Sperotto, Alessandra; Fanin, Renato",Oncologist,,510

288425,Impact of COVID-19 on Care-Home Mortality and Life Expectancy in Scotland,2021,"Filtering facepiece particle (FFP) masks are important items of personal protective equipment in fighting COVID-19 pandemic. They shall protect the wearer of the mask from particles, droplets and aerosols, but can also prevent the spread of aerosol-transmitted viruses if the wearer becomes infected. Most often, FFP respirators consist of multiple layers of non-woven fabric made from polypropylene. Worldwide, FFP respirators are subject to various regulatory standards that specify physical properties and performance characteristics. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, health authorities have temporarily repealed standards for respirators. We report on 46 patients that presented with rhinitis-like symptoms strongly associated to the use of FFP masks. Some of them were obliged to use FFP masks in their work environment. Nasal endoscopy showed edemata of the nasal mucosa that significantly decreased after a period of non-use of FFP masks. Subjectively reported symptom levels decreased after cessation of FFP use for 3 or more days. The presence of polypropylene fibres isolated from nasal rinsing solution was significantly associated with the use of FFP masks in our patients. Material safety and performance deregulation of FFP masks can pose a health risk. Thus, especially healthcare professionals and other individuals with occupational need for FFP masks should be aware of possible hazards that come with COVID-19 pandemic protection measures.","Klimek, Ludger; Huppertz, Tilman; Alali, Ali; Spielhaupter, Magdalena; Hörmann, Karl; Matthias, Christoph; Hagemann, Jan",World Allergy Organ J,,510

Although restrictive public health behaviors such as social distancing help manage its impact, these behaviors can further sever our connections to people and institutions that affirm our identities. Three studies (N = 1,195) validated a brief 10-item COVID-19 Threat Scale that assesses (1) realistic threats to physical or financial safety and (2) symbolic threats to one’s sociocultural identity. Studies reveal that both realistic and symbolic threats predict higher distress and lower well-being and demonstrate convergent validity with other measures of threat sensitivity. Importantly, the two kinds of threats diverge in their relationship to restrictive public health behaviors: Realistic threat predicted greater self-reported adherence, whereas symbolic threat predicted less self-reported adherence to social disconnection behaviors. Symbolic threat also predicted using creative ways to affirm identity even in isolation. Our findings highlight how social psychological theory can be leveraged to understand and predict people’s behavior in pandemics.","Kachanoff, Frank J.; Bigman, Yochanan E.; Kapsaskis, Kyra; Gray, Kurt",Soc.

The worldwide researchers and various health professionals are working together to determine the best way to stop its spread or halt this virus's spread and circumvent this pandemic condition threatening millions of human lives. The absence of definitive treatment is possible to explore to reduce virus infection and enhance patient recovery. Along with off-label medicines, plasma therapy, vaccines, the researchers exploit the various plants/herbs and their constituents to effectively treat nCoV infection. The present study aimed to present brief and most informative salient features of the numerous facts regarding the SARS-CoV-2, including the structure, genomic sequence, recent mutation, targeting possibility, and various hurdles in research progress, and off-labeled drugs, convalescent plasma therapy, vaccine and plants/herbs for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Results showed that off-labeled drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, antiviral drug (remdesivir, favipiravir), etc., give positive results and approved for use or approved for restricted use in some countries like India.

The aim of our study was to describe the medical interventions following nursing teleconsultation for the outpatient management of patients with cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: All patients who did not attend the follow-up visit from 4 to 15 April 2020 at our institution and who were re-scheduled due to the COVID-19 lockdown were selected to be enrolled in the study. Each patient was followed by a semi-structured telephonic interview performed by a nurse. The outcomes of our study were to assess the patients' adherence to nursing teleconsultation and the usefulness of nursing teleconsultation to detect clinical conditions in need of medical intervention. Results: In total, 203 patients (81%) underwent nursing teleconsultation in a mean time of 7 ± 3 days from the outpatient visit lost due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Furthermore, 53 patients (26%) showed poor adherence to nursing teleconsultation. Among the 150 patients (mean age 67 ± 10 years; 68% male) who completed the telephonic interview, the nursing teleconsultation revealed the need of medical intervention in 69 patients (46%), who were more likely at very high cardiovascular risk (77% vs. 48%; p < 0.0003) and who showed a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia (97% vs. 64%; p < 0.0001) and coronary artery disease (75% vs. 48%, p < 0.0008) compared to those not in need of any intervention. The up-titration of the lipid-lowering drugs (n: 32, 74%) was the most frequent medical intervention following the nursing teleconsultation. The mean time between the nursing teleconsultation and the date of the rescheduled in-person follow-up visit was 164 ± 36 days. Conclusions: Nursing teleconsultation is a simple and well-tolerated strategy that ensures the continuity of care and outpatient management for patients with cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Russo, Vincenzo; Cassini, Roberta; Caso, Valentina; Donno, Chiara; Laezza, Annunziata; Naddei, Maria; Fiorelli, Alfonso; Golino, Paolo; Nigro, Gerardo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,510

Unfortunately, reserving VMs exposes users to \emph{demand risk} that can increase cost if their expected future demand does not materialize. Since accurately forecasting demand over long periods is challenging, users often limit their use of reserved VMs. To mitigate demand risk, Amazon operates a Reserved Instance Marketplace (RIM) where users may publicly list the remaining time on their VM reservations for sale at a price they set. The RIM enables users to limit demand risk by either selling VM reservations if their demand changes, or purchasing variable- and shorter-term VM reservations that better match their demand forecast horizon. Clearly, the RIM's potential to mitigate demand risk is a function of its price characteristics. However, to the best of our knowledge, historical RIM prices have neither been made publicly available nor analyzed. To address the problem, we have been monitoring and archiving RIM prices for 1.75 years across all 69 availability zones and 22 regions in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

We investigate whether contemporary NLG models can function as behavioral priors for systems deployed in social settings by generating action hypotheses that achieve predefined goals under moral constraints. Moreover, we examine if models can anticipate likely consequences of (im)moral actions, or explain why certain actions are preferable by generating relevant norms. For this purpose, we introduce 'Moral Stories', a crowd-sourced dataset of structured, branching narratives for the study of grounded, goal-oriented social reasoning. Finally, we propose decoding strategies that effectively combine multiple expert models to significantly improve the quality of generated actions, consequences, and norms compared to strong baselines, e.g. though abductive reasoning.","Emelin, Denis; Bras, Ronan Le; Hwang, Jena D.; Forbes, Maxwell; Choi, Yejin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15738v1.pdf,510

From the outset, EMU involved asymmetric degrees of integration in the area of ‘economic’ union (less centralised governance) versus ‘monetary’ union (more supranational governance). With the outbreak of the Sovereign Debt Crisis in 2010, the regime-shaping relevance of a second asymmetry emerged: one roughly between the member states of the Euro Area ‘core’ and those in the ‘periphery’. Each of the two asymmetries have created a range of challenges — institutional, policy and political — that undermine the stability and sustainability of the EMU project.","Howarth, David; Verdun, Amy",J.

Researchers have identified PE-degrading bacteria which have been considered as a sustainable alleviation to this crisis. However, the degradation mechanism employed by currently isolated bacteria is unclear and their degradation efficiencies are insufficient. More importantly, there is little research into bacteria capable of degrading PE mulching film to solve ""white"" pollution in agriculture. We determined the PE degradation efficiency of two Pseudomonas, identified by 16S rDNA analysis, and elucidated their potential mechanisms through whole genome sequencing. During an 8-week period, PE mulch lost 5.95 ± 0.03% and 3.62 ± 0.32% of its mass after incubated with P. knackmussii N1-2 and P. aeruginosa RD1-3 strains, respectively. Moreover, considerable pits and wrinkles were observed on PE.The hydrophobicity of PE films also decreased, and new oxygenic functional groups were detected on PE mulch by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR).

292874,Treatments for COVID-19: emerging drugs against the coronavirus,2020,"Australia is currently experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks from infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants (B.1.617.2, AY.3). Analysis of the index case reveals a sub-consensus level of sequencing reads ([~]25%) that support a 17-nucleotide deletion in ORF7a (ORF7a{Delta}17del). ORF7a{Delta}17del induces a frameshift mutation in ORF7a, which truncates the peptide and potentially leads to reduced suppression of host restriction factor BST-2/CD317/Tetherin. Despite this, the mutation has rapidly become represented at the consensus level in subsequent cases: approximately 72% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Australian outbreak possess ORF7a{Delta}17del, and 99.7% (1534/1538) of Delta genomes on GISAID with ORF7a{Delta}17del originate from the current Australian outbreak (5 August 2021). The global abundance of this mutation might be underestimated given the difficulty of variant calling software correctly calling insertion/deletions (indels), the common inability of phylogenetics software to take indels into account, and the tendency of GISAID to not release submissions that contain a frameshift mutation (unless specifically requested). Overall, the rapid increase of persistent ORF7a{Delta}17del variants is concerning, and suggests either a chance founder effect with a neutral mutation yet to be purged, or that the ORF7a{Delta}17del mutation provides a direct selective advantage.","Foster, Charles S.P.; Rawlinson, William D",,,510

Despite the significance of online learning for ERL across most educational institutions, there are wide mixed perceptions about online learning during this pandemic. This study, therefore, aims at examining public perception about online learning for ERL during COVID-19. The study sample included 31,009 English language Tweets extracted and cleaned using Twitter API, Python libraries and NVivo, from 10 March 2020 to 25 July 2020, using keywords: COVID-19, Corona, e-learning, online learning, distance learning. Collected tweets were analysed using word frequencies of unigrams and bigrams, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and sentiment labeling, cluster, and trend analysis. The results identified more positive and negative sentiments within the dataset and identified topics. Further, the identified topics which are learning support, COVID-19, online learning, schools, distance learning, e-learning, students, and education were clustered among each other. The number of daily COVID-19 related cases had a weak linear relationship with the number of online learning tweets due to the low number of tweets during the vacation period from April to June 2020. The number of tweets increased during the early weeks of July 2020 as a result of the increasing number of mixed reactions to the reopening of schools. The study findings and recommendations underscore the need for educational systems, government agencies, and other stakeholders to practically implement online learning measures and strategies for ERL in the quest of reopening of schools.","Asare, Andy Ohemeng Yap Robin Truong Ngoc Sarpong Eric Ohemeng",Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,,510

This system requires accurate transient modeling, lower computation cost, and fewer observation data. To tackle these three challenges, we propose a novel deep learning approach using black-box knowledge distillation for both accurate and efficient transmission dynamics prediction in a practical manner. First, we leverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical simulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the simulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge. Then, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query efficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model accuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved and mixed observation projection sequences for practical use. The case study on COVID-19 justifies that our approach accurately projects infections with much lower computation cost when observation data are limited.","Wang, D. D.; Zhang, S. P.; Wang, L.

293060,Generic and Respiratory-Specific Quality of Life in Non-Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: We compared two serological assays from Roche Diagnostics in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination, namely the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (detecting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (detecting antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: With both assays, we analyzed 3033 serum samples collected from 2496 patients without COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, we studied 34 healthcare-workers who received two injections of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer three weeks apart and who had repeatedly determined their antibody response by both assays. RESULTS: In our cohort of patients without COVID-19 vaccination, 62.9% of all determinations were negative with both Roche assays and 31.5% were positive with both assays. In 5.6% of our cohort, however, there were discordant results with both assays (partly because initially discordant results of the two assays became concordantly positive over time). In the healthcare-workers with the COVID-19 vaccination, the results of the Roche anti-nucleocapsid assay remained negative throughout the observation period of 5 weeks after vaccination. The initially negative antibodies against the spike protein became positive with the Roche assay in all samples two weeks after the initial injection, and the serum concentrations of anti-spike antibodies increased constantly until 4-5 weeks after the initial injection. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide information on serological testing with the two Roche assays, which may be important for the application of the two assays in clinical routine. There are differences in the pattern of antibodies in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination.","Mueller, Thomas",Clin Chim Acta,,510

This study also compares the market reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic with the market reactions to the 2008 global financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Morgan Stanley Capital International daily stock indices data and the Carhart and the GARCH(1,1) models for an event study, the authors examine the cumulative abnormal returns during 30 and 10 trading days and the extended 60 days before and after the WHO pandemic announcement. It also compares the market reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic with the reactions to the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy announcement during the 2008 global financial crisis. Findings: This study finds that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly greater negative impact to the stock markets in emerging countries than in the developed countries. The negative impact on the emerging markets is more pronounced for firms with small market capitalizations and for growth stocks. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is stronger in the energy and financial sectors in both emerging and developed markets. The positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in healthcare and telecommunications for the emerging markets and information technology for the developed markets. This study also finds that the equity markets in both emerging and developed countries recovered faster from the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the 2008 global financial crisis. Social implications: Investors' desire to diversify their risks across different countries and sectors in the emerging markets could bring superior returns. The diversification strategies bring critical financial supports to forestall the contagion of COVID-19, to protect lives, and to save the emerging economies, especially for those financially constrained countries that are facing twin health and economic shocks by channeling their investments to countries with weak healthcare systems. Originality/value: This study extends the literature that examines market reactions to stock market shocks by examining the market reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak on the emerging and developed equity markets across different market capitalizations, valuation and sectors. This study also finds that the markets recovered quicker from the COVID-19 pandemic announcement than during the 2008 global financial crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Harjoto, M.

Here, we developed image-based single cell measurements to scrutinize the heterogeneity of adenovirus (AdV) infection. AdV delivers, transcribes and replicates a linear double-stranded DNA genome in the nucleus. We measured the abundance of viral transcripts by single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the incoming ethynyl-deoxy-cytidine (EdC)-tagged viral genomes by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (click) reaction. Surprisingly, the expression of the immediate early gene E1A only moderately correlated with the number of viral genomes in the cell nucleus. Intranuclear genome-to-genome heterogeneity was found at the level of viral transcription and, in accordance, individual genomes exhibited heterogeneous replication activity. By analyzing the cell cycle state, we found that G1 cells exhibited the highest E1A expression and displayed increased correlation between E1A expression and viral genome copy numbers. The combined image-based single molecule procedures described here are ideally suited to explore the cell-to-cell variability in viral gene expression in a range of different settings, including innate immune response.","Suomalainen, Maarit; Prasad, Vibhu; Kannan, Abhilash; Greber, Urs F",J. cell. sci,,510

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Results of the 2020 ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings are presented. METHODS: Pharmacy directors at 1,437 general and children's medical/surgical hospitals in the United States were surveyed using a mixed-mode method of contact by email and mail. Survey completion was online. IQVIA supplied data on hospital characteristics; the survey sample was drawn from the IMS hospital database. RESULTS: The response rate was 18.7%. Almost all hospitals (92.5%) have a method for pharmacists to review medication orders on demand. Most hospitals (74.5%) use automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) as their primary method for drug distribution. A third of hospitals use barcodes to verify doses during dispensing in the pharmacy and to verify ingredients when intravenous medications are compounded. More than 80% scan barcodes when restocking ADCs. Sterile workflow management technology is used in 21.3% of hospitals. Almost three-quarters of hospitals outsource some sterile preparations. Pharmacists can independently prescribe in 21.1% of hospitals. Pharmacist practice in ambulatory clinics in 46.2% of health systems and provide telepharmacy services in 28.4% of health systems. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists continue their responsibility in their traditional role in preparation and dispensing of medications. They have successfully employed technology to improve safety and efficiency in performance of these duties and have employed emerging technologies to improve the safety, timeliness, and efficiency of the administration of drugs to patients. As pharmacists continue to expand their role to all aspects of medication use, new opportunities highlighted in ASHP's Practice Advancement Initiative 2030 have been identified.","Pedersen, Craig A; Schneider, Philip J; Ganio, Michael C; Scheckelhoff, Douglas J",Am. j. health system pharm,,510
298666,Adherence to anti-hypertensive treatment on the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Mathematical modeling of epidemic spreading has been widely adopted to estimate the threats of epidemic diseases (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) as well as to evaluate epidemic control interventions. The indoor place is considered to be a significant epidemic spreading risk origin, but existing widely-used epidemic spreading models are usually limited for indoor places since the dynamic physical distance changes between people are ignored, and the empirical features of the essential and non-essential travel are not differentiated. In this paper, we introduce a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model that is capable of modeling indoor transmission risks of diseases during people’s social activities. Taking advantage of the before-and-after mobility data from the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, it’s found that people tend to spend more time in grocery stores once their travel frequencies are restricted to a low level. In other words, an increase in dwell time could balance the decrease in travel frequencies and satisfy people’s demands. Based on the pedestrian-based model and the empirical evidence, combined non-pharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels are evaluated. Numerical simulations show that restrictions on people’s travel frequency and open hours of indoor places may not be universally effective in reducing average infection risks for each pedestrian who visit the place. Entry limitations can be a widely effective alternative, whereas the decision-maker needs to balance the decrease in risky contacts and the increase in queue length outside the place that may impede people from fulfilling their travel needs. The results show that a good coordination among the decision-makers can contribute to the improvement of the performance of combined non-pharmaceutical interventions, and it also benefits the short-term and long-term interventions in the future.","Xiao, Yao Yang Mofeng Zhu Zheng Yang Hai Zhang Lei Ghader Sepehr",Transport Policy,,510

Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with participants recruited from Italy and Spain by an international consortium group. METHODS: Summary GWAS statistics for 1610 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and 2205 controls were downloaded. In the current study, we analyzed the summary statistics with the information of loci and p-values for 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using gene ontology analysis to determine the top biological processes implicated in respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We considered the top 708 SNPs, using a p-value cutoff of 5 × 10- 5, which were mapped to the nearest genes, leading to 144 unique genes. The list of genes was input into a curated database to conduct gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. The top ranked biological processes were wound healing, epithelial structure maintenance, muscle system processes, and cardiac-relevant biological processes with a false discovery rate < 0.05. In the PPI analysis, the largest connected network consisted of 8 genes. Through a literature search, 7 out of the 8 gene products were found to be implicated in both pulmonary and cardiac diseases.

With the ongoing health concerns related to COVID-19, there is an increased need for social workers who can competently deliver evidence-based interventions, such as SBIRT, via telehealth. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional SBIRT training approaches using face-to-face (FTF) instruction and FTF simulated practice may not be a safe or feasible way to develop students' SBIRT- related skills. This study explores 35 social work graduate students' experiences of learning SBIRT skills in a remote learning format and subsequently delivering a SBIRT intervention to a live ""client"" via a peer-to-peer simulated telehealth session. Overall, students reported that the shift from FTF to remote learning made learning SBIRT skills difficult, and that providing brief intervention and referral was the most difficult step of the simulated SBIRT telehealth intervention. Qualitative feedback indicates that overall, students found the simulated telehealth sessions a valuable learning experience, but also reported that richer educational experiences would have resulted from additional practice opportunities and real time feedback. Implications for future research, simulation-based education and clinical practice are discussed.","Washburn, Micki; Zhou, Shu; Sampson, McClain; Palmer, Ashley",Clin Soc Work J,,510

SARS-CoV-2 exhibited efficient person-to-person transmission of what became labeled as COVID-19. It has spread worldwide with over 83,000,000 infected cases and more than 1,800,000 deaths to date (December 31, 2020). This research proposes a statistical monitoring scheme in which an optimized np control chart is utilized by sentinel metropolitan airports worldwide for early detection of coronavirus and other respiratory virus outbreaks. The sample size of this chart is optimized to ensure the best overall performance for detecting a wide range of shifts in the infection rate, based on the available resources, such as the inspection rate and the allowable false alarm rate. The effectiveness of the proposed optimized np chart is compared with that of the traditional np chart with a predetermined sample size under both sampling inspection and 100% inspection. For a variety of scenarios including a real case, the optimized np control chart is found to substantially outperform its traditional counterpart in terms of the average number of infections. Therefore, this control chart has potential to be an effective tool for early detection of respiratory virus outbreaks, promoting early outbreak investigation and mitigation.","Haridy, Salah; Maged, Ahmed; Baker, Arthur W; Shamsuzzaman, Mohammad; Bashir, Hamdi; Xie, Min",Comput Ind Eng,,510

303508,We Asked the Experts: How Do We Maintain Surgical Quality Standards for Enhanced Recovery Programs After Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Outbreak?,2020,"This paper analyses the impact of the control measures during the COVID-19 lockdown in Europe (15 March-30 April 2020) on 1-h daily maximum nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and maximum daily 8-h running average ozone (MDA8 O3) observations obtained from the European Environment Agency's air quality database (AirBase). Daily maximum NO2 decreased consistently over the whole continent, with relative reductions ranging from 5% to 55% with respect to the same period in 2015-2019 for 80% of the sites considered (10th - 90th percentiles). However, MDA8 O3 concentrations showed a different pattern, decreasing over Iberia and increasing elsewhere. In particular, a large region from northwestern to central Europe experienced increases of 10-22% at urban background stations, reaching typical values of the summer season. The analysis of the expected NO2 and O3 concentrations in the absence of the lockdown, using generalised additive models fed by reanalysis meteorological data, shows that the low NO2 concentrations were mostly attributed to the emission reductions while O3 anomalies were dominated by the meteorology. The relevance of each meteorological variable depends on the location. The positive O3 anomalies in northwestern and central Europe were mostly associated with elevated temperatures, low specific humidity and enhanced solar radiation. This pattern could be an analogue to study the limits of pollution control policies under climate change scenarios. On the other hand, the O3 reduction in Iberia is mostly attributable to the low solar radiation and high specific humidity, although the reduced zonal wind also played a role in the proximity of the Iberian Mediterranean coast.","Ordóñez, Carlos; Garrido-Perez, Jose M; García-Herrera, Ricardo",Sci Total Environ,,510

304277,The Impact of COVID-19 on Playwork Practice,2021,"IMPORTANCE: Among COVID-19 cases, especially the (frail) elderly show a high number of severe infections, hospital admissions, complications, and death. The highest mortality is found between 80 and 89 years old. Why do these patients have a higher risk of severe COVID-19? In this narrative review we address potential mechanisms regarding viral transmission, physical reserve and the immune system, increasing the severity of this infection in elderly patients. OBSERVATIONS: First, the spread of COVID-19 may be enhanced in elderly patients. Viral shedding may be increased, and early identification may be complicated due to atypical disease presentation and limited testing capacity. Applying hygiene and quarantine measures, especially in patients with cognitive disorders including dementia, can be challenging. Additionally, elderly patients have a decreased cardiorespiratory reserve and are more likely to have co-morbidity including atherosclerosis, rendering them more susceptible to complications. The aging innate and adaptive immune system is weakened, while there is a pro-inflammatory tendency. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system on cytokine production and T-cells, further seem to aggravate this pro-inflammatory tendency, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, increasing disease severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The combination of all factors mentioned above contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 in the older patient. While larger studies of COVID-19 in elderly patients are needed, understanding the factors increasing disease severity may improve care and preventative measures to protect the elderly patient at risk for (severe) COVID-19 in the future.","Smorenberg, Annemieke; Peters, Edgar Jg; van Daele, Paul LA; Nossent, Esther J; Muller, Majon",Eur. j. intern. med,,510
304464,How Spanish music conservatories managed pedagogy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-related factors and dysfunctional coping might favor the development of mental distress induced by COVID-19 containment measures. Aim of this study was exploring the relationship between disability, coping strategies, daily life reorganization and neuropsychiatric symptoms in an Italian MS population during the COVID-19 lockdown, in order to identify potentially modifiable factors that could inform clinical management of mental distress in people with MS. METHODS: We explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown. Structural equation modeling was applied to information collected via web survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress. RESULTS: A total of 845 participants (497 with MS and 348 controls) were included in the study. The MS group had higher scores than the control group for depression (P = 0.005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances. The structural equation modeling explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score. Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (ß = 0.509 and ß = 0.836; P < 0.001); positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (ß = 0.386 and ß = 0.297; P < 0.001); and avoidance, social support and watching television contributed to passive attitude (ß = 0.301, ß = 0.243 and ß = 0.212; P < 0.001). With regard to the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (ß = 0.855; P < 0.001), while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (ß = 0.729 and ß = -0.456; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: As a practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool in facing COVID-19-related mental distress.","Costabile, T; Carotenuto, A; Lavorgna, L; Borriello, G; Moiola, L; Inglese, M; Petruzzo, M; Trojsi, F; Ianniello, A; Nozzolillo, A; Cellerino, M; Boffa, G; Rosa, L; Servillo, G; Moccia, M; Bonavita, S; Filippi, M; Lanzillo, R; Brescia Morra, V; Petracca, M",Eur. j. neurol,,510

To estimate the length of time the COVID-19 vaccine spent in research and development as compared to other novel vaccines, we apply previously-established methods for estimating medical product development times, using the earliest associated patent filings cited by the manufacturer as the marker of when commercial development activity began. Applying these methods to a cohort of recently approved innovative vaccines and comparing them to the development time of the first-approved COVID-19 vaccine (BioNTech/Pfizer), we found patent filings for the technology in this COVID-19 vaccine occurred 10.0 years prior to regulatory authorization. Furthermore, the development timelines for innovative vaccines have been shortening since the 1980s and the COVID-19 vaccine comfortably fits within this pattern.

DESIGN: A scoping review and content analysis of online media reports. SETTING: WHO European region. METHODS: A scoping review of media reports and publications and a search of other grey literature (published from 1 January to 17 September 2020). Primary and secondary outcome measures included measures implemented by governments, public services and non-governmental and civil organisations to prevent or respond to VAWC during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our study found that in 52 of the 53 member states there was at least one measure undertaken to prevent or respond to VAWC during the pandemic. Government-led or government-sponsored measures were the most common, reported in 50 member states. Non-governmental and other civil society-led prevention and response measures were reported in 40 member states. The most common measure was the use of media and social media to raise awareness of VAWC and to provide VAWC services through online platforms, followed by measures taken to expand and/or maintain helpline services for those exposed to violence.

Understanding the timeline of antibody decline is important for interpreting SARS-CoV-2 serology results. Serum specimens were collected from a convenience sample of frontline health care personnel at 13 hospitals and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 during April 3-June 19, 2020, and again approximately 60 days later to assess this timeline. The percentage of participants who experienced seroreversion, defined as an antibody signal-to-threshold ratio >1.0 at baseline and <1.0 at the follow-up visit, was assessed. Overall, 194 (6.0%) of 3,248 participants had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (1). Upon repeat testing approximately 60 days later (range = 50-91 days), 146 (93.6%) of 156 participants experienced a decline in antibody response indicated by a lower signal-to-threshold ratio at the follow-up visit, compared with the baseline visit, and 44 (28.2%) experienced seroreversion. Participants with higher initial antibody responses were more likely to have antibodies detected at the follow-up test than were those who had a lower initial antibody response. Whether decay in these antibodies increases risk for reinfection and disease remains unanswered. However, these results suggest that serology testing at a single time point is likely to underestimate the number of persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a negative serologic test result might not reliably exclude prior infection.","Self, Wesley H; Tenforde, Mark W; Stubblefield, William B; Feldstein, Leora R; Steingrub, Jay S; Shapiro, Nathan I; Ginde, Adit A; Prekker, Matthew E; Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan D; Gong, Michelle N; Aboodi, Michael S; Khan, Akram; Exline, Matthew C; Files, D Clark; Gibbs, Kevin W; Lindsell, Christopher J; Rice, Todd W; Jones, Ian D; Halasa, Natasha; Talbot, H Keipp; Grijalva, Carlos G; Casey, Jonathan D; Hager, David N; Qadir, Nida; Henning, Daniel J; Coughlin, Melissa M; Schiffer, Jarad; Semenova, Vera; Li, Han; Thornburg, Natalie J; Patel, Manish M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,510

In this way, EVs participate in various biological processes, including immune responses. Viruses can hijack EV biogenesis systems for their dissemination, while EVs from infected cells can transfer viral proteins to uninfected cells and to immune cells in order to mask the infection or to trigger a response. Several studies have highlighted the role of native or engineered EVs in the induction of B cell and CD8(+) T cell reactions against viral proteins, strongly suggesting these antigen-presenting EVs as a novel strategy for vaccine design, including the emerging COVID-19. EV-based vaccines overcome some limitations of conventional vaccines and introduce novel unique characteristics useful in vaccine design, including higher bio-safety and efficiency as antigen-presenting systems and as adjuvants. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for antiviral EV-based vaccines, including the ongoing projects of some biotech companies in the development of EV-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.

308455,Communicating Effectively With Hospitalized Patients and Families During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Importance: Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in India. Since the first laboratory confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from Kerala on January 30, 2020 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) has been presenting to the hospital emergencies as severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). We aim to find out the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in SARI cases and further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP in New Delhi, India. Aims and Objectives: To find out the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in SARI cases presenting to the hospital emergency and describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 82 consecutive hospitalized patients with SARI and subsequent confirmed NCIP cases at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi between 10th April 2020 and 30th April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. The primary composite end-point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation or death. Patients were categorized as severe pneumonia and non-severe pneumonia at time of admission and outcome data was compared. Results: Of the 82 SARI cases, 32(39%) patients were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. The median age of NCIP cases was 54.5 years (IQR, 46.25 - 60) and 19(59.3%) of them were males. 24(75%) cases were categorized as severe pneumonia on admission. 22(68.8%) patients had 1 or more co-morbidities. Diabetes mellitus 16(50%), hypertension 11(34.4%) and chronic obstructive airway disease 5(15.6%) were the most common co-existing illnesses. Compared with the patients who did not meet the primary outcome, patients who met the primary outcome were more likely to be having at least 1 underlying comorbidity (p-0.03), diabetes (p-0.003) and hypertension (p-0.03). Common symptoms included dyspnea 29(90.6%) followed by cough 27(84.4%), fever 22(68%), bodyache and myalgias 14(43.75%). Median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 3 days. The most common pattern on chest X-ray was bilateral patchy nodular or interstitial infiltration seen in 30(93.8%) patients. Leucopenia was present in 10(31.2%) of the patients, with majority of patients presenting with lymphocytopenia, 24(75%) [lymphocyte count (1106 cells/ dL), interquartile range {IQR}, (970-1487)]. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 14(43.8%) patients, pancytopenia in 10(31.2%) patients and anemia was seen in 14(43.8%) patients. Hypoalbuminemia was present in 22(68.8%) cases. Raised CK-MB was seen in 7(21.9%) patients. The primary composite end-point occurred in 12(37.5%) patients, including 9(28.13%) patients who required mechanical ventilation and subsequently expired. 3(9.3%) of these patients who recovered, were subsequently shifted to COVID-19 ward from the ICU. The patients who met the primary outcome were older in age (56.5 years vs 50 years), had significantly higher SOFA scores (6 vs 3.5), were in shock (41.7% vs 5%), in higher respiratory distress (66.7% vs 10%), had lower mean arterial oxygen saturation (85% vs 89.5%), had higher CK-MB values (66 vs 26)U/L [6(54.5%) vs 2(9.5%)], had hypoalbuminemia (100% vs 50%) and acute kidney injury 8(72.7%) vs 5(23.8%) on admission. Of the 50 non-COVID-19 SARI patients in our study cohort, 13 (26%) patients met the primary composite outcome. Of them 9 (18%) patients expired and remaining 4 patients have subsequently recovered. As on 17th May 2020, 23 patients were still hospitalized, recovering in COVID-19 ward. Conclusion and Relevance: In this single-center case series from New Delhi, out of 82 patients of SARI, 32 patients were confirmed NCIP, with a COVID-19 positivity of 39%. 75% of NCIP presented in severe pneumonia and 37.5% required ICU care.

308558,90 Socio-Demographic and Medical Factors in A Multi-Ethnic Cohort of COVID Deaths,2021,"The history of knowledge about Amazonian biogeography is as rich as its fish community, and a fascinating theme of study in itself. Several current paradigms and controversies about Amazonian fish biogeography are rooted in principles dating from the second half of the 18th to the first half of the 19th centuries. The present work establishes a relationship between current biogeographical ideas and their old predecessors, on the basis of a chronologically-oriented historical continuity analysis. The advent of evolutionary theory has not contributed significantly to a transformation of the knowledge on the biogeography of Amazonian fishes. On the other hand, the two main schools of biogeographical thought (dispersalist and vicariant) had major implications on how Amazonian fish distribution is interpreted. The process was gradual and many hypotheses have combined elements from each of the two schools. Chronologically, practically the entire tradition of Amazonian biogeography takes place within the evolutionary paradigm, although its founder Louis Agassiz was himself an anti-evolutionist. The birth of Amazonian biogeography is Agassiz´s travel in Amazon. That document makes it clear that the author did not consider dispersal as a valid explanation for the biogeographical patterns he found. Later, Carl Eigenmann helps to spread the dispersalist tradition as a model for biogeographical explanations in fish distributions, a phase which lasted until the late 20th century. A major shift occurs with the contributions of Marylin Weitzman, Stanley Weitzman and Richard Vari, who associated the temporal framework of phylogenetic hypotheses with distribution patterns, underscoring the predictive power of vicariant biogeography. The present-day paradigm begins with the work of John Lundberg and attempts to incorporate geomorphological and phylogenetic information into integrative biogeographical hypotheses.(AU)","Dagosta, Fernando C.

However, the impact of data augmentation on the development of AI (artificial intelligence) models to address clinical unmet needs has not yet been investigated. In this work, we assess whether the aggregation of real with virtual patient data can improve the performance of the existing risk stratification and disease classification models in two rare clinical domains, namely the primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS) and the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), for the first time in the literature. To do so, multivariate approaches, such as, the multivariate normal distribution (MVND), and straightforward ones, such as, the Bayesian networks, the artificial neural networks (ANNs), and the tree ensembles are compared against their performance towards the generation of high-quality virtual data. Both boosting and bagging algorithms, such as, the Gradient boosting trees (XGBoost), the AdaBoost and the Random Forests (RFs) were trained on the augmented data to evaluate the performance improvement for lymphoma classification and HCM risk stratification. Our results revealed the favorable performance of the tree ensemble generators, in both domains, yielding virtual data with goodness-of-fit 0.021 and KL-divergence 0.029 in pSS and 0.029, 0.027 in HCM, respectively.

In the current review, scientific literature including original research articles, clinical studies, epidemiological reports, and review-type articles concerning human intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the possible consequences on the microbiota were reviewed. Moreover, the following aspects pertaining to COVID-19 have also been discussed: transmission, resistance in the human body, the impact of nutritional status in relation to the intestinal microbiota, and the impact of comorbid metabolic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), obesity, and type two diabetes (T2D). The articles investigated show that health, age, and nutritional status are associated with specific communities of bacterial species in the gut, which could influence the clinical course of COVID-19 infection. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Patients suffering from metabolic and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are thought to be at a moderate-to-high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating the direct implication of gut dysbiosis in COVID-19 severity.

Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunit. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, completely of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells, regardless of the glycosites' location. Moreover, the N-glycan compositions were conserved among different sizes of subunits. Our study indicate that the S protein N-glycosylation occurs regularly at each site, albeit the occupied N-glycans were diverse and heterogenous. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","Zhang, Yong; Zhao, Wanjun; Mao, Yonghong; Chen, Yaohui; Wang, Shisheng; Zhong, Yi; Su, Tao; Gong, Meng; Du, Dan; Lu, Xiaofeng; Cheng, Jingqiu; Yang, Hao",Mol Cell Proteomics,,510

310202,COVID-19 preferred practice pattern for eye care professional - An initiative by Nepal Ophthalmic Society,2020,"With increasing frequency, humans are facing outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. In the most extreme instances, such outbreaks can become pandemics, as we are now witnessing with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization, this new disease, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has already infected more than 10 million people worldwide and led to 499,913 deaths as of 29 June, 2020. How high these numbers will eventually go depends on many factors, including policies on travel and movement, availability of medical support, and, because there is no vaccine or highly effective treatment, the pace of biomedical research. Other than an approved antiviral drug that can be repurposed, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold the most promise for providing a stopgap measure to lessen the impact of an outbreak while vaccines are in development. Technical advances in mAb identification, combined with the flexibility and clinical experience of mAbs in general, make them ideal candidates for rapid deployment. Furthermore, the development of mAb cocktails can provide a faster route to developing a robust medical intervention than searching for a single, outstanding mAb. In addition, mAbs are well-suited for integration into platform technologies for delivery, in which minimal components need to be changed in order to be redirected against a novel pathogen. In particular, utilizing the manufacturing and logistical benefits of DNA-based platform technologies in order to deliver one or more antiviral mAbs has the potential to revolutionize EID responses.","Andrews, Chasity D; Huang, Yaoxing; Ho, David D; Liberatore, Rachel A",Emerg Microbes Infect,,510

311473,Covid-19 Spaces Initiative Reduces Staff Exposure while Maintaining the Quality of Care,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has altered mental health care delivery like no other event in modern history. The purpose of this study was to document the magnitude of that effect by examining (a) the amount of psychologists' telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study used a cross-sectional, national online design to recruit 2,619 licensed psychologists practicing in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology, which increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic, with 67.32% of psychologists conducting all of their clinical work with telepsychology. Psychologists projected that they would perform 34.96% of their clinical work via telepsychology after the pandemic. Psychologists working in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase in telepsychology use during the pandemic, while those in Veterans Affairs medical centers only reported a sevenfold increase. A larger increase in percentage telepsychology use occurred in women, in psychologists who reported an increase in telepsychology training and supportive organizational telepsychology policies, and in psychologists who treated relationship issues, anxiety, and women's issues. The lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use were reported by psychologists working in rural areas, treating antisocial personality disorder, performing testing and evaluation, and treating rehabilitation populations. Although there was a remarkable increase in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual and practice characteristics affected psychologists' ability to adopt telepsychology.

311841,Evaluation of alcohol content of cologne products in the Turkish market amid the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifest mainly respiratory symptoms. However, clinical observations frequently identified neurological symptoms and neuropsychiatric disorders related to COVID-19 (Neuro-SARS2). Accumulated robust evidence indicates that Neuro-SARS2 may play an important role in aggravating the disease severity and mortality. Understanding the neuropathogenesis and cellular mechanisms underlying Neuro-SARS2 is crucial for both basic research and clinical practice to establish effective strategies for early detection/diagnosis, prevention, and treatment paradigms. In this review, we will comprehensively examine current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various neural cells including neurons, microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, pericytes/endothelial cells, ependymocytes/choroid epithelial cells, and neural stem/progenitor cells. Although significant progress has been made in studying Neuro-SARS2, much remains to be learned about the neuroinvasive routes (transneuronal and hematogenous) of the virus and the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying the development/progression of this disease. Future and ongoing studies require the establishment of more clinically relevant and suitable neural cell models using human induced pluripotent stem cells, brain organoids and postmortem specimens.

Background: COVID-19 is an emerging disease with worldwide distribution. However, there is a little data about the correlation between the disease and the host immune responses. Methods: Whole blood samples of 30 COVID-19 patients and eight healthy people were collected during March to June 2020. Total RNA was extracted from the samples, cDNA synthesis was performed, and the expression level of targeted genes was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: The expression level of CD4, CD25, and Foxp3 was significantly downregulated 5-, 2-, and 3-fold, respectively, among COVID-19 patients in comparison to healthy controls (P-value < 0.0001). The expression level of IL-6 represented almost 18-fold increase in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Our findings indicated the expression profile analysis of CD4+ FoxP3+ CD25+ T cells could be a potential marker for the assessment of severity of COVID-19 patients.","Mohebbi, Seyed Reza; Baghaei, Kaveh; Rostami-Nejad, Mohammad; Nazemalhosseini Mojarad, Ehsan; Mirjalali, Hamed; Yadegar, Abbas; Asri, Nastaran; Abdoulahi, Shahrokh; Assadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,,510

The aim of this study was to see whether or not this may affect overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHOD: A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189158). Medline, EMBASE and Scopus were interrogated. Patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer who received elective surgery as their primary treatment were included. Delay to elective surgery was defined as the period between CRC diagnosis and the day of surgery. Meta-analysis of the outcomes OS and DFS were conducted. Forest plots, funnel plots and tests of heterogeneity were produced. An estimated number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant pooled hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Of 3753 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria. Encompassing 314 560 patients, three of the seven studies showed that a delay to elective resection is associated with poorer OS or DFS. OS was assessed at a 1 month delay, the HR for six datasets was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.26, p = 0.020) and at 3 months the pooled HR for three datasets was 1.57 (95% CI 1.16-2.12, p = 0.004). The estimated NNH for a delay at 1 month and 3 months was 35 and 10 respectively. Delay was nonsignificantly negatively associated with DFS on meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review recommends that elective surgery for CRC patients is not postponed longer than 4 weeks, as available evidence suggests extended delays from diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes. Focused research is essential so patient groups can be prioritized based on risk factors in future delays or pandemics.","Whittaker, Thomas M; Abdelrazek, Mohamed E G; Fitzpatrick, Aran J; Froud, Joseph L J; Kelly, Jack R; Williamson, Jeremy S; Williams, Gethin L",Colorectal dis,,510
315520,High incidence of hand eczema in Danish schoolchildren following intensive hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide questionnaire study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Quantitative antibody tests are expected to be useful in diagnostics of COVID-19 and investigation of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. To make it proper to perform them, understanding of the immunological aspects is critically important. The present study aimed to assess humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests. METHODS: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes, and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titers of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titers measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titers were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases. Viral burdens estimated according to threshold cycle values at the RT-PCR seemed to impact antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide insights into the nature of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 and diagnostic performance of antibody tests.","Wakui, Masatoshi; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Kurafuji, Toshinobu; Noguchi, Masayo; Ohno, Akemi; Yokota, Hiromitsu; Kikuchi, Haruhito; Hasegawa, Naoki; Saya, Hideyuki; Murata, Mitsuru",Ann Clin Biochem,,510

The long incubation period, high infectious rate, varied manifestation, and absence of effective treatment make it difficult to manage the disease transmission. Objective: The intended goals are to encourage efficient management of neurological and neurosurgical patients, resource utilization, and protecting the healthcare provider during the COVID-19 epidemic. Herein, we present a consensus statement from various centers in India. Methodology: In addition to the literature review, recommendations were included from neurologists and neurosurgeons from various centers in India. Results: Every patient presenting for treatment should be treated as a potential asymptomatic infected case. Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month). Non-essential elective surgeries and outpatient clinics should be avoided after informing the patient(s). There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes. These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment. The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly. Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources. Conclusion: These recommendations could be used to mitigate the risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public, and healthcare staff.","Gupta, Prakamya; Muthukumar, N; Rajshekhar, V; Tripathi, Manjari; Thomas, Sanjeev; Gupta, Sunil Kumar; Lal, Vivek; Pal, Pramod; Abraham, Mathew; Behari, Sanjay; Paliwal, Vimal; Singh, Daljit; Pandey, Sanjay; Narasimhan, Lakshmi; Srinivas, Dwarakanath; Panda, Samhita; Kale, S S; Chandra, P Sarat",Neurol India,,510

319415,Voluntary adoption of social welfare-enhancing behavior: Mask-wearing in Spain during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: On January 30th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a international health emergency due to the unprecedented phenomenon of COVID-19. After this declaration countries swiftly implemented a variety of health policies. In this work we examine how rapid countries responded to this pandemic using two events: the day in which the first case of COVID-19 was reported, and first day in which countries used school closure as one of the measures to avoid outbreaks. We also assessed how countries' health systems, globalization, economic development, political systems, and economic integration to China, Republic of Korea and Italy increased the speed of adoption. METHODS: We compiled information from multiple sources, from December 31st 2019 to June 1st 2020, to trace when 172 countries reported their first COVID-19 case and implemented school closure to contain outbreaks. We applied cross-national Weibull survival analysis to evaluate the global speed of detection of first COVID-19 reported cases and school closure. RESULTS: Ten days after WHO declared COVID-19 to be an international emergency, relative to seven days from this declaration, countries were 28 (95% CI: 12-77) times more likely to report first COVID-19 cases and 42 (95% CI: 22-90) times more likely to close schools. One standard deviation increase in the epidemic security index rises the rate of report first cases by 37% (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.37 (95% CI: 1.09-1.72) and delays the adoption for school closures by 36% (HR 0.64 (95% CI:0.50-0.82). One standard deviation increase in the globalization index augments the adoption for school closures by 74% (HR 1.74 (95% CI:1.34-2.24). CONCLUSION: After the WHO declared a global emergency, countries were unprecedently acting very rapidly. While countries more globally integrated were swifter in closing schools, countries with better designed health systems to tackle epidemics were slower in adopting it. More studies are needed to assess how the speed of school closures and other policies will affect the development of the pandemic.","Nazif-Muñoz, José Ignacio; Peña, Sebastián; Oulhote, Youssef",PLoS One,,510
319594,COVID-19 vaccination did not improve employee mental health: A prospective study in an early phase of vaccination in Japan,2021,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful and debilitating disease characterized by the chronic and progressive degradation of articular cartilage. Post-traumatic OA (PTOA) is a secondary form of OA that develops in ~50% of cases of severe articular injury. Inflammation and re-occurring injury have been implicated as contributing to the progression of PTOA after the initial injury. However, there is very little known about external factors prior to injury that could affect the risk of PTOA development. To examine how the gut microbiome affects PTOA development we used a chronic antibiotic treatment regimen starting at weaning for six weeks prior to ACL rupture, in mice. A six-weeks post-injury histological examination showed more robust cartilage staining on the antibiotic (AB)-treated mice than the untreated controls (VEH), suggesting slower disease progression in AB cohorts. Injured joints also showed an increase in the presence of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in the AB group. Molecularly, the phenotype correlated with a significantly lower expression of inflammatory genes Tlr5, Ccl8, Cxcl13, and Foxo6 in the injured joints of AB-treated animals. Our results indicate that a reduced state of inflammation at the time of injury and a lower expression of Wnt signaling modulatory protein, Rspo1, caused by AB treatment can slow down or improve PTOA outcomes.","Mendez, Melanie E; Murugesh, Deepa K; Sebastian, Aimy; Hum, Nicholas R; McCloy, Summer A; Kuhn, Edward A; Christiansen, Blaine A; Loots, Gabriela G",,,510

The theoretical perspective of politics-administration dichotomy is used to examine the rhetoric, power, and authority of public health messages during the pandemic. This study considers political shifts using state-level data on population, historical voter turnout, and projected COVID-19 cases number coupled with national-level data on voter participation by age group and COVID-19 fatality rates. Developing a formula to calculate these data, we project the extent to which the number of voters from each party could diminish. The analysis shows the potential for significant political changes due to the disproportionate loss of older voters in key swing states in the months leading to the 2020 presidential election.","Johnson, Andrew F.; Pollock, Wendi; Rauhaus, Beth",Adm.

320191,"COVID-19 Pandemic: Advances in Diagnosis, Treatment, Organoid Applications and Impacts on Cancer Patient Management",2021,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan has adopted three methods of admitting patients for treatment: designated hospitals, newly built temporary hospitals and Fangcang shelter hospitals. It has been proven that converting large-scale public venues such as stadiums and exhibition centres into Fangcang shelter hospitals, which serve as hospitals for isolation, treatment and disease monitoring of patients with mild symptoms, is the most effective way to control virus transmission and reduce mortality. This paper presents some experiences learnt from treating COVID-19 in Wuhan, the first city to report the outbreak and which suffered from a shortage of emergency supplies, heavy workload among staff and a shortage of hospital beds during the early stages of the pandemic. The experiences include location, accessibility, spacious outdoor area, spacious indoor space, power supply, architectural layout design and partition isolation, ventilation, sewage, and problems in the construction and management of Fangcang shelter hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional approaches to disaster preparedness have demonstrated intrinsic problems, such as poor economic performance, inefficiency and lack of flexibility. Converting large-scale public venues into Fangcang shelter hospitals is an important means to rapidly improve the function of the city's healthcare system during a pandemic. This valuable experience in Wuhan will help other countries in their battle against the current COVID-19 pandemic and will also contribute to disaster preparedness and mitigation in the future.","Fang, Dongping; Pan, Shengjie; Li, Zaishang; Yuan, Ting; Jiang, Benran; Gan, Di; Sheng, Bai; Han, Jing; Wang, Tao; Liu, Zhongmin",,,510
320915,Is Elective Cancer Surgery Safe During the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2020,"Italy was the first country in Europe to deal with COVID-19. Measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus were based mainly on quarantine and social distancing, with dramatic economic, social and psychological consequences. Since March, Italian children and adolescents are facing school closures, which have caused a disruption in the daily lives of millions of young people and their families. To date, despite the slow reopening, the government has decided to maintain school closures for the entire academic year, leaving the future of young people in uncertainty. There is already some evidence that quarantine and social isolation are having negative impact on children's and adolescents' psychological well-being. Moreover, this situation will mainly affect those children and adolescents with pre-existing vulnerabilities and those suffering of mental disorders. It is imperative to keep young people's needs at the core of reconstruction plans, allowing them to return to school safely, and providing them with some strategies to heal and dealing with this stressful and potentially traumatic situation.","Caffo, Ernesto; Scandroglio, Francesca; Asta, Lisa",Child Adolesc Ment Health,,510

321407,Educating Surgeons to Educate Patients About the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"More than a year after its emergence, COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to plague the world and dominate our daily lives. Even with the development of effective vaccines, this coronavirus pandemic continues to cause a fervor with the identification of major new variants hailing from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and California. Coupled with worries over a distinct mink strain that has caused human infections and potential for further mutations, SARS-CoV-2 variants bring concerns for increased spread and escape from both vaccine and natural infection immunity. Here, we outline factors driving SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution, explore the potential impact of specific mutations, examine the risk of further mutations, and consider the experimental studies needed to understand the threat these variants pose. In this review, Plante et al. examine SARS-CoV-2 variants including B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (RSA), P.1 (Brazil), and B.1.429 (California). They focus on what factors contribute to variant emergence, mutations in and outside the spike protein, and studies needed to understand the impact of variants on infection, transmission, and vaccine efficacy.","Plante, Jessica A; Mitchell, Brooke M; Plante, Kenneth S; Debbink, Kari; Weaver, Scott C; Menachery, Vineet D",Cell Host Microbe,,510

Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are a family cytokines of the early innate immune response to viruses that are being tested against SARS-CoV-2. However, coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 can suppress host IFN-I antiviral responses. Retinoids are a family molecules related to vitamin A that possess robust immune-modulating properties, including the ability to increase and potentiate the actions of IFN-I. Therefore, adjuvants such as retinoids, capable of increasing IFN-I-mediated antiviral responses, should be tested in combinations of IFN-I and antiviral drugs in pre-clinical studies of SARS-CoV-2.","Trasino, Steven E",Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,,510

323844,"Endoscopy in inflammatory bowel diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic period (vol 5, pg 598, 2020)",2021,"Antibody therapies such as convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies have emerged as major potential therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immunoglobulins differ from conventional antimicrobial agents in that they mediate direct and indirect antimicrobial effects that work in concert with other components of the immune system. The field of infectious diseases pioneered antibody therapies in the first half of the 20th century but largely abandoned them with the arrival of conventional antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, much of the knowledge gained from the historical development and use of immunoglobulins such as serum and convalescent antibody therapies was forgotten; principles and practice governing their use were not taught to new generations of medical practitioners, and further development of this modality stalled. This became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 when convalescent plasma was initially deployed as salvage therapy in patients with severe disease. In retrospect, this was a stage of disease when it was less likely to be effective. Lessons of the past tell us that antibody therapy is most likely to be effective when used early in respiratory diseases. This article puts forth three principles of antibody therapy, namely, specificity, temporal, and quantitative principles, connoting that antibody efficacy requires the administration of specific antibody, given early in course of disease in sufficient amount. These principles are traced to the history of serum therapy for infectious diseases. The application of the specificity, temporal, and quantitative principles to COVID-19 is discussed in the context of current use of antibody therapy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Casadevall, Arturo; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Joyner, Michael J",mBio (Online),,510

L’hygiène des mains (HDM) constitue de ce fait le premier moyen de lutte d’efficacité authentifiée contre les IAS. Bien que ce geste soit simple, le manque d’observance de cette mesure parmi les professionnels de santé (PS) est un problème universel. Dans le but d’une efficacité maximale, l’objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer l’impact d’un programme interventionnel sur les connaissances et les perceptions du PS en matière d’HDM. Matériels et méthodes Il s’agissait d’une étude quasi-expérimentale de type avant-après, ayant inclus un échantillon représentatif de PS des différents services du CHU, menée durant la 2e vague de la pandémie COVID-19, août-décembre 2020. L’outil d’évaluation adopté était des questionnaires validés de l’OMS sur les connaissances et les perceptions du PS en matière d’HDM, distribués en deux exemplaires avant l’intervention et 3 mois après. L’intervention consistait en un programme de formation basé sur les cinq composantes de la stratégie multimodale de l’HDM de l’OMS. Un score moyen (SM) global/100 des connaissances était calculé. Pour les perceptions, les réponses étaient basées sur l’échelle de Likert de 4 et 7 points, à partir des deux derniers points la perception était considérée positive. Résultats Au total, 100 PS ont rempli les questionnaires, parmi lesquels 45 % étaient du cadre médical et 55 % étaient des paramédicaux. Trente-neuf sujets (39 %) ont suivi une formation antérieure en HDM les trois dernières années. Le SM global des connaissances a significativement augmenté après l’intervention (48,10±16,76 vs 64,92±17,21 ;p&lt;0,001). Nous avons noté une amélioration significative des SM des connaissances des PS sur le rôle des mains dans la transmission croisée des micro-organismes (65,97±17,75 vs 79,16±13,57 ;p&lt;0,001) ainsi que des différentes techniques de l’HDM (47,97±12,67 vs 67,38±8,59 ;p&lt;0,001). Concernant la source la plus fréquente d’acquisition des IAS, le SM des connaissances est resté stable (32,14±6,73 vs 48,21±6,45 ;p=0,058). Le taux médian d’amélioration des connaissances était de 10,75 (IQR=[2,22–37,59]). Il était significativement plus élevé chez les PS qui ont reçu une formation antérieure (31,85 vs 5,92 ;p=0,007) et chez les paramédicaux (10,75 vs 4,44 ;p=0,014).L’efficacité de l’HDM dans la prévention des IAS était perçue comme élevée/très élevée par la majorité des PS avant et après l’intervention sans amélioration significative (93 % vs 95 % ;p=0,7). De même, la disponibilité de rubans à base d’alcool a été perçue comme l’action la plus utile pour améliorer le respect de l’hygiène des mains (53 % vs 64 % ;p=0,15). Conclusion Cette étude a mis en exergue l’importance du programme de formation instauré auprès des PS en matière d’HDM et la nécessité d’une évaluation continue de leurs compétences afin de réduire la charge des IAS. L’évaluation de cette pratique s’avère indispensable dans le cadre d’une démarche d’amélioration continue de la qualité des pratiques en milieu hospitalier.","Maamri, H.; Ben Ayed, H.; Ketata, N.; Baklouti, M.; Yaich, S.; Feki, H.; Damak, J.",Infectious Diseases Now,,510

COVID-19 continues to cause widespread economic and social turmoil, and while the current focus is on both minimising the spread of the disease and deploying a range of vaccines to save lives, attention will soon turn to future proofing. In line with this, this paper proposes a prediction and containment model that could be used for pandemics and natural disasters. It combines selective lockdowns and protective cordons to rapidly contain the hazard while allowing minimally impacted local communities to conduct ""business as usual"" and/or offer support to highly impacted areas. A flexible, easy to use data analytics model, based on Self Organising Maps, is developed to facilitate easy decision making by governments and organisations. Comparative tests using publicly available data for Great Britain (GB) show that through the use of the proposed prediction and containment strategy, it is possible to reduce the peak infection rate, while keeping several regions (up to 25% of GB parliamentary constituencies) economically active within protective cordons.","Moodley, R.; Chiclana, F.; Caraffini, F.; Gongora, M.",International Journal of Intelligent Systems,,510

324895,Guidelines for otorhinolaryngologists and head neck surgeons in coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and differential impacts on metropolitan areas across the United States and around the world. Within the United States, metropolitan areas that were hit earliest with the pandemic and reacted with scientifically based health policy were able to contain the virus by late spring. For other areas that kept businesses open, the first wave in the United States hit in mid-summer. As the weather turns colder, universities resume classes, and people tire of lockdowns, a second wave is ascending in both metropolitan and rural areas. It becomes more obvious that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed at the local level to track recent shifts in the pandemic, rates of increase, and persistence. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand and manage risk in metropolitan areas. Existing surveillance measures coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until, and after, an effective vaccine is developed. Here, we provide values for novel indicators to measure COVID-19 transmission at the metropolitan area level. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 260 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the 25 largest US metropolitan areas as a function of the prior number of cases and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Minneapolis and Chicago have the greatest average number of daily new positive results per standardized 100,000 population (which we refer to as speed). Extreme behavior in Minneapolis showed an increase in speed from 17 to 30 (67%) in 1 week. The jerk and acceleration calculated for these areas also showed extreme behavior. The dynamic panel data model shows that Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit have the largest persistence effects, meaning that new cases pertaining to a specific week are statistically attributable to new cases from the prior week. CONCLUSIONS: Three of the metropolitan areas with historically early and harsh winters have the highest persistence effects out of the top 25 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States at the beginning of their cold weather season. With these persistence effects, and with indoor activities becoming more popular as the weather gets colder, stringent COVID-19 regulations will be more important than ever to flatten the second wave of the pandemic. As colder weather grips more of the nation, southern metropolitan areas may also see large spikes in the number of cases.","Oehmke, Theresa B; Post, Lori A; Moss, Charles B; Issa, Tariq Z; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James F",J Med Internet Res,,510

The goal of this paper is to examine the association between racial discrimination amid COVID-19 pandemic and depressive symptoms among Asian subgroups and to test whether communications about the incident with various sources moderate this relationship. Data come from an online survey conducted among 245 Asian Americans. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. COVID-19 racial discrimination was positively associated with depressive symptoms, and this association did not vary between Chinese Americans and other Asian subgroups. Communications with a spouse/partner buffered the mental burden of racial discrimination. Those who shared their experience in online ethnic communities displayed stronger depressive symptoms than who did not. These results suggest the potential benefit of communication with a spouse/partner in mitigating the mental burden of discrimination and call for more online mental health support for Asians.","Woo, Bongki; Jun, Jungmi",J. immigr. minor. health,,510

RESULTS: 50% of the centres increased their surgical activity, 33% decreased it and 17% did not change it during containment. Some centres had to cancel (17%) or postpone (33%) patient-requested interventions due to fear of SARS-CoV-2. Four and 6 centres (33% and 50%) respectively cancelled and postponed interventions for medical reasons. In the usual period, 83% of the centres perform their conservative surgeries on an outpatient basis, otherwise the length of hospital stay was 24 to 48 h. All the centres except one performed conservative surgery on an outpatient basis during the lockdown period, for which. 8% performed mastectomies on an outpatient basis during the usual period. During lockdown, 50% of the centres reduced their hospitalization duration (25% outpatient /25% early discharge on Day 1).

326399,COVID-19: the end of lockdown what next?,2020,"Prevention is better than cure. A milestone of the anthropocene is the emergence of a series of epidemics and pandemics often characterized by the transmission of a pathogen from animals to human in the past two decades. In particular, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made a profound impact on emergency responding and policy-making in a public health crisis. Classical solutions for controlling the virus, such as travel restrictions, lockdowns, repurposed drugs and vaccines, are socially unpopular and medically limited by the fast mutation and adaptation of the virus. This is exacerbated by microbial resistance to therapeutic drugs and the slowness of vaccine development. In other words, microbial pathogens are somehow 'smarter' and faster than us, thus calling for more intelligent cures to combat future pandemics. Here, we compare therapeutics for COVID-19 such as synthetic drugs, vaccines, antibodies and phages. We present the strength and limitations of antibiotic and antiviral drugs, vaccines, and antibody-based therapeutics. We describe smarter, cheaper and preventive cures such as bacteriophages, food medicine using probiotics and prebiotics, sports, healthy diet, music, yoga, Tai Chi, dance, reading, knitting, cooking and outdoor activities. Some of these preventive cures have been intuitively developed since thousands of years ago, as illustrated by the fascinating similarity of the Chinese characters for 'music' and 'herbal medicine.'","Dai, Han; Han, Jie; Lichtfouse, Eric",Environ Chem Lett,,510

The dramatic lifestyle changes and stressors associated with this pandemic pose a threat to mental health and have the potential to exacerbate risk factors for suicide. We used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to assess Google Trends data representing searches in the United States for 18 terms related to suicide and known suicide risk factors following the emergence of COVID-19. Although the relative proportion of Google searches for suicide-related queries was lower than predicted during the early pandemic period, searches for the following queries representative of financial difficulty were dramatically elevated: ""I lost my job"" (226%; 95%CI, 120%-333%), ""laid off"" (1164%; 95%CI, 395%-1932%), ""unemployment"" (1238%; 95%CI, 560%-1915%), and ""furlough"" (5717%; 95%CI, 2769%-8665%). Searches for the Disaster Distress Helpline, which was promoted as a source of help for those impacted by COVID-19, were also remarkably elevated (3021%; 95%CI, 873%-5169%). Google searches for other queries representative of help-seeking and general mental health concerns were moderately elevated. It appears that some indices of suicidality have fallen in the United States in this early stage of the pandemic, but that COVID-19 may have caused an increase in suicide risk factors that could yield long-term increases in suicidality and suicide rates.","Halford, Emily A; Lake, Alison M; Gould, Madelyn S",PLoS One,,510
327269,Impact of COVID-19 on Patient-Initiated Discontinuation of Omalizumab in Two Academic Hospital Clinics at the University of Toronto,2020,"Coronavirus is an epidemic that spreads very quickly. For this reason, it has very devastating effects in many areas worldwide. It is vital to detect COVID-19 diseases as quickly as possible to restrain the spread of the disease. The similarity of COVID-19 disease with other lung infections makes the diagnosis difficult. In addition, the high spreading rate of COVID-19 increased the need for a fast system for the diagnosis of cases. For this purpose, interest in various computer-aided (such as CNN, DNN, etc.) deep learning models has been increased. In these models, mostly radiology images are applied to determine the positive cases. Recent studies show that, radiological images contain important information in the detection of coronavirus. In this study, a novel artificial neural network, Convolutional CapsNet for the detection of COVID-19 disease is proposed by using chest X-ray images with capsule networks. The proposed approach is designed to provide fast and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 diseases with binary classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings), and multi-class classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings, and Pneumonia). The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.24%, and 84.22% for binary class, and multi-class, respectively. It is thought that the proposed method may help physicians to diagnose COVID-19 disease and increase the diagnostic performance. In addition, we believe that the proposed method may be an alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 by providing fast screening.","Toraman, Suat; Alakus, Talha Burak; Turkoglu, Ibrahim",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,510

METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment administered online asked respondents (N = 306) to imagine the COVID-19 caseload had surged and that they were lay members of a panel tasked to allocate the final ICU bed. They had to decide which patient was more deserving for each of 14 patient pairs. Patients were characterized by 5 attributes: age, occupation, caregiver status, health prior to being infected, and prognosis. Respondents were randomly allocated to one of 7 sets of 14 pairs. Multinomial, mixed logit, and latent class models were used to model the observed choice behavior. RESULTS: A latent class model with 3 classes was found to be the most informative. Two classes valued active decision making and were slightly more likely to choose patients with caregiving responsibilities over those without. One of these classes valued prognosis most strongly, with a decreasing probability of bed allocation for those 65 y and older. The other valued both prognosis and age highly, with decreasing probability of bed allocation for those 45 y and older and a slight preference in favor of frontline health care workers. The third class preferred more random decision-making strategies. CONCLUSIONS: For two-thirds of those sampled, prognosis, age, and caregiving responsibilities were the important features when making allocation decisions, although the emphasis varies.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, FCSO quickly implemented comprehensive mitigation policies and adapted MOUD programming. Two major challenges for implementation of the MOUD program were the mandated rapid release of nonviolent pretrial individuals, many of whom were being treated with MOUD and released too quickly to conduct continuity of care planning; and establishing how to deliver physically distanced MOUD services in jail. FCSO implemented and adapted a hub-and-spoke MOUD model, developed telehealth capacity, and experimented with take-home MOUD at release to facilitate continuity-of-care as individuals re-entered the community. Experiences underscore how COVID-19 accelerated the uptake and diffusion of technology-infused OUD treatment and other innovations in criminal justice settings. Looking forward, to address both opioid use disorder and COVID-19, jails and prisons need to develop capacity to implement mitigation strategies, including universal and rapid COVID-19 testing of staff and incarcerated individuals, and be resourced to provide evidence-based addiction treatment. FCSO quickly pivoted and adapted MOUD programming because of its history of applying public health approaches to address the opioid epidemic. Utilizing public health strategies can enable prisons and jails to mitigate the harms of the co-occurring epidemics of OUD and COVID-19, both of which disproportionately affect criminal justice populations, for persons who are incarcerated and the communities to which they return.","Donelan, Christopher J; Hayes, Edmond; Potee, Ruth A; Schwartz, Levin; Evans, Elizabeth A",J Subst Abuse Treat,,510

331993,Smoking and COVID-19: a literature review of cohort studies in non-Chinese population settings,2021,"The theory of discrete-time online learning has been successfully applied in many problems that involve sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, in many applications including contractual hiring in online freelancing platforms and server allocation in cloud computing systems, the outcome of each action is observed only after a random and action-dependent time. Furthermore, as a consequence of certain ethical and economic concerns, the controller may impose deadlines on the completion of each task, and require fairness across different groups in the allocation of total time budget $B$. In order to address these applications, we consider continuous-time online learning problem with fairness considerations, and present a novel framework based on continuous-time utility maximization. We show that this formulation recovers reward-maximizing, max-min fair and proportionally fair allocation rules across different groups as special cases. We characterize the optimal offline policy, which allocates the total time between different actions in an optimally fair way (as defined by the utility function), and impose deadlines to maximize time-efficiency. In the absence of any statistical knowledge, we propose a novel online learning algorithm based on dual ascent optimization for time averages, and prove that it achieves $\tilde{O}(B^{-1/2})$ regret bound.","Cayci, Semih; Gupta, Swati; Eryilmaz, Atilla",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06852v1.pdf,510

332034,The novel use of a commercially available video-conference platform to facilitate multi-disciplinary target volume review and delineation for skull base radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is of high public health importance in Malaysia. Sabah State, located on the island of Borneo, has previously reported a particularly high burden of disease and faces unique contextual challenges compared with peninsular Malaysia. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of TB in Sabah to identify risk groups and hotspots of TB transmission. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of TB cases notified in Sabah, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2018. Using data from the state's 'myTB' notification database, we calculated the case notification rate and described trends in the epidemiology, diagnostic practices and treatment outcomes of TB in Sabah within this period. The Chi-squared test was used for determining the difference between two proportions. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2018 there were 33 193 cases of TB reported in Sabah (128 cases per 100 000 population). We identified several geographic hotspots, including districts with > 200 cases per 100 000 population per year. TB rates increased with age and were highest in older males. Children < 15 years accounted for only 4.6% of cases. Moderate or advanced disease on chest X-ray and sputum smear positivity was high (58 and 81% of cases respectively), suggesting frequent late diagnosis. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB prevalence was low (0.3% of TB cases), however, rapid diagnostic test coverage was low (1.2%) and only 18% of all cases had a positive culture result. Treatment success was 83% (range: 81-85%) in those with drug-sensitive TB and 36% (range: 25-45%) in cases of MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: Between 2012 and 2018, TB notifications in Sabah State equated to 20% of Malaysia's total TB notifications, despite Sabah representing only 10% of Malaysia's population. We found hotspots of TB in urbanised population hubs and points of migration, as well as evidence of late presentation and diagnosis. Ensuring universal health coverage and expansion of GeneXpert® coverage is recommended to reduce barriers to care and early diagnosis and treatment for TB.","Goroh, Michelle May D; Rajahram, Giri Shan; Avoi, Richard; Van Den Boogaard, Christel H A; William, Timothy; Ralph, Anna P; Lowbridge, Christopher",Infect Dis Poverty,,510

In the community, the use of face masks is increasing world-wide, but documentation for the efficacy of this remedy is lacking. This trial investigates whether the use of face masks in the community will reduce wearers' risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This study will be a two-arm, unblinded, randomised controlled trial. We will include adults (>18 years of age) without prior confirmed COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, who spend more than three hours per day outside the home with exposure to other people. A total of 6,000 participants are randomly assigned 1:1 to use face masks or not for a 30-day period during the pandemic. Participants will perform self-testing; quick test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)) (the Livzon lateral flow test) and oropharyngeal/nasal swabs for viral detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primary endpoint following the 30-day study period is the difference in the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals between the two study groups as assessed by a positive nasopharyngeal swap, a positive antibody test or a hospital-based diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: We will study whether a face mask protects the wearer of the mask against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings are expected to apply to the present pandemic and to future viral outbreaks and to provide evidence for authority recommendations across the world.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of methylprednisolone on mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia-induced severe systemic inflammation (PI-SSI). METHODS: Between 9 March and 5 May 2020 (final follow-up on 2 July 2020), a retrospective cohort study was conducted in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 PI-SSI (&#8805;2 inflammatory biomarkers [IBs]: temperature &#8805;38â, lymphocyte &#8804;800 cell/µL, C-reactive protein &#8805;100 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;300 units/L, ferritin &#8805;1000 mcg/L, D-dimer &#8805;500 ng/mL). Patients received 0.5-1.0 mg/kg of methylprednisolone for 5-10 days or standard of care. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included &#8805;2 points improvement on a 7-item WHO-scale (Day 14), transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) (Day 28) and adverse effects. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression were implemented to analyse the time to event outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (corticosteroid group n = 72, control group n = 70) were included. A significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality was shown with methylprednisolone in patients with respiratory support (HR: 0.15; 95% CI 0.03-0.71), with &#8805;3 (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.05-0.61) or &#8805;4 altered IB (HR: 0.15; 95% CI 0.04-0.54) and in patients with both respiratory support and &#8805;3 (HR: 0.11; 95% CI 0.02-0.53] or &#8805;4 altered IB (HR: 0.14; 95% CI 0.04-0.51). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Intermediate to high doses of methylprednisolone, initiated between 5 and 12 days after symptom onset, was associated with a significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and &#8805;3 o &#8805; 4 altered IB, independently of the need of respiratory support.","Climente-Martí, Mónica; Ruiz-Millo, Oreto; López-Cruz, Ian; Atienza-García, Ángel; Martínez-Moragón, Eva; Garijo-Gómez, Emilio; López-Grima, María Luisa; Zaragoza-Crespo, Rafael; Llau-Pitarch, Juan Vicente; Bautista-Rentero, Daniel; Nogueira-Coito, José Miguel; Ripollés-González, Tomás; Marco-Artal, María Antonia; Romero-Serrano, Ramón; Dolz-Sinisterra, Francisco; López-Estudillo, Rosario",Int J Clin Pract,,510

Specifically, we analyzed five public scRNA-seq pancreas datasets and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization, western blotting, and immunolocalization for ACE2 with extensive reagent validation on normal human pancreatic tissues across the lifespan, as well as those from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. These in silico and ex vivo analyses demonstrated prominent expression of ACE2 in pancreatic ductal epithelium and microvasculature, but we found rare endocrine cell expression at the mRNA level.

336321,Literature-guided recommendations for otolaryngologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: A contemporary review,2020,"Digital contact tracing is a relevant tool to control infectious disease outbreaks, including the COVID-19 epidemic. Early work evaluating digital contact tracing omitted important features and heterogeneities of real-world contact patterns influencing contagion dynamics. We fill this gap with a modeling framework informed by empirical high-resolution contact data to analyze the impact of digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate the spread in real environments. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in containing the epidemic but come at the cost of unnecessary large-scale quarantines. Policy evaluation through their efficiency and cost results in optimized solutions which only consider contacts longer than 15-20 minutes and closer than 2-3 meters to be at risk. Our results show that isolation and tracing can help control re-emerging outbreaks when some conditions are met: (i) a reduction of the reproductive number through masks and physical distance; (ii) a low-delay isolation of infected individuals; (iii) a high compliance. Finally, we observe the inefficacy of a less privacy-preserving tracing involving second order contacts. Our results may inform digital contact tracing efforts currently being implemented across several countries worldwide.","Cencetti, G; Santin, G; Longa, A; Pigani, E; Barrat, A; Cattuto, C; Lehmann, S; Salathé, M; Lepri, B",Nat Commun,,510

In this paper, we use a spatio-temporal stochastic model to explain the temporal and spatial variations in the daily number of new confirmed cases in Spain, Italy and Germany from late February 2020 to mid January 2021. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we found that the temporal trends of the epidemic in the three countries rapidly reached their peaks and slowly started to decline at the beginning of April and then increased and reached their second maximum in the middle of November. However decline and increase of the temporal trend seems to show different patterns in Spain, Italy and Germany.","Jalilian, Abdollah; Mateu, Jorge",Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess,,510

OBJECTIVE: To date, there is no selective antiviral agent for the management of pathologies associated with covid-19 and the need for an effective agent against it is essential. METHOD: In this work two home-made databases from synthetic quinolines and coumarins were virtually docked against viral proteases (3CL and PL), human cell surface proteases (TMPRSS2 and furin) and spike proteins (S1 and S2). Chloroquine, a reference drug without a clear mechanism against coronavirus was also docked on mentioned targets and the binding affinities compared with title compounds. RESULT: The best compounds of synthetic coumarins and quinolines for each target were determined. All compounds against all targets showed binding affinity between -5.80 to -8.99 kcal/mol in comparison with the FDA-approved drug, Chloroquine, with binding affinity of -5.7 to -7.98 kcal/mol. Two compounds, quinoline-1 and coumarin-24, were found to be effective on three targets - S2, TMPRSS2 and furin - simultaneously, with good predicted affinity between -7.54 to -8.85 kcal/mol. In silico ADME studies also confirmed good oral absorption for them. Furthermore, PASS prediction was calculated and coumarin-24 had higher probable activity (Pa) than probable inactivity (Pi) with acceptable protease inhibitory as well as good antiviral activity against Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza. CONCLUSION: Quinoline-1 and Coumarin-24 have the potential to be used against Covid-19. Hence these agents could be useful in combating covid-19 infection after further in vitro and in vivo studies.","Nejabat, Mojgan; Ghodsi, Razieh; Hadizadeh, Farzin",Medicinal chemistry (Hilversum.

COVID-19 is similar to the diseases caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV virologically and etiologically, but closer to influenza in epidemiology and virulence. The comparison provides a new perspective for the future of the disease control, and offers some ideas in the prevention and control management strategy. The large number of infectious people from the origin, and the highly infectious and occult nature have been two major problems, making the virus difficult to eradicate.

339687,"Disease Control, Civil Liberties, and Mass Testing - Calibrating Restrictions during the Covid-19 Pandemic",2020,"PURPOSE: Plasma membranes constitute a gathering point for lipids and signaling proteins. Lipids are known to regulate the location and activity of signaling proteins under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Membrane lipid therapies (MLTs) that gradually modify lipid content of plasma membranes have been developed to treat chronic disease; however, no MLTs have been developed to treat acute conditions such as reperfusion injury following myocardial infarction (MI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A fusogenic nanoliposome (FNL) that rapidly incorporates exogenous unsaturated lipids into endothelial cell (EC) membranes was developed to attenuate reperfusion-induced protein signaling. We hypothesized that administration of intracoronary (IC) FNL-MLT interferes with EC membrane protein signaling, leading to reduced microvascular dysfunction and infarct size (IS). METHODS: Using a myocardial ischemia/reperfusion swine model, the efficacy of FNL-MLT in reducing IS following a 60-min coronary artery occlusion was tested. Animals were randomized to receive IC Ringer's lactate solution with or without 10 mg/mL/min of FNLs for 10 min prior to reperfusion (n = 6 per group). RESULTS: The IC FNL-MLT reduced IS (25.45 ± 16.4% vs. 49.7 ± 14.1%, P < 0.02) and enhanced regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) in the ischemic zone at 15 min of reperfusion (2.13 ± 1.48 mL/min/g vs. 0.70 ± 0.43 mL/min/g, P < 0.001). The total cumulative plasma levels of the cardiac injury biomarker cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were trending downward but were not significant (999.3 ± 38.7 ng/mL vs. 1456.5 ± 64.8 ng/mL, P = 0.1867). However, plasma levels of heart-specific fatty acid binding protein (hFABP), another injury biomarker, were reduced at 2 h of reperfusion (70.3 ± 38.0 ng/mL vs. 137.3 ± 58.2 ng/mL, P = 0.0115). CONCLUSION: The IC FNL-MLT reduced IS compared to vehicle in this swine model. The FNL-MLT maybe a promising adjuvant to PCI in the treatment of acute MI.","Maldonado, Claudio; Nguyen, Mai-Dung; Bauer, Phillip; Nakamura, Shunichi; Khundmiri, Syed J; Perez-Abadia, Gustavo; Stowers, Heather L; Wu, Wen-Jian; Tang, Xian-Liang",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,,510

Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has been widely used and shown satisfying efficacies in treating all stages of COVID-19. In this study, the molecular interaction networks of different stages of COVID-19(the early, severe, critical and recovery stage) were constructed using the links among symptoms-related genes collected from TCMIP V2.0(http://www.tcmip.cn/), an integrated pharmacology network-computing platform for TCM. Following the network topological feature calculation and functional enrichment analysis, we found that the molecular targets and pathways related with the ""immune-inflammation system"" were involved throughout all the stages of COVID-19. The severe stage and the critical period of COVID-19 were occupied by a large proportion of inflammatory factors and pathways, suggesting that there might be a cytokine storm in these periods, along with respiratory disorders, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, nervous system disorders, etc. Accordingly, the therapeutic targets and pathways hit by the recommended prescriptions against COVID-19 were also aimed to regulate the balance of immune-inflammation system, nutrient absorption and metabolism, abnormal energy metabolism, the cardio-pulmonary function, nerve system function, etc., which may be related to the therapeutic effects of these prescriptions in terms of several clinical symptoms, such as expiratory dyspnea, chest tightness and shortness of breath, abdominal distension and constipation, sweating and limb cold, dizziness, and irritability, etc. The above findings reflect the integrative actions of TCM characterizing by multiple-components, multiple-targets, multiple-pathways, and multiple-effects. This study systematically constructed the molecular networks of different TCM syndromes during the development and progression of COVID-19 and uncovered the biological basis for symptomatic treatment of TCM. Furthermore, our data revealed the pharmacological mechanisms and the scientific connotation of recommended prescriptions, which may provide supports for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 using TCM.","Xu, Hai-Yu; Zhang, Yan-Qiong; Qing, Yue-Wen; Zhao, Hai-Yu; Wang, Ping; Liu, Feng",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,510

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use and in-hospital mortality in geriatric patients hospitalized for COVID-19. DESIGN: This observational retrospective study was conducted in a French geriatric department. Patients were included between March 17 and April 18, 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive 201 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods) were included. All nondeceased patients had 30 days of follow-up and no patient was lost to follow-up. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and biological data and medications were collected. In-hospital mortality of patients treated or not by ACEI/ARB was analyzed using multivariate Cox models. RESULTS: Mean age of the population was 86.3 (8.0) years, 62.7% of patients were institutionalized, 88.6% had dementia, and 53.5% had severe disability (activities of daily living [ADL] score <2). Sixty-three patients were treated with ACEI/ARB and 138 were not. Mean follow-up was 23.4 (10.0) days, 66 (33.8%) patients died after an average of 10.0 days (6.0). Lower mortality rate was observed in patients treated with ACEI/ARB compared with patients not treated with ARB or ACEI (22.2% [14] vs 37.7% [52], hazard ratio [HR] 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.97; P = .03). In a multivariate Cox regression model including age, sex, ADL score, Charlson index, renal function, dyspnea, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count, use of ACEI/ARB was significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality (HR 0.52 (0.27-0.99), P = .048). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: In very old subjects hospitalized in geriatric settings for COVID-19, mortality was significantly lower in subjects treated with ARB or ACEI before the onset of infection.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients with a first-time acute cardiovascular admission in two periods: 1) January 2-October 16, 2019 and 2) January 2-October 15, 2020. Weekly incidence rates of a first-time cardiovascular admission, overall and according to subtypes, in the two periods were calculated. The incidence rate of first-time cardiovascular admissions overall was significantly lower during the first weeks of lockdown in 2020 compared with a similar period in 2019 but increased after the gradual reopening of the Danish society. A similar trend was observed for all subgroups of cardiovascular diseases. The mortality rate among patients admitted after March 12 was not significantly different in 2020 compared with 2019 (mortality rate ratio 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.06]). CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, we observed a substantial decrease in the rate of acute cardiovascular admissions, overall and according to subtypes, during the first weeks of lockdown. However, after the gradual reopening of the Danish society, the admission rates for acute cardiovascular diseases increased and returned to rates similar to those observed in 2019.

Here we define an index, which we call the COVID-19 Burden Index, that relates the capacities of the healthcare system of a given country to treat severe and critical cases. Its value is 0 if there is no extra strain in the healthcare system, and it reaches 1.0 when the collapse is imminent. As of 23 March 2020, we show that Chile, the USA, UK, among other countries, must reduce the rate of infections right now, otherwise, in less than 7 days they could be in a catastrophic situation such as Italy, Spain and Iran.","Gonzalez, R.

To identify factors that hinder consumer awareness and the spread of eco-friendly vehicles, news articles and online postings on eco-friendly vehicles from 2006 to 2020 were collected and analyzed using text mining techniques. This study found that Korean consumers thought hybrid vehicles were fuel-efficient and quiet;however, there were concerns about battery life and safety due to poor battery performance and complaints about battery replacement. Nevertheless, consumers thought electric cars were sophisticated, luxurious, youthful, clean, and that technical problems would be resolved in the future. The inconveniences of charging and short-distance driving, the expenses and the lack of various dispute settlement measures have been shown to lower the intention to purchase electric vehicles.","Ju, Naan Kyu-Hye Lee Kim Seong Hun",Sustainability,,510

Clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with acute liver disease, and microcystin-LR was present at 3000 µg/L in a reservoir water sample and at 7100 µg/L in the rumen contents of one of the mortalities. Serum biochemistry and histological examination indicated severe liver damage consistent with microcystin toxicosis. Microscopic observation of reservoir water samples, limited to frozen or poorly stored and partially degraded samples, indicated the presence of abundant Anabaena/Dolichospermum, but the presence of other toxic cyanobacteria such as Microcystis could not be excluded. Metagenomic analysis showed the presence in these samples of a single cyanobacterium whose cpcBA, rpoB and rbcL genes indicated membership in the Anabaena/Dolichospermum genus. The sequence of a complete mcy gene cluster with homology to previously identified Anabaena mcy genes was recovered. These results emphasize the capacity for Anabaena/Dolichospermum blooms to produce lethal levels of microcystin, posing a danger to public health and livestock. Further, our findings indicate that such occurrences can occur outside the far-northern latitudes in which microcystin-producing Anabaena have typically been found.","Dreher, Theo W; Collart, Lindsay P; Mueller, Ryan S; Halsey, Kimberly H; Bildfell, Robert J; Schreder, Peter; Sobhakumari, Arya; Ferry, Rodney",Toxicon X,,510
344029,The imperative for universal healthcare to curtail the COVID-19 outbreak in the USA,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 has been devastating on a global scale. The negative conversion time (NCT) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is closely related to clinical manifestation and disease progression in COVID-19 patients. Our study aimed to predict factors associated with prolonged NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The clinical features, laboratory data and treatment outcomes of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Then univariate and multivariate analysis were used to screen out risk factors of influencing prolonged NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Thirty-two hospitalized mild/moderate COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The general clinical symptoms were cough (78.1%), fever (75%), diarrhea (68.8%), expectoration (56.3%), and nausea (37.5%). More than 40% of the patients had decreased erythrocyte, hemoglobin and leucocyte and 93.8% patients were detected in abnormalities of chest CT. The median NCT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 19.5 days (IQR: 14.25-25). Univariate analysis found fever, nausea, diarrhea and abnormalities in chest CTs were positively associated with prolonged NCT of viral RNA (P< 0.05). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model revealed that fever [Exp (B), 0.284; 95% CI, 0.114-0.707; P<0.05] and nausea [Exp (B), 0.257; 95%CI, 0.096-0.689; P<0.05] were two significant independent factors. CONCLUSIONS: Fever and nausea were two significant independent factors in prolonged NCT of viral RNA in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, which provided a useful references for disease progression and treatment of COVID-19.","Yang, Ya; Hu, Xiaogang; Xiong, Lirong; Fu, Peishu; Feng, Wei; Li, Wei; Zhang, Liwen; Sun, Fengjun",BMC Infect Dis,,510

344469,Measures to Limit COVID-19 Outbreak Effects Among Military Personnel: Preliminary Data,2020,"Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a newly described condition. It has a spectrum of presentations proposed to occur as part of a post-infectious immune response. We report the first case of PIMS-TS in a child on established anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (anti-TNF-&#945;) therapy; a 10 year-old girl with ulcerative colitis treated with infliximab. The patient had 6-weeks of daily fever with mucocutaneous, gastrointestinal, renal and hematologic involvement. Biomarkers of hyperinflammation were present including: hyperferritinaemia (up to 691 µ/L; normal 15-80 µg/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) (>100mg/L for >10 days, normal 0-5 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) consistently >100mm/hr (normal 0-15 mm/hr), raised white cell count with neutrophilia, elevated D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), anaemia and Mott cells on bone marrow analysis. Extensive investigations for alternative diagnoses for pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) were negative. The condition was refractory to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but improved within 24hrs of high dose methylprednisolone. Infliximab treatment followed and the patient has remained well at follow up. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Current series report such negative findings in up to half of cases. The patient experienced a milder clinical phenotype without cardiac involvement, shock or organ failure. Accepting the wide spectrum of PIMS-TS presentations, it is possible that prior anti-TNF-&#945; therapy may have attenuated the disease course. Given the uncertainty around therapeutic strategies for PIMS-TS this case supports the need for further investigation into continuing infliximab as a treatment option for the condition.","Meredith, Joseph; Khedim, Cher-Antonia; Henderson, Paul; Wilson, David C; Russell, Richard K",J. crohns. colitis,,510
344501,Social determinants of COVID-19 incidence and outcomes: A rapid review,2021,"Purpose: To report a novel, telemedicine-friendly, smartphone-based, wireless anterior segment device with instant photo-documentation ability in the COVID-19 era. Methods: Anterior Imaging Module (AIM) was constructed based on a 50/50 beam splitter design, to match the magnification drum optics of slit-lamps with a three-step or higher level of magnification. The design fills the smartphone sensor fully at the lowest magnification and matches the fixed focus of the slit-lamp. It comes with a smartphone for instant photo-documentation, an in-built software application for data-management and secure HIPAA compliant cloud storage, and a Bluetooth trigger for a one-tap image capture. The construction of the device is explained, and the optical resolution measured using U.S. air-force resolution test. AIM's performance was characterized with traceability to internationally relevant performance standards for digital slit-lamps after image quality assessment through a pilot study. Results: Clinically useful anterior segment images were obtained with both diffuse and slit illumination at different magnification settings with the highest magnification (40X) resolution of 359 lines per cm and the lowest magnification (16X) resolution of 113 lines per cm. Conclusion: AIM is a novel, wireless, telemedicine-enabled design that digitizes existing, analog slit lamps with at least three-step magnification. The settings ensure the focus is determined purely by the position of the slit-lamp. Hence, the image viewed and captured on the smartphone is exactly what the clinician sees through the eyepiece. This helps in maintaining distance from the patient in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well.","Dutt, Sreetama; Vadivel, Siva S; Nagarajan, Shanmuganathan; Galagali, Amrutha; Christy, Josephine S; Sivaraman, Anand; Rao, Divya Parthasarathy",Indian J Ophthalmol,,510
344891,The Development of a Surgical Oncology Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that patients with comorbidities and novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may have poor survival outcomes. However, the risk of these coexisting medical conditions in severe and non-severe cases has not been systematically reported. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to estimate the association of chronic comorbidities in severe and non-severe cases. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database (CQVIP) from the inception dates to April 1, 2020, to identify cohort studies assessing comorbidity and risk of adverse outcome. Either a fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate the overall combined risk estimates. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies involving 3286 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Overall, compared with the patients with non-severe cases, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases in patients with severe cases were 2.79 (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 1.66-4.69), 1.64 (95% CI: 2.30-1.08), 1.79 (95% CI: 1.08-2.96), 3.92 (95% CI: 2.45-6.28), and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.26-3.12), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports the finding that chronic comorbidities may contribute to severe outcome in patients with COVID-19. According to the findings of the present study, old age and 2 or more comorbidities are significantly impactful to COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients in China.","Cheng, Sixiang; Zhao, Yuxin; Wang, Fenxiao; Chen, Yan; Kaminga, Atipatsa Chiwanda; Xu, Huilan",Medicine (Baltimore),,510

As of the date of this writing, a total of 116 M cases has been diagnosed worldwide leading to 2.5 M deaths. The number of mortalities is directly correlated with the rise of innate immune cells (especially macrophages) in the lungs that secrete inflammatory cytokines (IL-1ß and IL-6) leading to the development of ""Cytokine Storm Syndrome"" (CSS), multi-organ-failure and death. Given that currently the treatment of this condition is rare and release of effective vaccine might be months away, here, we review the plants and their pharmacologically active-compounds as potential phytopharmaceuticals for the virus induced inflammatory response. Experimental validation of the effectiveness of these natural compounds to prevent or reduce the cytokine storm might be beneficial as an adjunct treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","Sapra, Leena; Bhardwaj, Asha; Azam, Zaffar; Madhry, Deekhsha; Verma, Bhupendra; Rathore, Sumit; Srivastava, Rupesh K",Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),,510
344988,The danger of neglecting melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: No trials have tested multifaceted mental health interventions recommended by public health organisations during COVID-19. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program on anxiety symptoms and other mental health outcomes among people vulnerable during COVID-19 owing to a pre-existing medical condition. Methods: The SPIN-CHAT Trial was a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, partially nested, randomised, controlled trial (1:1 allocation to intervention or waitlist). Eligible participants with systemic sclerosis were recruited from the international SPIN COVID-19 Cohort. SPIN COVID-19 Cohort participants were eligible for the trial if they completed baseline measures and had at least mild anxiety symptoms, had not tested positive for COVID-19, and were not currently receiving mental health counselling. SPIN-CHAT is a 4-week (3 sessions per week) videoconference-based group intervention that provided education and practice with mental health coping strategies, and provided social support to reduce isolation. Groups included 6-10 participants. The primary outcome analysed in the intention-to-treat population was anxiety symptoms (PROMIS Anxiety 4a version 1.0) immediately post-intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04335279 and is complete. Findings: Of participants who completed baseline measures between April 9, 2020, and April 27, 2020, 560 participants were eligible and 172 participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=86) or waitlist (n=86). Mean age was 55·0 years (SD 11·4 years), 162 (94%) were women, and 136 (79%) identified as White. In intention-to-treat analyses, the intervention did not significantly reduce anxiety symptoms post-intervention (-1·57 points, 95% CI -3·59 to 0·45; standardised mean difference [SMD] -0·22 points) but reduced symptoms 6 weeks later (-2·36 points, 95% CI -4·56 to -0·16; SMD -0·31). Depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks post-intervention (-1·64 points, 95% CI -2·91 to -0·37; SMD -0·31); no other secondary outcomes were significant. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation: The intervention did not significantly improve anxiety symptoms or other mental health outcomes post-intervention. However, anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks later, potentially capturing the time it took for new skills and social support between intervention participants to affect mental health. Multi-faceted interventions such as SPIN-CHAT have potential to address mental health needs in vulnerable groups during COVID-19, yet uncertainty remains about effectiveness.

345042,CORR® International-Asia-Pacific: Closing the Loop-Focus Early and Often on Your Patients' Postsurgical Rehabilitation Program,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death. Family members often witness the event and attempt resuscitation. The physiological and psychological impact of a loved one's death, witnessed or unwitnessed, can be significant and long-lasting. However, little is known about the care needs of families during the cardiac arrest care of a loved one. This scoping review protocol was designed with, and will be performed in partnership with, persons with lived experience of sudden cardiac arrest (survivors and family members of survivors and nonsurvivors alike). METHODS: The review will be performed in accordance with accepted methods such as the Arksey and O'Malley methodology framework and the Levac extension. We will search multiple databases, and Google Scholar for both qualitative and quantitative scientific literature. Articles will be screened, extracted, and analyzed by a team with lived experience of cardiac arrest. Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data extraction independently. A descriptive overview, tabular and/or graphical summaries, and a directed content analysis will be carried out on extracted data. DISCUSSION: This protocol outlines a planned literature review to systematically examine the nature of existing evidence to describe what the care needs of families experiencing the cardiac arrest of a loved one are. Such evidence will contribute to the development of strategies to meet identified care needs. Persons with lived experience participated in the creation of this protocol, and they will also participate in the execution of this review as partners and coinvestigators, not as research subjects or participants. The results of the scoping review will be disseminated upon completion of the work described in this protocol.","Douma, Matthew J; Ali, Samina; Bone, Allison; Dainty, Katie N; Dennett, Liz; Smith, Katherine E; Frazer, Kate; Kroll, Thilo",,,510

During this they are partly hidden from the innate immune responses although inflammatory consequences of viral replication still occur. We propose that anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins may not only restrict viral replication but also prevent inflammatory responses in the lungs and other vital organs that are known to be part of the immuno-pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The combination of anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins with interferons may lead to the clearance of viruses inside growth-restricted infected cells.

345749,Research in radiation oncology and the Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic had an unexpected impact on cardiovascular emergencies, particularly STEMI. The France PCI registry and other studies around the world have highlighted a significant decrease in myocardial infarctions arriving at hospital. This decrease is mainly related to patients' fear of coming to the hospital and being contaminated. Although the STEMI revascularisation time targets (<120min) are often difficult to achieve in normal times, they were almost impossible to achieve in periods of lockdown because of the many obstacles. Longer delays and longer total ischemic time have led to excess mortality, especially in the regions most affected by the epidemic. Recommendations for the management of STEMI during the COVID-19 period have thus been issued by the scientific societies. STEMI in patients with COVID-19 often have an uncommon clinical presentation, and the absence of coronary obstruction on angiography is frequent. Their prognosis is very poor. Only public information campaigns and an organisation adapted to the management of coronary emergencies during epidemics can try to limit their effects and avoid aggravating an already fragile health situation in the future.","Hakim, R; Motreff, P; Rangé, G",Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris),,510

The growth of coronavirus in the presence inhibitor tunicamycin resulted in the production of spikeless, non-infectious virions which were devoid of S protein. We concluded that tunicamycin inhibits E2, S, and M glycoproteins of coronaviruses. Tunicamycin is also diminished glycosylation of PTMs such as HE, and 8 ab of SARS-CoV.

We used results from formative interviews to construct a survey and collected data from 420 gay men. Results showed several factors that were associated with PrEP uptake among gay men. Specifically, the lack of access to an LGBTQ-friendly healthcare provider(s) and lack of English fluency had significant main effects on PrEP uptake behavior, while lack of access to a healthcare provider and lack of healthcare system knowledge were significant moderators of the intention-behavior relationship.

348117,Management strategies for patients with autoimmune diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: A perspective from China,2020,"Caregiver mental health is crucial to the wellbeing of children. This is most apparent when caregivers face high levels of stress or life adversity. To study this phenomenon in the current global context, this study examined the relation between stress/disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health of female and male caregivers. Pre-pandemic childhood adversity was considered as a moderator of this association. A multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%; United States, 19%; Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) was recruited in May 2020, of whom 348 female and 143 male caregivers of 5-18 year-old children provided data on the constructs of interest. At this time, caregivers reported on their history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and COVID stress/disruption. About two months later (July 2020) caregiver mental health was evaluated. We examined differences between female and male caregivers on ACEs, COVID stress/disruption, and mental health (distress, anxiety, substance use, and posttraumatic stress). Main and interactive effects of ACEs and COVID stress/disruption on each mental health outcome were examined. Female caregivers reported higher COVID stress/disruption, more ACEs, and greater distress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms compared to male caregivers. Among female caregivers, higher COVID stress/disruption and more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) independently predicted all mental health outcomes, consistent with a stress accumulation model. Among male caregivers, a pattern of interactions between COVID stress/disruption and ACEs suggested that the effects of COVID stress/disruption on mental health was stronger for those with higher ACEs, especially for substance use, consistent with a stress sensitization model. Higher levels of stress and mental health difficulties among female caregivers suggests a disproportionate burden due to pandemic-related disruption compared to male caregivers. Findings speak to the disparate effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of female compared to male caregivers, and the role of pre-existing vulnerabilities in shaping current adaptation.","Wade, Mark; Prime, Heather; Johnson, Dylan; May, Shealyn S; Jenkins, Jennifer M; Browne, Dillon T",Soc Sci Med,,510

However, the impact of blood glucose (BG) control on the degree of required medical interventions and on mortality in patients with COVID-19 and T2D remains uncertain. Thus, we performed a retrospective, multi-centered study of 7,337 cases of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China, among which 952 had pre-existing T2D. We found that subjects with T2D required more medical interventions and had a significantly higher mortality (7.8% versus 2.7%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49) and multiple organ injury than the non-diabetic individuals. Further, we found that well-controlled BG (glycemic variability within 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) was associated with markedly lower mortality compared to individuals with poorly controlled BG (upper limit of glycemic variability exceeding 10.0 mmol/L) (adjusted HR, 0.14) during hospitalization. These findings provide clinical evidence correlating improved glycemic control with better outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D.","Zhu, Lihua; She, Zhi-Gang; Cheng, Xu; Qin, Juan-Juan; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Cai, Jingjing; Lei, Fang; Wang, Haitao; Xie, Jing; Wang, Wenxin; Li, Haomiao; Zhang, Peng; Song, Xiaohui; Chen, Xi; Xiang, Mei; Zhang, Chaozheng; Bai, Liangjie; Xiang, Da; Chen, Ming-Ming; Liu, Yanqiong; Yan, Youqin; Liu, Mingyu; Mao, Weiming; Zou, Jinjing; Liu, Liming; Chen, Guohua; Luo, Pengcheng; Xiao, Bing; Zhang, Changjiang; Zhang, Zixiong; Lu, Zhigang; Wang, Junhai; Lu, Haofeng; Xia, Xigang; Wang, Daihong; Liao, Xiaofeng; Peng, Gang; Ye, Ping; Yang, Jun; Yuan, Yufeng; Huang, Xiaodong; Guo, Jiao; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Li, Hongliang",Cell Metab,,510

We carried out sex-balanced sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and outpatients, uninfected close contacts, and healthy controls for 36-color flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing. Our results revealed a pronounced reduction of circulating mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in infected females. Integration of published COVID-19 airway tissue datasets implicate that this reduction represented a major wave of MAIT cell extravasation during early infection in females. Moreover, female MAIT cells possessed an immunologically active gene signature, whereas male counterparts were pro-apoptotic. Collectively, our findings uncover a female-specific protective MAIT profile, potentially shedding light on reduced COVID-19 susceptibility in females.","Yu, Chen; Littleton, Sejiro; Giroux, Nicholas S; Mathew, Rose; Ding, Shengli; Kalnitsky, Joan; Yang, Yuchen; Petzold, Elizabeth; Chung, Hong A; Rivera, Grecia O; Rotstein, Tomer; Xi, Rui; Ko, Emily R; Tsalik, Ephraim L; Sempowski, Gregory D; Denny, Thomas N; Burke, Thomas W; McClain, Micah T; Woods, Christopher W; Shen, Xiling; Saban, Daniel R",,,510
349188,COVID-19 and tobacco use: a review,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To establish, amongst Irish rheumatic musculoskeletal disease (RMD) patients, rates of COVID-19 symptoms and positive tests, DMARD adherence and attitudes to virtual clinics. METHODS: An online survey assessing COVID-19 status, RMD diagnoses, adherence and information sources was disseminated via the Arthritis Ireland website and social media channels. RESULTS: There were 1381 respondents with 74.8% on immunosuppressive medication. Symptoms of COVID-19 were reported by 3.7% of respondents of which 0.46% tested positive, consistent with the general Irish population. The frequency of COVID-19 symptoms was higher for respondents with spondyloarthropathy [odds ratio (OR) 2.06, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.70] and lower in those on immunosuppressive medication (OR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.88), and those compliant with health authority (HSE) guidance (OR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.89). Adherence to RMD medications was reported in 84.1%, with 57.1% using health authority guidelines for information on medication use. Importantly, adherence rates were higher amongst those who cited guidelines (89.3% vs 79.9%, P <0.001), and conversely lower in those with COVID-19 symptoms (64.0% vs 85.1%, P =0.009). Finally, the use of virtual clinics was supported by 70.4% of respondents. CONCLUSION: The rate of COVID-19 positivity in RMD patients was similar to the general population. COVID-19 symptoms were lower amongst respondents on immunosuppressive medication and those adherent to medication guidelines. Respondents were supportive of HSE advice and virtual clinics.","Murray, Kieran; Quinn, Sean; Turk, Matthew; O039,; Rourke, Anna; Molloy, Eamonn; Neill, Lorraine; Mongey, Ann Barbara; Fearon, Ursula; Veale, Douglas J",Rheumatology (Oxford),,510

Aim: To describe an epidemiological surveillance strategy to detect symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection and early case detection among healthcare personnel at a university hospital. Patients and Methods: We assessed 209 healthcare workers reporting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in a telephone counseling system. After a structured evaluation, the suggestions ranged from having a SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR test, consulting in the emergency room or at outpatient clinic or returning to work. Results: In 61% of assessed workers a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR was requested and 28 (22%) were positive. In a multivariate analysis, the clinical variables associated with a positive PCR test were the presence of fever, sudden loss of smell or taste, and a history of contact with a COVID-19 positive case.

351319,Covid-19 message: Necessity of attention to passive defense in emerging diseases,2021,"Since the outbreak of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there has been an increasing need for treatment to decrease morbidity and mortality of patients presenting with severe disease symptoms. There has been increasing evidence to suggest that the pathophysiological basis is a severe inflammatory response that resembles the cytokine release syndrome. Current strategies to counteract this involve modifiers of the immune response such as interleukin (IL)-6 receptor blockers and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. An example of a JAK inhibitor is baricitinib. In this case, we present a 17-year-old female admitted with severe COVID-19 symptoms, who was placed on high-flow nasal cannula and started on azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, which were standard of care at the time. Due to the worsening of symptoms, she was given baricitinib for compassionate use. There was a rapid improvement in clinical and imaging findings, and the patient was discharged from the hospital within 8 days of admission. This study is fascinating because there are very limited studies published on the benefits of baricitinib in managing patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 especially in the pediatric population, and the rapidity in recovery time was remarkable.","Atemnkeng, F.; Alataby, H.; Demirjian, J.; Kenne, F.

These challenges are met by incorporating a recent augmentation solution called SnapMix, by a new patch embedding technique, and by performing a test-time stability analysis. The three techniques are complementary and are all based on utilizing the heatmaps produced by the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) explainability method.

However, the injury mechanism of H2S exposure to lung remains poorly understood. In this study, pig lung was selected as a H2S exposure model for the first time. We first examined the histological damage and the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes of lung in pigs exposed to H2S. Histopathology change and increased mRNA level of pro-inflammatory cytokines demonstrated that H2S exposure indeed induced inflammatory injury in the porcine lung. We then performed TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis to probe the injury molecular mechanism. The proteomics results showed that 526 proteins have significant changes in abundance between control and H2S treated swine. Further validation analysis of some H2S responsive proteins using both Real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting demonstrated that proteomics data are reliable. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these proteins were involved in antigen processing and presentation, complement and coagulation cascade, IL-17 signaling pathway, ferroptosis and necroptosis. Our data suggest that H2S exposure induced immune suppression, inflammatory response and cell death. These findings provide a new insight into the complexity mechanisms of H2S induced lung injury, and offer therapeutic potential as drug targets with a view towards curing the intoxication caused by H2S.","Liu, Zhen; Fu, Qin; Tang, Shanlong; Xie, Yanjiao; Meng, Qingshi; Tang, Xiangfang; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Hongfu; Schroyen, Martine",Environ Res,,510

However, the susceptibility of individuals to be impacted by the pandemic is variable suggesting potential influences of specific factors related to participants' demographics, attitudes, and practices. OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with psychological symptoms related to the effects of the first wave of pandemic in a multi-country cohort of internet users. METHODS: This study anonymously screened 13,332 internet users worldwide for acute psychological symptoms related to COVID-19 pandemic from March 29th to April 14th, 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic amidst strict lockdown conditions. A total of n=12,817 responses were considered valid. n=1077 participants from Europe were screened a second time during May 15th to May 30th to ascertain the presence of psychological effects after the ease down of restrictions. RESULTS: Female gender, pre-existing psychiatric condition, and prior exposure to trauma were identified as notable factors associated with increased psychological symptoms during the first wave of COVID-19 (P <.001). The same factors, in addition to being related to someone who demised due to COVID-19 and using social media more than usual, were associated with persistence of psychological disturbances in the limited second assessment of European participants after the restrictions had relatively eased (P <.001). Optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends like usual, positive prediction about COVID-19, and daily exercise were related to fewer psychological symptoms in both assessments (P <.001).

355639,Patient Opinions on Care Received in Virtual Clinics Compared to A Face-To-Face Clinic Appointments in General Surgery During The COVID-19 Pandemic. A Retrospective Patient Feedback Study,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat presenting health, economic, and social challenges that continue to escalate. Metapopulation epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intracounty environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different regions. To address this issue, we develop a human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behaviors. This modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and business foot traffic, race and ethnicity, and age structure are then investigated. The results reveal that, in a college town (Dane County), the most important heterogeneity is age structure, while, in a large city area (Milwaukee County), racial and ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate to various reopening policies, which suggests that policy makers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and reopening.","Hou, Xiao; Gao, Song; Li, Qin; Kang, Yuhao; Chen, Nan; Chen, Kaiping; Rao, Jinmeng; Ellenberg, Jordan S; Patz, Jonathan A",Proc.

356568,Guidance for nebulization during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the characteristics and predictors of death in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Spain. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed of the first consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time PCR assay in 127 Spanish centres until 17 March 2020. The follow-up censoring date was 17 April 2020. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and complications data. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with death. RESULTS: Of the 4035 patients, male subjects accounted for 2433 (61.0%) of 3987, the median age was 70 years and 2539 (73.8%) of 3439 had one or more comorbidity. The most common symptoms were a history of fever, cough, malaise and dyspnoea. During hospitalization, 1255 (31.5%) of 3979 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 736 (18.5%) of 3988 were admitted to intensive care units and 619 (15.5%) of 3992 underwent mechanical ventilation. Virus- or host-targeted medications included lopinavir/ritonavir (2820/4005, 70.4%), hydroxychloroquine (2618/3995, 65.5%), interferon beta (1153/3950, 29.2%), corticosteroids (1109/3965, 28.0%) and tocilizumab (373/3951, 9.4%). Overall, 1131 (28%) of 4035 patients died. Mortality increased with age (85.6% occurring in older than 65 years). Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them including advanced age, liver cirrhosis, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of C-reactive protein and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide comprehensive information about characteristics and complications of severe COVID-19, and may help clinicians identify patients at a higher risk of death.","Berenguer, Juan; Ryan, Pablo; Rodríguez-Baño, Jesús; Jarrín, Inmaculada; Carratalà, Jordi; Pachón, Jerónimo; Yllescas, María; Arriba, José Ramón",Clin Microbiol Infect,,510
356715,Behavioral interventions in acute COVID-19 recovery: A new opportunity for integrated care,2020,"CONTEXT: The emergence and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed an unprecedented threat to both societies and economies. The dairy sector is an example of the challenges that food supply chains have faced due to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide primary evidence of the immediate effects of COVID-19 on the global dairy sector, particularly focusing on the outcome of the implemented response mechanisms, and the potential medium and long-term implications of the pandemic on the sector. METHODS: We employed a longitudinal qualitative analysis framework that combines the use of questionnaires, media-search, focus-group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and secondary evidence reviews. Information was gathered at two points in time: three months after the beginning of the outbreak and one year later. We applied this framework in five different geographical regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the pandemic has been perceived as a series of episodes affecting the sector from both demand and supply sides. These waves have impacted the sector differently depending on regions and countries’ trade profiles, relative resource scarcity, per capita income, and market structure. Although in one year the sector has mostly recovered from the shock, the analysis concludes that the pandemic has accelerated on-going structural changes taking place in the dairy sector. SIGNIFICANCE: The study expands existing knowledge about the effects of the pandemic on the dairy sector and adds to the newly evolving literature about the medium and long-term effects of the COVID-19 on food systems across the globe. Despite the preliminary nature of the results, they provide important insights to inform sectorial policy discussions. © 2021 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations","Acosta, A.; McCorriston, S.; Nicolli, F.; Venturelli, E.; Aratchilage, U.

In this preclinical study, we investigated whether the combination of HCQ+AZI would be compatible with the therapeutic induction of anticancer immune responses. For this, we used doses of HCQ and AZI that affect whole-body physiology (as indicated by a partial blockade in cardiac and hepatic autophagic flux for HCQ and a reduction in body weight for AZI), showing that their combined administration did not interfere with tumor growth control induced by the immunogenic cell death inducer oxaliplatin. Moreover, the HCQ+AZI combination did not affect the capacity of a curative regimen (cisplatin + crizotinib + PD-1 blockade) to eradicate established orthotopic lung cancers in mice. In conclusion, it appears that HCQ+AZI does not interfere with the therapeutic induction of therapeutic anticancer immune responses.","Liu, Peng; Zhao, Liwei; Ferrere, Gladys; Alves-Costa-Silva, Carolina; Ly, Pierre; Wu, Qi; Tian, Ai-Ling; Derosa, Lisa; Zitvogel, Laurence; Kepp, Oliver; Kroemer, Guido",OncoImmunology,,510

359205,Enhanced Draping for Airway Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"AIM: To assess whether the application of a non-invasive tool, such as ratio of oxygen saturation (ROX) index, during triage can identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DESIGN: A multi-centre, observational, retrospective study. METHODS: Only COVID-19 positive patients who required an emergency department evaluation for dyspnoea were considered. The primary objective of the study was to compare the ROX value obtained during triage with the medical diagnosis of ARDS and intubation in 72 h of the triage evaluation. The ROX index value was also compared with objective outcomes, such as the pressure of arterial O2 (PaO2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) ratio and the lung parenchyma volume involved in COVID-19-related inflammatory processes, based on 3D reconstructions of chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: During the study period, from 20 March 2020 until 31 May 2020, a total of 273 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The predictive ability of ROX for the risk of developing ARDS in 72 h after triage evaluation was associated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.845 (0.797-0.892, p < 0.001), whereas the AUROC value was 0.727 (0.634-0.821, p < 0.001) for the risk of intubation. ROX values were strongly correlated with PaO2 /FiO2 values (r = 0.650, p < 0.001), decreased ROX values were associated with increased percentages of lung involvement based on 3D CT reconstruction (r = -0.371, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ROX index showed a good ability to identify triage patients at high evolutionary risk. Correlations with objective but more invasive indicators (PaO2 /FiO2 and CT) confirmed the important role of ROX in identifying COVID-19 patients with extensive pathological processes. IMPACT: During the difficult triage evaluation of COVID-19 patients, the ROX index can help the nurse to identify the real severity of the patient. The triage systems could integrate the ROX in the rapid patient assessment to stratify patients more accurately.","Zaboli, Arian; Ausserhofer, Dietmar; Pfeifer, Norbert; Sibilio, Serena; Tezza, Giovanna; Ciccariello, Laura; Turcato, Gianni",J Adv Nurs,,510

Similar measures are known risk factors for psychological disturbances in the general population; still, little is known about their impact on pregnant women's mental health during COVID-19 pandemic. The cross-sectional, web-based, national survey ""COVID-19 related Anxiety and StreSs in prEgnancy, poSt-partum and breaStfeeding"" (COVID-ASSESS) was conducted during the first month of full ""lockdown"" in Italy. Participants were recruited via social networks with a snowball technique. The questionnaire was specifically developed to examine COVID-19 concerns and included the psychometric tests National Stressful Events Survey (NSESSS) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to explore the association of the concern, anxiety and PTSD symptoms with age, gestational weeks, parity, days of ""lockdown"", assisted reproductive technology use, psychopathological history, and previous perinatal losses. Out of 1015 pregnant women reached, 737 (72.6%) fully answered the questionnaire; no woman reported a COVID-19 infection. Median age was 34.4 years [quartiles 31.7, 37.2], median days in ""lockdown"" were 13.1 [11.0, 17.0], median gestational weeks were 27.8 [19.8, 34.0]. Clinically significant PTSD symptoms were present in 75 women (10.2%, NSESSS cutoff 24) and clinically significant anxiety symptoms were present in 160 women (21.7%, STAI-Y1 cutoff 50). Women were particularly worried about the health of their baby and of their elderly relatives, as well as of the possible impact of pandemic in the future of society. Previous anxiety predicted higher concern and PTSD symptoms; previous depression and anxiety were independently associated with current PTSD symptoms.","Ravaldi, Claudia; Ricca, Valdo; Wilson, Alyce; Homer, Caroline; Vannacci, Alfredo",,,510

360845,Risk for depressive symptoms among hospitalized women in high-risk pregnancy units during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"The intensity and the magnitude of saliva cortisol responses were investigated during the first 48 h following birth in newborn dairy calves which underwent normal (eutocic, EUT, n = 88) and difficult (dystocic, DYS, n = 70) calvings. The effects of parity and body condition of the dam, the duration of parturition, the time spent licking the calf, the sex and birth weight of the calf were also analyzed. Neonatal salivary cortisol concentrations were influenced neither by factors related to the dam (parity, body condition) nor the calf (sex, birth weight). The duration of parturition and the time spent licking the calf also had no effect on salivary cortisol levels. Salivary cortisol concentrations increased rapidly after delivery in both groups to reach their peak levels at 45 and 60 min after delivery in EUT and DYS calves, respectively supporting that the birth process means considerable stress for calves and the immediate postnatal period also appears to be stressful for newborn calves. DYS calves exhibited higher salivary cortisol concentrations compared to EUT ones for 0 (P = 0.022), 15 (P = 0.016), 30 (P = 0.007), 45 (P = 0.003), 60 (P = 0.001) and 120 min (P = 0.001), and for 24 h (P = 0.040), respectively. Peak levels of salivary cortisol and the cortisol release into saliva calculated as AUC were higher in DYS than in EUT calves for the 48-h of the sampling period (P = 0.009 and P = 0.003, respectively). The greater magnitude of saliva cortisol levels in DYS calves compared to EUT ones suggest that difficult parturition means severe stress for bovine neonates and salivary cortisol could be an opportunity for non-invasive assessment of stress during the early neonatal period in cattle.","Kovács, Levente; Kézér, Fruzsina Luca; Bodó, Szilárd; Ruff, Ferenc; Palme, Rupert; Szenci, Ottó",Sci Rep,,510

In spite of having 96% sequence identity among Mpros from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2; the inhibitors used to block the activity of SARS-CoV-1 Mpro so far, were found to have differential inhibitory effect on Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. The possible reason could be due to the difference of few amino acids among the peptidases. Since, overall 3-D crystallographic structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar and mapping a subtle structural variation is seemingly impossible. Hence, we have attempted to study a structural comparison of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in apo and inhibitor bound states using protein structure network (PSN) based approach at contacts level. The comparative PSNs analysis of apo Mpros from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 uncovers small but significant local changes occurring near the active site region and distributed throughout the structure. Additionally, we have shown how inhibitor binding perturbs the PSG and the communication pathways in Mpros . Moreover, we have also investigated the network connectivity on the quaternary structure of Mpro and identified critical residue pairs for complex formation using three centrality measurement parameters along with the modularity analysis. Taken together, these results on the comparative PSN provide an insight into conformational changes that may be used as an additional guidance towards specific drug development.","Lata, Surabhi; Akif, Mohd",Proteins,,510
361998,Simulation in neurosurgical education during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,2020,"Covid-19 is a major pandemic facing the world today caused by SARS-CoV-2 which has implications on our understanding of infectious diseases. Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies.","Dhar, Debojyoti; Mohanty, Abhishek",Virus Res,,510

Personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks and gloves is needed to avoid transmission. Adverse skin reactions associated with PPE have been described, but there is no information regarding objective measures to assess skin impairment related to PPE. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of using facial mask and nitrile gloves on epidermal barrier function and skin homeostasis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Thirty-four health care workers wearing nitrile gloves and a mask for 2 hours were included. Transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration, erythema, and temperature were measured. RESULTS: Transepidermal water loss (31.11 vs 14.24 g·m-2·h-1), temperature (33.29°C vs 32.57°C), and erythema were significantly greater at the area covered by gloves compared with the noncovered area. Transepidermal water loss (22.82 vs 13.69 g·m-2·h-1), temperature, and erythema (411.43 vs 335.52 arbitrary units) were significantly increased at the area covered by mask, whereas stratum corneum hydration was lower. Transepidermal water loss was greater at the area covered by a surgical mask than at a filtering respirator mask coded filtering facepiece 2 (27.09 vs 18.02 g·m-2·h-1, P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Skin homeostasis and epidermal barrier function may be impaired by gloves and mask use.

Since it is a novel virus, research continues to update the possible therapeutic targets when new evidence regarding COVID-19 are gathered. This article presents an evidence-based hypothesis that activating the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is a potential target for COVID-19. Interferons (IFNs) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity including against SARS-CoV-2. Induction of HO-1 and increase in the heme catabolism end-product confer antiviral activity. IFN activation results in inhibition of viral replication in various viral infections. COVID-19 induced inflammation as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulopathies are now known major causes of mortality. A protective role of HO-1 induction in inflammation, inflammation-induced coagulation, and ARDS has been reported. Based on an association of HO-1 promoter polymorphisms and disease severity, we propose an evaluation of the status of these polymorphisms in COVID-19 patients who become severely ill. If an association is established, it might be helpful in identifying patients at high risk. Hence, we hypothesize that HO-1 pathway activation could be a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 and associated complications.","Singh, Devendra; Wasan, Himika; Reeta, K H",Free Radic Biol Med,,510

The role of virtual platforms is discussed with respect to fostering new collaborations, scheduling research meetings, and holding conferences such that scientific collaboration and exchange of ideas can continue. Our hope is for these recommendations to serve as a valuable resource for investigators in the neurosciences and other research disciplines for current and future research disruptions.","Vlisides, Phillip E; Vogt, Keith M; Pal, Dinesh; Schnell, Eric; Armstead, William M; Brambrink, Ansgar M; Kuo, Philip; Nelson, Priscilla; Vacas, Susana; Goettel, Nicolai; Aglio, Linda S; Farag, Ehab; Gorji, Reza; García, Paul S; Koerner, Ines P",J Neurosurg Anesthesiol,,510
364850,Caution of the Etiology of Testicular Swelling in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic-It May Not Be Testicular Torsion,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, was first identified after a cluster of cases in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Whether vertical transmission or placental pathology might occur following maternal infection during pregnancy remains unknown. This review aimed to summarise all studies that examined the placenta or neonates following infection with SARS-CoV-2, or closely related highly pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1, or the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)). Structured literature searches found 50 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty studies reported placental histopathology findings in third trimester placentas following maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using the Amsterdam Consensus criteria to categorise the histopathology results, evidence of both fetal vascular malperfusion (35.3% of cases; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 27.7-43.0%) and maternal vascular malperfusion (46% of cases; 95% CI 38.0-54.0%) were reported, along with evidence of inflammation in the placentas (villitis 8.7% cases, intervillositis 5.3% of cases, chorioamnionitis 6% of cases). The placental pathologies observed in SARS-CoV-2 were consistent with findings following maternal SARS-CoV-1 infection. Of those tested, a minority of neonates (2%) and placental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (21%). Limited conclusions can be drawn about the effect of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on placental pathology as most lack control groups and the majority of reports followed third trimester infection. Collaboration to maximise the number of samples examined will increase the reliability and generalisability of findings. A better understanding of the association between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and placental pathology will inform maternity care during the coronavirus pandemic.","Sharps, Megan C; Hayes, Dexter J L; Lee, Stacey; Zou, Zhiyong; Brady, Chloe A; Almoghrabi, Yousef; Kerby, Alan; Tamber, Kajal K; Jones, Carolyn J; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M; Heazell, Alexander E P",Placenta,,510
364971,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for COVID-19-associated severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and risk of thrombosis,2020,"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading throughout the world. Aerosol is a potential transmission route. We conducted the quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to evaluate the aerosol transmission risk by using the South China Seafood Market as an example. The key processes were integrated, including viral shedding, dispersion, deposition in air, biologic decay, lung deposition, and the infection risk based on the dose-response model. The available hospital bed for COVID-19 treatment per capita (1.17 × 10-3) in Wuhan was adopted as a reference for manageable risk. The median risk of a customer to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection via the aerosol route after 1 h of exposure in the market with one infected shopkeeper was about 2.23 × 10-5 (95% confidence interval: 1.90 × 10-6 to 2.34 × 10-4). The upper bound could increase and become close to the manageable risk with multiple infected shopkeepers. More detailed risk assessment should be conducted in poorly ventilated markets with multiple infected cases. The uncertainties were mainly due to the limited information on the dose-response relation and the viral shedding which need further studies. The risk rapidly decreased outside the market due to the dilution by ambient air and became below 10-6 at 5 m away from the exit.","Zhang, Xiaole; Ji, Zheng; Yue, Yang; Liu, Huan; Wang, Jing",Environ. sci. technol,,510

The aim of this study-based register is to support rapid and living evidence synthesis, including an evidence ecosystem of COVID-19 research (CEOsys). In November and December 2020, we conducted an evaluation of the CCSR for CEOsys, measured its performance and identified areas for improvement. For the evaluation we generated a purposive sample of 286 studies from 20 reviews to calculate the CCSR's comprehensiveness (sensitivity), accuracy (correctly classified and linked studies) and currency (time to publish and process references). Our sample showed that the CCSR had an overall comprehensiveness of 77.2%, with the highest coverage for interventional studies (94.4%). The study register had 100% coverage for trial registry records, 86.5% for journal articles and 52.4% for preprints. A total of 98.3% of references were correctly classified with regard to study type, and 93.4% with regard to study aim. A total of 89% of studies were correctly linked. A total of 81.4% of references were published to the register in under 30 days, with 0.5 day (median) for trial registry records, 2 days for journal articles and 56 days for preprints. The CCSR had high comprehensiveness, accurate study classifications and short publishing times for journal articles and trial registry records in the sample. We identified that coverage and publishing time for preprints needed improvement. Finally, the evaluation illustrated the value of a study-based register for identifying additional study references for analysis in evidence synthesis.","Metzendorf, Maria-Inti; Featherstone, Robin M",Res. synth. methods (Online),,510

367000,The Importance of Rubber Dam Isolation in Endodontics Throughout COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"Clinical data suggest that during the current COVID-19 pandemic, children are less prone than adults to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our purpose was to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in children vs. adults during the 2020 pandemic in Warsaw, Poland, and to investigate whether RSV and/or influenza A/B infections were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. We present results of RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed in Warsaw, Poland. Some of the pediatric subjects were also PCR-tested for RSV, and A and B influenza. We compared the test results from the four groups of symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects: 459 symptomatic pediatric patients (children 0-18 years old), 1774 symptomatic adults, 445 asymptomatic children, and 239 asymptomatic adults. 3.26% (15/459) of symptomatic pediatric patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in contrast to 5.58% (99/1774) of symptomatic adults (p = 0.0448). There were no SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the group of asymptomatic children (0/445) and two positive cases in the group of asymptomatic adults (2/239), i.e., 0.83%. In the group of symptomatic pediatric patients, 17.14% (6/35) (p = 0.0002) were positive for RSV, 8.16% (4/49) were positive for influenza A, and 2.04% (1/49), thus 10.20% (5/49) (p = 0.0176) for influenza A/B. Children were less prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than the adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Warsaw. Higher percentage of symptomatic children was infected with RSV or influenza A/B than with SARS-CoV-2. This suggests a necessity for the testing for all these viruses for an early identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients for an ensuing 2020 autumn return of COVID-19.","Kuchar, Ernest; Zaleski, Andrzej; Wronowski, Michal; Krankowska, Dagny; Podsiadly, Edyta; Brodaczewska, Klaudia; Lewicka, Aneta; Lewicki, Slawomir; Kieda, Claudine; Horban, Andrzej; Kloc, Malgorzata; Kubiak, Jacek Z",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,510

Without effective drugs to cure COVID-19, early identification and control of risk factors are important measures to combat COVID-19. This study was conducted to determine the clinical profile and risk factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital in South India. This record-based longitudinal study was conducted by reviewing the case records of COVID-19 patients admitted for treatment from June 2020 to September 2020 in a tertiary care centre in South India. The clinical details, discharge/death details, were collected and entered in MS Excel. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were analysed using univariate binomial logistic regression, generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson distribution. Survival curves were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to test the equality of survivor functions between the groups. Out of 854 COVID-19 patients, 56.6% were men and the mean (standard deviation) age was 45.3(17.2) years. The median survival time was significantly lesser in male COVID-19 patients (16 days) as compared to female patients (20 days). Increasing age, male gender, patients presenting with symptoms of fever, cough, breathlessness, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Patients with older age, male gender, breathlessness, fever, cough, smoking and alcohol and comorbidities need careful observation and early intervention. Public health campaigns aimed at reducing the prevalence of risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, smoking and alcohol use are also needed.","Marimuthu, Yamini; Kunnavil, Radhika; Anil, N S; Nagaraja, Sharath Burugina; Satyanarayana, N; Kumar, Jeetendra; Ramya, Bojja",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,510

368481,Italian Physical Therapists' Response to the Novel COVID-19 Emergency,2020,"BACKGROUND: Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is largely passive, which impedes epidemic control. We defined active testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for groups at increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in all Canadian provinces. METHODS: We identified 5 groups who should be prioritized for active RT-PCR testing: contacts of people who are positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 4 at-risk populations - hospital employees, community health care workers and people in long-term care facilities, essential business employees, and schoolchildren and staff. We estimated costs, human resources and laboratory capacity required to test people in each group or to perform surveillance testing in random samples. RESULTS: During July 8-17, 2020, across all provinces in Canada, an average of 41 751 RT-PCR tests were performed daily; we estimated this required 5122 personnel and cost $2.4 million per day ($67.8 million per month). Systematic contact tracing and testing would increase personnel needs 1.2-fold and monthly costs to $78.9 million. Conducted over a month, testing all hospital employees would require 1823 additional personnel, costing $29.0 million; testing all community health care workers and persons in long-term care facilities would require 11 074 additional personnel and cost $124.8 million; and testing all essential employees would cost $321.7 million, requiring 25 965 added personnel. Testing the larger population within schools over 6 weeks would require 46 368 added personnel and cost $816.0 million. Interventions addressing inefficiencies, including saliva-based sampling and pooling samples, could reduce costs by 40% and personnel by 20%. Surveillance testing in population samples other than contacts would cost 5% of the cost of a universal approach to testing at-risk populations. INTERPRETATION: Active testing of groups at increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 appears feasible and would support the safe reopening of the economy and schools more broadly. This strategy also appears affordable compared with the $169.2 billion committed by the federal government as a response to the pandemic as of June 2020.","Campbell, Jonathon R; Uppal, Aashna; Oxlade, Olivia; Fregonese, Federica; Bastos, Mayara Lisboa; Lan, Zhiyi; Law, Stephanie; Oh, Chi Eun; Russell, W Alton; Sulis, Giorgia; Winters, Nicholas; Yanes-Lane, Mercedes; Brisson, Marc; Laszlo, Sonia; Evans, Timothy G; Menzies, Dick",CMAJ,,510

Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of anticoagulation in coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized patients and its impact on survival. DESIGN: Multicenter international prospective registry (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for Corona Virus Disease 2019). SETTING: Hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Five thousand eight hundred thirty-eight consecutive coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTIONS: Anticoagulation therapy, including prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, was obtained for each patient. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five thousand four hundred eighty patients (94%) did not receive any anticoagulation before hospitalization. Two-thousand six-hundred one patients (44%) during hospitalization received anticoagulation therapy and it was not associated with better survival rate (81% vs 81%; p = 0.94) but with higher risk of bleeding (2.7% vs 1.8%; p = 0.03). Among patients admitted with respiratory failure (49%, n = 2,859, including 391 and 583 patients requiring invasive and noninvasive ventilation, respectively), anticoagulation started during hospitalization was associated with lower mortality rates (32% vs 42%; p < 0.01) and nonsignificant higher risk of bleeding (3.4% vs 2.7%; p = 0.3). Anticoagulation therapy was associated with lower mortality rates in patients treated with invasive ventilation (53% vs 64%; p = 0.05) without increased rates of bleeding (9% vs 8%; p = 0.88) but not in those with noninvasive ventilation (35% vs 38%; p = 0.40). At multivariate Cox' analysis mortality relative risk with anticoagulation was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.49-0.67) in patients admitted with respiratory failure, 0.50 (95% CI, 0.49-0.67) in those requiring invasive ventilation, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.51-1.01) in noninvasive ventilation.

369003,Psychiatry and COVID-19,2020,"This paper aims to explore the cyber-deception-based approach and to design a novel conceptual model of hybrid threats that includes deception methods. Security programs primarily focus on prevention-based strategies aimed at stopping attackers from getting into the network. These programs attempt to use hardened perimeters and endpoint defenses by recognizing and blocking malicious activities to detect and stop attackers before they can get in. Most organizations implement such a strategy by fortifying their networks with defense-in-depth through layered prevention controls. Detection controls are usually placed to augment prevention at the perimeter, and not as consistently deployed for in-network threat detection. This architecture leaves detection gaps that are difficult to fill with existing security controls not specifically designed for that role. Rather than using prevention alone, a strategy that attackers have consistently succeeded against, defenders are adopting a more balanced strategy that includes detection and response. Most organizations deploy an intrusion detection system (IDS) or next-generation firewall that picks up known attacks or attempts to pattern match for identification. Other detection tools use monitoring, traffic, or behavioral analysis. These reactive defenses are designed to detect once they are attacked yet often fail. They also have some limitations because they are not designed to catch credential harvesting or attacks based on what appears as authorized access.

369099,Covid-19 pandemic and the skin,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a newly emerging life-threatening respiratory disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. METHODOLOGY: We included 28 COVID-19 patients admitted to Nantong Third Hospital from January 23 to February 26, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory parameters were obtained from each patient. RESULTS: The vast majority (71.4%) of confirmed COVID-19 patients were brought in from outside of the city, and all others had contact history with these confirmed cases. The median age of patients was 50 years old and half had underlying diseases. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (96.4%), cough (67.9%), and chilly (28.6%), and 75.0% patients had two or more symptoms. Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein levels, and reduced absolute counts of total lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subsets were observed among the patients. The vast majority (85.7%) of patients showed bilateral or unilateral pneumonia, and three symptomatic patients and one asymptomatic case did not show abnormalities in their CT image. Among the 28 admitted patients, 24 were discharged as of February 26, 2020, with an average hospital stay of 14.96 (±4.27) days, which was not significantly associated with the interval between the onset of symptoms and admission. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of specific antiviral drugs or a vaccine, quarantine or isolation is the most effective intervention strategy for preventing the spread of the virus. Adequate supportive medical care is crucial for good prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Lu, Renfei; Qin, Jianru; Wu, Yan; Wang, Jian; Huang, Shengyong; Tian, Lijun; Zhang, Tao; Wu, Xiuming; Huang, Songping; Jin, Xia; Zhang, Chiyu",J Infect Dev Ctries,,510
369397,129 “Pop-Up” Specialist End of Life Ward For COVID-19—The Nottingham Experience,2021,"Major changes in the organisation of the teaching process at universities in Poland had to be introduced in response to the current pandemic situation and threat of further spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This article presents the results of the research conducted at the Faculty of Architecture, Poznan University of Technology in view of the pilot, experimental entrance exam that excludes the evaluation of drawing skills of candidates for architectural studies in the 2020/21 recruitment process. The purpose of the research was to find a correlation between the quality of candidates accepted for the BSc (engineer) programme studies, evaluated on the basis of their drawing skills demonstrated during the entrance exam and the learning outcomes of graduates. For that purpose, the authors hereof have carried out an analysis with the use of the Spearman Rank Correlation formula. The comparative analysis has shown that candidates whose drawing skills were evaluated highly during the entrance exam did not necessarily rank as the top grade scoring graduates of the first degree study programme, and thus, it has further been shown that good drawing skills at the beginning of the study programme do not guarantee top learning results at the end of the studies. In effect, the research should become a starting point for a discussion in Poland on whether there are any justified grounds for entrance exams in drawing or whether a portfolio of works may replace it and be an effective recruitment criterion.","Gawlak, Agata Pruszewicz-Sipinska Ewa Bonenberg Wojciech",Education Sciences,,510

The narrowing of cranial vessels may be asymptomatic or produce neurological symptoms. Very often nonspecific signs of ischemia occur, such as headache, vertigo, or dizziness. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the effect of carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis on the function of the equilibrium organ on the basis of electronystagmography and posturography. MATERIAL: The study was conducted in 63 patients, presenting with carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis. The control group consisted of 32 healthy persons. METHODS: All patients were subjected to precise audiological and otoneurological diagnostic examinations. Prior to being qualified for the study, patients were subjected to the assessment of arteries by means of Doppler ultrasonography. The vestibular organ was assessed by means of physical examination as well as by electronystagmography and posturography testing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed statistically significant reduction in the results of the equilibrium organ assessments in patients with carotid and vertebral arteries sclerosis as compared to the control group. Abnormal ENG records in the study group patients were observed particularly in the pendulum test, optokinetic test, and the assessment of positional nystagmus, possibly indicating disturbances within the central part of the equilibrium system. Disturbed blood flow in arteries had also an important impact on spinovestibular reflexes and resulted in disturbed postural stability control. On the basis of the conducted studies, it is concluded that diagnostic examinations for carotid and vertebral artery stenosis should be performed in patients with equilibrium system disorders.","Dorobisz, Karolina; Dorobisz, Tadeusz; Zatonski, Tomasz",Brain Behav,,510

370660,Herpes Zoster Duplex Unilateralis as a manifestation of severe lymphopenia in COVID19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Decreasing aerosol leaks are of great interest, especially in the recent era of COVID-19. The aim was to investigate intrapulpal heat development, coolant spray patterns, and the preparation efficiency of speed-increasing contra-angle handpieces with the spray air on (mist) or off (water jet) settings during restorative cavity preparations. METHODS: Standard-sized cavities were prepared in 80 extracted intact human molar teeth using diamond cylindrical drills with a 1:5 speed-increasing contra-angle handpiece. A custom-made device maintained the standardized lateral drilling force (3 N) and predetermined depth. Temperatures were measured using intrapulpal thermocouple probes. The four experimental groups were as follows: mist cooling mode at 15 mL/min (AIR15), water jet cooling mode at 15 mL/min (JET15), mist cooling mode at 30 mL/min (AIR30), and water jet cooling mode at 30 mL/min (JET30). The coolant spray pattern was captured using macro-photo imaging. RESULTS: The JET15 group had the highest increase in temperature (&#916;T = 6.02 °C), while JET30 (&#916;T = 2.24 °C; p < 0.001), AIR15 (&#916;T = 3.34 °C; p = 0.042), and AIR30 (&#916;T = 2.95 °C; p = 0.003) had significantly lower increases in temperature. Fine mist aerosol was formed in the AIR15 and AIR30 preparations but not in the JET15 and JET30 preparations (p < 0.001). The irrigation mode had no influence on the preparation time (p = 0.672). CONCLUSIONS: Water jet irrigation using coolant at 30 mL/min appeared to be the optimal mode. Considering the safe intrapulpal temperatures and the absence of fine mist aerosols, this mode can be recommended for restorative cavity preparations. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: To increase infection control in dental practices, the water jet irrigation mode of speed-increasing handpieces with coolant flow rates of 30 mL/min should be considered for restorative cavity preparations.","Lempel, Edina; Szalma, József",Clin. oral investig,,510

As family caregivers provide a good portion of the care for older people, their lives have been drastically altered by COVID-19 too. Our study is an in-depth exploration of the greatest concerns of family caregivers in the United States during COVID-19, as well as their perspectives on the benefits of caregiving during this global pandemic. We conducted in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of 52 family caregivers in the United States between May and September of 2020 over video conferencing using a semi-structured interview guide. Thematic analysis was conducted to ascertain our participants' perceptions. Caregiver's concerns were organized into six main themes, including social isolation, decline in mental health, decline in physical and cognitive functioning, keeping their family members safe from COVID-19, lack of caregiving support, and caregiving stress. The themes related to the benefits of caregiving during COVID-19 included: enjoyed the slower pace, increased time to spend together, deepened relationships, recognizing the resilience of family members, and caregiving innovations. Our in-depth study helps social workers understand the nature of caregiving stress during COVID-19, as well as the positive aspects of caregiving, even during a global pandemic.","Lightfoot, Elizabeth; Moone, Rajean; Suleiman, Kamal; Otis, Jacob; Yun, Heejung; Kutzler, Courtney; Turck, Kenneth",J Gerontol Soc Work,,510

373229,Improving early detection of infection in nursing home residents in south africa,2021,"BACKGROUND: The maternity care system in the Netherlands is well known for its support of community-based midwifery. However, regular midwifery practices typically do not offer caseload midwifery care - one-to-one continuity of care throughout pregnancy and birth. Because we know very little about the outcomes for women receiving caseload care in the Netherlands, we compared caseload care with regular midwife-led care, looking at maternal and perinatal outcomes, including antenatal and intrapartum referrals to secondary (i.e., obstetrician-led) care. METHODS: We selected 657 women in caseload care and 1954 matched controls (women in regular midwife-led care) from all women registered in the Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) who gave birth in 2015. To be eligible for selection the women had to be in midwife-led antenatal care beyond 28 gestational weeks. Each woman in caseload care was matched with three women in regular midwife-led care, using parity, maternal age, background (Dutch or non-Dutch) and region. These two cohorts were compared for referral rates, mode of birth, and other maternal and perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: In caseload midwifery care, 46.9% of women were referred to obstetrician-led care (24.2% antenatally and 22.8% in the intrapartum period). In the matched cohort, 65.7% were referred (37.4% antenatally and 28.3% in the intrapartum period). In caseload care, 84.0% experienced a spontaneous vaginal birth versus 77.0% in regular midwife-led care. These patterns were observed for both nulliparous and multiparous women. Women in caseload care had fewer inductions of labour (13.2% vs 21.0%), more homebirths (39.4% vs 16.1%) and less perineal damage (intact perineum: 41.3% vs 28.2%). The incidence of perinatal mortality and a low Apgar score was low in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found that when compared to regular midwife-led care, caseload midwifery care in the Netherlands is associated with a lower referral rate to obstetrician-led care - both antenatally and in the intrapartum period - and a higher spontaneous vaginal birth rate, with similar perinatal safety. The challenge is to include this model as part of the current effort to improve the quality of Dutch maternity care, making caseload care available and affordable for more women.","Offerhaus, Pien; Jans, Suze; Hukkelhoven, Chantal; de Vries, Raymond; Nieuwenhuijze, Marianne",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,510

However, the ophthalmological implications of this syndrome has not yet been well described. Both eyes and tears as portals of entry and sources of contagion have been the subject of debate by many authors. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence currently available on COVID-19 and its ocular implications and manifestations, in both animals and humans, with the aim to facilitate prevention and educate the ophthalmological community on this subject. A review of the literature revealed that the results of some studies suggest that ocular symptoms commonly appear in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and that it is possible to isolate the virus from the conjunctival sac of these patients. Conjunctivitis is not a common manifestation of the disease, but contact with infected eyes could be one route of transmission. Consequently, ophthalmologists need to have correct prevention strategies in place. Some guidelines regarding the prevention and management of ophthalmology clinics are reviewed. However, well-designed trials should be conducted to rule out other ocular manifestations that may result from COVID-19 infection and to understand the transmission of the virus through the eyes.","Amesty, María A; Alió Del Barrio, Jorge L; Alió, Jorge L",,,510

374660,COVID-19 cognitive deficits after respiratory assistance in the subacute phase: a COVID-rehabilitation unit experience,2021,"Purpose: Efficient interventional radiology (IR) procedure room utilization relies on various healthcare professionals performing clinical and nonclinical tasks to minimize room downtime. The coronavirus-19 (COVID) pandemic offers insight into the importance of staff ratios in improving room utilization, by evaluating the effect of a relative increase in support staffing in the setting of reduced physician staffing and reduced overall case volume. Materials and Methods: In March 2020, as a result of a department-wide COVID disaster management plan, a 4-angiosuite IR department in a 900-bed tertiary care center experienced reduced case volume by approximately 1/3, matched by decreased physician staffing (3 to 2 attendings). IR technologist and nurse staffing remained unchanged. Normal staffing resumed June 2020. A prospective database of event times related to room workflow was reviewed for case volume, room turnaround time, and first case delay time before and after volume and staff changes. Turnaround times greater than 2 hours were excluded to correct for gaps in schedule and the prolonged turnaround associated with COVID-positive patient cases. Wilcoxon rank-sum two-sample tests were used to evaluate the differences between time periods. All P values reported are two-sided. Analysis was done in RStudio 1.2.5033 (RStudio Team, Boston, MA). Results: Under standard operation, the median values for room turnaround time, case start delay, weekly case volume, and total case hours were 43.0 minutes, 30.0 minutes, 64 cases, and 44.4 hours, respectively. Under the COVID disaster management plan, a 32.6% (P &lt; 0.001, 95% C.I. 23.3%, 41.9%) estimated increase was observed for room turnaround times, and a 53% (P &lt; 0.001, 95% C.I. 36.7%, 70.0%) estimated increase was observed in case start delay;despite a 29.7% (P &lt; 0.001, 95% C.I. 20.3%, 42.2%) decrease in case number and 29.5% (P = 0.009, 95% C.I. 13.1%, 43.2%) estimated decrease in total case hours. Conclusions: Paradoxically, a relative increase in staffing did not improve measured metrics for room utilization, despite a stable attending physician-to-case ratio. Rather, findings may be allegorical to Parkinson’s law suggesting that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.","Vazquez, L.; Kolber, M.; Lamus, D.; Pillai, A.; Xi, Y.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,510

This study aimed to investigate on how people perceive the COVID-19 outbreak using the components of the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) and to find out how this might contribute to possible behavioral responses to the prevention and control of the disease. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Iran during March and April 2020. Participants were recruited via online applications using a number of platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Instagram asking people to take part in the study. To collect data an electronic self-designed questionnaire based on the EPPM was used in order to measure the risk perception (efficacy, defensive responses, perceived treat) related to the COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were used to explore the data. RESULTS: A total of 3727 individuals with a mean age (SD) of 37.0 (11.1) years participated in the study. The results revealed significant differences in efficacy, defensive responses and perceived treat among different population groups particularly among those aged 60 and over. Women had significantly higher scores than men on some aspects such as self-efficacy, reactance, and avoidance but men had higher perceived susceptibility scores compared to women. Overall 56.4% of participants were engaged in danger control (preventive behavior) while the remaining 43.6% were engaged in fear control (non-preventive behavior) process. CONCLUSION: More than half of all participants motivated by danger control. This indicated that more than half of participants had high perceived efficacy (i.e., self-efficacy and response efficacy). Self-efficacy scores were significantly higher among participants who were older, female, single, lived in rural areas, and had good economic status. The results suggest that socioeconomic and demographic factors are the main determinants of the COVID-19 risk perception. Indeed, targeted interventions are essential for controlling the pandemic.","Jahangiry, Leila; Bakhtari, Fatemeh; Sohrabi, Zahara; Reihani, Parvin; Samei, Sirous; Ponnet, Koen; Montazeri, Ali",BMC Public Health,,510

Face masks are acknowledged for effective viral aerosol shedding reduction. COVID-19 pandemic generated an opportunity to study the impact of face masks and confinement on droplet transmission diseases, usually implicated in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). We aimed to evaluate the variation on severe AECOPD (sAECOPD) rate in a Portuguese COPD cohort during the first COVID-19 lockdown and following months. This retrospective self-controlled study enrolled 322 adult patients followed at COPD-specialized consultation in a tertiary hospital from February 2016 to July 2020, of whom 286 met inclusion criteria. Severe AECOPD events were registered from March 2020 (beginning of state of emergency) until July 2020. From 2016 to 2019 there was a mean of 38 patients per year with sAECOPD. During 2020, 11 patients experienced sAECOPD. Over the course of 2020 there was a 73.4% (p < 0.001) decrease in sAECOPD events comparing with previous years' average. After the end of State of Emergency, the rate of sAECOPD events also declined by 74.6% (p < 0.001) comparing with the same timeline of previous years. Results were consistent and statistically significant when comparing 2020 with each of previous years for every period of analysis. Our findings suggest a sustained decrease in the rate of sAECOPD during confinement and in the following months. The widespread use of face mask and social distancing during COVID-19 pandemic may play an important role in preventing the transmission of respiratory infections and consequently reducing sAECOPD.","Faria, Nuno; Costa, Maria Inês; Gomes, Joana; Sucena, Maria",COPD,,510

Prior to the pandemic, Black cancer survivors experienced a disproportionate burden of delays in cancer treatment compared to White cancer survivors. As a result of the pandemic, disruptions in care are widespread and affect cancer survivors regardless of race. This shift presented an opportunity to investigate differences in how Black and White cancer survivors experience disruptions in cancer care due to the pandemic. We conducted a national survey of adult breast cancer survivors, distributed online from 4/2/20 to 4/27/20. We used t-tests to compare cancer and non-cancer-related worry during the Covid-19 pandemic between Black and White breast cancer survivors. Analysis of data from 570 respondents (106 Black and 464 White) indicated significantly higher levels of distress among White respondents compared to Black respondents. Our results point to the importance of assessing race differences in emotional response to disruptions in cancer care during the pandemic. We suggest that differences in emotional distress may reflect differences in previous experience of treatment delays and coping strategies between Black and White breast cancer survivors.","Hamlish, Tamara; Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,510

A small number of patients also presented with either unrelated conditions (such as trauma) or other emergencies, and some of which are now known to be associated with COVID-19 (such as stroke). We report such a scenario in 17 patients who were admitted and investigated with CT spine imaging and CT angiography for nonpulmonary reasons (trauma = 13, stroke = 4). Their initial work-up did not suggest COVID-19 as a diagnosis but showed unsuspected/incidental lung findings, which led to further investigations and a diagnosis of COVID-19.","Jain, R; Young, M; Dogra, S; Kennedy, H; Nguyen, V; Raz, E",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,,510

380642,Unmasking Peripheral Arterial Disease in Diabetic Patients Presenting With Inflammatory Skin Manifestations During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"A common non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) during the COVID-19 pandemic has been group size limits. Furthermore, educational settings of schools and universities have either fully closed or reduced their class sizes. As countries begin to reopen classrooms, a key question will be how large classes can be while still preventing local outbreaks of disease. Here, we develop and analyse a simple, stochastic epidemiological model where individuals (considered as students) live in fixed households and are assigned to a fixed class for daily lessons. We compare key measures of the epidemic—the peak infected, the total infected by day 180 and the calculated R 0 —as the size of class is varied. We find that class sizes of 10 could largely restrict outbreaks and often had overlapping inter-quartile ranges with our most cautious case of classes of five. However, class sizes of 30 or more often result in large epidemics. Reducing the class size from 40 to 10 can reduce R 0 by over 30%, as well as significantly reducing the numbers infected. Intermediate class sizes show considerable variation, with the total infected varying by as much as from 10% to 80% for the same class size. We show that additional in-class NPIs can limit the epidemic still further, but that reducing class sizes appears to have a larger effect on the epidemic. We do not specifically tailor our model for COVID-19, but our results stress the importance of small class sizes for preventing large outbreaks of infectious disease.","Best, Alex Singh Prerna Ward Charlotte Vitale Caterina Oliver Megan Idris Laminu Poulston Alison",Royal Society Open Science,,510

Alterations, such as low placental weight, accelerated villous maturation, decidual vasculopathy, infarcts, thrombosis of fetal placental vessels, and chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI), have been described. Objective: To analyze clinical data and the placental morphological and morphometric changes of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 group) in comparison with the placentas of non-infected pregnant women, matched for maternal age and comorbidities, besides gestational age of delivery (Control group). Method: The patients in the COVID-19 and the Control group were matched for maternal age, gestational age, and comorbidities. The morphological analysis of placentas was performed using Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus Statement. The quantitative morphometric evaluation included perimeter diameter and number of tertiary villi, number of sprouts and knots, evaluation of deposition of villous fibrin, and deposition of intra-villous collagen I and III by Sirius Red. Additionally, Hofbauer cells (HC) were counted within villi by immunohistochemistry with CD68 marker. Results: Compared to controls, symptomatic women in the COVID-19 group were more likely to have at least one comorbidity, to evolve to preterm labor and infant death, and to have positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in their concepts. Compared to controls, placentas in the COVID-19 group were more likely to show features of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion. In the COVID-19 group, placentas of symptomatic women were more likely to show CHI. No significant results were found after morphometric analysis. Conclusion: Pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly with the severe course, are more likely to exhibit an adverse fetal outcome, with slightly more frequent histopathologic findings of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion, and CHI. The morphometric changes found in the placentas of the COVID-19 group do not seem to be different from those observed in the Control group, as far as maternal age, gestational age, and comorbidities are paired. Only the deposition of villous fibrin could be more accentuated in the COVID-19 group (p = 0.08 borderline). The number of HC/villous evaluated with CD68 immunohistochemistry did not show a difference between both groups.","Rebutini, Patricia Zadorosnei; Zanchettin, Aline Cristina; Stonoga, Emanuele Therezinha Schueda; Prá, Daniele Margarita Marani; de Oliveira, André Luiz Parmegiani; Dezidério, Felipe da Silva; Fonseca, Aline Simoneti; Dagostini, Júlio César Honório; Hlatchuk, Elisa Carolina; Furuie, Isabella Naomi; Longo, Jessica da Silva; Cavalli, Bárbara Maria; Dino, Carolina Lumi Tanaka; Dias, Viviane Maria de Carvalho Hessel; Percicote, Ana Paula; Nogueira, Meri Bordignon; Raboni, Sonia Mara; de Carvalho, Newton Sergio; Machado-Souza, Cleber; de Noronha, Lucia",Front Immunol,,510

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and radiographic data were collected from records of 5 oral pathology laboratories, and all cases were microscopically reviewed. RESULTS: This series of cases included 36 (34.2%) from South Africa; 33 (31.4%) from Brazil; 23 (21.9%) from Mexico; and 13 (12.3%) from Guatemala. Seventy-two patients (68.5%) were females and 33 patients (31.4%) were males, with an average age of 19.2 years. The tumors predominantly affected the anterior maxilla (48.5%), followed by the anterior mandible (29.5%); posterior mandible (15.2%); and posterior maxilla (6.6%). Sixty-three tumors (63.6%) were follicular, 34 (34.3%) were extrafollicular, and 2 (2%) were peripheral. In most cases, the tumors caused considerable cortical expansion (average size 3.4 cm). Microscopically, most cases showed rosette-like and duct-like structures. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest case series of AOTs reported in the literature and the first multicenter study involving populations from Latin America and South Africa. In a fifth of the present cases, the posterior regions of the gnathic bones were affected and the tumors demonstrated larger sizes compared with cases occurring in other populations.","Roza, Ana Luiza Oliveira Corrêa; Carlos, Román; van Heerden, Willie F P; de Andrade, Bruno Augusto Benevenuto; Mosqueda-Taylor, Adalberto; Santos-Silva, Alan Roger; Lopes, Márcio Ajudarte; de Almeida, Oslei Paes; Romañach, Mário José; Vargas, Pablo Agustin","Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology",,510

One, in a skilled nursing facility, led to rapid transmission and significant mortality in this vulnerable population but little broader spread, while other introductions into the facility had little effect. The second, at an international business conference, produced sustained community transmission and was exported, resulting in extensive regional, national, and international spread. The two events also differed significantly in the genetic variation they generated, suggesting varying transmission dynamics in superspreading events.

Her ways of dealing with this chain of severe, life-changing events inspired us to analyze her case through Judith Butler's feminist lens of vulnerability, conceptualized as the very source of resistance. The results of the analysis illustrate vulnerability and emergent modes of resistance as gendered responsibilities of giving and receiving care, as well as the power of solidarity.

Despite the various impacts, the pandemic has improved the quality of the environment and thereby creating an opportunity to restore the degraded ecosystems. This study presents the imprints of COVID-19 lockdown on the surface water quality and chemical characteristics of the urban-based Bagmati River Basin (BRB), Nepal. A total of 50 water samples were collected from 25 sites of BRB during the monsoon season, in 2019 and 2020. The water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen (DO), and turbidity were measured in-situ, while the major ions, total hardness, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed in the laboratory. The results revealed neutral to mildly alkaline waters with relatively moderate mineralization and dissolved chemical constituents in the BRB. The average ionic abundance followed the order of Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > NH4+ for cations and HCO3-> Cl- > SO42- > NO3- > PO43- for anions. Comparing to the pre-lockdown, the level of DO was increased by 1.5 times, whereas the BOD and COD were decreased by 1.5 and 1.9 times, respectively during the post-lockdown indicating the improvement of the quality water which was also supported by the results of multivariate statistical analyses. This study confirms that the remarkable recovery of degraded aquatic ecosystems is possible with limiting anthropic activities.","Pant, Ramesh Raj; Bishwakarma, Kiran; Rehman Qaiser, Faizan Ur; Pathak, Lalit; Jayaswal, Gauri; Sapkota, Bhawana; Pal, Khadka Bahadur; Thapa, Lal Bahadur; Koirala, Madan; Rijal, Kedar; Maskey, Rejina",J Environ Manage,,510

Contrary to this growing and troubling trend, we argue that it is especially important during the crisis to not only continue but also strengthen performance management to communicate a firm's strategic direction, collect valuable business data, provide critical feedback to individuals and workgroups, protect organizations from legal risks, and retain top talent. To do so, we offer a solution to overcome the challenges associated with measuring performance during a crisis. Specifically, we extend and expand upon the well-established Net Promoter Score measure in marketing and introduce the Performance Promoter Score (PPS) to measure performance. We offer evidence-based recommendations for collecting PPS information for individuals, workgroups, and other collectives, computing a Net Performance Promoter Score (NPPS); using multiple sources of performance data, and using PPS for administrative and developmental purposes as well as to provide more frequent performance check-ins. PPS is a convenient, practical, relevant, and useful performance measure during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is also an innovation that will be useful long after the pandemic is over.","Aguinis, Herman; Burgi-Tian, Jing",,,510

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter prospective study, data on the intensity and type of pain were collected on 169 patients with active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection at 2 teaching hospitals in the United States and Korea and on 8 patients with acute pain at another large teaching hospital between February 1, 2020, and June 15, 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-five of 169 patients (38.5%) reported an active pain condition. Among the 73 patients with pain, the most common pain symptoms were headache (n=22; 30.1%), chest pain (n=17; 23.3%), spinal pain (n=18; 24.7%), myalgia (n=13; 17.8%), abdominal or pelvic pain (n=13; 17.8%), arthralgia (n=11; 15.1%), and generalized pain (n=9; 12.3%). Those reporting headache as their main symptom were less likely to require ICU admission (P=.003). Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed to 80.8% (n=59), opioids to 17.8% (n=13), adjuvants to 8.2% (n=6), and ketamine to 5.5% (n=4) of patients with pain. When age 65 years and older and sex were controlled for in multivariable analysis, the absence of pain was associated with ICU admission (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.42 to 6.28; P=.004) and death (odds ratio, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.40 to 9.76; P=.01). CONCLUSION: Acute pain is common during active COVID-19 infection with the most common manifestations being headache, chest pain and spine pain. Individuals without pain were more likely to require intensive care and expire than those with pain. Reasons why pain may be associated with reduced mortality include that an intense systemic stimulus (eg, respiratory distress) might distract pain perception or that the catecholamine surge associated with severe respiratory distress might attenuate nociceptive signaling.","Knox, Nigel; Lee, Chang-Soon; Moon, Jee Youn; Cohen, Steven P",Mayo Clin Proc,,510

Although COVID-19 leads to little or mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of affected patients, the disease may cause severe, frequently lethal complications such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure driven by hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm syndrome. This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of COVID-19. Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is reviewed with special reference to immune cell activation. Moreover, the potential implications of these new insights for immunomodulation and biological therapy in IBD are discussed.","Neurath, M. F.",Gut,,510

384986,The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy,2021,"Microscale turbulence in porous media is a new physical phenomenon that exhibits unique properties unlike those in classical turbulence flows. At low values of porosity, the surface forces on the solid obstacles compete with the inertial force of the fluid flow to result in the formation of flow instabilities. In this paper, we report the origin and mechanism of a symmetry-breaking phenomenon in periodic porous media that causes a deviation in the direction of the mean flow from that of the applied pressure gradient. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to simulate turbulent flow in a homogeneous porous medium consisting of a periodic, square lattice arrangement of cylindrical solid obstacles. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is used to simulate the transient stages during symmetry breakdown and also to validate the LES method. Quantitative and qualitative observations are made from the following approaches: (1) macroscale momentum budget, (2) 2D&3D flow visualization. The phenomenon draws its roots from the amplification of a flow instability that emerges from the vortex shedding process. The symmetry-breaking phenomenon is a pitchfork bifurcation that can exhibit multiple modes depending on the local vortex shedding process. The phenomenon is observed to be sensitive to the porosity, solid obstacle shape, and the Reynolds number. It is a source of macroscale turbulence anisotropy in porous media for symmetric solid obstacle geometries. The resulting macroscale flow field is oriented such that it does not align with the plane of symmetry of the porous matrix geometry. The principal axis of the Reynolds stress tensor is not aligned with any of the geometric axes of symmetry, nor with the direction of flow. Thus, symmetry-breaking in porous media involves new flow physics that should be taken into consideration while modeling flow inhomogeneity in the macroscale.","Srikanth, V.; Huang, C. W.; Su, T.

We aimed to forecast mortality trends in the 27 countries of the European Union (EU), plus Switzerland and the UK, where lockdown dates and confinement interventions have been heterogeneous, and to explore its determinants. METHODS: We have adapted our predictive model of COVID-19-related mortality, which rested on the observed mortality within the first weeks of the outbreak and the date of the respective lockdown in each country. It was applied in a training set of three countries (Italy, Germany and Spain), and then applied to the EU plus the UK and Switzerland. In addition, we explored the effects of timeliness and rigidity of the lockdown (on a five-step scale) and population density in our forecasts. We report r2, and percent variation of expected versus observed deaths, all following TRIPOD guidance. RESULTS: We identified a homogeneous distribution of deaths, and found a median of 24 days after lockdown adoption to reach the maximum daily deaths. Strikingly, cumulative deaths up to April 25th, 2020 observed in Europe separated countries in three waves, according to the time lockdown measures were adopted following the onset of the outbreak: after a week, within a week, or even prior to the outbreak (r2=0.876). In contrast, no correlation neither with lockdown rigidity nor population density were observed.

386632,E-Learning amid the COVID-19 Lockdown: Standpoint of Medical and Dental Undergraduates,2021,"Recent clinical data have suggested a correlation between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and diabetes. Here, we describe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen in pancreatic beta cells in autopsy samples from individuals with COVID-19. Single-cell RNA sequencing and immunostaining from ex vivo infections confirmed that multiple types of pancreatic islet cells were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, eliciting a cellular stress response and the induction of chemokines. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, beta cells showed a lower expression of insulin and a higher expression of alpha and acinar cell markers, including glucagon and trypsin1, respectively, suggesting cellular transdifferentiation. Trajectory analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 induced eIF2-pathway-mediated beta cell transdifferentiation, a phenotype that could be reversed with trans-integrated stress response inhibitor (trans-ISRIB). Altogether, this study demonstrates an example of SARS-CoV-2 infection causing cell fate change, which provides further insight into the pathomechanisms of COVID-19.","Tang, Xuming; Uhl, Skyler; Zhang, Tuo; Xue, Dongxiang; Li, Bo; Vandana, J Jeya; Acklin, Joshua A; Bonnycastle, Lori L; Narisu, Narisu; Erdos, Michael R; Bram, Yaron; Chandar, Vasuretha; Chong, Angie Chi Nok; Lacko, Lauretta A; Min, Zaw; Lim, Jean K; Borczuk, Alain C; Xiang, Jenny; Naji, Ali; Collins, Francis S; Evans, Todd; Liu, Chengyang; tenOever, Benjamin R; Schwartz, Robert E; Chen, Shuibing",Cell metab,,510
386753,COVID-19 Diary From a Psychiatry Department in Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 µM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 µM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.","Yao, Xueting; Ye, Fei; Zhang, Miao; Cui, Cheng; Huang, Baoying; Niu, Peihua; Liu, Xu; Zhao, Li; Dong, Erdan; Song, Chunli; Zhan, Siyan; Lu, Roujian; Li, Haiyan; Tan, Wenjie; Liu, Dongyang",Clin. infect. dis,,510

387296,The intervention of the emergency psychologist: the SIPEM SoS Emilia Romagna during the first lockdown from COVID-19,2021,"A cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019. The cluster was largely associated with a seafood and animal market. A novel Betacoronavirus was quickly identified as the causative agent, and it is shown to be related genetically to SARS-CoV and other bat-borne SARS-related Betacoronaviruses. The number of cases increased rapidly and spread to other provinces in China, as well as to another four countries. To help control the spread of the virus, a ""cordon sanitaire"" was instituted for Wuhan on January 23, 2020, and subsequently extended to other cities in Hubei Province, and the outbreak declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the Director General of the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. This article described the evolution of the outbreak, and the known properties of the novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease it causes, and the major public health measures being used to help control it's spread. These measures include social distancing, intensive surveillance and quarantining of cases, contact tracing and isolation, cancellation of mass gatherings, and community containment. The virus is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but appears to be the only one with pandemic potential. However, a number of important properties of the virus are still not well understood, and there is an urgent need to learn more about its transmission dynamics, its spectrum of clinical severity, its wildlife origin, and its genetic stability. In addition, more research is needed on possible interventions, particularly therapeutic and vaccines.","Mackenzie, John S; Smith, David W",Asia Pac J Public Health,,510

We conducted a systematic review and comparative meta-analysis to compare VCM and LZD efficacy against proven MRSA pneumonia. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PubMed up to November 2019. The outcomes of the meta-analysis were mortality, clinical cure, microbiological evaluation, and adverse events. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1239 patients and eight retrospective cohort or case-control studies (CSs) with a total 6125 patients were identified. Clinical cure and microbiological eradication rates were significantly increased in patients treated with LZD in RCTs (clinical cure: risk ratio (RR) = 0.81, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 0.71-0.92; microbiological eradication: RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.62-0.81) and CSs (clinical cure: odds ratio (OR) = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.18-0.69). However, mortality was comparable between patients treated with VCM and LZD in RCTs (RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.88-1.32) and CSs (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.94-1.53). Likewise, there was no significant difference in adverse events between VCM and LZD in CSs (thrombocytopenia: OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.50-1.82; nephrotoxicity: OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 0.85-3.45). CONCLUSIONS: According to our meta-analysis of RCTs and CSs conducted worldwide, we found robust evidence to corroborate the IDSA guidelines for the treatment of proven MRSA pneumonia.","Kato, Hideo; Hagihara, Mao; Asai, Nobuhiro; Shibata, Yuichi; Koizumi, Yusuke; Yamagishi, Yuka; Mikamo, Hiroshige",J Glob Antimicrob Resist,,510

387731,Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Transcription factors are ubiquitous proteins that associate with promoter DNA and regulate gene expression through a variety of mechanisms. Understanding transcriptional control mechanisms requires in-depth investigation of the binding of transcription factors to the promoters they regulate. There are many in vivo and in vitro methods for testing the binding of a known protein to a promoter, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. However, for these experiments, one must have a protein candidate to test and is not able to identify unknown proteins bound to a particular promoter. Thus, the promoter pull-down assay was developed to fill this void. This method uses DNA as bait to capture proteins that bind to a specific promoter, such as transcription factors, from cellular lysates. Coupled with other experiments, the promoter pull-down assay vastly improves the repertoire of methods available for defining regulatory complexes that influence transcription.","Chaparian, Ryan R; van Kessel, Julia C",Methods mol. biol,,510

It is unclear if screening and diagnostic mammography volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels and whether utilization has varied by women's characteristics. METHODS: We collected data on 461,083 screening mammograms and 112,207 diagnostic mammograms conducted during January 2019 through July 2020 at 62 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We compared monthly screening and diagnostic mammography volumes before and during the pandemic, stratified by age, race/ethnicity, breast density, and family history of breast cancer. RESULTS: Screening and diagnostic mammography volumes in April 2020 were 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5% to 2.4%) and 21.4% (95% CI = 18.7% to 24.4%) of April 2019 pre-pandemic volumes, respectively, but by July 2020 rebounded to 89.7% (95% CI = 79.6% to 101.1%) and 101.6% (95% CI = 93.8% to 110.1%) of July 2019 pre-pandemic volumes, respectively. The year-to-date cumulative volume of screening and diagnostic mammograms performed through July 2020 was 66.2% (95% CI = 60.3% to 72.6%) and 79.9% (95% CI = 75.4% to 84.6%), respectively, of year-to-date volume through July 2019. Screening mammography rebound was similar across age groups and by family history of breast cancer. Monthly screening mammography volume in July 2020 for Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian women reached 96.7% (95% CI = 88.1% to 106.1%), 92.9% (95% CI = 82.9% to 104.0%), 72.7% (95% CI = 56.5% to 93.6%), and 51.3% (95% CI = 39.7% to 66.2%) of July 2019 pre-pandemic volume, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite a strong overall rebound in mammography volume by July 2020, the rebound lagged among Asian and Hispanic women and a substantial cumulative deficit in missed mammograms accumulated, which may have important health consequences.","Sprague, Brian L; Lowry, Kathryn P; Miglioretti, Diana L; Alsheik, Nila; Bowles, Erin J A; Tosteson, Anna N A; Rauscher, Garth; Herschorn, Sally D; Lee, Janie M; Trentham-Dietz, Amy; Weaver, Donald L; Stout, Natasha K; Kerlikowske, Karla",J. natl. cancer inst,,510

As a result of the quarantine enforced by governments and authorities worldwide, people had to suddenly adapt their daily routines, including work, study, diet, leisure and fitness activities to the new circumstances. A growing body of research indicates that the engagement with virtual reality (VR) activities can have a positive impact on users' mental and physical wellbeing. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VR activities on users under lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. An online survey was carried out to investigate the recreational use of VR during the lockdown period and to gather users' opinions on its impact on their physical and mental health. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the responses provided by the 646 participants. The results of the survey show that VR use has significantly increased during the lockdown period for most participants, who expressed overwhelmingly positive opinions on the impact of VR activities on their mental and physical wellbeing. Strikingly, self-reported intensity of physical activity was considerably more strenuous in VR users than in console users. Given the current uncertainty as to the duration and course of the pandemic, as well as the possibility of intermittent lockdown in the upcoming years, the outcomes of this study could have a significant impact towards the development and deployment of VR-based strategies aimed at helping the population cope with prolonged social distancing, with particular regards to vulnerable individuals.","Siani, Alessandro; Marley, Sarah Anne",Health Technol (Berl),,510

Additionally, the logistic regression analysis was executed to identify the possible influence factors for antibody production. The median positive conversion time for RNA was day 7 (IQR, 3-11), and the positive rate was highest in day 1-5 (74.59 %) and then gradually decreased. The median time of seroconversion for IgM and IgG were both day 12 (IQR, 10-15). The sensitivity and specificity for IgM (or IgG) was 87.04% and 96.92%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that reduced lymphocytes and short positive conversion time for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were independent factors for negative results of IgM and IgG.

391178,Indian Association of Gastrointestinal Endo Surgeons COVID-19 endoscopy recommendations,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has currently become a global concern. The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread. METHODS: We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics. RESULTS: Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17-20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23-24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.","Hu, Bisong; Qiu, Jingyu; Chen, Haiying; Tao, Vincent; Wang, Jinfeng; Lin, Hui",Int J Infect Dis,,510

In Sicily (Italy), our institute houses a mobile ECMO team that serves a population of around 10 million people for a vast area in southern Italy and Malta. This observational, descriptive study includes all patients that required veno-venous (V-V) ECMO and transport by a mobile team between October 2009 and May 2020. Linear and multiple logistic regressions were applied to explore the risk factors for mortality in the ICU. Kaplan-Meier estimates were generated to predict the survival in patients transported by helicopter or ambulance, and the two cohorts were compared according to their baseline characteristics. Of 122 patients transported, 89 (73%) survived to ICU discharge (50 (41%) patients were transported by ambulance, and 72 (59%) were transported by helicopter). Independent predictive factors associated with mortality in a stepwise multiple regression model were prone positioning, acute kidney injury, and the number of days spent on mechanical ventilation (MV). Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival favored the helicopter cohort (79%) rather than the ambulance cohort (64%). Patients transported by helicopter had better pre-ECMO profiles, with shorter hospital and ICU stays, a shorter duration of MV use, and higher RESP scores, which indicate better survival probabilities. ECMO transport can be carried out safely over long distances; in rural areas with underdeveloped roads, transportation via helicopter or ambulance can extend the arm of the hospital to remote areas. Early ECMO initiation can be crucial in improving survival outcomes, and when transportation is the limiting factor to starting ECMO support, it should be attempted at the earliest logistical stage possible.","Hildreth, Brianna A; Panarello, Giovanna; Martucci, Gennaro; Tuzzolino, Fabio; Piacentini, Alberto; Occhipinti, Giovanna; Giunta, Andrea; Genco, Fabio; Raffa, Giuseppe M; Pilato, Michele; Capitanio, Guido; Arcadipane, Antonio",,,510

A new representation of the probability density function for the price range is provided, and its accurate sampling algorithm is developed. A Bayesian estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is provided for the model parameters and unobserved variables. MCMC samples can be generated rigorously, despite the estimation procedure requiring sampling from a density function with the sum of an infinite series. The empirical results obtained using data from the U.S. market indices are consistent with the stylized facts in the financial market, such as the existence of the leverage effect. In addition, to explore the model's predictive ability, a model comparison based on the volatility forecast performance is conducted.","Kurose, Yuta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00039v1.pdf,510

The first published serologic detections of morbillivirus in sea otters occurred in 2001-02 in live-captured Washington sea otters, with a documented 80% seroprevalence. We conducted a retrospective study of sea otter cases from 1989 to 2010 compiled at the US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center to identify cases of morbilliviral disease in Washington sea otters and to characterize the disease using immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, genetic sequencing, virus isolation, and serology. We identified six cases of morbilliviral disease and 12 cases of morbilliviral infection in this population of sea otters during 2000-10. Significant histologic findings included inflammation in the white and gray matter of the brain characterized by lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffing, neuronal necrosis, and satellitosis in gray matter and by spongiosis, myelin degeneration, spheroids, and gemistocytes in white matter. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies were found in neurons, Purkinje cells, and glia. Immunohistochemistry for canine distemper virus (CDV) showed positive staining in neurons, glial cells, and cell processes. A pan-morbillivirus RT-PCR with subsequent restriction endonuclease digestion or sequencing identified CDV. Virus isolation was not successful. Two sea otters with morbilliviral encephalitis showed greater antibody titers to CDV than phocine distemper virus. Histologic changes were confined to the central nervous system and resembled neurologic canine distemper in domestic dogs. Cases of sea otters with morbilliviral infection without histologic changes could represent early infections or incompletely cleared sublethal infections. We found that morbillivirus was present in the Washington sea otter population as early as 2000, and we provide a description of the pathology of canine distemper in sea otters.","Thomas, Nancy; White, C LeAnn; Saliki, Jeremiah; Schuler, Krysten; Lynch, Deanna; Nielsen, Ole; Dubey, J P; Knowles, Susan",J. wildl. dis,,510

Even at 5% HPC level, the tablet tensile strength achieved up to 3.5 MPa. A minimum of 10% HPC was required for the process robustness. However, 20% HPC led to tabletability loss, attributable to the high mechanical strength of APAP granules. The over-granulated APAP granules had thick connected HPC scaffold and low porosity. Consequently, these granules were so strong that they underwent a lower degree of fracture under compression and higher elastic recovery during decompression. HPC was enriched on the surface of APAP extrudates at all HPC levels. Amorphous APAP was also observed on the extrudate surface at 20% HPC level, and it recrystallized within 24 h storage. To achieve a robust process and optimal improvement in APAP tabletability, the preferred HPC level was 10 to 15%.","Liu, Tongzhou; Paul, Shubhajit; Beeson, Brian T; Alexander, Johnny; Yang, Fengyuan; Bi, Vivian; Durig, Thomas; Sun, Changquan Calvin; Zhang, Feng",AAPS PharmSciTech,,510

The survey included eight main questions about personal risk perception and behavioral response to COVID-19 based on a five- or nine-point ordinal scale. A high percentage of the respondents perceived it as highly unlikely they were at risk of getting infection (26.9%), serious illness (29.7%), and death (41.7%). The percentage of the respondents who applied protective measures frequently or always was high for most protective behavior types, except for wearing masks, wearing gloves, and avoiding touching the face. There was a significant (P < .001) weak positive correlation between risk perception and protective behaviors. The respondents followed protective behavior measures reasonably, but the frequency of undertaking some important protective behaviors was relatively low.","Shabu, Sherzad A; M-Amin, Karwan; Mahmood, Kazhan I; Shabila, Nazar P",Soc Work Public Health,,510

In this study, we focus on the main protease enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, 3CLpro, which is critical for viral replication. We employ explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of about 150 compounds docked into 3CLpro's binding site and that had emerged as good main protease ligands from our previous in silico screening of over 1.2 million compounds. By incoporating protein dynamics and applying a range of structural descriptors, such as the ability to form specific contacts with the catalytic dyad residues of 3CLpro and the structural fluctuations of the ligands in the binding site, we are able to further refine our compound selection. Fourteen compounds including estradiol shown to be the most promising based on our calculations were procured and screened against recombinant 3CLpro in a fluorescence assay. Eight of these compounds have significant activity in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Among these are corilagin, a gallotannin, and lurasidone, an antipsychotic drug, which emerged as the most promising natural product and drug, respectively, and might thus be candidates for drug repurposing for the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, we also tested the inhibitory activity of testosterone, and our results reveal testosterone as possessing moderate inhibitory potency against the 3CLpro enzyme, which may thus provide an explanation why older men are more severely affected by COVID-19.","Loschwitz, Jennifer; Jäckering, Anna; Keutmann, Monika; Olagunju, Maryam; Eberle, Raphael J; Coronado, Monika Aparecida; Olubiyi, Olujide O; Strodel, Birgit",Bioorg Chem,,510

Ableist Logic Used in Misguided Attempt to Combat Ageism During COVID-19,2020,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) widely available in public places. This may warrant determining whether cases of unintentional ocular exposure are increasing, especially in children. Objective: To describe the epidemiologic trend of pediatric eye exposures to ABHS and to report the severity of the ocular lesions. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case series conducted from April 1, 2020, to August 24, 2020. Cases were retrieved from the national database of the French Poison Control Centers (PCC) and from a pediatric ophthalmology referral hospital in Paris, France. Cases of ocular exposure to chemical agents in children younger than 18 years during the study period were reviewed. Cases of ABHS exposure were included. Exposures: The following data were collected: age, sex, circumstances of exposure, symptoms, size of the epithelial defect at first examination, time between the incident and re-epithelialization, and medical and/or surgical management. Main Outcomes and Measures: Comparison of the number of eye exposures to ABHS in children between April to August 2020 and April to August 2019. Results: Between April 1 and August 24, 2020, there were 7 times more pediatric cases of ABHS eye exposures reported in the PCC database compared with the same period in 2019 (9.9% of pediatric eye exposures in 2020 vs 1.3% in 2019; difference, 8.6%; 95% CI, 7.4-9.9; P < .001). The number of cases occurring in public places increased in 2020 (from 16.4% in May to 52.4% in August). Similarly, admissions to the eye hospital for ABHS exposure increased at the same period (16 children in 2020 including 10 boys; mean [SD] age, 3.5 [1.4] years vs 1 boy aged 16 months in 2019). Eight of them presented with a corneal and/or conjunctival ulcer, involving more than 50% of the corneal surface for 6 of them. Two cases required amniotic membrane transplant. Conclusions and Relevance: These data support the likelihood of an increasing number of unintentional ocular exposures to ABHS in the pediatric population. To maintain good public compliance with hand disinfection, these findings support that health authorities should ensure the safe use of these devices and warn the parents and caregivers about their potential danger for children.","Martin, Gilles C; Le Roux, Gael; Guindolet, Damien; Boulanger, Etienne; Hasle, Denis; Morin, Emilie; Vodovar, Dominique; Vignal, Catherine; Gabison, Eric; Descatha, Alexis",JAMA ophthalmol.

Seventy-four COVID-19 positive and 228 COVID-19 negative patients were evaluated with routine haematological parameters. Severe disease was defined as death and/or need of intensive care treatment. Twenty-seven COVID-19 positive and 18 COVID-19 negative patients were furthermore included for morphological evaluation using smear examination. Significant differences were found for platelet indices and white blood cell parameters. Thus, platelet count and plateletcrit was lower in COVID-19 patients, whilst mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, and platelet large cell ratio was significantly higher than in non-COVID-19 patients. Leukocyte, neutrophil, immature granulocyte, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil count was lower in COVID-19 patients. No significant differences were found for red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit or mean corpuscular haemoglobin for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with a severe disease course had higher levels of immature granulocytes, but lower lymphocyte and platelet counts compared to patients with non-severe COVID-19. In terms of morphology, 14.8% of COVID-19 patients had a normal smear examination, compared to 83.3% of non-COVID-19 patients. Hypogranulated neutrophils were more frequent in COVID-19 patients (p < .001), but non-COVID-19 patients had higher levels of reactive lymphocytes, compared to COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, several haematological morphological abnormalities are more frequent in patients with COVID-19 disease, and several findings indicate that platelets play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of the disease.","Alnor, Anne; Sandberg, Maria Boysen; Toftanes, Barbara Ella; Vinholt, Pernille Just",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,,510

The laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes of the disease in discharged patients remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the laboratory and echocardiographic findings of patients with COVID-19 after discharge and the relation between left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and inflammatory parameters in discharged patients. METHODS: A total of 75 patients recovering from COVID-19 as the study group were prospectively recruited from the COVID-19 outpatient clinic for their follow-up visits at a median 6 months after discharge. Patients were classified into groups according to pneumonia severity and impairment in LVGLS. Laboratory findings of patients both at admission and after discharge were evaluated and the relation with pneumonia severity at admission and LVGLS after discharge were analyzed. RESULTS: Serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) levels after discharge were significantly higher in the study group than the control group (n = 44). Ferritin was found to be related to pneumonia severity. Serum ferritin and LDH values after discharge were significantly higher in patients with impaired LVGLS than those with preserved. There was a significant correlation between LVGLS, serum ferritin and LDH values after discharge (r = -0.252, p = 0.012; r = -0.268, p = 0.005, respectively).

Inoculation theory explains how immunity to counter‐attitudinal messages is conferred by preemptively exposing people to weakened doses of challenging information. The theory has been applied in a number of contexts (e.g., politics, health) in its 50+ year history. Importantly, one of the newest contexts for inoculation theory is work in the area of contested science, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. Recent research has revealed that when a desirable position on a scientific issue (e.g., climate change) exists, conventional preemptive (prophylactic) inoculation can help to protect it from misinformation, and that even when people have undesirable positions, “therapeutic” inoculation messages can have positive effects. We call for further research to explain and predict the efficacy of inoculation theory in this new context to help inform better public understandings of issues such as climate change, genetically modified organisms, vaccine hesitancy, and other contested science beliefs such as conspiracy theories about COVID‐19.

400243,Australian Guidelines for the Clinical Care of People with COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, disproportionally targets older people, particularly men, ethnic minorities, and individuals with underlying diseases such as compromised immune system, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The discrepancy in COVID-19 incidence and severity is multifaceted and likely involves biological, social, as well as nutritional status. Vitamin D deficiency, notably common in Black and Brown people and elderly, is associated with an increased susceptibility to many of the diseases comorbid with COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency can cause over-activation of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system (RAS) leading to the respiratory syndrome. RAS is regulated in part at least by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which also acts as a primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells. Hence, vitamin D deficiency can exacerbate COVID-19, via its effects on ACE2. In this review we focus on influence of age, gender, and ethnicity on vitamin D-ACE2 interaction and susceptibility to COVID-19.","Getachew, Bruk; Tizabi, Yousef",J. med. virol,,510

How planners conceptualize the future therefore has important practical and normative implications as contemporary decisions have long-term impacts that may be irreversible and distribute costs and benefits across society. A discourse analysis of strategies prepared under the 100 Resilient Cities programme reveals that while they are ostensibly forward-looking and cognizant of uncertainty, most presume a knowable future (epistemic certainty) and focus on well-understood or recently experienced risks. Few acknowledge the future’s inherent unknowability (ontic uncertainty). Those that do emphasize community self-help; others describe top-down, government-led initiatives. Most strategies also present an image of societal consensus, downplaying the potential for legitimate disagreement over means and ends (discursive uncertainty). These findings suggest that new conceptualizations of future uncertainty have had limited impacts on planning practice.","Taylor, Zack; Fitzgibbons, Joanne; Mitchell, Carrie L.",Reg. Stud.,,510

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: There is evidence that a proportion of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 have detectable viral loads prior to exhibiting symptoms, or without ever developing symptoms. The degree of risk of transmission from asymptomatic patients to healthcare providers will depend on the prevalence of disease in the population, which is difficult to assess without widespread population screening. Aerosol-generating procedures increase the odds of viral transmission from infected symptomatic patients to healthcare providers, but transmission from asymptomatic patients has not been reported. Techniques to minimize aerosolization and appropriate personal protective equipment may help reduce the risk to healthcare workers in the operating room. Some societal guidelines recommend the use of airborne precautions during aerosol-generating procedures on asymptomatic patients during the coronavirus disease pandemic, although evidence supporting this practice is limited. CONCLUSION: Viral transmission from patients exhibiting no symptoms in the operating room is plausible and efforts to reduce risk to healthcare providers include reducing aerosolization and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, the feasibility of which will vary based on geographic risk and equipment availability.","Lee, Susan; Meyler, Paula; Mozel, Michelle; Tauh, Tonia; Merchant, Richard",Can J Anaesth,,510

402216,Fixed Dosing of Tocilizumab in ICU Admitted COVID-19 Patients Is a Superior Choice Compared to Bodyweight Based Dosing;An Observational Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic it is important to identify risk factors for COVID-19. Registry studies are providing growing evidence on the elevated risk of mortality from COVID-19 in patients with chronic liver disease, especially in advanced stages. Results may, however, have a selection bias towards severe cases. Limited data is available on COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD). AIM: To perform an online survey to capture the prevalence of COVID-19 and the state of medical care of patients with AILD in Europe during the pandemic. METHODS: Data was collected via an anonymous patient-oriented, online survey, which was available on the EUSurvey platform in nine European languages between 24th June 2020 and 14th October 2020. Of 1834 contributions, 51 were excluded because participants did not name an underlying AILD, and four were excluded because of duplicate data entry. RESULTS: Of 1,779 participants, 1,752 resided in 20 different countries of the European Union and the United Kingdom (UK). The five countries with the highest numbers of contributions were France (n = 450), Germany (n = 318), the Netherlands (n = 267), Spain (n = 225), and the UK (n = 183). 2.2% of participants (39/1779) had been diagnosed with COVID-19. There were no differences regarding age, sex, AILD, the status of liver cirrhosis, or status post liver transplantation between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Of the 39 COVID-19 cases, five patients were admitted to a regular ward, one patient was admitted to ICU and required ventilation. CONCLUSION: In our Europe-wide, patient-oriented survey on COVID-19 in patients with AILD, we detected a low rate of COVID-19, comparable to the period prevalence of the general population. These results suggest that patients with AILD are not at elevated risk of COVID-19.","Zecher, Britta Franziska; Buescher, Gustav; Willemse, José; Walmsley, Martine; Taylor, Alison; Leburgue, Angela; Schramm, Christoph; Lohse, Ansgar W; Sebode, Marcial",,,510

Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. METHODS: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy. CONCLUSION: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new evidence in further releases of these guidelines.","Alhazzani, Waleed; Møller, Morten Hylander; Arabi, Yaseen M; Loeb, Mark; Gong, Michelle Ng; Fan, Eddy; Oczkowski, Simon; Levy, Mitchell M; Derde, Lennie; Dzierba, Amy; Du, Bin; Aboodi, Michael; Wunsch, Hannah; Cecconi, Maurizio; Koh, Younsuck; Chertow, Daniel S; Maitland, Kathryn; Alshamsi, Fayez; Belley-Cote, Emilie; Greco, Massimiliano; Laundy, Matthew; Morgan, Jill S; Kesecioglu, Jozef; McGeer, Allison; Mermel, Leonard; Mammen, Manoj J; Alexander, Paul E; Arrington, Amy; Centofanti, John E; Citerio, Giuseppe; Baw, Bandar; Memish, Ziad A; Hammond, Naomi; Hayden, Frederick G; Evans, Laura; Rhodes, Andrew",Crit Care Med,,510

METHODS: Data regarding provisional death counts and estimates of excess deaths for COVID-19 according to state and territory were downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics website. Reporting included the six-month-long period of March 1 - August 31, 2020. Excess mortality rates were calculated as the number of excess deaths per 100,000 persons in each state population using 2019 US Census Bureau data. Mean values for state and territorial NHSPI domain indices were compared to state and territorial rates of COVID-19-related excess mortality using multiple linear regression, including analysis of variance. Correlations between the 51 state and territorial NHSPI values and corresponding COVID-19 excess mortality rates were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: These calculations revealed a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.02 and 0.25) and poor correlation (P = .16 and .08) among values for the overall NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico.There was also a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.001 and 0.03) and poor correlation (P values ranging from .09 to .94) for values for the six individual domains of the NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico. CONCLUSION: The NHSPI does not appear to be a valid predictor of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico during the first six months of the pandemic.","Keim, Mark E; Lovallo, Alex P",Prehosp Disaster Med,,510

404814,Covid-19: Students overlooked for vaccine in favour of family members at Dublin hospital,2021,"Retroperitoneal sarcoma is relatively uncommon, constituting only 10-15 percent of all soft tissue sarcomas. The most common histologic types of RPS are liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. Retroperitoneal sarcoma is classified based on the amount of lipid inside the cells, the mucoid lipid and the degree of cell differentiation. It is classified into the well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic and dedifferentiated types and the commonest is the pleomorphic type. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas are defined by the presence of sharply demarcated regions of non-lipogenic sarcomatous tissue within a well-differentiated tumor. This type has a vague prognosis compared to other types of sarcoma and making the histological diagnosis can be difficult. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma commonly develops in the retroperitoneum, limbs, testis, and spermatic cord. Retro peritoneal sarcoma typically produces few symptoms until they are large enough to compress or invade surrounding structures. Most tumors are already large and locally advanced at the time they are first detected. Here, we reported a case that came to medical attention as an incidentally discovered large abdominal mass in an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, later the mass was successfully removed and free from symptoms.","Nadukkandiyil, Navas; Valappil, Sameer; Ramadan, Marwan; Al Sulaiti, Essa; Alhamad, Hanadi Khamis",Aging Male,,510

To determine more about the transmission patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in these settings, we performed whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on 319 (14.4%) samples from 2,222 SARS-CoV-2-positive persons associated with 8 outbreaks in Minnesota, USA, during March-June 2020. Sequencing indicated that virus spread in 3 long-term care facilities and 2 correctional facilities was associated with a single genetic sequence and that in a fourth long-term care facility, outbreak cases were associated with 2 distinct sequences. In contrast, cases associated with outbreaks in 2 meat-processing plants were associated with multiple SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These results suggest that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into a facility can result in a widespread outbreak.

406140,Covid-19 Pandemic-An Opportunity to Reduce and Eliminate Low-Value Practices in Oncology?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic stimulated a national lockdown in the UK. The public were advised to avoid unnecessary hospital attendances and health professionals were advised to avoid aerosol-generating procedures wherever possible. The authors hypothesised that these measures would result in a reduction in the number of patients presenting to hospital with acute appendicitis and alter treatment choices. METHODS: A multicentred, prospective observational study was undertaken during April 2020 to identify adults treated for acute appendicitis. Searches of operative and radiological records were performed to identify patients treated during April 2018 and April 2019 for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were treated for acute appendicitis pre-lockdown compared with 64 patients treated during lockdown. Patients treated during the pandemic were more likely to have a higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (p = 0.049) and to have delayed their presentation to hospital (2 versus 3 days, p = 0.03). During the lockdown, the use of computed tomography (CT) increased from 36.3% to 85.9% (p < 0.001), the use of an antibiotic-only approach increased from 6.2% to 40.6% (p < 0.001) and the rate of laparoscopic appendicectomy reduced from 85.3% to 17.2% (p < 0.001). The negative appendicectomy rate decreased from 21.7% to 7.1% during lockdown (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a decreased incidence of acute appendicitis and a significant shift in the management approach. The increased use of CT allows the identification of simple appendicitis for conservative treatment and decreases the negative appendicectomy rate.","Mowbray, N G; Hurt, L; Powell-Chandler, A; Reeves, N; Chandler, S; Walters, E; Cornish, J",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,510

410142,Coping with Coronavirus Disease 2019: Developing a Rapid-cycle Frontline Quality-improvement Process to Support Employee Well-being and Drive Institutional Responsiveness in a Tertiary Care Faith-based Hospital in Rural Kenya,2021,"RATIONALE: Fibrinolysis shutdown associated with severe thrombotic complications is a recently recognized syndrome that was previously seldom investigated in patients with severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It presents a unique therapeutic dilemma, as anticoagulation with heparin alone is insufficient to address the imbalance in fibrinolysis. And while the use of fibrinolytic agents could limit the disease severity, it is often associated with bleeding complications. There is a need for biomarkers that will guide the timely stratification of patients into those who may benefit from both anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapies. PATIENT CONCERNS: All 3 patients presented with shortness of breath along with comorbidities predisposing them to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. One patient (Patient 3) also suffered from bilateral deep venous thrombosis. DIAGNOSES: All 3 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were eventually diagnosed with respiratory failure necessitating intubation. INTERVENTIONS: All 3 patients required mechanical ventilation support, 2 of which also required renal replacement therapy. All 3 patients were also placed on anticoagulation therapy. OUTCOMES: In Patients 1 and 2, the initial D-dimer levels of 0.97âµg/ml fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) and 0.83âµg/ml FEU were only slightly elevated (normal <0.50âµg/ml FEU). They developed rising D-dimer levels to a peak of 13.21âµg/ml FEU and >20.0âµg/ml FEU, respectively, which dropped to 1.34âµg/ml FEU 8 days later in Patient 1 and to 2.94âµg/ml on hospital day 13 in Patient 2. In Patient 3, the D-dimer level on admission was found to be elevated to >20.00âµg/ml FEU together with imaging evidence of thrombosis. And although he received therapeutic heparin infusion, he still developed pulmonary embolism (PE) and his D-dimer level declined to 5.91âµg/ml FEU. Despite ""improvement"" in their D-dimer levels, all 3 patients succumbed to multi-system organ failure. On postmortem examination, numerous arterial and venous thromboses of varying ages, many consisting primarily of fibrin, were identified in the lungs of all patients. LESSONS: High D-dimer levels, with subsequent downtrend correlating with clinical deterioration, seems to be an indicator of fibrinolysis suppression. These findings can help form a hypothesis, as larger cohorts are necessary to demonstrate their reproducibility.","Manzoor, Daniel; Bui, Chau; Makhoul, Elias; Luthringer, Daniel; Marchevsky, Alberto; Volod, Oksana",Medicine (Baltimore),,510
410222,Predictors of patient experience with teledermatology in setting of COVID-19 pandemic in a single medical center,2020,"We previously made the hypothesis that STING contributes to COVID-19. The present review detail new arguments for over-activation of STING pathways in COVID-19, following the description of hyper-coagulability and Kawasaki-like diseases in children. Indeed, Kawasaki disease is induced by overreaction of innate cells following exposition to various viruses, including herpes viruses which trigger STING. It predisposes to diffuse vasculitis and aneurysms, whereas STING is over-expressed in arterial aneurisms. The redness at the inoculation site of bacillus Calmette-Guérin, a specific feature of Kawasaki disease, is reproduced by activation of the STING pathway, which is inhibited upstream by aspirin, intravenous immunoglobulins, and Vitamin-D. SARS-CoV2 binding to ACE2 can lead to excessive angiotensin II signaling, which activates the STING pathway in mice. Over-activation of the STING-pathway promotes hyper-coagulability through release of interferon-ß and tissue factor by monocytes-macrophages. Aspirin and dipyridamole, besides their anti-platelet activity, also reduce tissue factor procoagulant activity, and aspirin inhibits the STING pathway upstream of STING. Aspirin and dipyridamole may be used, in combination with drugs blocking downstream the activation of the STING pathway, like inhibitors of IL-6R and JAK/STAT pathways. The risk of bleeding should be low as bleeding has not been reported in severe COVID-19 patients.","Berthelot, Jean-Marie; Drouet, Ludovic; Lioté, Frédéric",Emerg Microbes Infect,,510

I conducted a 2 (topic: climate change vs. COVID-19) X 2 (source: expert vs. nonexpert) experimental study with an US adult sample (N = 486). Using Bayes factors to quantify evidence for null and alternative hypothesis, I find substantial evidence that at least under the conditions present in the study, experts are perceived to be higher in expertise, but equal in trustworthiness to the ""average Joe"". In turn, experts are equally persuasive to nonexperts on both topics. My work suggests that when engaging in policy advocacy on public health matters, the fact that an advocate is an expert on a topic can be acknowledged by audiences, but this may not necessarily help (nor necessarily harm) one's perceived trustworthiness or ability to persuade an audience. More research is needed to understand how experts can bolster their trustworthiness and persuasiveness when advocating for public health policies.","Geiger, Nathaniel",Health Commun,,510

METHODS: Using in-depth interviews (N = 14) and framework analysis, we describe how policymakers developed, adopted, and implemented regulations governing services for substance use disorders during COVID-19, and how policymakers' perceived the impacts of these regulations in New York State. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers shifted to more inclusive approaches of knowledge generation and co-production of recommendations. Barriers to adoption and implementation of new regulations included medication/services supply, lack of integration, stigma, and overcriminalization. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study highlight the potential feasibility and benefits of co-produced policies for substance use services and the need for consistent service supply, better integration with health care services, reduced stigma, improved funding structures, best practice guidelines, criminal justice reform, and harm reduction support. These considerations should inform future policy maintenance and modifications to substance use services related to COVID-19.","Henry, Brandy F; Campbell, Aimee; Hunt, Timothy; Johnson, Jessica K; Mandavia, Amar D; Chaple, Michael; Arout, Caroline; Wu, Elwin; Pincus, Harold A; Nunes, Edward V; Lincourt, Pat; Levin, Frances R; El-Bassel, Nabila",J Subst Abuse Treat,,510

411354,Validating the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire in Danish,2020,"Engineering halide perovskites through alloying allows synthesis of materials having tuned electronic and optical properties; however, synthesizing many of these alloys is hindered by the formation of demixed phases arising due to thermodynamically unstable crystal structures. Methods have been developed to make such alloys, such as solid-phase reactions, chemical vapor deposition, and mechanical grinding; but these are incompatible with low-temperature solution-processing and monolithic integration, precluding a number of important applications of these materials. Here, solvent-phase kinetic trapping (SPKT), an approach that enables the synthesis of novel thermodynamically unfavored perovskite alloys, is developed. SPKT is used to synthesize Cs1- x Rbx PbCl3 and report the first instance of ultraviolet emission in polycrystalline perovskite thin films. SPKT leads to materials exhibiting superior thermal and photostability compared to non-kinetically trapped materials of the same precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy of the kinetically trapped material reveals improved optical properties: greater absorption, and longer ground-state bleach lifetimes. SPKT may be applied to other perovskites to realize improved material properties while benefiting from facile solution-processing.","Parmar, Darshan H; Pina, Joao M; Choubisa, Hitarth; Bappi, Golam; Bertens, Koen; Sargent, Edward H",Adv Mater,,510

411718,92 Clinical Frailty Scoring Is Crucial For the COVID-19 Era and Beyond,2021,"PURPOSE: The prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) has increasingly been recognized to reflect prognosis involving local invasion and distant metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to assess a predictive model using preoperatively accessible clinical parameters and radiographic features developed and validated to predict MVI. This predictive model can distinguish clinical outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) for HCC patients. METHODS: In total, 455 HCC patients who underwent LT between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019, were retrospectively enrolled in two centers in China as a training cohort (ZFA center; n = 244) and a test cohort (SLA center; n = 211). Univariate and multivariate backward logistic regression analysis were used to select the significant clinical variables which were incorporated into the predictive nomogram associated with MVI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on clinical parameters were plotted to predict MVI in the training and test sets. RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate backward logistic regression analysis identified four independent preoperative risk factors for MVI: &#945;-fetoprotein (AFP) level (p < 0.001), tumor size ((p < 0.001), peritumoral star node (p = 0.003), and tumor margin (p = 0.016). The predictive nomogram using these predictors achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.85 and 0.80 in the training and test sets. Furthermore, MVI could discriminate different clinical outcomes within the Milan criteria (MC) and beyond the MC. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram based on preoperatively clinical variables demonstrated good performance for predicting MVI. MVI may serve as a supplement to the MC.","Zhang, Wenhui; Liu, Zhikun; Chen, Junli; Dong, Siyi; Cen, Beini; Zheng, Shusen; Xu, Xiao",Transl Oncol,,510

Post declaration, India announced lockdown and various guidelines were issued by Health authorities worldwide for the organizations to function in this emergency aeon. Different organizations strategized differently to respond to COVID 19 pandemic. The aim was to implement COVID 19 guidelines across all the centres of a chain of Eye hospitals in India in short span of time overcoming the challenges. Methods: A SMART strategy was confabulated within the team. There were numerous challenges like lack of time, rapidly changing guidelines, no travelling scenarios, training and educating the staff in huge numbers, rapidly evolving situation, change management, need of increased vigilance, and language barrier at certain centres, sustaining quality assurance and motivating the staff in stressful times. The challenges were surpassed using a power packed strategy, dedicated efforts and team work grasping the available tools and technology from a single location. This template can serve us and other hospitals to respond in a better way for similar future challenges. Results: The COVID 19 protocols were implemented across all the centres successfully. The entire Quality assurance system drifted to online platform and education and awareness methods took the digital thread. Teamwork synergized with the aforementioned things and we came out with flying colours achieving the goals in short span of time overcoming all the barriers. Conclusion: Difficult times bring challenges and challenges teach us the innovative ways to convert them into opportunities. A well planned strategy, best utilization of available resources, team work and continuous monitoring can bring the best outcomes forward.","Singh, Mandeep J; Verma, Deepika; Banerjee, Tirtha B; Singh, Ankita; Bhatt, Kanika",Indian J Ophthalmol,,510

It is important to estimate its impact of COVID-19 for health policy decision-making. We estimated the years of life lost (YLLs) due to COVID-19 in high-incidence countries. METHODS: We collected the YLLs due to COVID-19 in 30 high-incidence countries as of April 13, 2020 and followed up as of July 14, 2020. Incidence and mortality were collected using each country's formal reports, articles, and other electronic sources. The life expectancy of Japanese females by age and the UN population data were used to calculate YLLs in total and per 100,000. RESULTS: As of April 22, 2020, there were 1,699,574 YLLs due to COVID-19 in 30 high-incidence countries. On July 14, 2020, this increased to 4,072,325. Both on April 22 and July 14, the total YLLs due to COVID-19 was highest in the USA (April 22, 534,481 YLLs; July 14, 1,199,510 YLLs), and the YLLs per 100,000 population was highest in Belgium (April 22, 868.12 YLLs/100,000; July 14, 1,593.72 YLLs/100,000). YLLs due to COVID-19 were higher among males than among females and higher in those aged &#8805; 60 years than in younger individuals. Belgium had the highest proportion of YLLs attributable to COVID-19 as a proportion of the total YLLs and the highest disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 population. CONCLUSION: This study estimated YLLs due to COVID-19 in 30 countries. COVID-19 is a high burden in the USA and Belgium, among males and the elderly. The YLLs are very closely related with the incidence as well as the mortality. This highlights the importance of the early detection of incident case that minimizes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 fatality.","Oh, In Hwan; Ock, Minsu; Jang, Su Yeon; Go, Dun Sol; Kim, Young Eun; Jung, Yoon Sun; Kim, Ki Beom; Park, Hyesook; Jo, Min Woo; Yoon, Seok Jun",J Korean Med Sci,,510

However, there is limited literature on the appropriate timing of corticosteroid administration to obtain the best possible patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including patients with severe COVID-19 who received corticosteroid treatment from March 2 to June 30, 2020 in seven tertiary hospitals in South Korea. We analyzed the patient demographics, characteristics, and clinical outcomes according to the timing of steroid use. Twenty-two patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled, and they were all treated with corticosteroids. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients who received corticosteroids, 12 patients (55%) were treated within 10 days from diagnosis. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics. The initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 168.75. The overall case fatality rate was 25%. The mean time from diagnosis to steroid use was 4.08 days and the treatment duration was 14 days in the early use group, while those in the late use group were 12.80 days and 18.50 days, respectively. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio, C-reactive protein level, and cycle threshold value improved over time in both groups. In the early use group, the time from onset of symptoms to discharge (32.4 days vs. 60.0 days, P = 0.030), time from diagnosis to discharge (27.8 days vs. 57.4 days, P = 0.024), and hospital stay (26.0 days vs. 53.9 days, P = 0.033) were shortened.

413078,Endoscopy during COVID-19 pandemic: An overview of infection control measures and practical application,2020,"INTRODUCTION: On March 11, 2020 the WHO announced a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Lockdown restrictions, compromised access to medical care and fear of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have forced patients with non-COVID-19 illnesses such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) to stay home. Thisâ¯situation can lead to delay in T1D diagnosis and insulin treatmentâ¯resultingâ¯in rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and therefore increased risk of complications and death.â¯â¯. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of DKA at the onset of T1D in children diagnosed in our department during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown from March 2020 till May 2020 in comparison to corresponding period of the previous year.â¯. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected data ofâ¯children with newly diagnosed T1D. DKA was defined according to ISPAD guidelines.â¯. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 34 childrenâ¯in groupâ¯2020â¯and 52 in groupâ¯2019 with an average age 9.90 ±4.9 vs. 9.59±4.7 years with mean HbA1c 12.9 ±2.4â¯vs.â¯11.5 ±2.2%,â¯respectively. The incidence of DKA was higher by 12% inâ¯groupâ¯2020 vs.â¯2019 (52.94% vs 40.38%; p = 0.276).â¯ Regarding the DKA severity (2020 vs. 2019)â¯32.35% vs. 11.54% wereâ¯severe (p = 0.026), 17.65 vs. 13% were moderate (p = 0.759), and 2.94 vs. 15.38%â¯wereâ¯mild (p = 0.081).â¯None of the analyzed patients were COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown changes in society and health care system, the DKA rate has increased by 12 percentage points with more severe cases noted in children with newly diagnosedâ¯T1D. Regular education of the whole society about the symptoms of diabetes could contribute to faster diagnosis of T1D and reduction of DKA prevalence.â¯.","Dzygalo, Katarzyna; Nowaczyk, Jedrzej; Szwilling, Alicja; Kowalska, Agnieszka",Pediatr Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,,510
413109,COVID-19: Exposing digital poverty in a pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma is the only antibody based therapy currently available for COVID 19 patients. It has robust historical precedence and sound biological plausibility. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe as a treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: Thus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. RESULTS: The incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in the first four hours after transfusion was <1%, including mortality rate (0.3%). Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n = 4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO; n = 7), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI; n = 11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n = 3). However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The seven-day mortality rate was 14.9%. CONCLUSION: Given the deadly nature of COVID 19 and the large population of critically-ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive. These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Joyner, Michael J; Wright, R Scott; Fairweather, DeLisa; Senefeld, Jonathon W; Bruno, Katelyn A; Klassen, Stephen A; Carter, Rickey E; Klompas, Allan M; Wiggins, Chad C; Shepherd, John Ra; Rea, Robert F; Whelan, Emily R; Clayburn, Andrew J; Spiegel, Matthew R; Johnson, Patrick W; Lesser, Elizabeth R; Baker, Sarah E; Larson, Kathryn F; Ripoll, Juan G; Andersen, Kylie J; Hodge, David O; Kunze, Katie L; Buras, Matthew R; Vogt, Matthew Np; Herasevich, Vitaly; Dennis, Joshua J; Regimbal, Riley J; Bauer, Philippe R; Blair, Janis E; van Buskirk, Camille M; Winters, Jeffrey L; Stubbs, James R; Paneth, Nigel S; Verdun, Nicole C; Marks, Peter; Casadevall, Arturo",J. clin. invest,,510

413612,"Challenges and similarities in HIV, COVID-19 crises: a Q&A with Anthony Fauci, MD",2020,"Under-representation of certain populations, based on gender, race/ethnicity, and age, in data collection for predictive modeling may yield less-accurate predictions for the under-represented groups. Recently, this issue of fairness in predictions has attracted significant attention, as data-driven models are increasingly utilized to perform crucial decision-making tasks. Methods to achieve fairness in the machine learning literature typically build a single prediction model subject to some fairness criteria in a manner that encourages fair prediction performances for all groups. These approaches have two major limitations: i) fairness is often achieved by compromising accuracy for some groups; ii) the underlying relationship between dependent and independent variables may not be the same across groups. We propose a Joint Fairness Model (JFM) approach for binary outcomes that estimates group-specific classifiers using a joint modeling objective function that incorporates fairness criteria for prediction. We introduce an Accelerated Smoothing Proximal Gradient Algorithm to solve the convex objective function, and demonstrate the properties of the proposed JFM estimates. Next, we presented the key asymptotic properties for the JFM parameter estimates. We examined the efficacy of the JFM approach in achieving prediction performances and parities, in comparison with the Single Fairness Model, group-separate model, and group-ignorant model through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of the JFM method in the motivating example to obtain fair risk predictions for under-represented older patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Do, Hyungrok; Nandi, Shinjini; Putzel, Preston; Smyth, Padhraic; Zhong, Judy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04648v3.pdf,510

More than one-third of COVID-19 patients report neurological symptoms and cases of neurological diseases are increasingly accumulating. The aim of this systematic review was to characterize all - to date - reported cases with COVID-19 related myelopathy. Methods×Eighteen papers were included in this review. Patients of all ages could be affected, although there is a predilection for middle-aged people. Results×There were no significant co-morbidities or immunodeficiencies in the affected patients. COVID-19 related myelopathy started roughly within the first month after COVID-19 onset, either concomitantly with COVID-19 symptoms or within 10 days after their remission. The vast majority of cases fulfilled our criteria for postinfectious transverse myelitis. However, some cases were considered to have had parainfectious or infectious myelitis or, in one case, vascular myelopathy. Motor, sensory and bowel and/or bladder symptoms predominated the clinical presentation of myelopathies, explained mainly by centrally localized and longitudinally extensive lesions within the cervical and/or thoracic segments of the spinal cord. Occasionally lesions were complicated by necrosis and hemorrhages. Treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange was offered mostly a mild to marked improvement within a period of some weeks. Conclusions× Considering the imminent arrival of new vaccines against COVID-19 pandemic, and their potential risk for postvaccination transverse myelitis, this characterization of COVID-19 related myelopathy is of utmost importance.","Artemiadis, Artemios; Liampas, Andreas; Hadjigeorgiou, Loizos; Zis, Panagiotis",Neurol Res,,510

METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm randomized controlled trial testing a theory-based, community-informed, Web-accessible computer role-playing game intervention. Control condition received a list of resources. Primary hypotheses were high levels of implementation success, game demand, and game acceptability. RESULTS: We randomized 240 SGMYs aged 14-18 years into the intervention (n = 120) or control (n = 120) conditions. Participants completed baseline (100%), 1-month follow-up (T2; 73.3%), and 2-month follow-up (T3; 64.4%) surveys. Among intervention participants, 55.8% downloaded and played the game. Of those who played, 46.2% reported a desire to play it again, and 50.8% would recommend it. Game acceptability exceeded hypothesized benchmarks, wherein participants reported high positive affect (M = 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.13, 2.58), low negative affect (M = 2.75; 95% CI: 2.55, 2.95), low tension/annoyance (M = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.98, 3.39), and high competence (M = 2.23; 95% CI: 2.04, 2.43) while playing the game. In multivariable intent-to-treat analyses of 38 secondary/tertiary outcomes, intervention participants reported significantly larger reductions than control participants in cyberbullying victimization (T2 b = -.28; 95% CI: -.56, -.01), binge drinking frequency (T2 b = -.39; 95% CI: -.71, -.06), and marijuana use frequency (T3 b = -2.78; 95% CI: -4.49, -1.08). CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a Web-accessible game trial with SGMY. The game-based intervention was feasible and acceptable to SGMY, and preliminary results show it improved several health-related behaviors. A larger scale trial is needed to test whether the game-based intervention can reduce health inequities for SGMY.","Egan, James E; Corey, Stephanie L; Henderson, Emmett R; Abebe, Kaleab Z; Louth-Marquez, William; Espelage, Dorothy; Hunter, Simon C; DeLucas, Matthew; Miller, Elizabeth; Morrill, Brooke A; Hieftje, Kimberly; Sang, Jordan M; Friedman, Mark S; Coulter, Robert W S",J. adolesc. health,,510

Curriculum is ordinarily viewed as a tool for regulating and adapting modern educational systems to society's needs and trends. But most governments have been unwilling to rethink post-pandemic education, despite the loss of livelihoods, food, and shelter - accentuated by educational inequality and institutionalised via neoliberal reforms. The current pandemic compels us to examine the meanings and purposes of education from a socio-historical perspective, to understand how questions of equity and justice, rooted in India's Constitution, can be woven into curricula and pedagogic approaches. This article reflects on the role that curriculum can play in enabling an ecologically and socially just and connected world. This curricular response includes cognising the significance of subaltern disciplines and imagining transformative pedagogies that can help reclaim education spaces and sustain epistemic justice.","Batra, Poonam",Prospects (Paris),,510

We consider the optimal allocation of a limited supply of a preventive vaccine to control an infectious disease, and four different allocation objectives: minimize new infections, deaths, life years lost, or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to death. We consider an SIR model with n interacting populations, and a single allocation of vaccine at time 0. We approximate the model dynamics to develop simple analytical conditions characterizing the optimal vaccine allocation for each objective. We instantiate the model for an epidemic similar to COVID-19 and consider n=2 population groups: one group (individuals under age 65) with high transmission but low mortality and the other group (individuals age 65 or older) with low transmission but high mortality. We find that it is optimal to vaccinate younger individuals to minimize new infections, whereas it is optimal to vaccinate older individuals to minimize deaths, life years lost, or QALYs lost due to death. Numerical simulations show that the allocations resulting from our conditions match those found using much more computationally expensive algorithms such as exhaustive search.

418102,The Novel Concept of Patient Self-Imaging: Success in COVID-19 and Cardiopulmonary Disorders,2021,"More than one year has passed since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 coronavirus were reported in Wuhan (China), rapidly evolving into a global pandemic. This infectious disease has become a major public health challenge in the world. Unfortunately, to date, no specific antivirals have been proven to be effective against COVID-19, and although a few vaccines are available, the mortality rate is not decreasing but is still increasing. One therapeutic strategy has been focused on infection prevention and control measures. In this regard, the use of nutraceutical supports may play a role against some aspect of the infection, particularly the inflammatory state and the immune system function of patients, thus representing a strategy to control the worst outcomes of this pandemic. For this reason, we performed an overview including meta-analyses and systematic reviews to assess the association among melatonin, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc supplementation and inflammatory markers using three databases, namely, MEDLINE, PubMed Central and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. According to the evidence available, an intake of 50,000 IU/month of vitamin D showed efficacy in CRP. An amount of 1 to 2 g per day of vitamin C demonstrated efficacy both in CRP and endothelial function, and a dosage of melatonin ranging from 5 to 25 mg /day showed good evidence of efficacy in CRP, TNF and IL6. A dose of 50 mg/day of elemental zinc supplementation showed positive results in CRP. Based on the data reported in this review, the public health system could consider whether it is possible to supplement the current limited preventive measures through targeted nutraceutical large-scale administration.","Corrao, Salvatore; Mallaci Bocchio, Raffaella; Lo Monaco, Marika; Natoli, Giuseppe; Cavezzi, Attilio; Troiani, Emidio; Argano, Christiano",Nutrients,,510

418610,Rethinking dermatology resident education in the age of COVID-19,2020,"By 2040, deaths from chronic viral hepatitis worldwide are projected to exceed those from human immunodeficiency virus infection, tuberculosis and malaria combined. The burden of this disease is predominantly carried by low-resource countries in Africa and Asia. In resource-rich countries, the epidemiological spread of viral hepatitis is partially driven by migrant movements from areas of high endemicity. In the last decade, Member States of the European Union and the European Economic Area have experienced an unprecedented influx of migrants, which has resulted in the polarization of political views about migration. In addition, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has worsened the economic and health conditions of migrants and contributed to hostility to ensuring their health rights. Moreover, the implementation of hostile laws in some host nations has increased the vulnerability of marginalized migrant subgroups, such as asylum seekers and undocumented individuals. These developments have complicated the historical challenge of identifying high-risk migrant groups for screening and treatment. However, if European countries can apply the simplified assessment tools and diagnostic tests for viral hepatitis that have been used for decentralized screening and monitoring in resource-poor countries, the uptake of care by migrants could be dramatically increased. Given the global calls for the elimination of viral hepatitis, European nations should recognize the importance of treating this vulnerable migrant population. Political and health strategies need to be adapted to meet this challenge and help eliminate viral hepatitis globally.","Kim, Jin Un; Ingiliz, Patrick; Shimakawa, Yusuke; Lemoine, Maud",Bull World Health Organ,,510

419652,Could isotretinoin be a protective agent against COVID-19?: A dermatologist perspective,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have surpassed one million worldwide with limited treatment modalities, and physicians are relying on alternative methods, such as Vitamin D supplementation, to prevent or halt disease progression without direct evidence. Research has proven that vitamin D supplementation can prevent inflammation based on its role in innate immune response;however, there have been limited studies regarding vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19. We aimed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D insufficient patients was associated with fewer severe COVID-19 outcomes, defined as mechanical ventilation or death. Methods: Retrospective study that analyzed data from all adult patients admitted to our tertiary care center between March 2020 and July 2020 with a positive RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level measured within 90 days prior to the index admission. Patients with 25(OH)D &amp;lt;30 ng/mL were considered vitamin D insufficient and patients ordered for least one weekly dose of ≥1,000 units of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol were considered supplemented. Supplemented vitamin D insufficient patients were compared to non-supplemented vitamin D insufficient patients in terms of severe COVID-19 disease as defined by mechanical ventilation or death. Results: 129 COVID-19 patients with a vitamin D level &amp;lt;30 ng/mL were identified, with a median vitamin D level of 21.4 ng/mL. A total of 43 patients (33.3%) had severe COVID-19 outcomes. 65 (50.4%) patients with vitamin D insufficiency were supplemented and 64 (49.6%) were not supplemented. Vitamin D supplementation with ≥1,000 units (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.28 - 1.40;p=0.25), ≥5,000 units (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.26 - 1.23;p=0.15), or ≥50,000 units (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.42–2.20, p=0.92) weekly had no statistically significant effect on severe COVID-19 outcomes. The odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes in supplemented patients were non-significantly reduced at lower cutoff values for vitamin D insufficiency (&amp;lt;20 ng/mL and &amp;lt;12 ng/mL) for all supplementation amounts. Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation in patients with vitamin D insufficiency did not significantly reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes;however, vitamin D supplementation was associated with non-statistically significant reduced odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes at lower cutoff values of vitamin D level. These results demonstrate that Vitamin D supplementation may have a protective effect against severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with lower baseline levels of vitamin D.","Levitus, Corinne Chekuri Sweta Assa Andrei Mohrmann Laurel Zindman Alexandra Tabatabaie Vafa Toscano Fabrizio Ahmed Masud Baron Sarah W.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,510

METHODS: This is a prospective study, comparing clinical data and inflammatory biomarkers of COVID-19 patients with and without headache, recruited at the Emergency Room. We compared baseline with 6-week follow-up to evaluate disease evolution. RESULTS: Of 130 patients, 74.6% (97/130) had headache. In all, 24.7% (24/97) of patients had severe pain with migraine-like features. Patients with headache had more anosmia/ageusia (54.6% vs. 18.2%; p < 0.0001). Clinical duration of COVID-19 was shorter in the headache group (23.9 ± 11.6 vs. 31.2 ± 12.0 days; p = 0.028). In the headache group, IL-6 levels were lower at the ER (22.9 (57.5) vs. 57.0 (78.6) pg/mL; p = 0.036) and more stable during hospitalisation. After 6 weeks, of 74 followed-up patients with headache, 37.8% (28/74) had ongoing headache. Of these, 50% (14/28) had no previous headache history. Headache was the prodromal symptom of COVID-19 in 21.4% (6/28) of patients with persistent headache (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Headache associated with COVID-19 is a frequent symptom, predictive of a shorter COVID-19 clinical course. Disabling headache can persist after COVID-19 resolution. Pathophysiologically, its migraine-like features may reflect an activation of the trigeminovascular system by inflammation or direct involvement of SARS-CoV-2, a hypothesis supported by concomitant anosmia.","Caronna, Edoardo; Ballvé, Alejandro; Llauradó, Arnau; Gallardo, Victor José; Ariton, Diana María; Lallana, Sofia; López Maza, Samuel; Olivé Gadea, Marta; Quibus, Laura; Restrepo, Juan Luis; Rodrigo-Gisbert, Marc; Vilaseca, Andreu; Hernandez Gonzalez, Manuel; Martinez Gallo, Monica; Alpuente, Alicia; Torres-Ferrus, Marta; Pujol Borrell, Ricard; Alvarez-Sabin, José; Pozo-Rosich, Patricia",Cephalalgia,,510

420886,The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: perspectives from an orthopaedic hospital,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic is a world-wide crisis without an effective therapy. While most approaches to therapy are using repurposed drugs that were developed for other diseases, it is thought that targeting the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can result in an effective therapeutic treatment. The coronavirus RNA cap structure is methylated by two viral methyltransferases that transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The proper methylation of the virus depends on the level of methionine in the host to form SAM. Herein, we propose to restrict methionine availability by treating the patient with oral recombinant methioninase, aiming to treat Covid-19. By restricting methionine we not only interdict viral replication, which depends on the viral RNA cap methyaltion, but also inhibit the proliferation of the infected cells, which have an increased requirement for methionine. Most importantly, the virally-induced T-cell- and macrophage-mediated cytokine storm, which seems to be a significant cause for Covid-19 deaths, can also be inhibited by restricting methionine, since T-cell and macrophrage activation greatly increases the methionine requirement for these cells. The evidence reviewed here suggests that oral recombinant methioninase could be a promising treatment for coronavirus patients.","Hoffman, Robert M; Han, Qinghong",In Vivo,,510

It suggests a new framework for assessing the phases of the pandemic. Method: The paper draws its information and conclusions from a rapid synthesis and translation process (RSTP) of a series of webinars and online discussions from the Pandemic-Mental Health International Network (Pan-MHIN) - policy experts from across 16 locations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. While the initial focus of this research was on mental health, COVID-19 has raised much broader issues and questions for health planners. Results: We identified gaps affecting the capacity to respond effectively and quickly, including in relation to system indicators, the inadequacy of the prior classification of the phases of the pandemic, the absences of a healthcare ecosystem approach, and the quick shift to digital technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of COVID-19 responses across different systems, services, sites and countries been identified and compared, including both low and high impacted areas. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for managerial epidemiology based on healthcare ecosystem research encompassing multidisciplinary teams, visualization tools and decision analytics for rapid response. Policy and healthcare context played a key role in the response to COVID-19. Its severity, the containment measures and the societal response varied greatly across sites and countries.

While the elderly are most severely affected, implicating an age bias, a striking factor in the demographics of this deadly disease is the gender bias, with higher numbers of cases, greater disease severity, and higher death rates among men than women across the lifespan. While pre-existing comorbidities and social, behavioral, and lifestyle factors contribute to this bias, biological factors underlying the host immune response may be crucial contributors. Women mount stronger immune responses to infections and vaccinations and outlive men. Sex-based biological factors underlying the immune response are therefore important determinants of susceptibility to infections, disease outcomes, and mortality. Despite this, gender is a profoundly understudied and often overlooked variable in research related to the immune response and infectious diseases, and it is largely ignored in drug and vaccine clinical trials. Understanding these factors will not only help better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but it will also guide the design of effective therapies and vaccine strategies for gender-based personalized medicine. This review focuses on sex-based differences in genes, sex hormones, and the microbiome underlying the host immune response and their relevance to infections with a focus on coronaviruses.","Gadi, Nirupa; Wu, Samantha C; Spihlman, Allison P; Moulton, Vaishali R",Front Immunol,,510

How to effectively control such epidemic has gradually become a global issue. This paper reviews the economic impact of major epidemics such as SARS, H1N1, and Ebola at the micro-, sector-, and macro-level. The challenge of effective epidemic control is to achieve a balance between viral transmission reduction and economic cost. This paper then summarizes three main methods to evaluate the effectiveness of several control policies. We also find that the adequacy and authenticity of information disclosure is of great importance to minimize economic loss, as either public panic due to overestimation or lack of public awareness due to underestimation can cause additional negative economic impacts. Accurate and transparent disclosure of information plays a crucial role associated with fighting against the epidemic. Finally, the paper puts forward a number of policy recommendations to minimize economic loss while controlling the spread of COVID-19.","Gong, Binlei; Zhang, Shurui; Yuan, Lingran; Chen, Kevin Z.",J.

There were five waves of interviews. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric test methods were used for data analysis. Participants numbered 150 for the linkable baseline survey and 102 completed all 5 survey waves and were included in the analysis. Mental stress, emotional status and lifestyle manifested a statistically significant downwards trend across the total period of this panel study. The number of reported new confirmed patients perceived high risk and perceived severity were positively associated with mental stress, emotional status and lifestyle. Self-efficacy was negatively associated with each type of mental and behavioral response. The more time people were confined to their home, the more serious the emotional and lifestyle problems. Dose-response relationships were noted between the number of reported new confirmed patients and mental stress, emotional status and lifestyle during the five observation points. This study yielded new information about mental and behavioral responses among Chinese people during the COVID-19 epidemic.

This article provides guidance for hospital managers, healthcare staff, district-level managers and provincial managers on parental access to hospitalised children during a pandemic such as COVID-19. It: (i) summarises legal and ethical issues around parental visitation rights; (ii) highlights four guiding principles; (iii) provides 10 practical recommendations to facilitate safe parental access to hospitalised children; (iv) highlights additional considerations if the mother is COVID-19-positive; and (v) provides considerations for fathers. In summary, it is a child's right to have access to his or her parents during hospitalisation, and parents should have access to their hospitalised children; during an infectious disease pandemic such as COVID-19, there is a responsibility to ensure that parental visitation is implemented in a reasonable and safe manner. Separation should only occur in exceptional circumstances, e.g. if adequate in-hospital facilities do not exist to jointly accommodate the parent/caregiver and the newborn/infant/child. Both parents should be allowed access to hospitalised children, under strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and with implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including handwashing/sanitisation, face masks and physical distancing. Newborns/infants and their parents/caregivers have a reasonably high likelihood of having similar COVID-19 status, and should be managed as a dyad rather than as individuals. Every hospital should provide lodger/boarder facilities for mothers who are COVID-19-positive, COVID-19-negative or persons under investigation (PUI), separately, with stringent IPC measures and NPIs. If facilities are limited, breastfeeding mothers should be prioritised, in the following order: (i) COVID-19-negative; (ii) COVID-19 PUI; and (iii) COVID-19-positive. Breastfeeding, or breastmilk feeding, should be promoted, supported and protected, and skin-to-skin care of newborns with the mother/caregiver (with IPC measures) should be discussed and practised as far as possible. Surgical masks should be provided to all parents/caregivers and replaced daily throughout the hospital stay. Parents should be referred to social services and local community resources to ensure that multidisciplinary support is provided. Hospitals should develop individual-level policies and share these with staff and parents. Additionally, hospitals should ideally track the effect of parental visitation rights on hospital-based COVID-19 outbreaks, the mental health of hospitalised children, and their rate of recovery.","Goga, A; Feucht, U; Pillay, S; Reubenson, G; Jeena, P; Mahdi, S; Mayet, N T; Velaphi, S; McKerrow, N; Mathivha, L R; Makubalo, N; Green, R J; Gray, G",S Afr Med J,,510

However, the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is unclear. METHODS: The Passive Immunity Trial for Our Nation (PassITON) is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial being conducted in the USA to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma as a treatment for adults hospitalized with symptomatic disease. Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms for less than 14 days are eligible. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 unit (200-399 mL) of COVID-19 convalescent plasma that has demonstrated neutralizing function using a SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus neutralization assay. Study treatments are administered in a blinded fashion and patients are followed for 28 days. The primary outcome is clinical status 14 days after study treatment as measured on a 7-category ordinal scale assessing mortality, respiratory support, and return to normal activities of daily living. Key secondary outcomes include mortality and oxygen-free days. The trial is projected to enroll 1000 patients and is designed to detect an odds ratio &#8804; 0.73 for the primary outcome. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide the most robust data available to date on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of adults hospitalized with acute moderate to severe COVID-19. These data will be useful to guide the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the current pandemic and for informing decisions about whether developing a standardized infrastructure for collecting and disseminating convalescent plasma to prepare for future viral pandemics is indicated.

426703,Antipsychotic use and psychiatric disorders in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recently, severe manifestations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been recognized. Analysis of studies for this novel syndrome is needed for a better understanding of effective management among affected children. METHODS: An extensive search strategy was conducted by combining the terms multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and coronavirus infection or using the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in bibliographic electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and in preprint servers (BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses guidelines to retrieve all articles published from January 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020. Observational cross-sectional, cohort, case series, and case reports were included. RESULTS: A total of 328 articles were identified. Sixteen studies with 655 participants (3 months-20 years of age) were included in the final analysis. Most of the children in reported studies presented with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and Kawasaki Disease-like symptoms. Sixty-eight percent of the patients required critical care; 40% needed inotropes; 34% received anticoagulation; and 15% required mechanical ventilation. More than two-thirds of the patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 49% received corticosteroids. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma were the least commonly utilized therapies. Left ventricular dysfunction was reported in 32% of patients. Among patients presenting with KD-like symptoms, 23% developed coronary abnormalities and 26% had circulatory shock. The majority recovered; 11 (1.7%) children died. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review delineates and summarizes clinical features, management, and outcomes of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although most children required intensive care and immunomodulatory therapies, favorable outcomes were reported in the majority with low-mortality rates.","Kaushik, Ashlesha; Gupta, Sandeep; Sood, Mangla; Sharma, Seema; Verma, Shikha",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,510

The review included 84 studies. The majority of included studies were conducted in Western Europe and the USA. Many lacked theoretical input, were at risk for bias, and few were experimental in design. The most commonly coded domains of the TDF in the included studies were 'Environmental Context and Resources' (388 codes across 76 studies), 'Beliefs about Consequences' (34 codes across 21 studies), 'Emotion' (28 codes across 12 studies), and 'Social Influences' (26 codes across 16 studies). The least frequently coded TDF domains included 'Optimism' (not coded), 'Intentions' (coded once), 'Goals' (2 codes across 2 studies), 'Reinforcement' (3 codes across 2 studies), and 'Behavioural Regulation' (3 codes across 3 studies). Examining the focus of the included studies identified a lack of studies on potentially important determinants of adherence such as reinforcement, goal setting and self-monitoring. The quality of the included studies was variable and their generalisablity was threatened by their reliance on convenience samples.","Noone, Chris; Warner, Nikolett Zs; Byrne, Molly; Durand, Hannah; Lavoie, Kim L; McGuire, Brian E; McSharry, Jenny; Meade, Oonagh; Morrissey, Eimear; Molloy, Gerard J; O039,; Connor, Laura; Toomey, Elaine",Health Psychol Rev,,510

Our purpose of this research is to study the improvement of air quality and human mortality rates in countries worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Worldwide air quality data were collected from &gt; 12,000 continuous air quality monitoring stations on six continents covering 1000 major cities from over 100 countries. Here, we discussed the implementation of the open-source data set of basic air pollutants such as PM 2.5, NO2, temperature, relative humidity, and Air Quality Index variation during the pre-lockdown and lockdown pandemic COVID-19 in India and described the global aspect. An average concentration of PM 2.5 (145.51 μg/m3), NO2(21.64 μg/m3), and AQI index (55.58) continuously decreased. The variation of PM 2.5, NO2, normally shows more than 25 μg/m3every year, but during the COVID-19 lockdown period (April 2020) continuously decreased below 20 μg/m3. Similarly, the AQI index and meteorological factors such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed variation decreased significantly in the many countries in the world. In Asian countries, air quality improved during the national lockdown especially in the most polluted cities globally such as Beijing, Delhi, and Nanjing and also in developed cities like Madrid, New York, Paris, Seoul, Sydney, Tokyo. Furthermore, the reduction of particulate matter was in about 46%, and other gaseous pollutants during the lockdown period were observed in a 54% reduction. We are witnessing pollution reductions which add significantly to improvements in air quality. This is due to the massive decrease in the use of fossil fuel, which in turn reduces production and traffic in general. People nowadays are now willing to see a comparatively healthier world with bleached skies and natural ecosystems. This research finding demonstrates potential safety benefits associated with improving air quality and mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in decreases in mortality rates in India and around the world.","Karuppasamy, Manikanda Bharath; Seshachalam, Srinivasalu; Natesan, Usha; Ayyamperumal, Ramamoorthy; Karuppannan, Shankar; Gopalakrishnan, Gnanachandrasamy; Nazir, Nusrat",Air Qual.

428576,Telephone follow-up in urogynecology in the era of COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota is a terrestrial lagerstätte that contains exceptionally well-preserved fossils indicating the origin and early evolution of Mesozoic life, such as birds, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, mammals, insects, and flowering plants. New geochronologic studies have further constrained the ages of the fossil-bearing beds, and recent investigations on Early Cretaceous tectonic settings have provided much new information for understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of the biota and dispersal pattern of its members. Notably, the occurrence of the Jehol Biota coincides with the initial and peak stages of the North China craton destruction in the Early Cretaceous, and thus the biotic evolution is related to the North China craton destruction. However, it remains largely unknown how the tectonic activities impacted the development of the Jehol Biota in northeast China and other contemporaneous biotas in neighboring areas in East and Central Asia. It is proposed that the Early Cretaceous rift basins migrated eastward in the northern margin of the North China craton and the Great Xing'an Range, and the migration is regarded to have resulted from eastward retreat of the subducting paleo-Pacific plate. The diachronous development of the rift basins led to the lateral variations of stratigraphic sequences and depositional environments, which in turn influenced the spatiotemporal evolution of the Jehol Biota. This study represents an effort to explore the linkage between terrestrial biota evolution and regional tectonics and how plate tectonics constrained the evolution of a terrestrial biota through various surface geological processes.","Zhou, Zhonghe; Meng, Qingren; Zhu, Rixiang; Wang, Min",Proc.

428857,Cardiac arrhythmias in the era of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is an international concern as it spreads through human populations and across national and international borders. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we consecutively included all cancer patients who had been identified as having a nucleic acid-confirmed COVID-19 from two designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 patients without cancer were also enrolled for comparison. The clinical data were gathered from the medical records from Jan 14 to March 12, 2020. RESULTS: Among the 117 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the median age was 63 years and 48.7% were male. Male sex, hematologic cancer, dyspnea on admission, and anti-cancer therapies were associated with an increased risk of mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19. We found that elevated levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 were associated with a poorer prognosis in cancer patients with COVID-19, but no statistically significant association was found in patients without cancer. In addition, IL-2R and IL-6 markedly decreased in cancer patients who recovered from COVID-19. However, lymphocyte subsets were diminished in cancer patients who died from COVID-19, including total T cells, total B cells, helper T (Th) cells and suppressor T (Ts) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients with COVID-19 were associated with high mortality (23.9%). A decrease in lymphocyte subsets and higher levels of cytokines were associated with a higher risk of severe outcome and could be utilized as the reference index to predict the survival outcome of cancer patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Wei; Gao, Yuan; Hu, Guoqing; Chu, Qian; Yuan, Xun",Aging (Albany NY),,510

In Experiment 1, 36 5 1/2-month-old infants were habituated to a screen rotating 180° with no block, a screen rotating 120° up to a block, or a screen rotating 180° up to and seemingly through a block. All infants were then tested on the same 3 events and also a screen rotating 120° with no block. The results indicate that infants are using novelty and familiarity preference to determine their looking times. To confirm this, in Experiment 2, 52 5 1/2-month-old infants were familiarized on either 3 or 7 trials to a screen rotating 180° with no block or a screen rotating 120° with no block. All infants were then tested on the same test events as in Experiment 1. Infants with fewer familiarization trials were more likely to prefer the familiar rotation event. The results of these 2 experiments indicate that infants did not use the possibility or impossibility of events but instead used familiarity or novelty relations between the habituation events and the test events to determine their looking times, and suggest that the Baillargeon et al. study should not be interpreted as indicating object permanence or solidity knowledge in young infants.","Bogartz, Richard S; Shinskey, Jeanne L; Schilling, Thomas H",Infancy,,510
430301,High Level of Food Insecurity among Families with Children Seeking Routine Care at Federally Qualified Health Centers during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are increasingly being identified as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). They have potentially detrimental ecological and human health impacts but most are not currently subject to environmental regulation. Addressing the life cycle of these pharmaceuticals plays a significant role in identifying the potential sources and understanding the environmental impact that pharmaceuticals may have in surface waters. The stability and biological activity of these ""micro-pollutants"" can lead to a pseudo persistence, with ensuing unknown chronic behavioural and health-related effects. Research that investigates pharmaceuticals predominantly focuses on their occurrence and effect within surface water environments. However, this review will help to collate this information with factors that affect their environmental concentration. This review focuses on six pharmaceuticals (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, gemfibrozil and diclofenac), chosen because they are heavily consumed globally, have poor removal rates in conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (CAS WWTPs), and are persistent in the aquatic environment. Furthermore, these pharmaceuticals are included in numerous published prioritisation studies and/or are on the Water Framework Directive (WFD) ""Watch List"" or are candidates for the updated Watch List (WL). This review investigates the concentrations seen in European Union (EU) surface waters and examines factors that influence final concentrations prior to release, thus giving a holistic overview on the source of pharmaceutical surface water pollution. A period of 10 years is covered by this review, which includes research from 2009-2020 examining over 100 published studies, and highlighting that pharmaceuticals can pose a severe risk to surface water environments, with each stage of the lifecycle of the pharmaceutical determining its concentration. This review additionally highlights the necessity to improve education surrounding appropriate use, disposal and waste management of pharmaceuticals, while implementing a source directed and end of pipe approach to reduce pharmaceutical occurrence in surface waters.","O039,; Flynn, Dylan; Lawler, Jenny; Yusuf, Azeez; Parle-McDermott, Anne; Harold, Denise; Mc Cloughlin, Thomas; Holland, Linda; Regan, Fiona; White, Blánaid",Anal Methods,,510
430609,Speech pathology telepractice for children with cleft palate in the times of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background Patients' goals of care (GOC), which direct end-of-life clinical decision-making, should be established in conjunction with their primary physician when they are well. However, these discussions are often left for when critical intervention is needed in the Emergency Department, and this has been exacerbated in the new context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Establishing effective, formal training for Emergency Medicine (EM) residents to successfully carry out these conversations and potentially improve patient care is needed. Methodology A physician dual-certified in Emergency Medicine and Palliative Care developed a virtual course on best practices in determining GOC for EM residents. It occurred for one hour during resident didactic conference and all residents who attended were included. A survey was sent to all participants to assess the success of the course's content and method of delivery. Results Of the 39 residents who participated, 18 (46%) completed the survey. The majority (94%) agreed the course helped close knowledge gaps and increased comfort in carrying out these discussions and 100% planned to incorporate these learning points into practice. A smaller majority (61%) thought the virtual platform was an effective method of delivery and 61% felt the breakout rooms helped with learning retention. Open-ended comments reflected learners' desire for more of this content, suggestions to augment with simulation, as well as technical difficulties experienced. Conclusions This course helped EM residents identify and close knowledge gaps in determining patients' GOC who plan to incorporate what they learned into their clinical practice. Next steps in validating the course include seeking more pointed feedback of the virtual format and assessing its effects over broader audiences after making feedback-focused adjustments to its content and delivery.","Crossman, M.

These frameworks aim to ensure countries of origin reap some of the benefits from the use of their resources. Using real-world examples, we demonstrate conceptual and definitional ambiguities relating to ""country of origin"" that make not only operationalising the ABS scheme for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use objectives difficult but may also undermine public health emergency responses.

The use of social capital as a resource to diversify agribusiness to get more customers and improve the agricultural supply chain is a considerable issue to explore. This study aims to develop a comprehensive measurement of social capital and examine its effect on the intention to diversify agribusiness. From a supply chain perspective, it uses theory of planned behavior (TPB) and resource-based view (RBV). Design/methodology/approach The study uses a mixed-methods approach. In-depth interviews, focus group discussions and surveys are used. Structural equation modeling on a sample of 465 respondents in Vietnam was employed to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings An integrative measurement scale of social capital from an agricultural supply chain perspective is suggested. The study also shows significant causal relationships amongst social capital, motives, TPB's determinants and the intention to diversify agribusinesses in light of supply chain perspectives. Originality/value The study offers a significant contribution to the existing body of knowledge in the literature on social capital, motives, TPB, RBV and supply chain perspectives.

434122,"Olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19, a review of the evidence and implications for pandemic management",2020,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, Black Americans are suffering from a significantly disproportionate incidence of COVID-19. Going beyond mere epidemiological tallying, the potential for racial-justice interventions, including reparations payments, to ameliorate these disparities has not been adequately explored. METHODS: We compared the COVID-19 time-varying Rt curves of relatively disparate polities in terms of social equity (South Korea vs. Louisiana). Next, we considered a range of reproductive ratios to back-calculate the transmission rates ßiâj for 4â¯cells of the simplified next-generation matrix (from which R0 is calculated for structured models) for the outbreak in Louisiana. Lastly, we considered the potential structural effects monetary payments as reparations for Black American descendants of persons enslaved in the U.S. would have had on pre-intervention ßiâj and consequently R0. RESULTS: Once their respective epidemics begin to propagate, Louisiana displays Rt values with an absolute difference of 1.3-2.5 compared to South Korea. It also takes Louisiana more than twice as long to bring Rt below 1. Reasoning through the consequences of increased equity via matrix transmission models, we demonstrate how the benefits of a successful reparations program (reflected in the ratio ßbâb/ßwâw) could reduce R0 by 31-68%. DISCUSSION: While there are compelling moral and historical arguments for racial-injustice interventions such as reparations, our study considers potential health benefits in the form of reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. A restitutive program targeted towards Black individuals would not only decrease COVID-19 risk for recipients of the wealth redistribution; the mitigating effects would also be distributed across racial groups, benefiting the population at large.","Richardson, Eugene T; Malik, Momin M; Darity, William A; Mullen, A Kirsten; Morse, Michelle E; Malik, Maya; Maybank, Aletha; Bassett, Mary T; Farmer, Paul E; Worden, Lee; Jones, James Holland",Soc Sci Med,,510

In the current study, we formulated protein subunit vaccines with AS03 adjuvant and recombinant proteins of S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (S1-WT) and S1 variant (K417N, E484K, N501Y, and D614G) subunit (S1-Mut), and immunized transgenic mice that express human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The S1 protein-specific antibody production and the neutralization capability for SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 variant were measured after immunization in mice. The results revealed that the S1-Mut antigens were more effective in inhibiting the receptor-binding domain and ACE2 binding in B.1.351 variant than in wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the development of a bivalent vaccine exhibited the ideal neutralization properties against wild-type and B.1.351 variant, as well as other variants. Our findings may provide a rationale for the development of a bivalent recombinant vaccine targeting the S1 protein that can induce the neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 variants and wild-type of the virus and may be of importance to explore the potential clinical use of bivalent recombinant vaccine in the future.","He, Cai; Yang, Jingyun; He, Xuemei; Hong, Weiqi; Lei, Hong; Chen, Zimin; Shen, Guobo; Yang, Li; Li, Jiong; Wang, Zhenling; Song, Xiangrong; Wang, Wei; Lu, Guangwen; Wei, Xiawei",,,510

Métodos Utilizamos como base el número de contagios confirmados con SARS-CoV-2 en Chile hasta el 14 de abril del 2020 (8 273 casos, 94 muertes). Para los distintos escenarios, asumimos un número reproductivo básico que va desde R0=2,5 hasta R0=1,5. La proyección de la demanda hospitalaria y letalidad por edad se fundamentaron en reportes italianos y británicos. Resultados Estimamos que para el 14 de mayo del 2020 habría en Chile 2 019 775 contagiados y 15 068 fallecidos en ausencia de medidas de mitigación (R0=2,5). Al implementar medidas que reduzcan R0 a 1,5 (detección temprana y aislamiento de casos, cuarentena y distanciamiento social de mayores de 70 años), el número de contagios y letalidad disminuirían a 94 235 y 703 respectivamente. Sin embargo, la demanda hospitalaria aún sobrepasaría la capacidad de respuesta. La población de mayor riesgo la componen los mayores de 60 años. Conclusión Encontramos evidencia a favor de las medidas de mitigación implementadas por el Gobierno chileno. Sin embargo, medidas más estrictas son necesarias para no colapsar el sistema sanitario, que cuenta con menos recursos hospitalarios que los proyectados. Es esencial aumentar la capacidad hospitalaria en términos de equipamiento y entrenamiento del personal de salud.(AU)","Ochoa-Rosales, Carolina; González-Jaramillo, Nathalia; Vera-Calzaretta, Aldo; Franco, Oscar H",Rev. salud pública,,510

Given language barriers, patients with limited English proficiency present a unique set of challenges in integrating telehealth and ensuring equity. Using data from 84,419 respondents in the 2015-18 California Health Interview Survey, we assessed the association between limited English proficiency and telehealth use (telephone and video visits) and evaluated the impact of telehealth use on health care access and use. We found that patients with limited English proficiency had lower rates of telehealth use (4.8 percent versus 12.3 percent) compared with proficient English speakers. In weighted multivariable logistic regression, patients with limited English proficiency still had about half the odds of using telehealth. Telehealth use was associated with increased emergency department use for all patients. This study suggests that policy makers and clinicians must focus on limited English proficiency as an important dimension to promote telehealth equity and decrease digital divides.","Rodriguez, Jorge A; Saadi, Altaf; Schwamm, Lee H; Bates, David W; Samal, Lipika",Health Aff (Millwood),,510

A Fast Fourier Transform is applied to 30 seconds long epochs of EEG recordings to provide localized time-frequency information, and a deep convolutional LSTM neural network is trained for sleep stage classification. Automating sleep stages detection from EEG data offers great potential to tackling sleep irregularities on a daily basis. Thereby, a novel approach for sleep stage classification is proposed which combines the best of signal processing and statistics. In this study, we used the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database. The code evaluation showed impressive results, reaching an accuracy of 86.43, precision of 77.76, recall of 93,32, F1-score of 89.12 with the final mean false error loss of 0.09.","Cvetko, Tim; Robek, Tinkara",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03387v1.pdf,510
436993,Tackling the pillars of ageing to fight COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) most commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat. However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease. In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity. METHODS: We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms. We followed up patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected &#8805;24 hours apart. We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4 ± 3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3 ± 2.2 bowel movements per day. Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom. Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P < 0.001). Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P < 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms. These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.","Han, Chaoqun; Duan, Caihan; Zhang, Shengyan; Spiegel, Brennan; Shi, Huiying; Wang, Weijun; Zhang, Lei; Lin, Rong; Liu, Jun; Ding, Zhen; Hou, Xiaohua",Am J Gastroenterol,,510

We analysed sex differences in a low epidemic area with low overall mortality in Covid-19 in a population based setting with patients treated in specialized healthcare. METHODS: We entered all hospitalized laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases of all specialized healthcare hospitals of the Capital Province of Finland, into a population-based quality registry and described demographics, severity and case-fatality by sex of the first Covid-19 wave February-June 2020. RESULTS: Altogether 5471 patients (49% male) were identified. Patients hospitalized in the specialist healthcare (N = 585, 54% male, OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.05-1.48) were of the same age. Men had less asthma and thyroid insufficiency and more coronary artery disease compared to women. Mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was at least one day longer for men (p=.005). Men required intensive care unit (ICU) more often (27% vs. 17%) with longer lengths-of-stays at ICU. Male sex associated with significantly higher case-fatality at 90-days (15% vs. 8%) and all excess male deaths occurring after three weeks from onset. Men with fatal outcomes had delays in both Covid-19 testing and hospital admission after a positive test. The delays in patients with the most severe and fatal outcomes differed markedly by sex. In multivariable analysis, male sex associated independently with case-fatality (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.22-4.59). CONCLUSIONS: Male sex associated with higher disease severity and case-fatality. Late presentation of male fatal cases could represent different treatment-seeking behaviour or disease progression by sex.","Forsblom, Erik; Silén, Suvi; Kortela, Elisa; Ahava, Maarit; Kreivi, Hanna-Riikka; Holmberg, Ville; Järvinen, Asko; Hästbacka, Johanna; Kivivuori, Sanna-Maria; Meretoja, Atte",Infect Dis (Lond),,510

Since emojis are used as effective vehicles to convey ideas and sentiments, they can offer important insight into the public's gendered discourses about the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at exploring how people of different genders (eg, men, women, and sex and gender minorities) are discussed in relation to COVID-19 through the study of Twitter emojis. METHODS: We collected over 50 million tweets referencing the hashtags #Covid-19 and #Covid19 for a period of more than 2 months in early 2020. Using a mixed method, we extracted three data sets containing tweets that reference men, women, and sexual and gender minorities, and we then analyzed emoji use along each gender category. We identified five major themes in our analysis including morbidity fears, health concerns, employment and financial issues, praise for frontline workers, and unique gendered emoji use. The top 600 emojis were manually classified based on their sentiment, indicating how positive, negative, or neutral each emoji is and studying their use frequencies. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the majority of emojis are overwhelmingly positive in nature along the different genders, but sexual and gender minorities, and to a lesser extent women, are discussed more negatively than men. There were also many differences alongside discourses of men, women, and gender minorities when certain topics were discussed, such as death, financial and employment matters, gratitude, and health care, and several unique gendered emojis were used to express specific issues like community support.

Prison conditions in Italy put detained minors at grave risk of contracting sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To date (29 April 2020), the Italian penitentiary system is housing 161 minors (147 males), most of them in pre-trial custody, as well as 50 children <3 y of age residing with their mothers in detention. Furthermore, the government reported 5265 unaccompanied minor migrants, mainly from Gambia and Egypt. The fundamental approach to be followed in childhood detention during COVID-19 is prevention of the introduction of infectious agents into detention facilities, limiting the spread within the prison and reducing the possibility of spread from the prison to the outside community. This appears challenging in countries like Italy with intense SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The current COVID-19 pandemic shows the need to provide a comprehensive childhood protection agenda, as the provision of healthcare for people in prisons and other places of detention is a state responsibility.","Logar, Silvia; Leese, Maggie",International health (Online),,510

OBJECTIVE: To phenotype leukocyte subpopulations and the cytokine milieu in the lungs and blood of critically ill patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We consecutively included patients <72 hours after intubation following informed consent from next of kin. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was evaluated by microscopy and BALF and blood was assessed by 10-colored flow cytometry and a multiplex cytokine panel. RESULTS: Four mechanically ventilated patients (40-75 yr.) with moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS were included. Immature neutrophils dominated in both blood and lungs, while CD4 and CD8 T cell lymphopenia were observed in the two compartments. However, T regulatory cells and Th17 cells were found in higher fractions in the lung. Lung CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages expressed an even higher upregulation of activation markers than in blood. A wide range of cytokines were expressed at high levels both in blood and in the lungs, most notably IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1, consistent with hyperinflammation. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 ARDS exhibits a distinct immunologic profile in the lungs with a depleted and exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cell population that resides within a heavily hyperinflammatory milieu.

441884,Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Delayed Skin Cancer Services,2021,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already resulted in a huge setback to mankind in terms of millions of deaths, while the unavailability of an appropriate therapeutic strategy has made the scenario much more severe. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity and the role of human cell surface TLRs in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory pathogenesis has been demonstrated recently. However, the functional significance of the human intracellular TLRs including TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 is yet unclear. Hitherto, the involvement of these intracellular TLRs in inducing pro-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 has been reported but the identity of the interacting viral RNA molecule(s) and the corresponding TLRs have not been explored. This study hopes to rationalize the comparative binding of the major SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs to the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drives these interactions. Our in silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs depicts that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are possible virus-associated molecular patterns that bind to TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7, respectively, and trigger downstream cascade reactions. Intriguingly, binding of the viral mRNAs resulted in variable degrees of conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the TLRs ratifying the activation of the downstream inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, the current study is the maiden report to describe the role of TLR3, 7, and 9 in COVID-19 immunobiology and these could serve as useful targets for the conception of a therapeutic strategy against the pandemic.","Choudhury, Abhigyan; Das, Nabarun Chandra; Patra, Ritwik; Mukherjee, Suprabhat",J. med. virol,,510

445079,Chloroquine and its derivatives in the management of COVID-19: A scoping review,2020,"Background: the need for social distancing midst the COVID-19 pandemic has forced ophthalmologists to innovate with telemedicine. The novel process of triaging emergency ophthalmology patients via videoconsultations should reduce hospital attendances. However, the safety profile of such services were unknown. Methods: in this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed case notes of 404 adults who used our videoconsultation service from 20/04/2020 to 03/05/2020. We compared these to 451 patient who attended eye casualty in person at the same time who were deemed not to require same day ophthalmic examination. Findings: patients seen by videoconsultations tended to be younger (Median = 43 years, Inter-quartile range = 27 vs Median= 49 years, Inter-quartile range = 28)'. More males used the face-to-face triage (55%) while more females used videoconsultation (54%)%. Fewer patients seen by videoconsultations required specialist review compared to face-face triage [X 2 (1, N = 854) = 128.02, p<0.001)]. 35.5% of the patients initially seen by videoconsultation had unplanned reattendance within 1 month, compared to 15.7% in the group initially seen in person. X 2 (1, N = 234) = 7.31, p = 0.007). The rate of actual harm was no different (at 0% for each method), with perfect inter-grader correlation when graded independently by two senior ophthalmologists. 97% of patients seen on the video platform surveyed were satisfied with their care. Interpretation: we demonstrate comparable patient safety of videoconsultations at one-month follow-up to in person review. The service is acceptable to patients and reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We propose that videoconsultations are effective and desirable as a tool for triage in ophthalmology.

As the infection rates rise, a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals have been reported to complain of olfactory disturbances at an alarming rate. Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is a well-known phenomenon that may explain the olfactory dysfunction reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Methods: A scoping literature review was performed to identify studies that investigated the mechanisms of postviral olfactory dysfunction. Studies demonstrating pathophysiological, histological, immunochemical, and epidemiological outcomes of PVOD were included. Results: Fourteen studies were included in addition to one international news article. Three studies reported destruction of the olfactory epithelium following intranasal inoculation of various viral strains in mice. Three studies isolated pathogenic, anosmia inciting viruses (Parainfluenza virus, Human Coronavirus, Rhinovirus) through nucleic acid amplification. Eleven studies demonstrated female predilection in patients with PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction, of which the majority were over 50 years old. Conclusions: PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction demonstrates considerable similarities in epidemiological trends and disease sequela of other viruses to suggest identical pathophysiological mechanisms. Further studies such as intranasal inoculation and histological biopsies are needed to support our hypothesis.","Imam, Sarah A; Lao, Wilson P; Reddy, Priyanka; Nguyen, Shaun A; Schlosser, Rodney J",,,510

We explored the inclusion of pregnant women in treatment trials of COVID-19 by reviewing ten international clinical trial registries at two timepoints in 2020. We identified 155 COVID-19 treatment studies of non-biological drugs for the April 7-10, 2020 timepoint, of which 124 (80%) specifically excluded pregnant women. The same registry search for the July 10-15, 2020 timepoint, yielded 722 treatment studies, of which 538 (75%) specifically excluded pregnant women. We then focused on studies that included at least one of six drugs (remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon beta, corticosteroids, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin) under evaluation for COVID-19. Of 176 such studies, 130 (74%) listed pregnancy as an exclusion criterion. Of 35 studies that evaluated high-dose vitamin treatment for COVID-19, 27 (77%) excluded pregnant women. Despite the surge in treatment studies for COVID-19, the proportion excluding pregnant women remains consistent. Exclusion was not well justified as many of the treatments being evaluated have no or low safety concerns during pregnancy.

445603,"The impact of COVID-19 ""Unlock-I"" on L V Prasad Eye Institute Network in Southern India",2021,"Introduction: The first clinical trial on remdesivir for treatment of severe COVID-19 conducted in China was terminated prematurely due to limited patient enrollment, which rendered the findings inconclusive. We re-analyzed the efficacy with a statistically more powerful and clinically meaningful method based on published data using the 6-point ordinal scale of patient’s disease severity. Methods: We defined response as patient’s point reached, either 2 (hospitalized, no require-ment for supplementary oxygen therapy) or 1 (discharged or met discharge criterion), and then analyzed with logistic regression with baseline score, day of assessment, treatment group, baseline by treatment interaction, and day by treatment interaction as covariates. The binary endpoint was supported by the recent FDA’s guidance on COVID-19. Results: Eighty-two percent (82%) of the patients were in the disease severity point=3 (hospitalized, required supplemental oxygen (but not NIV/HFNC)) – the moderately severe category. The response rate was 85% for remdesivir-treated patients with baseline disease point=3 versus 70% response rate for likewise placebo-treated patients on Day 28 (OR=2.38, P=0.0012). On Day 14, the response rate for these patients was 43% for remdesivir versus 33% for placebo (OR=1.53, P=0.0022). For patients with baseline disease point=4 (critically severe category), no similar comparisons were statistically significant. Conclusion and Discussion: The Chinese trial was not really under-powered as previously perceived or portrayed by many opinions. This result supports the preliminary findings of ACTT that remdesivir is effective for patients who were not critically severe. This result also suggests that remdesivir should be given to hospitalized COVID-19 patients as soon as possible. There is no race difference in the treatment effect.","Shih, Weichung J.; Shen, Xin; Zhang, Peng; Xie, Tai",Open Access J. Clin.,,510

Provision of the cell-adhesive surface is an important requirement to improve its biocompatibility. An aqueous solution of hyaluronic acid possessing phenolic hydroxyl (HA-Ph) moieties is gellable via a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed oxidative cross-linking reaction. This study evaluates the effect of different degrees of cross-linked Ph moieties on cellular adhesiveness and proliferation on the resultant enzymatically cross-linked HA-Ph hydrogels. Mechanical characterization demonstrated that the compression force of engineered hydrogels could be tuned in the range of 0.05-35 N by changing conjugated Ph moieties in the precursor formulation. The water contact angle and water content show hydrophobicity of hydrogels increased with increasing content of cross-linked Ph groups. The seeded mouse embryo fibroblast-like cell line and human cervical cancer cell line, on the HA-Ph hydrogel, proved cell attachment and spreading with a high content of cross-linked Ph groups. The HA-Ph with a higher degree of Ph moieties shows the maximum degree of cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation which presents this hydrogel as a suitable biomaterial for biomedical and tissue engineering applications.","Bagheri, Sara; Bagher, Zohreh; Hassanzadeh, Sajad; Simorgh, Sara; Kamrava, Seyed Kamran; Nooshabadi, Vajihe Taghdiri; Shabani, Ronak; Jalessi, Maryam; Khanmohammadi, Mehdi",J. biomed. mater. res.

447646,"Have we learnt anything from COVID-19, and can we put it to good use in the future?",2020,"We experienced a 72-year-old man who developed laboratory-confirmed human coronavirus HKU1 pneumonia. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen was negative twice, and rapid immunochromatographic antibody test (RIAT) using a commercially available kit for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 showed him turning positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We then performed RIAT in stored serum samples from other patients who suffered laboratory-confirmed human common cold coronaviruses (n = 6) and viruses other than coronavirus (influenza virus, n = 3; rhinovirus, n = 3; metapneumovirus, n = 1; adenovirus, n = 1) admitted until January 2019. Including the present case, four of 7 (57%) showed false-positive RIAT results due to human common cold coronaviruses infection. Two of the 4 patients showed initial negative to subsequent positive RIAT results, indicating seroconversion. RIAT was positive for IgG and IgM in viruses other than coronavirus in 2 (25.0%) and 1 (12.5%) patient.

447698,Investigation of the Status of Nurses Returning to Work After Recovering From COVID-19 and Influencing Factors,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human respiratory viral infection that has rapidly progressed into a pandemic, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Blood clotting disorders and acute respiratory failure have surfaced as the major complications among the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, more than 70% of deaths related to COVID-19 are attributed to clotting-associated complications such as pulmonary embolism, strokes and multi-organ failure. These vascular complications have been confirmed by autopsy. This study summarizes the current understanding and explains the possible mechanisms of the blood clotting disorder, emphasizing the role of (1) hypoxia-related activation of coagulation factors like tissue factor, a significant player in triggering coagulation cascade, (2) cytokine storm and activation of neutrophils and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps and (3) immobility and ICU related risk factors.","Pujhari, Sujit; Paul, Sanjeeta; Ahluwalia, Jasmina; Rasgon, Jason L",Rev Med Virol,,510

METHODS: We present an initial online survey in 6416 Chinese about the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic and addictive behavior in China. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 46.8% of the subjects reported increased dependence on internet use, and 16.6% had longer hours of internet use. The prevalence (4.3%) of severe internet dependence rose up to 23% than that (3.5%) before the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, and their dependence degree rose 20 times more often than being declined (60% vs 3%). Relapses to abuse from alcohol and smoking abstinence were relatively common at 19% and 25%, respectively. Similarly, 32% of regular alcohol drinkers and 20% of regular smokers increased their usage amount during the pandemic. CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: These three coping behaviors (internet, alcohol, and smoking) during this COVID-19-related crisis appear to have increased the risk for substance use disorders and internet addiction.

Here, a bibliometric study of the publications in environmental studies has been conducted to identify the emerging research trends in this field in the era of COVID-19. Bibliometric analysis serves as a useful tool to evaluate research productivity and scholarly trends in a field. For this, publications were searched in nine environment-related subject categories indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) database of the Web of Science Core Collection. A bibliometric evaluation of 495 relevant documents was performed to identify various essential research indicators, including the type of the publication, the most prominent journals, subject categories, authors, institutions, and the countries, that contributed significantly to this theme. Major focus of this bibliometric study is to illustrate the potential research hotspots emerged during this pandemic. It has been found that significant amount of research has been conducted for the assessment of environmental quality and its contribution in environmental transmission of COVID-19. In addition to its positive impacts on environment, COVID-19 has contributed indirectly in worsening many environmental threats such as increased exposure to disinfectants and antimicrobials, poor solid waste management, and food insecurity. Researchers have also been focusing on the strategies for the planning of post-COVID-19 cities and buildings and to protect the ecology.

We propose that an imbalance in the action of ACE1- and ACE2-derived peptides, thereby enhancing angiotensin II (Ang II) signalling is primary driver of COVID-19 pathobiology. ACE1/ACE2 imbalance occurs due to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, reducing ACE2-mediated conversion of Ang II to Ang peptides that counteract pathophysiological effects of ACE1-generated ANG II. This hypothesis suggests several approaches to treat COVID-19 by restoring ACE1/ACE2 balance: (a) AT receptor antagonists; (b) ACE1 inhibitors (ACEIs); (iii) agonists of receptors activated by ACE2-derived peptides (e.g. Ang (1-7), which activates MAS1); (d) recombinant human ACE2 or ACE2 peptides as decoys for the virus. Reducing ACE1/ACE2 imbalance is predicted to blunt COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable patients. Importantly, approved AT antagonists and ACEIs can be rapidly repurposed to test their efficacy in treating COVID-19.

454656,Providing comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation during and after the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Community engagement has been considered a fundamental component of past outbreaks, such as Ebola. However, there is concern over the lack of involvement of communities and 'bottom-up' approaches used within COVID-19 responses thus far. Identifying how community engagement approaches have been used in past epidemics may support more robust implementation within the COVID-19 response. METHODOLOGY: A rapid evidence review was conducted to identify how community engagement is used for infectious disease prevention and control during epidemics. Three databases were searched in addition to extensive snowballing for grey literature. Previous epidemics were limited to Ebola, Zika, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndromeand H1N1 since 2000. No restrictions were applied to study design or language. RESULTS: From 1112 references identified, 32 articles met our inclusion criteria, which detail 37 initiatives. Six main community engagement actors were identified: local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility committees, individuals and key stakeholders. These worked on different functions: designing and planning, community entry and trust building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration. CONCLUSION: COVID-19's global presence and social transmission pathways require social and community responses. This may be particularly important to reach marginalised populations and to support equity-informed responses. Aligning previous community engagement experience with current COVID-19 community-based strategy recommendations highlights how communities can play important and active roles in prevention and control. Countries worldwide are encouraged to assess existing community engagement structures and use community engagement approaches to support contextually specific, acceptable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention and control measures.","Gilmore, Brynne; Ndejjo, Rawlance; Tchetchia, Adalbert; de Claro, Vergil; Mago, Elizabeth; Diallo, Alpha A; Lopes, Claudia; Bhattacharyya, Sanghita",,,510

Selection criteria We incLuded both case -control designs and consecutive series of patients that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine Laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID-19 The reference standard could be reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) alone;RT-PCR pLus clinical expertise or and imaging;repeated RT-PCR several days apart or from different samples;WHO and other case definitions;and any other reference standard used by the study authors Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study They also assessed the methodologicaLquaLity of the studies, using QUADAS-2 We used the 'NLMIXED' procedure in SAS 9 4 forthe hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) meta analyses of tests for which we included four or more studies To facilitate interpretation of resuLts, for each meta-ana Lysis we estimated summary sensitivity at the points on the SROC curve that corresponded to the median and interquartile range boundaries of specificities in the included studies Main results We included 21 studies in this review, including 14,126 COVI D-19 patients and 56,585 non-COVID-19 patients in total Studies evaluated a total of 67 different laboratory tests Although we were interested in the diagnotic accuracy of routine tests for COVID-19, the included studies used detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection through RT-PCR as reference standard There was considerable heterogeneity between tests, threshold values and the settings in which they were applied For some tests a positive result was defined as a decrease compared to normal vaues, for other tests a positive result was defined as an increase, and for some tests both increase and decrease may have indicated test positivity None of the studies had either Low risk of bias on aLl domains or low concerns for applicabiLity for all domains Only three of the tests evaluated had a summary sensitivity and specificity over 50% These were: increase in interleu kin -6, increase in Creactive protein and lymphocyte count decrease Blood count Eleven studies evaluated a decrease in white blood cell count, with a median specificity of 930/0 and a summary sensitivity of 25% (95% Cl 8 0% to 27%;very low -certainty evidence) The 15 studies that evaluated an increase in white blood cell count

studies) was 73% (95% CI 36% to 93%) at median specificity (58%) (very low -certainty evidence) Other biomarkers The summary sensitivity of an increase in creatine kinase (5 studies) was 11% (95% CI 60/0 to 190/0) at median specificity (94%) (low -certainty evidence) The summary sensitivity of an increase in serum creatinine (four studies) was 7% (95% CI 10/0 to 37%) at median specificity (91%;low -certainty evidence) The summary sensitivity of an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (4 studies) was 25% (95% CI 15% to 38%) at median specificity (72%;very low -certainty evidence) Authors' conclusions Although these tests give an indication about the general health status of patients and some tests may be specific indicators for inflammatory processes, none of the tests we investigated

456002,"The personal and professional impact of COVID-19 on orthopedic surgery trainees: reflections from an incoming intern, current intern, and chief resident",2020,"We have used the Nanopore long-read sequencing platform to demonstrate how amazingly complex the human adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) transcriptome is with a flexible splicing machinery producing a range of novel mRNAs both from the early and late transcription units. In total we report more than 900 alternatively spliced mRNAs produced from the Ad2 transcriptome whereof more than 850 are novel mRNAs. A surprising finding was that more than 50% of all E1A transcripts extended upstream of the previously defined transcriptional start site. The novel start sites mapped close to the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) and within the E1A enhancer region. We speculate that novel promoters or enhancer driven transcription, so-called eRNA transcription, is responsible for producing these novel mRNAs. Their existence was verified by a peptide in the Ad2 proteome that was unique for the E1A ITR mRNA. Although we show a high complexity of alternative splicing from most early and late regions, the E3 region was by far the most complex when expressed at late times of infection. More than 400 alternatively spliced mRNAs were observed in this region alone. These mRNAs included extended L4 mRNAs containing E3 and L5 sequences and readthrough mRNAs combining E3 and L5 sequences. Our findings demonstrate that the virus has a remarkable capacity to produce novel exon combinations, which will offer the virus an evolutionary advantage to change the gene expression repertoire and protein production in an evolving environment.IMPORTANCE Work in the adenovirus system led to the groundbreaking discovery of RNA splicing and alternative RNA splicing in 1977. These mechanisms are essential in mammalian evolution by increasing the coding capacity of a genome. Here, we have used a long-read sequencing technology to characterize the complexity of human adenovirus pre-mRNA splicing in detail. It is mindboggling that the viral genome, which only houses around 36,000 bp, not being much larger than a single cellular gene, generates more than 900 alternatively spliced mRNAs. Recently, adenoviruses have been used as the backbone in several promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Further improvement of adenovirus-based vaccines demands that the virus can be tamed into an innocent carrier of foreign genes. This requires a full understanding of the components that govern adenovirus replication and gene expression.","Westergren Jakobsson, Amanda; Segerman, Bo; Wallerman, Ola; Lind, Sara Bergström; Zhao, Hongxing; Rubin, Carl-Johan; Pettersson, Ulf; Akusjärvi, Göran",J. virol,,510

METHODS: Six photoelastic models were fabricated with an epoxy resin material (West System 105 Epoxy Resin/205 Fast Hardener, West System) to represent BJ and FE preparation configurations at 0° and 20° loading angulations. Lithium disilicate ceramic veneers (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) were bonded to the BJ and FE photoelastic models using resin cement (IPS Variolink Esthetic, Ivoclar Vivadent). Each model was loaded using an Instron Universal Testing Machine at the incisal edge at a cross-head speed of 0.25 mm/min till 100 N. RESULTS: BJ photoelastic model had more uniform distribution compared with FE photoelastic models under 0° and 20° loading angulations. CONCLUSION: Parallel to the results of our earlier load-to-failure published study, both incisal preparation designs affect stress distribution within the ceramic veneer-tooth system. BJ photoelastic model demonstrated a more uniform distribution compared with FE photoelastic model. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: BJ incisal preparation design has more uniform stress distribution than FE preparation design within the ceramic veneer-tooth system.","Chai, Sy Yin; Bennani, Vincent; Aarts, John M; Lyons, Karl; Das, Rag",,,510
457581,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on a Regional Stroke Thrombectomy Service in the United Kingdom,2020,"Worldwide morbidity and mortality associated with Covid-19 are severe and ongoing. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is said to be up to 95% effective against severe disease or death. We were able to demonstrate that an additional 9.8% of COVID-19 vaccine doses could theoretically be given if the residual vaccine within the reconstituted Pfizer vials after six doses are extracted were used. This could be achieved by aseptically combining this excess vaccine from multiple vials to achieve full 0.3ml doses. MethodsAn observational study was conducted in April, 2021, at a mass vaccine site run by a community volunteer organization on Bainbridge Island, Washington. We measured the amount of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that was left in 172 vials after six doses had been withdrawn per Centers for Disease Control (CDC) protocol. ResultsA total of 30.68 ml of leftover vaccine was measured and discarded as medical waste. 1,036 doses were given from these vials. An extra 102 doses theoretically could have been given using the residual vaccine in the vials. This would have resulted in 9.8% additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine without requiring new vials. ConclusionThe ability to combine solution from reconstituted Pfizer vaccine vials to minimize waste and obtain additional doses of vaccine could result in an increase in the number of individuals that could be vaccinated worldwide without additional cost. Further studies to validate our findings are warranted. Clinical trials to study the feasibility, safety and efficacy of protocols using this excess vaccine should be considered.","Hubbard, Stephen Thomas; Bais, Rajlaxmi",,,510

Sepsis is commonly present with high lethality in the severe forms of the disease. The virus-induced cytokine storm puts the immune system in overdrive at the expense of the pathogen-specific immune response and is likely to underlie the most advanced COVID-19 clinical features, including sepsis-related multiple organ dysfunction as well as the pathophysiological changes found in the lungs. We review the major therapeutic strategies that have been considered for sepsis and might be amenable to repurposing for COVID-19. We also discuss two different immunization strategies that have the potential to confer antiviral heterologous protection: innate-induced trained immunity and adaptive-induced immune response resetting.","Nowill, Alexandre E; de Campos-Lima, Pedro O",J Immunol,,510

METHODS: A total of 161 office workers (64.6%female) with a mean age of 38.2±9.5 years participated. The study was conducted as an online form. Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire, NORDIC Questionnaire, and questions about the work environment were used. The participants were asked to describe the current situation and retrospectively the situation 3 months before. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in the prevalence of MSP or between the mean number of body regions suffering from MSP before and during the lockdown. During the lockdown, a significant (pâ<â0.001) reduction in total PA and sport-related PA and a significant (pâ<â0.001) increase in work-related PA was noted. A significant drop in both workplace comfort rating (pâ<â0.05) and workplace ergonomics rating (pâ<â0.001) was suggested during the lockdown.

458459,COVID-19 outbreak: organisation of a geriatric assessment and coordination unit. A French example,2020,"Aspergillus is a ubiquitous fungus that causes a variety of clinical syndromes in the lung. The type and severity of airway and parenchymal disease produced by Aspergillus are influenced by the patient's immunologic status and the presence of pre-existing lung disease. There is increasing concern that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might be at risk of developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis co-infection particularly in the context of immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies. We present a case report of pseudomembranous aspergillus tracheobronchitis complicated by COVID-19 pneumonia. A 59-year-old female with a medical history of drug-induced interstitial lung disease from methotrexate, rheumatoid arthritis, was admitted to the intensive care unit secondary to dyspnea and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was diagnosed recently with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with remdesevir and high dose systemic corticosteroids for 14 days. one week after she is re-admitted with shortness of breath requiring high flow nasal cannula. she had a temperature of 38.2°, blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, and respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min. Chest auscultation was significant for diffuse bilateral inspiratory coarse crackles. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem. RT PCR COVID test remains positive since the last admission and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies are negative. Arterial blood gas values were pH 7.41, PaCO2 63 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg, and SaO2 91%. The complete blood count showed hemoglobin of 10.1 g/L and 16,800 leucocytes, with no growth in blood cultures. Initial CT chest reveals bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID pneumonia. Subsequently, she was intubated and mechanically ventilated for worsening respiratory failure, empiric micafungin was started. A bronchoscopy demonstrated extensive whitish exudative membranes covering the trachea and both mainstem bronchi. The endobronchial biopsy specimens and bronchial washing fluid revealed Aspergillus fumigatus. Serum Galactomannan and fungitel came back positive. Micafungin was changed to isavuconazole, two days later the patient developed refractory septic shock. Despite using isavuconazole and supportive care, acute deterioration followed with refractory hypoxemia and oliguria, resulting in a fatal cardiac arrest on the sixth day of the intensive care unit stay. Aspergillus tracheobronchitis is an unusual manifestation of IPA accounts for &lt;10% of cases. diagnosis of this condition is extremely difficult and hence is delayed given its relatively nonspecific presentation and the lack of specific radiographic findings. This case illustrates a need for careful screening for opportunistic infections in patients treated with high-dose systemic steroids, immunomodulators with underlying COVID pneumonia.","Katta, S.; Khoshnevis, M.

This case report describes a non-diabetic patient without any other chronic diseases, who experienced mild hypoglycemia related to HCQ used for COVID-19 treatment.Methods: All etiologies causing hypoglycemia were investigated and a 72-hour fast test was performed.Results: A 34-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with a high fever, cough, and chest pain. The result of his COVID-19 PCR test was positive. He received HCQ for 10 days for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. He experienced fatigue, dizziness, severe headache, weakness and feeling of hunger after discontinuation of HCQ during his isolation at home. Before COVID-19 infection, he never experienced hypoglycemia symptoms. He did not have a history of chronic diseases, drug use, alcohol consumption, or smoking. A 72-hour fasting test was performed. He complained about headache and weakness during the 72-hour test period. The PG level was determined as 49 mg/dl during these symptoms. Concurrent insulin and C-peptide levels were <2 mU/mL and 0.553 ng/mL, respectively. ACTH, cortisol, growth hormones, liver and kidney function tests were normal. HbA1c level was 4.7% (28 mmol/mol) (Normal Range %4,5-5,7).Conclusion: Hypoglycemia may be observed as an adverse effect of HCQ used for COVID-19 infection even in patients without chronic diseases and comorbidities. We must be careful while using HCQ for these patients and must warn them about this effect. The warning about hypoglycemia effect of HCQ must be added to COVID-19 treatment guidelines.","Imanova Yaghji, Narimana; Kan, Elif Kilic; Akcan, Songul; Colak, Ramis; Atmaca, Aysegul",Postgrad Med,,510
460006,The impact of the COVID-19 disease on the referral and admission of the non-COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in China. The high potential of human-to-human transmission led to subsequent COVID-19 global pandemic. Public health strategies including reduced social contact and lockdown have been adopted in many countries. Nonetheless, social distancing and isolation could also represent risk factors for mental disorders, resulting in loneliness, reduced social support and under-detection of mental health needs. Along with this, social distancing determines a relevant obstacle for direct access to psychiatric care services. The pandemic generates the urgent need for integrating technology into innovative models of mental healthcare. AIMS: In this paper, we discuss the potential role of telepsychiatry (TP) and other cutting-edge technologies in the management of mental health assistance. We narratively review the literature to examine the advantages and risks related to the extensive application of these new therapeutic settings, along with the possible limitations and ethical concerns. RESULTS: Telemental health services may be particularly feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members and healthcare providers during this COVID-19 pandemic. The integration of TP with other technological innovations (eg, mobile apps, virtual reality, big data and artificial intelligence (AI)) opens up interesting future perspectives for the improvement of mental health assistance. CONCLUSION: Telepsychiatry is a promising and growing way to deliver mental health services but is still underused. The COVID-19 pandemic may serve as an opportunity to introduce and promote, among numerous mental health professionals, the knowledge of the possibilities offered by the digital era.","Di Carlo, Francesco; Sociali, Antonella; Picutti, Elena; Pettorruso, Mauro; Vellante, Federica; Verrastro, Valeria; Martinotti, Giovanni; di Giannantonio, Massimo",,,510
460055,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retinopathy of prematurity practice: an Indian perspective,2020,"This study examines secondary teachers' efficacy for teaching in a fully online teaching environment during the sudden transition to online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic The study sought to identify how specific variables, teaching experience, professional development (PD) experience, and teaching supports correlate with the self-efficacy perceptions of teachers transitioning to online teaching during a pandemic More specifically, we examined self-efficacy perceptions of teachers in the domains of student engagement, instructional strategies, classroom management, and computer skills The instrument used to measure teacher efficacy for online teaching was a 32-item, web-based survey that was given to Ontario secondary teachers in a southern Ontario Catholic district school board We argue that prior experience with online learning such as additional qualification (AQ) courses or online PD would build greater self-efficacy amongst teachers as they transition to online learning The results indicate that higher online teaching efficacy scores correlated with having taken online AQ courses and online PD sessions The highest online teaching efficacy scores correlated with having previously used a board-provided learning management system (LMS) and using virtual technology supports These indicators are correlated with higher scores of online teaching efficacy but require further investigation as to how they can better provide support for teachers in online learning environments","Dolighan, T.; Owen, M.",Brock Education-a Journal of Educational Research and Practice,,510

460712,Internalized HIV Stigma and Pain among Women with HIV in the United States: The Mediating Role of Depressive Symptoms,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the practicing gastroenterologist in several ways. Although majority of COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are also seen. COVID-19 has also disrupted gastrointestinal endoscopy services in numerous ways. There are also concerns regarding the impact of these changes on gastrointestinal cancer screening and management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the implications of COVID-19 for the practicing gastroenterologist. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 patients can have gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia. Separate from the management of COVID-19 patients, there has been a reduction in endoscopy volume worldwide. This has also resulted in reduction/cessation of in-person clinic visits and an increasing use of telemedicine services. In addition, patients with certain chronic diseases like chronic liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease may have worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY: Gastroenterologists need to rapidly adapt to the challenges being faced and need to make both systems and practice-based changes to the endoscopy unit and outpatient clinic practices. Gastroenterologists should stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving literature regarding gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients as well as its impact on chronic gastrointestinal illnesses.","Bilal, Mohammad; Sawhney, Mandeep S; Feuerstein, Joseph D",Curr Opin Gastroenterol,,510

This article reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Historically, it has caused two pandemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome followed by the present COVID-19 that emerged from China. The virus is believed to be acquired from zoonotic source and spreads through direct and contact transmission. The symptomatic phase manifests with fever, cough and myalgia to severe respiratory failure. The diagnosis is confirmed using reverse transcriptase PCR. Management of COVID-19 is mainly by supportive therapy along with mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Preventive strategies form the major role in reducing the public spread of virus along with successful disease isolation and community containment. Development of a vaccine to eliminate the virus from the host still remains an ongoing challenge.","Umakanthan, Srikanth; Sahu, Pradeep; Ranade, Anu V; Bukelo, Maryann M; Rao, Joseph Sushil; Abrahao-Machado, Lucas Faria; Dahal, Samarika; Kumar, Hari; Kv, Dhananjaya",Postgrad Med J,,510

461367,Dental practice during the era of COVID-19 pandemic: An Egyptian experience,2021,"AIM: To summarize what we know so far about coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children. METHOD: We searched PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. We selected randomized trials, observational studies, case series or case reports, and research letters of children ages birth to 18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to calculate the weighted mean prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) or the weighted average means and 95% CI. RESULT: Forty-six articles reporting 551 cases of COVID-19 in children (aged 1 day-17.5 years) were included. Eighty-seven percent (95% CI: 77%-95%) of patients had household exposure to COVID-19. The most common symptoms and signs were fever (53%, 95% CI: 45%-61%), cough (39%, 95% CI: 30%-47%), and sore throat/pharyngeal erythema (14%, 95% CI: 4%-28%); however, 18% (95% CI: 11%-27%) of cases were asymptomatic. The most common radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings were patchy consolidations (33%, 95% CI: 23%-43%) and ground glass opacities (28%, 95% CI: 18%-39%), but 36% (95% CI: 28%-45%) of patients had normal CT images. Antiviral agents were given to 74% of patients (95% CI: 52%-92%). Six patients, all with major underlying medical conditions, needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and one of them died. CONCLUSION: Previously healthy children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms. The diagnosis is generally suspected from history of household exposure to COVID-19 case. Children with COVID-19 and major underlying condition are more likely to have severe/critical disease and poor prognosis, even death.","Zhang, Linjie; Peres, Tyele G; Silva, Marcus V F; Camargos, Paulo",Pediatr Pulmonol,,510

To obviate the need for phlebotomy services, we validated dried blood spots (DBS) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. Immunoglobulins were extracted from 3 mm DBS punches and the extracts were analyzed using the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA. Various pre-analytical factors were studied. Results were favorable for DBS stored for at least 67 days at or below 37°C. Comparison between paired serum and DBS specimens tested by the Euroimmun ELISA showed 96.8% and 81.3% positive and negative agreement, respectively, indicating that confirmatory testing of positive Euroimmun results on DBS extracts is necessary to achieve clinical accuracy. Our findings suggest that any SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay that requires pre-dilution of serum is amenable to DBS as an alternate specimen type that is relatively low cost, self-collectable, stable, can be shipped by standard mail and could be used to establish the seroprevalence of large populations.","Turgeon, Coleman T; Sanders, Karen A; Granger, Dane; Nett, Stephanie L; Hilgart, Heather; Matern, Dietrich; Theel, Elitza S",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,510
464441,Blood transfusion activity in a general hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"With the current COVID-19 outbreak, it has become essential to develop efficient methods for the treatment and detection of this virus. Among the new approaches that could be tested, that relying on nanotechnology finds one of its main grounds in the similarity between nanoparticle (NP) and coronavirus (COV) sizes, which promotes NP-COV interactions. Since COVID-19 is very recent, most studies in this field have focused on other types of coronavirus than COVID-19, such as those involved in MERS or SARS diseases. Although their number is limited, they have led to promising results on various COV using a wide range of different types of nanosystems, e.g., nanoparticles, quantum dos, or nanoassemblies of polymers/proteins. Additional efforts deserve to be spent in this field to consolidate these findings. Here, I first summarize the different nanotechnology-based methods used for COV detection, i.e., optical, electrical, or PCR ones, whose sensitivity was improved by the presence of nanoparticles. Furthermore, I present vaccination methods, which comprise nanoparticles used either as adjuvants or as active principles. They often yield a better-controlled immune response, possibly due to an improved antigen presentation/processing than in non-nanoformulated vaccines. Certain antiviral approaches also took advantage of nanoparticle uses, leading to specific mechanisms such as the blocking of virus replication at the cellular level or the reduction of a COV induced apoptotic cellular death.","Alphandéry, Edouard",Bioconjug Chem,,510

This is due to the absence of a systematic and measurable system in determining which citizens are eligible as recipients of social assistance. To help PW Tabita, it is necessary to establish a system capable of providing output recommendations for the selection of the most appropriate community members as recipients of social assistance. The criteria for selecting social assistance recipients refer to the fulfillment of several elements, namely: employment status, monthly income, number of dependents, residence status, electricity tariff status, insurance participants, and PKH (Family Hope Program) participants. The Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) method is a method applied in this research. The results showed that determining the appropriate weight for each criterion greatly influenced the results of the calculation of the recommendation for providing social funds for people affected by COVID-19. Then in order to obtain more accurate results, it is necessary to test the validity of the criteria to obtain more precise criteria in accordance with the eligibility needs of receiving social funds for community members affected by COVID-19 from PW Tabita.","Hutagalung, Bambang Tj; Siregar, Elida Tuti; Lubis, Juanda Hakim",Jurnal Media Informatika Budidarma,,510

466559,Letter to the Editor: Targeting adverse stress-related consequences of the COVID-19 crisis in individuals with psychotic disorders and childhood maltreatment,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 triggered the largest human-virus war in this century. Current evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus is mainly transmitted by droplets either by direct or indirect contact. The duration of infectiousness of COVID-19 ranges from 1-2 days before and 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms. It is often difficult to detect the signs and symptoms of infection and to implement timely intervention during the very early stage of infection. Thus, finding and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to contain this epidemic. Therefore, it is very important to wear masks, take personal precautions, and practice recommended social distancing to achieve source control and stop transmission. Taiwan has learned from its previous experience with the SARS epidemic and prepared for the potential of new disease outbreaks for at least 17 years. This helped the government to implement a multifaceted strategy in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Taiwan's effective response has made the country a model for pandemic response policy that has been appreciated internationally. This paper examines COVID-19 epidemic prevention from the perspective of infection control strategies. In Taiwan, hospital infection control, which is practiced nationwide, emphasizes the importance to epidemic prevention of collecting and tracking travel history, occupation, contact history, cluster (TOCC) information; practicing hand hygiene; promoting the correct use of personal protective equipment; and maintaining safe distances from others. Personal control measures are recognized as critical to providing a safe environment for patients and staff.","Huang, Wan-Tsuei; Chen, Yin-Yin",Hu Li Za Zhi,,510

Whether COVID-19 risk is associated with differences in vitamin D levels of 30 ng/mL or greater is not known. Objective: To examine whether COVID-19 test results are associated with differences in vitamin D levels of 30 ng/mL or greater, including for White individuals and for Black individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at an academic medical center in Chicago, Illinois. Participants included individuals with data on vitamin D level within 365 days before COVID-19 testing, which was conducted from March 3 to December 30, 2020. Data were analyzed from September 11, 2020, to February 5, 2021. Exposures: The last vitamin D level before COVID-19 testing was categorized as less than 20 ng/mL (ie, deficient), 20 to less than 30 ng/mL (ie, insufficient), 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, or 40 ng/mL or greater. Treatment was defined by vitamin D type and dose 14 days before COVID-19 testing and treatment changes after last vitamin D level. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was a positive result for COVID-19 in polymerase chain reaction testing. Multivariable analyses tested whether previously measured vitamin D level was associated with having test results positive for COVID-19 in White individuals and in Black individuals, controlling for months and treatment changes since the vitamin D level was measured, as well as demographic characteristics and comorbidity indicators. Results: A total of 4638 individuals (mean [SD] age 52.8 [19.5] years; 3205 [69%] women) had data for a vitamin D level within 1 year before COVID-19 testing, including 2288 (49%) Black individuals, 1999 (43%) White individuals, and 351 individuals (8%) who were another race/ethnicity (eg, Asian, Mideast Indian, >1 race). Stratified by vitamin D level, 1251 individuals (27%) had less than 20 ng/mL, 1267 individuals (27%) had 20 to less than 30 ng/mL, 1023 individuals (22%) had 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, and 1097 individuals (24%) had 40 ng/mL or greater. Lower vitamin D levels were more common in Black individuals (<20 ng/mL: 829 of 2288 Black individuals [36%]) than White individuals (<20 ng/mL: 315 of 1999 White individuals [16%]). A total of 333 individuals (7%) had test results positive for COVID-19, including 102 White individuals (5%) and 211 Black individuals (9%). Multivariate analysis controlling for time since last vitamin D level measurement was used to estimate the outcomes associated with levels 14 days before COVID-19 testing. A positive test result for COVID-19 was not significantly associated with vitamin D levels in White individuals but was associated with vitamin D levels in Black individuals (compared with &#8805;40 ng/mL: <20 ng/mL incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.55 [95% CI, 1.26-5.15]; P = .009; 20 to <30 ng/mL IRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 0.75-3.84]; P = .21; 30 to <40 ng/mL IRR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.24-5.66]; P = .01). Stratified by vitamin D level, estimated COVID-19 positivity rates in Black individuals were 9.72% (95% CI, 6.74%-13.41%) for individuals with a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, 6.47% (95% CI, 3.33%-10.28%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 20 to less than 30 ng/mL, 10.10% (95% CI, 6.00%-15.47%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, and 3.82% (95% CI, 1.78%-6.68%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 40 ng/mL or higher. Multivariate analysis in individuals with a vitamin D level of 30 ng/mL or greater found that the IRR of a positive COVID-19 test result was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P = .008) per 1-ng/mL increase in vitamin D overall and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98; P = .003) per 1-ng/mL increase in vitamin D in Black individuals. Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 risk increased among Black individuals with vitamin D level less than 40 ng/mL compared with those with 40 ng/mL or greater and decreased with increasing levels among individuals with levels greater than 30 ng/mL. No significant associations were noted for White individuals. Randomized clinical trials should examine whether increasing vitamin D level to greater than 40 ng/mL affects COVID-19 risk.","Meltzer, David O; Best, Thomas J; Zhang, Hui; Vokes, Tamara; Arora, Vineet M; Solway, Julian",JAMA Netw Open,,510
467185,Altitude and excess mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in Peru,2020,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a well-known player of diabetes mellitus (DM)-related morbidities, was supposed to be involved in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), but no data exist about COVID-19, DM, and the soluble RAGE (sRAGE) forms. We quantified total sRAGE and its forms, the endogenously secretory esRAGE and the membrane-cleaved cRAGE, in COVID-19 patients with and without DM and in healthy individuals to explore how COVID-19 may affect these molecules and their potential role as biomarkers. Circulating sRAGE and esRAGE were quantified by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays. cRAGE was obtained by subtracting esRAGE from total sRAGE. sRAGE, esRAGE, cRAGE, and the cRAGE/esRAGE ratio did not differ between DM and non-DM patients and had the same trend when compared to healthy individuals. Levels of total sRAGE, cRAGE, and cRAGE/esRAGE ratio were upregulated, while esRAGE was downregulated. The lack of difference between DM and non-DM COVID-19 patients in the levels of sRAGE and its forms supports the hypothesis that in COVID-19 the RAGE system is modulated regardless of glycemic control. Identifying how sRAGE and its forms associate to COVID-19 prognosis and the potential of RAGE as a therapeutic target to control inflammatory burden seem of relevance to help treatment of COVID-19.","Dozio, Elena; Sitzia, Clementina; Pistelli, Lara; Cardani, Rosanna; Rigolini, Roberta; Ranucci, Marco; Corsi Romanelli, Massimiliano M",,,510

As a critical component of a subunit vaccine, the adjuvant is responsible for strengthening the antigen-induced immune responses. Here, we present a new nanovaccine that comprising the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of spike protein and the manganese nanoadjuvant (MnARK), which induces humoral and cellular responses. Notably, even at a 5-fold lower antigen dose and with fewer injections, mice immunized with the MnARK vaccine immunized mice showed stronger neutralizing abilities against the infection of the pseudovirus (~270-fold) and live coronavirus (>8-fold) in vitro than that of Alum-adsorbed RBD vaccine (Alu-RBD). Furthermore, we found that the effective co-delivery of RBD antigen and MnARK to lymph nodes (LNs) elicited an increased cellular internalization and the activation of immune cells, including DC cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Our findings highlight the importance of MnARK adjuvant in the design of novel coronavirus vaccines and provide a rationale strategy to design protective vaccines through promoting cellular internalization and the activation of immune-related pathways.","Wang, Yaling; Xie, Yuping; Luo, Jia; Guo, Mengyu; Hu, Xuhao; Chen, Xi; Chen, Ziwei; Lu, Xinyi; Mao, Lichun; Zhang, Kai; Wei, Liangnian; Ma, Yunfei; Wang, Ruixin; Zhou, Jia; He, Chunyan; Zhang, Yufang; Zhang, Ye; Chen, Sisi; Shen, Lijuan; Chen, Yun; Qiu, Nasha; Liu, Ying; Cui, Yanyan; Liao, Guoyang; Liu, Ye; Chen, Chunying",Nano Today,,510

Our study investigates the effect of the pandemic on functional outcomes for patients presenting with stroke-like symptoms in two high-volume Tele-Stroke networks. Methods: We performed retrospective chart review of 7689 consecutive patients seen through two Tele-Stroke networks (Medical University of South Carolina and Augusta University) from July 2019 through May 2020. Discharge outcomes were assessed using modified Rankin scale (mRS). We dichotomized patients to preCOVID-19 pandemic (July 2019 to February 2020) and during COVID- 19 pandemic (March to May 2020). Results: During COVID, a higher percentage of patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (14.2% vs 11.3% before, p=0.001), despite a similar baseline NIHSS. Also, patients during the pandemic had a shorter symptom-onset to hospital door time (288 vs 353, P=0.012). Demographics were similar between groups, other than older age in patients presenting during COVID (66.02 vs 65.15 before, p=0.04) (table 1). During the pandemic, a higher percentage of patients had a poor functional outcome, as defined by mRS 3-6 (35.7% vs 30% before, p=0.012), and a higher percentage died or were discharged to hospice (7.0% vs 5.1%, p=0.000). Conclusions: Despite earlier ED presentation and increased tPA administration, our results demonstrate worse discharge outcomes during the pandemic in two large telestroke networks. Changes in workflow and resulting delays during COVID-19 may explain these findings.","Cummings, C.; Almallouhi, E.; Al Kasab, S.; Barnes, H.; Shah, M.; Giurgiutiu, D. V.; Switzer, J.

Also, vitamin D deficiency attenuate the immune system and predispose a person more susceptible to infection. In this context, we aimed to evaluate vitamin D, Electrolytes, Complete blood count, Liver enzymes, Urea, Creatinine, Albumin, CRP and ESR levels in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 118 patients with Covid-19 who were hospitalized from 2020/2/19 to 2020/4/3 in ICU. Serum levels of electrolytes, liver enzymes, blood factors, urea, creatinine, CRP and ESR as well as anthropometric parameters and serum vitamin D concentration were measured. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients (80 male and 38 female) was enrolled in the study (65.05±15.75 years). Only 5.08% of patients had no risk factors and 55.9% had &#8805; 2 risk factors. Diabetes (44.1%) and obesity (23.7%) were more common among patients. Laboratory finding showed that 80.50% of patients had hyponatremia, but other electrolytes included K, Mg, Ca and P were normal in majority of participants as well as CBC, Cr, Urea, Alb, ALT and ALKP. The AST concentration increased in most patients (66.94%). All patients had high levels of inflammatory factors such as CRP and ESR. The mean of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels in participants (25.95 ± 14.56 ng/mL) was lower than its levels in general papulation. However, it was not statistically significant (P= 0.88). A significant negative correlation found between vitamin D and ALT (P= 0.02, -0.21) as well as vitamin D and CRP (P= 0.05, -0.17). CONCLUSION: Regarding to the regulatory role of vitamin D in immune system and low levels of vitamin D in Covid-19 infected patients, the evaluation of vitamin D levels and prescribe supplements if necessary is suggested.","Abdollahi, Hamed; Salehinia, Farahnaz; Badeli, Mostafa; Karimi, Elmira; Gandomkar, Hossein; Asadollahi, Amin; Sedighiyan, Mohsen; Abdolahi, Mina",Endocr. metab. immune disord. drug targets,,510

Yet, factors that limit the individuals' ability to fully realise their mobility needs will ultimately affect the opportunities they can have access to (e.g. cultural activities, professional interactions). One important aspect frequently overlooked in human mobility studies is how gender-centred issues can amplify other sources of mobility disadvantages (e.g. socioeconomic inequalities), unevenly affecting the pool of opportunities men and women have access to. In this work, we leverage on a combination of computational, statistical, and information-theoretical approaches to investigate the existence of systematic discrepancies in the mobility diversity (i.e. the diversity of travel destinations) of (1) men and women from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and (2) work and non-work travels. Our analysis is based on datasets containing multiple instances of large-scale, official, travel surveys carried out in three major metropolitan areas in South America: Medell\'in and Bogot\'a in Colombia, and S\~ao Paulo in Brazil. Our results indicate the presence of general discrepancies in the urban mobility diversities related to the gender and socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals. Lastly, this paper sheds new light on the possible origins of gender-level human mobility inequalities, contributing to the general understanding of disaggregated patterns in human mobility.","Macedo, Mariana; Lotero, Laura; Cardillo, Alessio; Menezes, Ronaldo; Barbosa, Hugo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06619v2.pdf,510
472456,Dementia or psychosis precipitated by social isolation? A brief case report in COVID-19 pandemic times,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed health care, forcing providers to adopt and implement telehealth technology to provide continuous care for their patients. Amid this rapid transition from in-person to remote visits, differences in telehealth utilization have arisen among neurosurgical subspecialties. In this study, we analyze the impact of telehealth on neurosurgical healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic at our institution and highlight differences in telehealth utilization across different neurosurgical subspecialties. METHODS: To quantify differences in telehealth utilization, we analyzed all outpatient neurosurgery visits at a single academic institution. Internal surveys were administered to neurosurgeons and to patients to determine both physician and patient satisfaction with telehealth visits. Patient Likelihood-to-Recommend Press-Ganey scores were also evaluated. RESULTS: There was a decrease in outpatient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic in all neurosurgical subspecialties. Telehealth adoption was higher in spine, tumor, and interventional pain than in functional, peripheral nerve, or vascular neurosurgery. Neurosurgeons agreed that telehealth was an efficient (92%) and effective (85%) methodology; however, they noted it was more difficult to evaluate and bond with patients. The majority of patients were satisfied with their video visits and would recommend video visits over in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, neurosurgical subspecialties varied in adoption of telehealth, which may be due to the specific nature of each subspecialty and their necessity to perform in-person evaluations. Telehealth visits will likely continue after the pandemic as they can improve clinical efficiency; overall, both patients and physicians are satisfied with health care delivery over video.","Leung, Christopher; Wadhwa, Harsh; Sklar, Matthew; Sheth, Kunj; Loo, Sophia; Ratliff, John; Zygourakis, Corinna C",World Neurosurg,,510
473377,Initiation of a survey of healthcare worker distress and moral injury at the onset of the COVID-19 surge,2020,"BACKGROUND: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard for angiographic evaluation of cerebrovascular pathology, however, multiple acquisitions requiring additional time and radiation are often needed. In contrast, 3D-DSA provides volumetric information from a single injection but neglects temporal information. Four-dimensional-DSA (4D-DSA) combines temporal information of 2D-DSA with volumetric information of 3D-DSA to provide time-resolved tomographic 3D reconstructions, potentially reducing procedure time and radiation. This work evaluates the diagnostic quality of virtual single-frame 4D-DSA relative to 2D-DSA images by assessing clinicians' ability to evaluate cerebrovascular pathology. METHODS: Single-frame images of four projections from 4D-DSA and their corresponding 2D-DSA images (n = 15) were rated by two neurointerventional radiologists. Images were graded based on diagnostic quality (0 = non-diagnostic, 1 = poor, 2 = acceptable, 3 = good). Dose area product (DAP) for each case was recorded for all 2D-DSA, 4D-DSA acquisitions, and the overall procedure. RESULTS: The mean diagnostic quality of all four 4D-DSA projections from both raters was 1.75 while the mean of 2D-DSA projections was 2.8. Student's t-test revealed significant difference in diagnostic quality between 4D-DSA and 2D-DSA at all four projections (p < 0.001). On average 4D-DSA acquisitions accounted for 30% dose compared to the overall average aggregated dose per procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in image quality between virtual single-frame 4D-DSA and their respective 2D-DSA images is statistically significant. Furthermore, 4D-DSA acquisitions require less radiation dose than conventional procedures with 2D-DSA acquisitions.","Yu, Jay F; Pung, Leland; Minami, Hataka; Mueller, Kerstin; Khangura, Rajkamal; Darflinger, Robert; Hetts, Steven W; Cooke, Daniel L",Interv Neuroradiol,,510

476064,Modeling the second wave of COVID-19 infections in France and Italy via a stochastic SEIR model,2020,"INTRODUCTION: As red blood cell distribution width (RDW) significantly predicts clinical outcomes in patients with respiratory tract infections and in those with critical illnesses, we performed a critical analysis of the literature to explore the potential prognostic role of this laboratory parameter in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: An electronic search was conducted in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science, using the keywords ""coronavirus disease 2019"" OR ""COVID-19"" AND ""red blood cell distribution width"" OR ""RDW"" in all fields, up to the present time, with no language restriction. Studies reporting the value of RDW-CV in CO-VID-19 patients with or without severe illness were included in a pooled analysis. RESULTS: The pooled analysis included 3 studies, totaling 11,445 COVID-19 patients' samples (2,654 with severe disease; 23.2%). In all investigations RDW-CV was higher in COVID-19 patients with severe illness than in those with mild disease, with differences between 0.30 and 0.70%. The pooled analysis, despite consistent heterogeneity (I2: 88%), revealed that the absolute RDW-CV value was 0.69% higher (95% CI 0.40-0.98%; p < 0.001) in COVID-19 patients with severe illness compared to those with mild disease. CONCLUSION: These results, along with data published in other studies, support the use of RDW for assessing the risk of unfavorable COVID-19 progression.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Henry, Brandon M; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian",Acta Haematol,,510
476474,Preprocedure COVID-19 Testing in Early Phase of Pandemic,2021,"The infection with a new type of virus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first described in December 2019, in Wuhan, China. Due to the gastrointestinal mucosa tropism of the virus, an attempt was made to describe the oral manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which permits the attachment of the virus, is present also in the oral cavity. There are many symptoms in the oral cavity; among them, the most prevalent ones are dysgeusia (taste disorders), oral pain, the exacerbation of autoimmune diseases as well as the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections. Ulcerations and aphthous stomatitis are also often mentioned. The research shows that there are many oral symptoms in COVID-19, but the coexistence with the main disease has not been fully stated and understood. There is still no clearance on whether the oral symptoms are the manifestations of the disease or occur due to the loss of the immune response. Therefore, further studies on this subject should be conducted.","Paradowska-Stolarz, Anna Maria",Dent Med Probl,,510

The virus led to a pandemic that affected the entire world. COVID-19 affects not only health, but also economic and social life. The emergence of this pandemic has led to health systems across the world being questioned. The aim of this study was to assess the adequacy of world health systems in the face of this pandemic. Twelve countries were selected and analyzed in the study. The choice of these countries was determined by the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Information concerning health systems and COVID-19 was obtained from Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 2018, World Health Organization 2020 and Deep Knowledge Group data and was subjected to statistical analysis. According to the analysis, the country with the highest investment in health expenditures is the United States (10586 US dollars/capita), and Germany stands out as the best in health services. Another finding is the first and second wave of COVID-19 was identified as the USA with the highest case and death rate (First wave cases 1.942.363 and deaths 110.514;second wave cases at 7.419.230 and deaths 2.09.450). As a result of the meta-analysis, it is revealed that only socio-economic power is not enough, countries with good health systems are more successful in the pandemic. In addition, the analysis once again reveal how important health systems are in the face of such a pandemic.","Keles, A. I.; Keles, G.",Journal of Experimental and Clinical Medicine (Turkey),,510

Gut microbiota may also play important roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, the association between gut microbiota and fever in individuals with moderate COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods: We compared the clinical features and laboratory results of 187 moderate COVID-19 patients with fever and without fever and identified several inflammatory markers in patients with fever. Then, we performed gut metagenome-wide association study for 31 individuals to identify the microbes and their epitopes which have potential role in fever and hyperinflammation. Results: Among 187 moderate COVID-19 patients, 127 (67.9%) patients presented with fever. Lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, while AST, LDH, CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly elevated in patients with fever. Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered in patients with fever compared with those with non-fever. Opportunistic pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were enriched in patients with fever. E. faecalis was positively correlated with LDH and D-dimer and negatively correlated with CD8+T cells and IL-4, while S. cerevisiae was positively correlated with diarrhea symptom. Furthermore, several species with anti-inflammatory and protective effects, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Eubacterium ramulus, were enriched in patients with non-fever. B. fragilis was positively correlated with lymphocytes, and E. ramulus was negatively correlated with LDH, AST and IL-6. Finally, we found that several bacterial epitopes of GroEL, a homolog of human HSP60, were enriched in patients with fever and positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, WBC, neutrophils, D-dimer, LDH, CRP, and E. faecalis. Conclusion: Gut microbiota dysbiosis correlates with abnormal immune response in moderate COVID-19 patients with fever.","Zhou, Y.; Shi, X.; Fu, W.; Xiang, F.; He, X.; Yang, B.; Wang, X.; Ma, W.

Extensive studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 shares many biological features with SARS-CoV, the zoonotic virus that caused the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, including the system of cell entry, which is triggered by binding of the viral spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Clinical studies have also reported an association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease seems to be linked with worse outcomes and increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19, whereas COVID-19 itself can also induce myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism. Potential drug-disease interactions affecting patients with COVID-19 and comorbid cardiovascular diseases are also becoming a serious concern. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of COVID-19 from basic mechanisms to clinical perspectives, focusing on the interaction between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. By combining our knowledge of the biological features of the virus with clinical findings, we can improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19, paving the way towards the development of preventative and therapeutic solutions.","Nishiga, Masataka; Wang, Dao Wen; Han, Yaling; Lewis, David B; Wu, Joseph C",Nat Rev Cardiol,,510

This study aimed to examine risks of VTE and major bleeding in hospitalized and community-managed SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with control populations. METHODS: Using nationwide population-based registries, 30-day risks of VTE and major bleeding in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were compared with those of SARS-CoV-2 test-negative patients and with an external cohort of influenza patients. Medical records of all COVID-19 patients at six departments of infectious diseases in Denmark were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: The overall 30-day risk of VTE was 0.4% (40/9,460) among SARS-CoV-2 patients (16% hospitalized), 0.3% (649/226,510) among SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects (12% hospitalized), and 1.0% (158/16,281) among influenza patients (59% hospitalized). VTE risks were higher and comparable in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive (1.5%), SARS-CoV-2 negative (1.8%), and influenza patients (1.5%). Diagnosis of major bleeding was registered in 0.5% (47/9,460) of all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and in 2.3% of those hospitalized. Medical record review of 582 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients observed VTE in 4% (19/450) and major bleeding in 0.4% (2/450) of ward patients, of whom 31% received thromboprophylaxis. Among intensive care patients (100% received thromboprophylaxis), risks were 7% (9/132) for VTE and 11% (15/132) for major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Among people with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-based setting, VTE risks were low to moderate and were not substantially increased compared with SARS-CoV-2 test-negative and influenza patients. Risk of severe bleeding was low for ward patients, but mirrored VTE risk in the intensive care setting.","Dalager-Pedersen, Michael; Lund, Lars Christian; Mariager, Theis; Winther, Rannva; Hellfritzsch, Maja; Larsen, Torben Bjerregaard; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich; Johansen, Nanna Borup; Søgaard, Ole Schmeltz; Nielsen, Stig Lønberg; Omland, Lars; Lundbo, Lene Fogt; Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Harboe, Zitta Barrella; Pottegård, Anton; Nielsen, Henrik; Bodilsen, Jacob",Clin. infect. dis,,510

Multiple studies suggest CT should be a primary diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) because they reported sensitivities with CT far superior to that of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. This review aimed to assess these reports and found chest CT to have a clinical utility that is limited, particularly for patients who show no symptoms and patients who are screened early in disease progression. CONCLUSION. CT has limited sensitivity for COVID-19 and a lower specificity than RT-PCR testing, and it carries a risk of exposing providers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Chest CT should be considered a supplemental diagnostic tool, particularly for patients who show symptoms.","Waller, Joseph V; Kaur, Parveer; Tucker, Amy; Lin, Keldon K; Diaz, Michael J; Henry, Travis S; Hope, Michael",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,510
479184,The use of patient-reported outcome measures to guide referral for hip and knee arthroplasty,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly spreading worldwide. In Germany, an exponential increase in the number of infections was registered at the beginning of March 2020 and led to a call of the Ministry of Health to create more capacity for intensive medical treatment in hospitals. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (ORL) university hospitals regarding patient care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was sent out to all chairmen of the 39 ORL university hospitals in Germany. The answers to the questions referred to the defined period from March 15th to April 15th 2020 and were carried out using the online survey tool ""SurveyMonkey"". 87 questions focused on general information, health care, and structural effects in the respective institution. RESULTS: All chairmen of the 39 university hospitals in Germany participated in the survey. The collected data prove the considerable impact on organizational, structural and medical aspects of patient care. For example, the surveyed clinics reported a decrease in outpatient cases by 73.8â% to 26.2â±â14.2â% and in surgical treatments by 65.9â% to 34.1â±â13.9â%. In contrast, emergency treatment remained unchanged or even increased in 80â% of the facilities and surgical treatment of emergency patients remained unchanged or even increased in more than 90â%. Emergency outpatient and surgical treatment of patients was provided throughout the pandemic in all facilities. In total, about 35â000 outpatients and about 12â000 surgical cases were postponed. As a result of the acute structural changes, the potential danger of falling below current treatment standards was seen in individual areas of patient care. DISCUSSION: The assessment of the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is heterogeneous. The majority of the chairmen are critically aware of the risk of falling below current medical treatment standards or guidelines. In the phase of an exponential increase in the number of infections, significant changes in treatment processes had to be accepted for understandable reasons. However, with the currently significantly reduced number of infections, falling below treatment standards and guidelines should not be allowed to remain constant and tolerated. SUMMARY: This study shows a differentiated picture with regard to the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on outpatient, inpatient and operative patient care at the ORL university hospitals in Germany and illustrates the importance of these institutions for ensuring patient care during this critical phase.","Stöver, T; Dazert, S; Hoffmann, T K; Plontke, S K; Ambrosch, P; Arens, C; Betz, C; Beutner, D; Bohr, C; Bruchhage, K-L; Canis, M; Dietz, A; Guntinas-Lichius, O; Hagen, R; Hosemann, W; Iro, H; Klussmann, J-P; Knopf, A; Kramer, S; Lang, S; Leinung, M; Lenarz, T; Löwenheim, H; Matthias, C; Mlynski, R; Olze, H; Park, J; Plinkert, P; Radeloff, A; Rotter, N; Rudack, C; Bozzato, A; Schipper, J; Schrader, M; Strieth, S; Stuck, B A; Volkenstein, S; Westhofen, M; Wolf, G; Wollenberg, B; Zahnert, T; Zenk, J",Laryngorhinootologie,,510

In this study, we aimed to explore the potential roles and molecular mechanisms of action of ADSCs in histone-induced endothelial damage. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 N mice were intravenously injected with ADSCs, followed by histones or a vehicle. The mice in each group were assessed for survival, pulmonary vascular permeability, and histological changes. A co-culture model with primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to histones was used to clarify the paracrine effect of ADSCs. Overexpression and inhibition of miR-126 ADSCs were also examined as causative factors for endothelial protection. RESULTS: The administration of ADSCs markedly improved survival, inhibited histone-mediated lung hemorrhage and edema, and attenuated vascular hyper-permeability in mice. ADSCs were engrafted in the injured lung and attenuated histone-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. ADSCs showed endothelial protection (via a paracrine effect) and Akt phosphorylation in the histone-exposed HUVECs. Notably, increased Akt phosphorylation by ADSCs was mostly mediated by exosomes in histone-induced cytotoxicity and lung damage. Moreover, the expression of miR-126 was increased in exosomes from histone-exposed ADSCs. Remarkably, the inhibition of miR-126 in ADSCs failed to increase Akt phosphorylation in histone-exposed HUVECs. CONCLUSION: ADSC-derived exosomes may exert protective effects on endothelial cells via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.","Mizuta, Yukie; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Guo, Jie; Zhang, Shuo; Narahara, Sayoko; Kawano, Takahito; Murata, Masaharu; Tokuda, Kentaro; Eto, Masatoshi; Hashizume, Makoto; Yamaura, Ken",Stem Cell Res Ther,,510

479792,Outcomes of asymptomatic hospital employees in COVID-19 post-exposure quarantine during the second pandemic wave in Zurich,2021,"RATIONALE: Communities of color are bearing a disproportionate burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality. Social determinants of health have resulted in higher prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among minority groups. Published work on COVID-19 disparities has focused on higher transmission, hospitalization, and mortality risk among people of color, but studies on disparities in the post-acute care setting are scarce. Our aim was to identify socioeconomic disparities in health resource utilization after hospital discharge. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. We identified adult patients who were hospitalized at CUIMC or the Allen Hospital from March 1st through April 30th 2020, had a positive RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), developed severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, and were successfully discharged from the hospital without need for ventilator support. Patients who received a tracheostomy and were weaned off the ventilator prior to discharge were included. Exclusion criteria included transfer from or to another institution, prior tracheostomy, in-hospital death, and discharge with a ventilator. RESULTS: We identified 195 patients meeting inclusion criteria. The median age was 59 (IQR 47-67), and 135 (66.5%) were men. There were 25 (12.8%) patients who were uninsured and 116 (59.5%) patients who had public insurance. There were 121 (62%) Hispanic, 34 (17%) Black, and 18 (9%) White patients. Uninsured patients within our cohort were more likely to be Hispanic and Spanish-speaking (p=0.027;p&lt;0.001, respectively). Uninsured patients were also more likely to be discharged to home (p&lt;0.001) than to a rehabilitation facility. 8.8% of patients were readmitted to CUIMC within 30 days and 41.5% saw a medical provider at CUIMC within 30 days of discharge. Insurance status did not predict 30-day re-hospitalization or completion of outpatient follow-up, although our study was underpowered to answer these questions. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that race/ethnicity and primary language are associated with insurance status with Hispanic and Spanish-speaking patients being more likely to be uninsured. Uninsured patients were more likely to be discharged home after hospitalization, rather than to facility for further care and rehabilitation. We did not demonstrate any short-term differences in 30-day re-hospitalization rates or follow-up visits but we suspect socioeconomic disparities represent a significant barrier to adequate follow-up care in the long term. We plan to investigate this further with longitudinal follow-up and survey data.","Canas, A.; Gomez, L.; Wolf, A.; Furfaro, D.; Zelnick, J.; Watson, A.; Rodriguez, C.; Iyasere, J.; Fullilove, R.; Burkart, K.

481065,The Quality of Life and Predicting the Peak Incidence of Covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has lead to lockdown of population in many countries. In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people's mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series. RESULTS: The mean %EWL in group 1 is 47.37±18.59 and in group 2 is 51.13±17.59, being P=.438. Meanwhile, the mean %TWL in group 1 is 21.14±8.17 and in group 2 is 24.67±8.01, with P=.115. CONCLUSIONS: Population lockdown by COVID-19 did not get worse short-term results of vertical gastrectomy. More studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to draw firm conclusions.","Ruiz de Angulo, David; Balaguer Román, Andrés; Munitiz Ruiz, Vicente; Gil Vázquez, Pedro José; Ruiz Merino, Guadalupe; Ortiz Escandell, M Ángeles; Martínez de Haro, Luisa F; Parrilla Paricio, Pascual",Cir Esp (Engl Ed),,510
481093,Letter: COVID-19 Impact on the Medical Student Path to Neurosurgery,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: In non-intubated COVID-19 patients, subcutaneous emphysema and spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) remain rarely, with incidence rates of 3.0 and 1.2 per 100,000, respectively; nevertheless, the occurrence of these conditions in COVID-19 patients is unclear. Up to date only few cases have been reported. The mechanism of pneumomediastinum in non-intubated COVID-19 patients remains unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a 63-year-old male with subcutaneous emphysema, and spontaneous pneumomediastinum with a 1-day history of chest pain and productive cough, without chills and dyspnea. The patient was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, Chest CT, and laboratory findings. The patient successfully treated by given double (mask and nasal) oxygen therapy, antibacterial (moxifloxacin tablet 400 mg) every 24 h for 7 days, followed by antiviral (lopinavir tablet 400 mg) twice daily for 6 days and corticosteroid treatments as well as steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 40 mg) daily for 8 days. Subcutaneous emphysema treated by supraclavicular slit-like incision (3 cm) bilaterally and milking of skin from face, neck, shoulders and chest done for three days for subcutaneous emphysema but regarding the pneumomediastinum we did only follow up of the patient. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are rare clinical finding in non-intubation of COVID-19 patients but frequently common in patients with coronavirus acute respiratory distress syndrome (COV-ARDS), or intubated COVID-19. In the present paper, subcutaneous emphysema and spontaneous pneumomediastinum occurred at the same time, with no past history of pulmonary diseases, and smoking of the patient. The only reason of this patient was high-pressure repetitive cough. CONCLUSION: The authors declared that COVID-19 infection leading to subcutaneous emphysema and spontaneous pneumomediastinum in non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Our case revealed that oxygen therapy, bed rest, analgesic, and supraclavicular slit-like incision best option for treat subcutaneous emphysema (SE) and spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM).","Essa, Rawand A; Ahmed, Sirwan K; Bapir, Dunya H; Abubakr, Chawan P",Int J Surg Case Rep,,510
481158,COVID-19 and changes in the National Immunisation Program: a unique opportunity to optimise the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR),2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are becoming increasingly available and may serve as a diagnostic aid in a multitude of settings relating to past infection status. However, there is limited literature detailing the longitudinal performance of EUA-cleared serologic assays in US populations, particularly in cohorts with a remote history of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., > 2 months). METHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (anti-N) and Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (anti-S1-RBD) assays, using 174 residual clinical samples up to 267 days post-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 154) and a subset of samples obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as negative controls (n = 20). RESULTS: The calculated diagnostic sensitivities for the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays were 89% and 93%, respectively. Of the 154 samples in the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort, there were 6 discrepant results between the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays, 5 of which were specimens collected &#8805; 200 days post-PCR positivity and only had detectable levels of anti-S1-RBD antibodies. When only considering specimens collected &#8805; 100 days post-PCR positivity (n = 41), the sensitivities for the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays were 85% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-S1-RBD assay demonstrated superior sensitivity at time points more remote to the PCR detection date, with 6 more specimens from the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort detected, 5 of which were collected more than 200 days post-PCR positivity. While analytical differences and reagent lot-to-lot variability are possible, this may indicate that, in some instances, anti-S1-RBD antibodies may persist longer in vivo and may be a better target for detecting remote SARS-CoV-2 infection.","El-Khoury, Joe M; Schulz, Wade L; Durant, Thomas J S",,,510
481424,Bladder cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: The calm before the storm?,2020,"ObjectivesThis paper examines differences in vaccination coverage and hesitancy for people in vaccine priority groups. Design, setting, participantsUsing data from 2,400 Australians who participated in two waves of the Taking the Pulse of the Nation survey in April and May 2021, we describe vaccination coverage and hesitancy among vaccine priority groups including people with disability, people living with a severe mental health condition, a severe long-term health condition, those requiring frequent assistance with everyday activities, and people who provide paid or unpaid care. Main outcome measuresThe proportion of the sample who were vaccinated and who were vaccine hesitant, for the whole sample and for vaccine priority groups, disaggregated by age group and gender. ResultsCOVID-19 vaccine coverage was estimated to be 8.2% overall, higher for people with severe long term health conditions (13.4%) and lower for people with severe mental health conditions (4.3%). Vaccine hesitancy was high overall (35.6%) and was found to be lower for people with disability (30.3%), with severe long term health conditions (27.7%), with frequent need for assistance (24.2%) and carers (30.7%), but similar for those with severe mental health conditions (36.1%). ConclusionsLow vaccination coverage and high hesitancy for people in the priority groups leaves many people at significant risk of serious disease or death if infected with COVID-19. These findings demonstrate the urgent need for governments to enable easy access to vaccination for people in priority groups and to develop communication strategies to promote vaccination uptake, co-designed with the priority groups.","Aitken, Zoe; Emerson, Eric; Kavanagh, Anne",,,510

Studies in the radiology literature have suggested that CT might be sufficiently sensitive and specific in diagnosing COVID-19 when used in lieu of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test; however, this suggestion runs counter to current society guidelines. The purpose of this article is to critically review some of the most frequently cited studies on the use of CT for detecting COVID-19. CONCLUSION. To date, the radiology literature on COVID-19 has consisted of limited retrospective studies that do not substantiate the use of CT as a diagnostic test for COVID-19.","Raptis, Constantine A; Hammer, Mark M; Short, Ryan G; Shah, Amar; Bhalla, Sanjeev; Bierhals, Andrew J; Filev, Peter D; Hope, Michael D; Jeudy, Jean; Kligerman, Seth J; Henry, Travis S",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,510

A lot of researches are going on for the potential drug candidate that could help the healthcare system in this fight. Plants are a natural data bank of bioactive compounds. Many phytochemicals are being studied for various ailments including cancer, bacterial and viral infections, etc. The present study aims to screen 38 bioactive compounds from 5 selected plants viz., Azadirachta indica, Curcuma longa, Zingiber officinale, Ocimum basilicum and Panax ginseng against SARS-CoV-2. Lipinski's rule was taken as the foundation for initial screening. Shortlisted compounds were subjected to molecular docking study with Mpro receptor present in SARS-CoV-2. The study identified that gedunin, epoxyazadiradione, nimbin and ginsenosides have potential to inhibit Mpro activity and their binding energies are - 9.51 kcal/mol, - 8.47 kcal/mol, - 8.66 kcal/mol and - 9.63 kcal/mol respectively. Based on bioavailability radar studies gedunin and epoxyazadiradione are the two most potent compounds which are used for molecular dynamics simulation studies. Molecular dynamics studies showed that gedunin is more potent than epoxyazadiradione. To find the effectiveness and to propose the exact mechanism, in-vitro studies can be further performed on gedunin.","Garg, Saksham; Anand, Ashutosh; Lamba, Yash; Roy, Arpita",Vegetos,,510

Blending Artificial Intelligence (AI) with chest X-ray images and incorporating these models in a smartphone can be handy for the accelerated diagnosis of COVID-19. In this study, publicly available datasets of chest X-ray images have been utilized for training and testing of five pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models namely VGG16, MobileNetV2, Xception, NASNetMobile and InceptionResNetV2. Prior to the training of the selected models, the number of images in COVID-19 category have been increased employing traditional augmentation and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The performance of the five pre-trained CNN models utilizing the images generated with the two strategies have been compared. In the case of models trained using augmented images, Xception (98%) and MobileNetV2 (97.9%) turned out to be the ones with highest validation accuracy. Xception (98.1%) and VGG16 (98.6%) emerged as models with the highest validation accuracy in the models trained with synthetic GAN images. The best performing models have been further deployed in a smartphone and evaluated. The overall results suggest that VGG16 and Xception, trained with the synthetic images created using GAN, performed better compared to models trained with augmented images.

A total of 521 participants aged 18-65 years were recruited from 29 regions of mainland China. Situation-specific coping strategies, including support seeking, personal hygiene practice and social distancing, were measured at Time 1. Benefit finding and well-being were assessed 1 month later. A multilevel mediation model was conducted with region included in level 2 as cluster ID. Support seeking and personal hygiene practice were positive predictors of benefit finding, which further mediated their relationships with well-being, while social distancing negatively predicted well-being. These results highlight the relationships of support seeking, personal hygiene practice and benefit finding with well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

492111,78 A Quality Improvement Project on Oxygen Administration Within the Geriatrics COVID-19 Cohort Ward,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused severe pneumonia at December 2019. Since then, it has been wildly spread from Wuhan, China, to Asia, European, and United States to become the pandemic worldwide. Now coronavirus disease 2019 were globally diagnosed over 3 084 740 cases with mortality of 212 561 toll. Current reports variants are found in SARS-CoV-2, majoring in functional ribonucleic acid (RNA) to transcribe into structural proteins as transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein holds the virus RNA genome; the envelope (E) and membrane (M) alone with spike protein form viral envelope. The nonstructural RNA genome includes ORF1ab, ORF3, ORF6, 7a, 8, and ORF10 with highly conserved information for genome synthesis and replication in ORF1ab. METHODS: We apply genomic alignment analysis to observe SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genebank/): MN 908947 (China, C1); MN985325 (United States: WA, UW); MN996527 (China, C2); MT007544 (Australia: Victoria, A1); MT027064 (United States: CA, UC); MT039890 (South Korea, K1); MT066175 (Taiwan, T1); MT066176 (Taiwan, T2); LC528232 (Japan, J1); and LC528233 (Japan, J2) and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org). We adopt Multiple Sequence Alignments web from Clustalw (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw) and Geneious web (https://www.geneious.com. RESULTS: We analyze database by genome alignment search for nonstructural ORFs and structural E, M, N, and S proteins. Mutations in ORF1ab, ORF3, and ORF6 are observed; specific variants in spike region are detected. CONCLUSION: We perform genomic analysis and comparative multiple sequence of SARS-CoV-2. Large scaling sequence alignments trace to localize and catch different mutant strains in United possibly to transmit severe deadly threat to humans. Studies about the biological symptom of SARS-CoV-2 in clinic animal and humans will be applied and manipulated to find mechanisms and shield the light for understanding the origin of pandemic crisis.","Tsai, Ping-Hsing; Wang, Mong-Lien; Yang, De-Ming; Liang, Kung-How; Chou, Shih-Jie; Chiou, Shih-Hwa; Lin, Ta-Hsien; Wang, Chin-Tien; Chang, Tai-Jay",J Chin Med Assoc,,510
492384,The impact of protocol-based high-intensity pharmacological thromboprophylaxis on thrombotic events in critically ill COVID-19 patients,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic challenges healthcare systems worldwide while severely impacting mental health. As a result, the rising demand for psychological assistance during crisis times requires early and effective intervention. This contributes to the well-being of the public and front-line workers and prevents mental health disorders. Many countries are offering diverse and accessible services of tele-psychological intervention; Ecuador is not the exception. The present study combines statistical analyses and discrete optimization techniques to solve the problem of assigning patients to therapists for crisis intervention with a single tele-psychotherapy session. The statistical analyses showed that professionals and healthcare workers in contact with Covid-19 patients or with a confirmed diagnosis had a significant relationship with suicide risk, sadness, experiential avoidance, and perception of severity. Moreover, some Covid-19-related variables were found to be predictors of sadness and suicide risk as unveiled via path analysis. This allowed categorizing patients according to their screening and grouping therapists according to their qualifications. With this stratification, a multi-periodic optimization model and a heuristic are proposed to find an adequate assignment of patients to therapists over time. The integer programming model was validated with real-world data, and its results were applied in a volunteer program in Ecuador.","Miniguano-Trujillo, Andrés; Salazar, Fernanda; Torres, Ramiro; Arias, Patricio; Sotomayor, Koraima",Health care manag. sci,,510

A national survey of the Italian Young Medical Doctors Association,2021,"BACKGROUND: Psychiatry is a special but complicated medical specialty as it focuses on the most elusive of all suffering in medicine: mental suffering. <br/> AIM: Description of the (desired) role of science in psychiatry.<br/> METHOD: Essay based on relevant literature.<br/> RESULTS: Science constitutes the basis of psychiatry and is essential for daily practice. A methodologically broad view on science can provide new knowledge and better care in psychiatry without falling prey to reductionism. The doubt and nuance inherent in science is also valuable to avoid unnecessary ideological debates in psychiatry and to give room to meaningful discussions. Nevertheless, investments in science within psychiatry are relatively limited, particularly in view of the suffering and costs related to psychiatric disorders.<br/> CONCLUSION: Psychiatry has greatly benefited from science. However, science should also lead to modesty and doubt about the current state of knowledge. This paradox should be an incentive to embrace science as the basis of psychiatry while avoiding reductionism. This essay discusses a number of ways how this could be realized.","Vinkers, C H",Tijdschr Psychiatr,,510

To better understand public health and addiction, this study investigated to what extent work-time and leisure-time internet use relate to problematic internet use and perceived quality of life among college students and highly educated adults. An online cross-sectional survey with 446 individuals was assessed in Germany. Linear regression analyses were used to predict problematic internet use. Ordinal regression analyses were applied to predict perceived quality of life. Results showed that leisure-time internet use, but not work-time internet use, was positively associated with problematic internet use. Participants whose work-time internet use could be considered balanced (5-28 h/week in this study) indicated a higher perceived quality of life compared to individuals with little or large amount of internet use for work. The findings still emerged when taking negative feelings, perceived stress, smoking status and alcohol consumption into account. As both work-time and leisure-time internet use can be risk factors for mental health in terms of problematic internet use and perceived quality of life, well-controlled internet use rather than excessive use is recommended. This should be kept in mind when dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath.","Gao, Lingling; Gan, Yiqun; Whittal, Amanda; Lippke, Sonia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,510

We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study to compare clinical outcomes among SOT recipients with the general population and to assess immunosuppression management. METHODS: Adult SOT recipients with laboratory PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary-care hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from March 11th to April 25th 2020, were matched to controls (1:4) on the basis of sex, age and age-adjusted Charlson's Index. Patients were followed for up to 28 days from admission or until censored. Primary endpoint was mortality at 28 days. Secondary endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and secondary complications. Drug-drug interactions (DDI) between immunosuppressants and COVID-19 management medication were collected. RESULTS: Forty-six transplant recipients and 166 control patients were included. Mean (SD) age of transplant recipients and controls was 62.7 (12.6) and 66.0 (12.7) years, 33 (71.7%) and 122 (73.5%) were male, and median (IQR) Charlson's Index was 5 (3-7) and 4 (2-7), respectively. Mortality was 37.0% in SOT recipients and 22.9% in controls (p=0.51).Thirty-three (71.7%) patients underwent transitory discontinuation of immunosuppressants due to potential or confirmed DDI. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, hospitalized SOT recipients with COVID-19 had a trend toward higher mortality compared to controls, although it was not statistically significant, and a notable propensity for DDI.","Miarons, Marta; Larrosa-García, María; García-García, Sonia; Los-Arcos, Ibai; Moreso, Francesc; Berastegui, Cristina; Castells, Lluís; Pérez-Hoyos, Santiago; Varela, Javier; Pau-Parra, Alba; Varón-Galcera, Carlota; Parramon-Teixidó, Carlos-Javier; Martínez-Casanova, Javier; Domènech, Laura; García-Ortega, Patricia; Sánchez-Sancho, Pablo; Alonso-Martínez, Carla; Gómez-Ganda, Laura; Roch-Santed, Maria; Gracia-Moya, Ariadna; Del-Rio-Gutiérrez, José-Manuel; Guillén-Del-Castillo, Alfredo; Sans-Pola, Carla; Antón, Andrés; Montoro, Bruno; Gorgas-Torner, Maria-Queralt",Transplantation,,510

We hosted OpenKBP, a 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge, and challenged participants to develop the best method for predicting the dose of contoured CT images. The models were evaluated according to two separate scores: (1) dose score, which evaluates the full 3D dose distributions, and (2) dose-volume histogram (DVH) score, which evaluates a set DVH metrics. Participants were given the data of 340 patients who were treated for head-and-neck cancer with radiation therapy. The data was partitioned into training (n=200), validation (n=40), and testing (n=100) datasets. All participants performed training and validation with the corresponding datasets during the validation phase of the Challenge, and we ranked the models in the testing phase based on out-of-sample performance. The Challenge attracted 195 participants from 28 countries, and 73 of those participants formed 44 teams in the validation phase, which received a total of 1750 submissions. The testing phase garnered submissions from 28 teams. On average, over the course of the validation phase, participants improved the dose and DVH scores of their models by a factor of 2.7 and 5.7, respectively. In the testing phase one model achieved significantly better dose and DVH score than the runner-up models. Lastly, many of the top performing teams reported using generalizable techniques (e.g., ensembles) to achieve higher performance than their competition. This is the first competition for knowledge-based planning research, and it helped launch the first platform for comparing KBP prediction methods fairly and consistently. The OpenKBP datasets are available publicly to help benchmark future KBP research, which has also democratized KBP research by making it accessible to everyone.","Babier, Aaron; Zhang, Binghao; Mahmood, Rafid; Moore, Kevin L.; Purdie, Thomas G.; Chan, Andrea L.

497104,Predicting the ultimate outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy,2020-03-17,"Infectious respiratory diseases are highly contagious and very common, and thus can be considered as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We followed up the incidence rates (IRs) of eight infectious respiratory diseases, including chickenpox, measles, pertussis, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, rubella, and meningococcal disease, after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in South Korea, and then compared those with the IRs in the corresponding periods in the previous 3 years. Overall, the IRs of these diseases before and after age- or sex-standardization significantly decreased in the intervention period compared with the pre-intervention periods (p < 0.05 for all eight diseases). However, the difference in the IRs of all eight diseases between the IRs before and after age-standardization was significant (p < 0.05 for all periods), while it was not significant with regard to sex-standardization. The incidence rate ratios for eight diseases in the pre-intervention period compared with the intervention period ranged from 3.1 to 4.1. These results showed the positive effects of the mitigation measures on preventing the development of respiratory infectious diseases, regardless of age or sex, but we need to consider the age-structure of the population to calculate the effect size. In the future, some of these measures could be applied nationwide to prevent the occurrence or to reduce the transmission during outbreaks of these infections.

Results: The frequency and absolute number of circulating memory T and B cells expressing the gut homing integrin &#945;4ß7 integrin was reduced during COVID-19, whether gastrointestinal symptoms were present or not. While total IgA-expressing B cells were increased, gut-imprinted B cells with IgA expression were stable. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a decrease in circulating adaptive immune cells expressing the key gut homing marker &#945;4ß7 suggesting that these cells are preferentially recruited to extra-intestinal tissues independently of &#945;4ß7 or that the systemic immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is at least numerically dominated by extraintestinal, particularly pulmonary, immune cell priming.","Müller, Tanja M; Becker, Emily; Wiendl, Maximilian; Schulze, Lisa Lou; Voskens, Caroline; Völkl, Simon; Kremer, Andreas E; Neurath, Markus F; Zundler, Sebastian",Front Immunol,,510

We continued our SIV effectiveness against medically-attended influenza-like illness (ILI) under the Department of Health Hong Kong's sentinel private medical practitioners (PMP) network, using the test-negative case-control design, for the 2018/19 and 2019/20 season. In addition, we studied the potential interference between SIV and ILI caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV) based on data collated from 2017/18 to 2019/20 seasons. 3404 patients were analysed. Across the 2017/18 to 2019/20 seasons, the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of SIV was 44% (95% CI 30-56%) against pan-negative controls, 57% (95%CI. 42-68%) against NIRV controls and 50% (95%CI 38-59%) against both. SIV was moderately effective against medically-attended ILI caused by influenza A/B in both 2018/19 and 2019/20 winter seasons (53.2% (95%CI 36.7-65.5%) and 41.8% (95%CI 6.3-64.1%), respectively). The VE against the main circulating subtype, influenza A(H1), was higher for the 2018/19 season (57.2% (95%CI 39.8-69.9%), compared to 34.6% (95%CI -9.6-61.4%) in the 2019/20 season). When compared to pan negative controls, those with single NIRV infections were similarly likely to have received SIV (OR 1.05 (95%CI 0.72-1.54) within the influenza season; OR 0.97 (95%CI 0.73-1.29) when including non-influenza seasons). Analyses by type of virus showed no increased risk of SIV identified among those with single infections of EV/RV, HMPV and parainfluenza but a 2-fold increased risk was shown for those with single infections of adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (adenovirus: OR 2.54 (95%CI 1.24-5.14) within influenza season and OR 1.78 (95%CI 1.01-3.09) for the whole period; parainfluenza virus: OR 2.01 (95%CI 1.22-3.29) within influenza season and OR 1.89 (95%CI 1.29-2.76) for the whole period).

In this period, we have 3 episodes of relevant economic implications in the country under analysis: i) impeachment of the Brazilian President;ii) the lorry-drivers' strike;iii) the rise of the global Covid-19 epidemic. We use a sliding windows approach to analyze price dynamics over time. The results suggest that, at the beginning of the sample, prices were non-stationary and non-mean reverting. Over the time, diesel prices become non-stationary with mean-reversion in Midwest, South and Southeast regions, while in the North and Northeast we cannot reject non-stationarity and non-mean reversion (d &gt; 1). Results are relevant for market agents and policy-makers, as it can be inferred whether exogenous shocks are temporary, despite taking some time to dissipate completely.","Quintino, D.

501301,[a Delicate Balance of Oncology Practice during the Covid-19 Pandemic],2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to show how full-time telemedicine adoption has impacted patient visit volume and attendance in a comprehensive metabolic and weight loss center. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Elective surgical practices have been profoundly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a rapid increase in the utilization of telemedicine. The abrupt initiation of audio-video telehealth visits for all providers of a multidisciplinary clinic on March 19 2020 provided unique circumstances to assess the impact of telemedicine. METHODS: Data from the clinical booking system (new patient and follow-up visits) for all clinical provider types of the multidisciplinary metabolic center from the pre-telehealth, post-telehealth, and a 2019 comparative period were retrospectively reviewed and compared. The primary outcome is the change in patient visit volume for all clinical providers from before to after the initiation of telemedicine for both new patient, and follow-up visits. RESULTS: There were a total of 506 visits (162 new patient visits, and 344 follow-ups) in the pre-telehealth period, versus 413 visits (77 new patient visits, and 336 follow-ups) during the post-telehealth period. After telehealth implementation, new visits for surgeons decreased by 75%. Although follow-up visits decreased by 55.06% for surgeons, there was an increase by 27.36% for advanced practitioners. When surgeons were separated from other practitioners, their follow-up visit rate decrease by 55.06%, compared to a 16.08% increase for the group of all other practitioners (P < 0.0001). Dietitians experienced higher rates of absenteeism with new patient visits (10.00% vs 31.42%, P = 0.0128), whereas bariatricians experienced a decrease in follow-up visit absenteeism (33.33% vs 0%, P = 0.0093). CONCLUSIONS: Although new patient visit volume fell across the board, follow-up visits increased for certain nonsurgical providers. This provides a template for adoption of a multidisciplinary telehealth clinic in a post-pandemic world.","Brown, Andrew M; Ardila-Gatas, Jessica; Yuan, Victoria; Devas, Nina; Docimo, Salvatore; Spaniolas, Konstaninos; Pryor, Aurora D",Ann Surg,,510

Therefore, we conducted this survey to investigate the prevalence rate and related factors of insomnia symptoms in the Chinese general public after the COVID-19 had been initially control. Methods: An online survey was conducted among Chinese citizens through the JD Health APP. The questionnaire was used for collecting demographic data and self-designed questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Insomnia Severity Index, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Somatic Symptom Scale-8 and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used for measuring psychological symptoms. To examine the associations of sociodemographic and psychological factors with insomnia symptoms, a binary logistic regression was used. Results: In total, there were 14,894 eligible participants, and 4601 (30.9%) participants were found to have insomnia symptoms. The regression model revealed that a higher risk of insomnia symptoms was associated with being over the age of 40 years, having history of psychiatric disorders, smoking, having infected friends or colleagues, having depressive or somatic symptoms, experiencing psychological distress and feeling estranged from family members. Meanwhile a lower risk of insomnia symptoms was associated with being female, having closer family relationships, not feeling alienated from others and being satisfied with the available information. Conclusion: In our study, 30.9% of the participants in the general public reported insomnia symptoms after the COVID-19 epidemic had been initially controlled. When providing precise interventions for insomnia, extra attention should be paid to the individuals who are male, elderly and smokers, and those with psychiatric disorder history, with infected friends or colleagues, with psychological symptoms and with poor social support.","Guo, J.; Yang, L.; Xu, Y.; Zhang, C.; Luo, X.; Liu, S.; Yao, L.; Bai, H.; Zong, X.; Zhang, J.; Liu, Z.; Zhang, B.",Nature &amp; Science of Sleep,,510

In many cases due to uncertainty and limited information, the pandemic has created chaos across business and private activity;education is no exception. The reality of the limited flexibility of existing systems of teaching was immediately acknowledged by the closure of physical facilities and the subsequent migration to online teaching. However, in spite of technologies to enable remote participation, it has become apparent that the capacity for learning in an autonomous environment is not homogeneous. From this perspective the pandemic created an opportunity to assess education infrastructure in real time as part of on-going crisis management. This paper explores aspects of crisis management in education as precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia and relates the mitigation and adaptation policies subsequently adopted to a holistic sustainability agenda for education. The research method employed in this study consists of semi structured interviews with the management team members from eight educational institutions. The interviews focus on the crisis management strategies and approaches implemented in their schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion concludes with a connection between crisis management and educational sustainability and sets an agenda for future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Iliško, D.; Venkatesan, M.; Price, E.",World Sustainability Series,,510

The extension of the COVID-19 pandemic in our country has led to a significant decline in childhood immunization, which could have severe repercussions increasing the risk of future outbreaks. Hence, the measures of the Ministry of Health to correct the situation. The purpose of this study was to highlight the extent of vaccine release during COVID-19 pandemic and to make recommendations to restore vaccination programmes. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study of the effect of containment measures during this pandemic on the monitoring of children´s vaccinations. We conducted a national survey of pediatricians using an electronic questionnaire administered via Google Forms. We collected, analyzed and interpreted the results. Results: one hundred and three Moroccan pediatricians answered the questionnaire. More than 2-thirds (78.6%) of pediatricians practiced in the private sector and delivered vaccines in the immunization schedule. The majority of pediatricians (95%) were asked about parental vaccine concerns. We noted that 82.5% of parents were reluctant to go to the local health department and 5.8% refused to take vaccination during COVID-19 pandemic. About 22% of pediatricians completely stopped immunization services and 72.8% delayed immunizations from 3 to 4 weeks. Vaccination stoppage involved older children in two thirds of cases. Conclusion: it is essential to maintain public confidence in vaccination. Ongoing and timely assessment of vaccine coverage as well as clear recommendations and broad public awareness are essential to respond to vaccine changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chekhlabi, Nabila; Arrab, Raja; Ettair, Said; Dini, Nouzha",Pan Afr Med J,,510

We describe the strategies adopted to cope with the limitations imposed by the pandemic to the access to health care by patients diagnosed with idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational analysis including IPF patients under antifibrotic drugs (nintedanib and pirfenidone) that accessed to the Outpatient clinic of the University of Palermo, Italy. Patients received a phone number and an email address in case of any urgency and a virtual meeting was settled up monthly. RESULTS: 40 patients (M/F: 30/10) were followed up, 33 under nintedanib treatment, 7 under pirfenidone. Among patients under nintedanib, 1 patient reported high fever (T max 39°C) and purulent sputum with no sign of infections, 1 had hemoptysis that was spontaneously resolved. 2 patients accessed to the emergency department for the worsening of dyspnea; 5 patients had diarrhea that resolved with symptomatic drugs in few days. 3 patients had an increase of alkaline phosphatase levels, leading to the withdrawal of the antifibrotic drug for 15 days, and subsequent normalization of the plasmatic levels. Among patients under pirfenidone, one subject had an increase of ferritin serum levels with no symptoms. The remaining subjects were in stable clinical conditions. None of the patients reported hospitalization or exacerbations, and did not experience antifibrotic withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate that by implementing alternative ways to monitor the disease, patients did not incur in increased rates of acute exacerbations or higher frequency of side effects and antifibrotic treatment withdrawal.","Alida, Benfante; Riccardo, Messina; Ilaria, Piccionello; Rosangela, Di Liberti; Stefania, Principe; Nicola, Scichilone",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,,510

A resurgence of coronavirus infections has been confirmed in most countries, resulting in a second wave of the deadly virus. The infectious virus has symptoms ranging from an itchy throat to Pneumonia, resulting in the loss of thousands of human lives while globally infecting millions. Detecting the presence of COVID-19 as early as possible is critical, as it helps prevent further spread of disease and helps isolate and provide treatment to the infected patients. Recent radiological imaging findings confirm that lung X-ray and CT scans provide an excellent indication of the progression of COVID-19 infection in acute symptomatic carriers. This investigation aims to rapidly detect COVID-19 progression and non-COVID Pneumonia from lung X-ray images of heavily symptomatic patients. A novel and highly efficient COVID-DeepNet model is presented for the accurate and rapid prediction of COVID-19 infection using state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence techniques. The proposed model provides a multi-class classification of lung X-ray images into COVID-19, non-COVID Pneumonia, and normal (healthy). The proposed systems’ performance is assessed based on the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and f1 score. The current research employed a dataset size of 7500 X-ray samples. The high recognition accuracy of 99.67% was observed for the proposed COVID-DeepNet model, and it complies with the most recent state-of-the-art. The proposed COVID-DeepNet model is highly efficient and accurate, and it can assist radiologists and doctors in the early clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection for symptomatic patients.","Panthakkan, Alavikunhu Anzar S.

Purpose To assess the incidence, patterns, and severity of injuries in victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, compared with the prior three years. Materials and Methods The demographics, clinical presentation, injuries, and radiological findings of patients reporting physical abuse arising from IPV during the statewide COVID-19 pandemic between March 11th and May 3rd, 2020 were compared with the same period over the past three years. Pearson's chi-squared and Fischer's exact have been used for analysis. Results 26 physical IPV victims from 2020 (37+/-13 years, 25 women) were evaluated and compared with 42 physical IPV victims (41+/-15 years, 40 women) from 2017-2019. While the overall number of patients reporting IPV decreased during the pandemic, the incidence of physical IPV was 1.8 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 3.0, p = 0.01). The total number of deep injuries was 28 during 2020 versus 16 from 2017-2019; the number of deep injuries per victim was 1.1 during 2020 compared with 0.4 from 2017-2019 (p<0.001). The incidence of high-risk abuse defined by mechanism was greater by 2 times (95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, p = 0.01). Patients with IPV in during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be ethnically white, 17 (65%) victims in 2020 were ethnically white compared to 11 (26%) in the prior years (p=0.007). Conclusion There was a higher incidence and severity of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID 19 pandemic compared with the prior three years. These results suggest that IPV victims delayed reaching out to health care services until the late stages of the abuse cycle during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gosangi, Babina; Park, Hyesun; Thomas, Richard; Gujrathi, Rahul; Bay, Camden P; Raja, Ali S; Seltzer, Steven E; Balcom, Marta Chadwick; McDonald, Meghan L; Orgill, Dennis P; Harris, Mitchel B; Boland, Giles W; Rexrode, Kathryn; Khurana, Bharti",Radiology,,510

""Reflection from Pathophysiological Data""",2020,"The lack of quantitative risk assessment of airborne transmission of COVID-19 under practical settings leads to large uncertainties and inconsistencies in our preventive measures. Combining in situ measurements and numerical simulations, we quantify the exhaled particles from normal respiratory behaviors and their transport under elevator, small classroom and supermarket settings to evaluate the risk of inhaling potentially virus-containing particles. Our results show that the design of ventilation is critical for reducing the risk of particle encounters. Inappropriate design can significantly limit the efficiency of particle removal, create local hot spots with orders of magnitude higher risks, and enhance particle deposition causing surface contamination. Additionally, our measurements reveal the presence of substantial fraction of crystalline particles from normal breathing and its strong correlation with breathing depth.","Shao, Siyao; Zhou, Dezhi; He, Ruichen; Li, Jiaqi; Zou, Shufan; Mallery, Kevin; Kumar, Santosh; Yang, Suo; Hong, Jiarong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03645v3.pdf,510

STUDY DESIGN: By using a convenience sampling approach, 129 out of 205 randomly selected healthcare professionals from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were invited to take part in a WeChat messaging app survey, Questionnaire Star, via a survey link. Healthcare personnel details were collected, including profession, years of professional experience and adverse reactions while wearing L3PPE. Survey results were divided by profession and years of professional experience; differences in adverse reactions were compared. RESULTS: Among the 129 healthcare professionals surveyed, 21 (16.28%) were doctors and 108 (83.72%) were nurses. A total of 122 (94.57%) healthcare professionals experienced discomfort while wearing L3PPE to treat patients with COVID-19. The main reasons for adverse reactions and discomfort include varying degrees of adverse skin reactions, respiratory difficulties, heat stress, dizziness and nausea. Doctors had a lower incidence of rashes (&#967;2=4.519, p=0.034) and dizziness (&#967;2=4.123, p=0.042) when compared with nurses. Junior (8.5 years of experience or fewer) healthcare personnel also experienced a higher rate of heat stress when compared with senior personnel (more than 8.5 years greater) (&#967;2=5.228, p=0.022). CONCLUSION: More attention should be offered to healthcare personnel wearing L3PPE to treat patients with COVID-19 because they are susceptible to developing adverse reactions.","Yuan, Niu; Yang, Wei-Xia; Lu, Jian-Li; Lv, Zhang-Hong",Postgrad. med. j,,510

However, data in the pediatric kidney transplant population (PKT) are lacking. METHODS: Using two commercial immunoassays that measured IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and IgG against the nucleocapsid (N) protein, we screened 72 PKT recipients who attended the outpatient clinic for routine blood work. The majority of patients with positive serology underwent an additional serology test at least once during subsequent clinical follow-up. Patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection if they had two positive tests. RESULTS: Eight patients out of the 72 screened (11.1%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in both serological tests. Of those who tested positive, 4 had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results before screening. All patients were asymptomatic or had a history of mild symptoms. All tested patients had persistently positive antibodies at a median follow-up time of 75 days (IQR, 44.5, 86.5 days). One patient had a positive PCR test at 75 days and a positive serology test at 120 days post infection. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was relatively high (11.1%) in our population. Although all patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, they mounted a strong humoral immune response that persisted for a few months despite being on triple immunosuppressants. These findings have positive implications regarding vaccination efficacy in this group.","Alshami, Alanoud; Al Attas, Rabab; Azzam, Ahmad; Mohammed, Amani; Al-Quhaidan, Norah",BMC Nephrol,,510

511521,Correction,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic demanded a rapid response within Radiation Oncology services to minimise the risk of infection to patients and workforce. This study aimed to assess whether the operational changes put in place to reduce infection risks were effective in engaging and supporting staff. METHODS: Our service's response saw staff and patients split into morning or afternoon shifts without overlap. Changes included extended clinic hours, modified treatment regimens, expanded online/electronic communication and remote working. Staff were invited to respond to an electronic questionnaire in September 2020, just after the peak of the second COVID-19 wave in Victoria. Responses captured demographic data, parental status, profession, happiness levels, fear of COVID-19 and e-communication efficacy. RESULTS: A 57% response rate was achieved. 69% of respondents were female; 40% were aged 45+ and 35% had school-aged children. Staff aged 45+ showed a significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than younger staff. 36% of respondents reported feeling nervous or anxious watching news reports about COVID-19. 92% of staff were happy with their work arrangements; staff with children were happier than staff without children with their shifts. Online chat/channels were reported as the preferred e-communication method between colleagues. CONCLUSION: Staff provided predominantly positive feedback to the changes made in response to the pandemic, reporting high levels of happiness and willingness to continue with the changes implemented during COVID-19. The strategies adopted worked well and the overall high levels of staff satisfaction will allow our service to quickly pivot should further surges, or another pandemic, arise.","Rykers, Kym; Tacey, Mark; Bowes, Jack; Brown, Kerryn; Yuen, Eva; Wilson, Carlene; Khor, Richard; Foroudi, Farshad",J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol,,510

We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN. A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic. A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment. Finally, guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members. RESULTS: Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD. Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment. Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring. Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.","Turner, Dan; Huang, Ying; Martín-de-Carpi, Javier; Aloi, Marina; Focht, Gili; Kang, Ben; Zhou, Ying; Sanchez, Cesar; Kappelman, Michael D; Uhlig, Holm H; Pujol-Muncunill, Gemma; Ledder, Oren; Lionetti, Paolo; Dias, Jorge Amil; Ruemmele, Frank M; Russell, Richard K",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,,510

There are scanty data from India on the prevalence of liver injury in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We did this retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital, Chennai, India. Patients aged >18 years admitted with COVID-19 from May 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, were included. We noted the demographic details, symptoms at presentation, history of pre-existing illnesses, and laboratory tests. We also recorded the patient's clinical course and outcome. RESULTS: We took 445 patients for final analysis. Aspartate transaminase (AST) was borderline elevated in 47.5%, mildly elevated in 11.2%, moderately elevated in 2% and severely in 0.7%. Alanine transaminase (ALT) was borderline elevated in 28.7%, mildly elevated in 11.4%, and moderately elevated in 1.3%. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase were abnormal in only 19 (4.2%) and 15 (3.3%) patients, respectively. Patients with abnormal LFT were more likely to be symptomatic (90.3% vs. 80.6%, p 0.002). Respiratory symptoms (43.5% vs. 29.7%) and loose stools (11.4% vs. 3.4%) were also more common among them. Patients with abnormal LFT were more likely to have severe disease (25.2% vs. 13.6%, p value 0.003) and mortality (8.8% vs. 0.7%). CONCLUSION: Liver test abnormalities were widespread in patients with COVID-19. Most of the patients had borderline or mild transaminase elevation. Despite only mild changes, patients with abnormal LFT were more likely to be symptomatic and had more severe disease and mortality.","Saithanyamurthi, Hemamala V; Munirathinam, Manoj; Ananthavadivelu, Murali",Indian j. gastroenterol,,510

A secondary aim was to deductively explore the applicability of the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour model to participants' narratives related to self-regulated online learning. Online interviews with six demographically diverse participants were conducted and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The overarching theme was 'the balancing act of online learners', which consisted of three major themes (and respective subthemes): (1) 'identity as an online learner' ('in today's world, we're all very busy'), (2) 'access to resources' ('importance of location' and 'comparing online to on-campus teaching and learning'), and (3) 'changing nature of social interactions' ('tutors as a crutch' and 'peer-to-peer interactions'). A number of facilitators and barriers related to these themes were identified, which are applicable to the COM-B model. The COM-B model offers a novel approach in designing and delivering learning materials and activities that may instil or help maintain self-regulated learning in online psychology students.","Garip, Gulcan; Seneviratne, Sanju Rusara; Iacovou, Susan",J.

Mobility statistics are a relatively new data source created by compiling smartphone location data; they can be effectively used for understanding pandemics if integrated with epidemiological findings and other economic data sets. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were slightly more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to hold back the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all days), a 20%-35% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, can be achieved with a 6%-30% reduction in weekly mobility. These are the results if other potential causes of spread are ignored; for a fuller picture, more careful observations, expanded data sets, and advanced statistical modeling are needed.","Kajitani, Yoshio; Hatayama, Michinori",PLoS One,,510

Although instances of negative or hostile ageism have been identified, critical attention to the nuances of ageism throughout the pandemic, such as the prevalence and implications of positive or compassionate ageism, has lagged in comparison. This commentary uses stereotype content theory to extend the conversation regarding COVID-19 and ageism to include compassionate ageism. We offer the 'caremongering' movement, a social movement driven by social media to help individuals impacted by COVID-19, as a case study example that illustrates how compassionate ageism has manifested during the pandemic. The implications of compassionate ageism that have and continue to occur during the pandemic are discussed using stereotype embodiment theory. Future actions that focus on shifting attention from the intent of ageist actions and beliefs to the outcomes for those experiencing them is needed. Further, seeking older individuals' consent when help is offered, recognizing the diversity of aging experiences, and thinking critically about ageism in its multiple and varied forms are all required.","Vervaecke, Deanna; Meisner, Brad A",GerontologistGerontologist,,510

Data on age-associated differences in circulating ACE2 levels in humans and the role of CVD and medications is limited. We analyzed data from 967 participants of the InCHIANTI study, a community-dwelling cohort in the Chianti region, Italy. Relative abundance of ACE2 in plasma was assessed using a proteomics platform. CVD diagnoses, use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists: ACEi, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists, were ascertained. Multiple linear analyses were performed to examine the independent association of ACE2 with age, CVD, and RAAS antagonist use. Age was independently associated with lower log (ACE2) in persons aged &#8805; 55 years (STD ß = - 0.12, p = 0.0002). ACEi treatment was also independently associated with significantly lower ACE2 levels, and ACE2 was inversely associated with weight, and positively associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) status. There was a trend toward higher circulating ACE2 levels in hypertensive individuals, but it did not reach statistical significance. In a stratified analysis, the association between log (ACE2) and log (IL-6) was more evidenced in participants with PAD. Circulating ACE2 levels demonstrate curvilinear association with age, with older individuals beyond the sixth decade age having lower levels. ACEi was associated with greater circulating ACE2 levels. Interestingly, ACE2 was elevated in PAD and positively associated with inflammatory markers, suggesting compensatory upregulation in the setting of chronic inflammation. Further studies are needed to comprehensively characterize RAAS components with aging and disease, and assess its prognostic role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes.","AlGhatrif, Majd; Tanaka, Toshiko; Moore, Ann Zenobia; Bandinelli, Stefania; Lakatta, Edward G; Ferrucci, Luigi",Geroscience,,510

522404,"In the face of COVID-19, SADA continues to deliver to its members",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and countermeasures implemented by governments around the world have led to dramatically increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures, because they represent a demographic that is most affected by disasters and because pregnancy itself entails significant life changes that require major psychosocial and emotional adjustments. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals, and developmental outcomes in their offspring. OBJECTIVE: The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals and developmental outcomes in their offspring. Findings of the study are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and their offspring and point toward prevention and intervention targets. METHODS: The PdP study comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Participants were eligible if they were: pregnant, &#8805;17 years, &#8804;35 weeks gestation at study enrollment, living in Canada, and able to read and write in English or French. At enrollment, participants completed an initial survey that assessed demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, previous pregnancies and births, pre-pregnancy health, health conditions during pregnancy, medications, psychological distress, social support, and hardships experienced because of COVID-19 (e.g., lost employment, loved one dying). For the first three months following the initial survey, participants received a monthly email link to complete a follow-up survey that asked about experiences since the previous survey. After three months, follow-up surveys were sent every other month to reduce participant burden. For each of these surveys, participants were first asked if they were still pregnant and then routed either to the next prenatal survey or to the delivery survey. In the postpartum, surveys were sent at 3-, 6-, and 12-months of infant age to assess maternal stress, psychological distress and infant development. RESULTS: Participant recruitment via social media (Facebook, Instagram) began on April 5, 2020 and is ongoing. As of October 2019, more than 8200 individuals completed the initial survey. Follow-up data collection is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal investigation seeks to elucidate the associations between hardships, maternal psychological distress, child development during COVID-19, and risk and resilience factors that amplify or ameliorate these associations. Findings are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and point toward prevention and intervention targets.

At that time, there were reports of heroic acts among professionals who cared for these patients, whose bravery and professionalism were highly praised. However, there are concerns about changes in new generation of nursing professionals. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the attitude of nursing students, should they be faced with severe acute respiratory syndrome patients during their future work. RESEARCH DESIGN: A questionnaire survey was carried out to examine the attitude among final-year nursing students to three ethical areas, namely, duty of care, resource allocation, and collateral damage. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was carried out in accordance with the requirements and recommendations of the Central Research and Ethics Committee, School of Health Sciences at Caritas Institute of Higher Education. FINDINGS: Complete responses from 102 subjects were analyzed. The overwhelming majority (96.1%) did not agree to participate in the intubation of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients if protective measures, that is, N95 mask and gown, were not available. If there were insufficient N95 masks for all the medical, nursing, and allied health workers in the hospital (resource allocation), 37.3% felt that the distribution of N95 masks should be by casting lot, while the rest disagreed. When asked about collateral damage, more than three-quarters (77.5%) said that severe acute respiratory syndrome patients should be admitted to intensive care unit. There was sex difference in nursing students' attitude toward severe acute respiratory syndrome care during pregnancy and influence of age in understanding intensive care unit care for these patients. Interestingly, 94.1% felt that there should be a separate intensive care unit for severe acute respiratory syndrome patients. CONCLUSION: As infection control practice and isolation facilities improved over the years, relevant knowledge and nursing ethical issues related to infectious diseases should become part of nursing education and training programs, especially in preparation for outbreaks of infectious diseases or distress.","Kam, Joseph Km; Chan, Eric; Lee, Albert; Wei, Vivian Wi; Kwok, Kin On; Lui, Dominic; Yuen, Robert Kn",Nurs Ethics,,510

However, current teaching of public health to medical students varies in the European Region though an investment in multidisciplinary workforce is recognised essential to deliver high quality public health services. A recent medical education curricula restructuring in the University of Porto Medical School resulted in the inclusion of a Public Health module linking academic teaching to field practice and provided the opportunity to make an initial appraisal of students’ perceptions. CASE STUDY: We analysed final reports (n = 196), debriefing meetings notes (n = 2), and e-mails sent by students (n = 34) regarding the activities they observed or participated at, their contact with Public Health services’ teams, knowledge and critical appraisal, and opinion about the module. Students gained basic knowledge about how epidemiological surveillance, environmental health, health planning, and health promotion are performed in practice. They reported a better understanding of the roles and importance of Public Health services and its teams. Most considered that this module had an important role in their training. Some activities observed in the field lacked the needed standardisation to provide the students the feeling that core operations were experienced, which needs to be addressed in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Public Health practice-based training within field institutions may bring a better understanding of the discipline and specialty for medical students. It may strengthen interconnectivity and coordination of healthcare agents, which may improve future medical practice with potential improvement of patient-centred care and in terms of public health response, and back their roles as health agents and decision-makers.","Leão, Teresa; Barros, Henrique",Public Health Rev,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40985-020-00146-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292845/,510

According to the findings, male patients with COVID-19 infection are at an increased risk for severe complications than females. The causes of this issue are unknown and are most probably multifactorial. Sexual hormones affect the immune system, so estrogen strengthens the immune system, and testosterone suppresses it. Due to the reports of the high prevalence of androgenic alopecia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a higher risk of respiratory disease and increased use of allergy/asthma medications among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as a hyperandrogenism condition compared with non-PCOS women, this review aimed to evaluate androgens role in COVID-19. METHODS: 42 related articles from 2008 to 2020 were reviewed with the keywords of androgens, hormonal factors, and hair loss in combination with COVID-19 in medical research databases. RESULTS: The evidence of transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in lung tissue, which is an androgen-regulated gene and expressed mainly in the adult prostate may interpret the increased susceptibility of the male gender to severe COVID-19 complications. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) acts as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and male hormones are effective in the ACE-2 passageway and simplify SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.

We conducted a mystery client study August through October, 2019. Interactions were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, along with the contents of the packages. One hundred ten sellers were contacted, from whom mystery clients made 76 purchases and received 64 drug packages. Almost all sellers sold “packets” containing multiple drugs; 73 percent of packets contained misoprostol, and 47 percent contained at least 800 mcg of misoprostol. Thirty‐four packets contained insufficient drugs to complete an abortion. When compared to WHO standards, 87 percent of sellers imparted incomplete information about potential physical effects; no seller provided information about possible complications. Women buying misoprostol from informal online drugs sellers will be underprepared for understanding potential side effects and complications. Educational activities are needed to increase women's access to information about safe use of misoprostol as a harm reduction strategy.","Moore, Ann M.; Philbin, Jesse; Ariawan, Iwan; Budiharsana, Meiwita; Murro, Rachel; Aryanty, Riznawaty Imma; Bankole, Akinrinola",Stud Fam Plann,https://doi.org/10.1111/sifp.12138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079416/,510
591589,Non‐complicated evolution of COVID‐19 infection in a patient with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis during treatment with adalimumab,2020-05-30,"Corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has affected different groups of humankind such as farmers, soldiers, drivers, educators, students, healthcare workers and many others. The transmission rate of the disease varies from one group to another depending on the contact rate. Healthcare workers are at a high risk of contracting the disease due to the high contact rate with patients. So far, there exists no mathematical model which combines both public control measures (as a parameter) and healthcare workers (as an independent compartment). Combining these two in a given mathematical model is very important because healthcare workers are protected through effective use of personal protective equipment, and control measures help to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in the community. This paper presents a mathematical model named SWE [Formula: see text] HR; susceptible individuals (S), healthcare workers (W), exposed (E), symptomatic infectious ([Formula: see text]), asymptomatic infectious ([Formula: see text]), hospitalized (H), recovered (R). The value of basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] for all parameters in this study is 2.8540. In the absence of personal protective equipment [Formula: see text] and control measure in the public [Formula: see text] , the value of [Formula: see text] which implies the presence of the disease. When [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were introduced in the model, basic reproduction number is reduced to 0.4606, indicating the absence of disease in the community. Numerical solutions are simulated by using Runge–Kutta fourth-order method. Sensitivity analysis is performed to presents the most significant parameter. Furthermore, identifiability of model parameters is done using the least square method. The results indicated that protection of healthcare workers can be achieved through effective use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers and minimization of transmission of COVID-19 in the general public by the implementation of control measures. Generally, this paper emphasizes the importance of using protective measures.","Masandawa, Lemjini; Mirau, Silas Steven; Mbalawata, Isambi Sailon",Results Phys,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513578/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721008032?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379721008032,510
591923,War on two fronts: Experience of children with cancer and their family during COVID-19 pandemic in Iran,2020-10-24,"BACKGROUND: Accepted systematic review (SR) methodology requires citation screening by two reviewers to maximise retrieval of eligible studies. We hypothesized that records could be excluded by a single reviewer without loss of sensitivity in two conditions; the record was ineligible for multiple reasons, or the record was ineligible for one or more specific reasons that could be reliably assessed. METHODS: Twenty-four SRs performed at CHEO, a pediatric health care and research centre in Ottawa, Canada, were divided into derivation and validation sets. Exclusion criteria during abstract screening were sorted into 11 specific categories, with loss in sensitivity determined by individual category and by number of exclusion criteria endorsed. Five single reviewer algorithms that combined individual categories and multiple exclusion criteria were then tested on the derivation and validation sets, with success defined a priori as less than 5% loss of sensitivity. RESULTS: The 24 SRs included 930 eligible and 27390 ineligible citations. The reviews were mostly focused on pediatrics (70.8%, N=17/24), but covered various specialties. Using a single reviewer to exclude any citation led to an average loss of sensitivity of 8.6% (95%CI, 6.0–12.1%). Excluding citations with ≥2 exclusion criteria led to 1.2% average loss of sensitivity (95%CI, 0.5–3.1%). Five specific exclusion criteria performed with perfect sensitivity: conference abstract, ineligible age group, case report/series, not human research, and review article. In the derivation set, the five algorithms achieved a loss of sensitivity ranging from 0.0 to 1.9% and work-saved ranging from 14.8 to 39.1%. In the validation set, the loss of sensitivity for all 5 algorithms remained below 2.6%, with work-saved between 10.5% and 48.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that targeted application of single-reviewer screening, considering both type and number of exclusion criteria, could retain sensitivity and significantly decrease workload. Further research is required to investigate the potential for combining this approach with crowdsourcing or machine learning methodologies.

591987,"Potential benefit of vitamin d supplementation in people with respiratory illnesses, during the Covid‐19 pandemic",2021-05-31,"Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have examined the possibility of correlating the virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, to the climatic conditions of the involved sites; however, inconclusive results have been generally obtained. Although neither air temperature nor humidity can be independently correlated with virus viability, a strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the specific enthalpy of moist air appears to exist, as confirmed by extensive data analysis. Given this framework, the present study involves a detailed investigation based on the first 20–30 days of the epidemic before public health interventions in 30 selected Italian provinces with rather different climates, here assumed as being representative of what happened in the country from North to South, of the relationship between COVID-19 distributions and the climatic conditions recorded at each site before the pandemic outbreak. Accordingly, a correlating equation between the incidence rate at the early stage of the epidemic and the foregoing average specific enthalpy of atmospheric air was developed, and an enthalpy-based seasonal virulence risk scale was proposed to predict the potential danger of COVID-19 outbreak due to the persistence of weather conditions favorable to SARS-CoV-2 viability. As an early detection tool, an unambiguous risk chart expressed in terms of coupled temperatures and relative humidity (RH) values was provided, showing that safer conditions occur in the case of higher RHs at the highest temperatures, and of lower RHs at the lowest temperatures. Despite the complex determinism and dynamics of the pandemic and the related caveats, the restriction of the study to its early stage allowed the proposed risk scale to result in agreement with the available infectivity data highlighted in the literature for a number of cities around the world.","Spena, Angelo; Palombi, Leonardo; Corcione, Massimo; Quintino, Alessandro; Carestia, Mariachiara; Spena, Vincenzo Andrea",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291676/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17239059,510

In the United Kingdom surgery has continued—in a reduced capacity—through the establishment of regional ‘cancer hubs’ using independent sector facilities to treat public healthcare patients. It is essential that these scarce operating facilities available are optimally utilized and that logistical challenges that result from remote operating away from the surgeon’s primary hospital site are considered.

592343,The Impact of Lockdown During the COVID-19 Outbreak on Dietary Habits in Various Population Groups: A Scoping Review,2021-03-04,"The mechanisms that enable Seneca Valley Virus (SVV) to escape the host innate immune response are not well known. Previous studies demonstrated that SVV 3C(pro) suppresses innate immune responses by cleavage of host proteins and degradation of IRF3 and IRF7 protein expression. Here, we showed that SVV 3C protease (3C(pro)) has deubiquitinating activity. Overexpressed 3C(pro) inhibits the ubiquitination of cellular substrates, acting on both lysine-48- and lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. SVV infection also possessed deubiquitinating activity. The ubiquitin-proteasome system was significantly involved in SVV replication. Furthermore, 3C(pro) inhibited the ubiquitination of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), thereby blocking the expression of interferon (IFN)-β and IFN stimulated gene 54 (ISG54) mRNAs. A detailed analysis revealed that mutations (H48A, C160A, or H48A/C160A) that ablate the Cys and His residues of 3C(pro) abrogated its deubiquitinating activity and the ability of 3C(pro) to block IFN-β induction. Together, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism developed by SVV 3C(pro) to promote viral replication, and may also provide a novel strategy for improving ubiquitination-based therapy.","Xue, Qiao; Liu, Huisheng; Zhu, Zixiang; Yang, Fan; Xue, Qinghong; Cai, Xuepeng; Liu, Xiangtao; Zheng, Haixue",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218304303; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.10.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408499/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218304303,510

Method: A narrative review of recent advances in technologies underpinning conversational agents and their use and potential for healthcare and improving health outcomes. Results: By responding to written and spoken language, conversational agents present a versatile, natural user interface and have the potential to make their services and applications more widely accessible. Historically, conversational interfaces for health applications have focused mainly on mental health, but with an increase in affordable devices and the modernization of health services, conversational agents are becoming more widely deployed across the health system. We present our work on context-aware voice assistants capable of proactively engaging users and delivering health information and services. The proactive voice agents we deploy, allow us to conduct experience sampling in people's homes and to collect information about the contexts in which users are interacting with them. Conclusion: In this article, we describe the state-of-the-art of these and other enabling technologies for speech and conversation and discuss ongoing research efforts to develop conversational agents that “live” with patients and customize their service offerings around their needs. These agents can function as ‘digital companions’ who will send reminders about medications and appointments, proactively check in to gather self-assessments, and follow up with patients on their treatment plans. Together with an unobtrusive and continuous collection of other health data, conversational agents can provide novel and deeply personalized access to digital health care, and they will continue to become an increasingly important part of the ecosystem for future healthcare delivery.","Dingler, Tilman; Kwasnicka, Dominika; Wei, Jing; Gong, Enying; Oldenburg, Brian",Yearb Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34479391/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1726510,510

The regionally-based Italian National Health System has been reorganized. Hospitals' biggest challenge was to create new intensive care unit (ICU) beds, as the existing system was insufficient to meet new demand, especially in the most affected areas. Our institution in the Milan metropolitan area of Lombardy, the epicentre of the infection, was selected as one of the three regional hub for major trauma, serving a population of more than three million people. The aims were the increase the ICU beds and the rationalization of human and structural resources available for treating COVID-19 patients. In our hub hospital, the reorganization aimed to reduce the risk of infection and to obtained resources, in terms of beds and healthcare personnel to be use in the COVID-19 emergency. Non-urgent outpatient orthopaedic activity and elective surgery was also suspended. A training programme for healthcare personnel started immediately. Orthopaedic and radiological pathways dedicated to COVID-19 patients, or with possible infection, have been established. In our orthopaedic department, we passed from 70 to 26 beds. Our goal is to treat trauma surgery's patient in the “golden 72 hours” in order to reduce the overall hospital length of stay. We applied an objective priority system to manage the flow of surgical procedures in the emergency room based on clinical outcomes and guidelines. Organizing the present to face the emergency is a challenge, but in the global plan of changes in hospital management one must also think about the near future.

The objective of this study is to investigate the COVID-19 prevention behaviors within the framework of the Health Belief Model in the city of Depalpur in the Okara District of Pakistan in May 2020. Using an observational, cross-sectional, and quantitative study design, a face-to-face field survey was conducted during the epidemic of COVID-19 in district Okara, Pakistan. A sample of 500 adults was selected from the city of Depalpur the in Okara district of Pakistan, using a two-stage sampling design with cluster sampling in stage one and systematic random sampling at stage two. A COVID-19 prevention behavior scale was computed based on twelve dichotomous items. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and negative binomial regression analyses were performed. The most common prevention behavior among study participants was avoiding going for walks in the parks (81.0%), followed by not leaving home during the lockdown (72.6%), and washing hands every day with soap and water for 20 s after going out of their home (64.0%). Fewer people exhibited prevention behaviors such as social distancing (e.g., staying at least six feet away from other people) which in the EU was recommended to be a minimum of 1.5–2 m (44.4%) and following all of the basic protective measures (e.g., hand washing, use of a face covering in public, social distancing) in order to protect against COVID-19 (33.0%). The results from the negative binomial regression analysis showed that after controlling for the other HBM constructs and sociodemographic factors, only the perceived benefits of preventative actions showed significant association with the prevention behavior scale (IRR, 1.16; CI, 1.061–1.276; p < 0.001).

594391,Expected impact of lockdown measures due to COVID-19 on disabling conditions: a modelling study of chronic low back pain,2021-07-27,"Ireland is small country with a population of 4.8M which spent 6.9% of its gross domestic product on healthcare in 2018. Health services are provided through a twin track approach – all public services are largely free to those eligible (32.44% in 2019) and private patients pay for most services. Most of the expenditure on medicines is paid by the government while visits to General Practitioners (GPs) are an out-of-pocket expense for private patients under 70 years of age, and private health insurance provides cover for most hospital services. Healthcare professionals in the primary care sector contract to provide public services with the Health Services Executive (HSE) which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the service. Primary care teams began to be formed in 2001 to try to link and integrate the provision of care but since these are led by GPs neither community pharmacists nor dentists joined these teams. The focus of policy remained the primary care team until a proposal to create a public health service to provide universal health coverage called Sláintecare was agreed in 2017. However, implementation of Sláintecare has been slow and piecemeal. The government regularly devises policies to control prescribing and the HSE, together with other regulators has implemented generic substitution and preferred drugs and limited access to expensive drugs through schemes for particular patient groups. A programme called Healthy Ireland has taken on the health promotion policies but pharmacists have been excluded from most programmes although some campaigns have included them. Community pharmacy organisations have tried to develop pharmacy services and while a few which are targeted at specified patient groups, such as opioid substitution, emergency administration of certain drugs, emergency hormonal contraception and seasonal influenza vaccination have been remunerated for public patients by the HSE, other services have not. GP organisations defend their members’ scope of practice and seek to influence policy makers to channel schemes and services through general practice. There is no professional body to represent pharmacists that is independent of any trade union responsibilities and this has weakened the profession’s advocacy. Pharmacists are one of the most trusted group of professionals in Ireland and have maintained their practices throughout periods of recession and declining income from government. Whether pharmacists can argue that the optimisation of a patient’s medicines depends upon their contribution and will benefit the health service remains an open question.","Henman, Martin C.",Pharm Pract (Granada),https://doi.org/10.18549/pharmpract.2020.4.2224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294066/,510

In addition to their immune functions, microglial cells play an important role in other cerebral processes, including the regulation of synaptic architecture and neurogenesis. Chronic microglial activation is regarded as detrimental, and it is considered a pathogenic mechanism common to several neurological disorders. Microglial activation and function have been extensively studied in rodent experimental models, whereas the characterization of human cells has been limited due to the restricted availability of primary sources of human microglia. To overcome this problem, human immortalized microglial cell lines have been developed. The human microglial clone 3 cell line, HMC3, was established in 1995, through SV40-dependent immortalization of human embryonic microglial cells. It has been recently authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC®) and distributed under the name of HMC3 (ATCC®CRL-3304). The HMC3 cells have been used in six research studies, two of which also indicated by ATCC® as reference articles. However, a more accurate literature revision suggests that clone 3 was initially distributed under the name of CHME3. In this regard, several studies have been published, thus contributing to a more extensive characterization of this cell line. Remarkably, the same cell line has been used in different laboratories with other denominations, i.e., CHME-5 cells and C13-NJ cells. In view of the fact that “being now authenticated by ATCC®” may imply a wider distribution of the cells, we aimed at reviewing data obtained with the human microglia cell line clone 3, making the readers aware of this complicated nomenclature.

595410,"Fear, Loss, Social Isolation, and Incomplete Grief Due to COVID-19: A Recipe for a Psychiatric Pandemic",2020-07-08,"BACKGROUND: The Serious Outcomes Surveillance Network of the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN SOS) has been performing active influenza surveillance since 2009 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01517191). Influenza A and B viruses are identified and characterized using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and multiplex testing has been performed on a subset of patients to identify other respiratory virus aetiologies. Since both methods can identify influenza A and B, a direct comparison was performed. METHODS: Validated real-time RT-PCRs from the World Health Organization (WHO) to identify influenza A and B viruses, characterize influenza A viruses into the H1N1 or H3N2 subtypes and describe influenza B viruses belonging to the Yamagata or Victoria lineages. In a subset of patients, the Seeplex RV15 One-Step ACE Detection assay (RV15) kit was also used for the detection of other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: In total, 1111 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by RV15 and real-time RT-PCRs for influenza A and B identification and characterization. For influenza A, RV15 showed 98.0 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity and 99.7 % accuracy. The performance characteristics of RV15 were similar for influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. For influenza B, RV15 had 99.2 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity and 99.8 % accuracy, with similar assay performance being shown for both the Yamagata and Victoria lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the detection of circulating subtypes of influenza A and lineages of influenza B by RV15 was similar to detection by real-time RT-PCR. Multiplex testing with RV15 allows for a more comprehensive respiratory virus surveillance in hospitalized adults, without significantly compromising the reliability of influenza A or B virus detection.","LeBlanc, J.

595453,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Rheumatology Practice in Latin America.,2021-06-15,"Covid-19 disease caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious epidemic that originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in late December 2019. World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 as a pandemic on 12th March 2020. Researchers and policy makers are designing strategies to control the pandemic in order to minimize its impact on human health and economy round the clock. The SARS-CoV-2 virus transmits mostly through respiratory droplets and through contaminated surfacesin human body.Securing an appropriate level of safety during the pandemic situation is a highly problematic issue which resulted from the transportation sector which has been hit hard by COVID-19. This paper focuses on developing an intelligent computing model for forecasting the outbreak of COVID-19. The Facebook Prophet model predicts 90 days future values including the peak date of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 for six worst hit countries of the world including India and six high incidence states of India. The model also identifies five significant changepoints in the growth curve of confirmed cases of India which indicate the impact of the interventions imposed by Government of India on the growth rate of the infection. The goodness-of-fit of the model measures 85% MAPE for all six countries and all six states of India. The above computational analysis may be able to throw some light on planning and management of healthcare system and infrastructure.","Dash, Sujata; Chakraborty, Chinmay; Giri, Sourav K.; Pani, Subhendu Kumar",Pattern Recognit Lett,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167865521002762; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865521002762?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2021.07.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413555/,510

Today most of the synthetic drugs showed adverse and unacceptable side effects, however, impressive bioactivities with reduced toxicities were reported for many botanicals against several chronic or difficult-to-treat diseases. A whole range of viral diseases including human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Rabies, Dengue, and Herpes need effective drugs. Considerable research has been carried out on the pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology, and therapeutics of traditional medicines of diverse cultures, and many pharmaceutical companies have renewed their strategies for antiviral drug development where no effective drugs or vaccine exist. Thus, phytochemicals with antiviral potentials need to be studied in depth with standardization, chemical isolation, effectivity, molecular mechanism, along with in vivo toxicity and efficacy to reduce cost and time. This review will portray the scientific approaches and methodologies used for the development of antiviral leads from traditional medicines against selected genetically and functionally diverse viral infections.","Chattopadhyay, Debprasad; Ojha, Durbadal; Mondal, Supriya; Goswami, Debayan",Evidence-Based Validation of Herbal Medicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128008744000088; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128008744000088,510
596116,Emergent Drug and Nutrition Interactions in COVID-19: A Comprehensive Narrative Review,2021-05-04,"PURPOSE: To determine secondary effects of the mandated COVID-19 pandemic closure period for elective treatment on non-elective, injection-based retina care and outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of a single-provider outpatient clinic across multiple satellites, consecutive patients returning for intravitreal injections (IVIs) of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor or corticosteroids were identified as “delayed” or “undelayed” during a six-week study interval during the COVID-19 pandemic that closely following a mandated period of prohibited elective encounters. A “delayed” encounter was defined as having a follow-up interval exceeding 33% of the recommended cycle. Patients seen for IVIs during the corresponding six-week interval a year previously were identified for study as pre-COVID-19 controls. Main outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) assessment based on findings of intraretinal or subretinal fluid consistent with new or recurrent neovascular events. RESULTS: The study included 183 eyes of 144 patients who underwent IVI-based care from June 18, 2020, through August 7, 2020, compared to 193 eyes of 154 patients injected during the corresponding interval 1 year before. There were 62 eyes of 46 patients seen in the study period later than scheduled (among 144 patients of 183 eyes in total), which represented a larger proportion of delayed patients compared to the previous year (31.9% vs. 14.9%, p<0.0005). Considering the patterns from the control group, the attributed delay due to COVID-19 was 15.0% of patients. The delayed return eyes had a greater decline in BCVA (3 letters), higher rates of worsened OCT results (48%), and prompted reduction in previously prescribed injection intervals (p<0.02). CONCLUSION: The unintended consequence of delayed care of patients on established care regimens should be anticipated, and mitigate strategies considered if similar restrictions are mandated in the future.","Ashkenazy, Noy; Goduni, Lediana; Smiddy, William E",Clin Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s296345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33568895/,510

DESIGN: A descriptive study outlining real-world experience with INVOCELL that addresses patient selection, ovarian stimulation, embryology laboratory practices, and outcomes. SETTING: Five fertility centers in Missouri, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. PATIENTS: Four hundred sixty-three patients undergoing 526 cycles. INTERVENTION: IVC using INVOCELL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative pregnancy rate and live births. Secondary outcomes of interest included percent good quality embryos. RESULTS: IVC with INVOCELL was primarily used in women <38 years with anti-Mullerian hormone level >0.8 ng/mL. The mean numbers of retrieved oocytes ranged from 9.2 to 16. Mean numbers of oocytes and sperm-injected oocytes loaded per INVOCELL ranged from a mean of 6.4–9.5 with a reported maximum of 34 oocytes loaded into the device. Most (95%) of the embryos were transferred on day 5. The mean blastocyst recovery per oocyte loaded into the device ranged from 19% to 34%; mean cumulative live birth plus ongoing pregnancy rates ranged from 29% to 53% per cycle start and 40% to 61% per transfer. CONCLUSIONS: This study of IVC using INVOCELL as an alternative model for infertility treatment confirms its utility as a viable alternative to standard incubator-based in vitro fertilization. The technology is compatible within the current framework of practice patterns and, when appropriately used, results in acceptable blastocyst recovery and live birth rates.

596779,Thirty-Day Outcomes of Children and Adolescents With COVID-19: An International Experience,2021,"BACKGROUND: Much of what is known about COVID-19 risk factors comes from patients with serious symptoms who test positive. While risk factors for hospitalization or death include chronic conditions and smoking; less is known about how health status or nicotine consumption is associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who do not present clinically. METHODS: Two community-based population samples (including individuals randomly and nonrandomly selected for statewide testing, n = 8214) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing in nonclinical settings. Each participant was tested for current (viral PCR) and past (antibody) infection in either April or June of 2020. Before testing, participants provided demographic information and self-reported health status and nicotine and tobacco behaviors (smoking, chewing, vaping/e-cigarettes). Using descriptive statistics and a bivariate logistic regression model, we examined the association between health status and use of tobacco or nicotine with SARS-CoV-2 positivity on either PCR or antibody tests. RESULTS: Compared to people with self-identified “excellent” or very good health status, those reporting “good” or “fair” health status had a higher risk of past or current infections. Positive smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chewing tobacco was associated with infection and the use of vaping/e-cigarettes was not associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a statewide, community-based population drawn for SARS-CoV-2 testing, we find that overall health status was associated with infection rates. Unlike in studies of COVID-19 patients, smoking status was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. More research is needed to further understand the nature of this relationship.","Duszynski, Thomas J.; Fadel, William; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara K.; Dixon, Brian E.; Yiannoutsos, Constantin; Halverson, Paul K.; Menachemi, Nir",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11867-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600513/,510
596810,Geriatric outreach to residential aged care: Embracing a dynamic approach in the COVID‐19 era,2020-10-13,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of COVID-19 specific monoclonal antibodies (mABs) with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), alongside UPMC Health System efforts to increase patient access to these mABs. TRIAL DESIGN: Open-label, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness platform trial with response-adaptive randomization PARTICIPANTS: We will evaluate patients who meet the eligibility criteria stipulated by the COVID-19 mAB EUAs who receive mABs within the UPMC Health System, including infusion centers and emergency departments. EUA eligibility criteria include patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, <10 days of symptoms, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization (elderly, obese, and/or with specific comorbidities). The EUA criteria exclude patients who require oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19 and patients already hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19. We will use data collected for routine clinical care, including data entered into the electronic medical record and from follow-up calls. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The interventions are the COVID-19 specific mABs authorized by the EUAs. All aspects of mAB treatment, including eligibility criteria, dosing, and post-infusion monitoring, are as per the EUAs. As a comparative effectiveness trial, all patients receive mAB treatment, and the interventions are compared against each other. When U.S. government mAB policies change (e.g., FDA grants or revokes EUAs), UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mAB interventions will accordingly change. From November 2020 to February 2021, FDA issued EUAs for three mAB treatments (bamlanivimab; bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab), and at trial launch on March 10, 2021 we evaluated all three. Due to a sustained increase in SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States resistant to bamlanivimab administered alone, on March 24, 2021 the U.S. Government halted distribution of bamlanivimab alone, and UPMC accordingly halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. On April 16, 2021, FDA revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab monotherapy. At the time of manuscript submission, we are therefore evaluating the two mAB treatments authorized by EUAs (bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is total hospital free days (HFD) at 28 days after mAB administration, calculated as 28 minus the number of days during the index stay (if applicable – e.g., for patients admitted to hospital after mAB administration in the emergency department) minus the number of days readmitted during the 28 days after treatment. This composite endpoint captures the number of days from the day of mAB administration to the 28 days thereafter, during which the patient is alive and free of hospitalization. Death within 28 days is recorded as -1 HFD, as the worst outcome. RANDOMISATION: We will start with equal allocation. Due to uncertainty in sample size, we will use a Bayesian adaptive design and response adaptive randomization to ensure ability to provide statistical inference despite variable sample size. When mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order, the order is filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange. OPTIMISE-C19 provides the therapeutic interchange via random allocation. Infusion center operations teams and pharmacists use a mAB assignment application embedded in the electronic medical record to determine the random allocation. BLINDING (MASKING): This trial is open-label. However, outcome assessors conducting follow-up calls at day 28 are blinded to mAB assignment, and investigators are blinded to by-mAB aggregate outcome data until a statistical platform trial conclusion is reached. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Sample size will be determined by case volume throughout the course of the pandemic, supply of FDA authorized mABs, and by that needed to reach a platform trial conclusion of inferiority, superiority, or futility of a given mAB. The trial will continue as long as more than one mAB type is available under EUA, and their comparative effectiveness is uncertain. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol Version 1.0, February 24, 2021. Recruitment began March 10, 2021 and is ongoing at the time of manuscript submission. The estimated recruitment end date is February 22, 2022, though the final end date is dependent on how the pandemic evolves, mAB availability, and when final platform trial conclusions are reached. As noted above, due to U.S. Government decisions, UPMC Health System halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04790786.

596914,Mitigating Health Risks to Reopen a Clinical Research Laboratory During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Framework,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease and questions rise about the coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) effect on nervous system. This involvement could help explaining the pathogenesis of this condition and lead to novel therapeutic approaches. OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients during the Italian pandemic outbreak, as reported by physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the early days of pandemic emergence we developed an online survey open to all Italian clinicians involved in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. The survey was structured in three sections, with nine different items concerning the presence of different specific clinical abnormalities. Each item was graded from “absent” to “severe” in a 4-point Likert’s scale. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Likert’s scale data were analyzed by studying the distribution of responses by using medians and bar charts-relative frequencies. Also, in order to analyze differences in symptoms findings depending on the group of specialty, Likert’s scale data were combined into two nominal categories (“absent”/“low” and “moderate”/”high”/”) and a contingency table chi-square test was used. RESULTS: 126 physicians of 9 different medical specialties, from 10 regions of Italy, filled the online survey. The results show that 87.3% of practitioners reported neurological symptoms. In most cases these were mild and non-specific, but they were severe in a minority of patients. The most common symptoms observed were headache, myalgia and taste and smell abnormalities. Whilst there was no difference between neurologists and non-neurologists, we found that experienced clinicians (defined as clinicians that evaluated more than 30 patients) reported neurological symptoms more frequently than non-expert. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms have frequently been ported during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic, and thus should be monitored for all affected patients. Whilst some of the disturbances reported may be non-specific and common to other infectious diseases, smell and taste abnormalities might indicate nervous system as entry door for SARS-CoV-2 virus. This interpretation should promote research trials to avoid nervous system involvement.","Campiglio, Laura; Priori, Alberto",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915818/,510

Objective: To explore the lived experience of professionals at an independently operating palliative care hospital department in China's mainland. Design: We used purposive sampling to select palliative care physicians and nurses. Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted in person. Thematic analysis was used to elicit key themes that pertained to participants' lived experience. Setting/Subjects: Ten palliative care physicians and seven nurses at the palliative medicine department in the West China Fourth Hospital of Sichuan University in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, participated in the interviews. Results: Three themes related to participants' lived experience were (1) interactions with patients and families (e.g., frequent encounters with death, communication difficulties, witnessing family struggles, and developing mutually trusting relationships); (2) factors influencing their work life (e.g., supportive working environment, unmet training needs, policy restrictions, and lack of public awareness); and (3) perceived nature of work (e.g., complex and demanding, underappreciation, encroachment of work stress into personal life, deriving accomplishment from work, and personal growth). Conclusion: This study helps fill the void in the palliative care literature regarding the lived experience of inpatient palliative care professionals in China's mainland.

The pathobiology, natural history, and response to therapy of the diverse causes of secondary ITP differ from each other and from primary ITP, so accurate diagnosis is essential. Immune thrombocytopenia can be secondary to medications or to a concurrent disease, such as an autoimmune condition (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [APS], immune thyroid disease, or Evans syndrome), a lymphoproliferative disease (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or large granular T-lymphocyte lymphocytic leukemia), or chronic infection, eg, with Helicobacter pylori, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Response to infection may generate antibodies that cross-react with platelet antigens (HIV, H pylori) or immune complexes that bind to platelet Fcγ receptors (HCV) and platelet production may be impaired by infection of megakaryocyte bone marrow-dependent progenitor cells (HCV and HIV), decreased production of thrombopoietin (TPO), and splenic sequestration of platelets secondary to portal hypertension (HCV). Sudden and severe onset of thrombocytopenia has been observed in children after vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella or natural viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster virus. This thrombocytopenia may be caused by cross-reacting antibodies and closely mimics acute ITP of childhood.

Paired nucleic acid amplification tests of oropharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were performed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of the 554 staff members tested, 0.19% (95% CI 0.03, 1.10%) had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 as detected by RT-PCR. In contrast, 23 staff members, i.e. 4.15% (95% CI 2.78, 6.15%), had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with a wide range of antibody titres. There was no evidence of differences in seroconversion between countries with estimates ranging from 2.78% (95% CI 0.77, 9.58) in Austria to 6.75% (95% CI 4.46, 10.1) for the UK. There was no strong evidence of clustering within the clinics, with 21 of the 30 facilities having no staff members affected (prevalence estimates ranging from 0% to 35%), and one clinic having seven staff members affected (35% (95% CI 18.1%, 56.7%)). The single staff member who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus was in the pre-symptomatic phase and was isolated, with no contacts having evidence of infection on repeat testing. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This was a cross-sectional study prior to resumption of clinical activity, with repeat testing not undertaken. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The low prevalence of seroconversion of fertility clinic staff highlights the need for continued comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and engagement with national endeavours to identify and isolate new cases and their contacts as we embark on the resumption of fertility services.

600797,Anxiety and depression symptoms after COVID-19 infection: results from the COVID Symptom Study app,2021-07-08,"The outbreak of 2019-nCoV in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019 poses unprecedent public health challenges to both China and the rest world1. The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus2. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.","Xiao, Kangpeng; Zhai, Junqiong; Feng, Yaoyu; Zhou, Niu; Zhang, Xu; Zou, Jie-Jian; Li, Na; Guo, Yaqiong; Li, Xiaobing; Shen, Xuejuan; Zhang, Zhipeng; Shu, Fanfan; Huang, Wanyi; Li, Yu; Zhang, Ziding; Chen, Rui-Ai; Wu, Ya-Jiang; Peng, Shi-Ming; Huang, Mian; Xie, Wei-Jun; Cai, Qin-Hui; Hou, Fang-Hui; Liu, Yahong; Chen, Wu; Xiao, Lihua; Shen, Yongyi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.951335,510

601481,Italian COVID-19 epidemic: effects on paediatric emergency attendance—a survey in the Emilia Romagna region,2020-07-20,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In animals, two dominant organs are infected by coronaviruses, the respiratory tract and the gut. In past epidemics, a shift from the lung to the gut or vice versa has been observed. Analysis of the SARS episode in 2003 had suggested the possibility of a “double epidemic” explaining the absence of severe cases in Shanghai at the time. Here, using data from Wuhan and Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shenzhen, we discuss whether the present respiratory contagion route for SARS-CoV-2 might have also resulted from faecal contamination. We noticed that the propagation of the disease in the city of Wuhan underwent an original course. Besides the expected respiratory route, the disease appeared to have been greatly facilitated by a secondary propagation route, thus substantiating the beneficial effect of an effective quarantine. By contrast, a similar situation based on early data did not prevail in Hong Kong or Singapore. Our work shows how health authorities could decide to orient their prevention measures, depending on the analysis of ongoing epidemics, as a function of the identification of a secondary route in parallel with the prevailing one. Our model could also help highlight voluntarily or accidentally biased data collection. ABSTRACT: Background: Starting late 2019, a novel coronavirus spread from the capital of the Hubei province in China to the rest of the country, then to most of the world. To anticipate future trends in the development of the pandemic, we explore here, based on public records of infected persons, how variation in the virus tropism could end up in different patterns, warranting a specific strategy to handle the epidemic. Methods: We use a compartmental model to describe the evolution of an individual through several possible states: susceptible, infected, alternative infection, detected, and removed. We fit the parameters of the model to the existing data, taking into account significant quarantine changes where necessary. Results: The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective, but that alternative virus forms and a second propagation route are compatible with available data. For the Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shenzhen regions, the secondary route does not seem to be active. Conclusions: Hypotheses of an alternative infection tropism (the gut tropism) and a secondary propagation route are discussed using a model fitted by the available data. Corresponding prevention measures that take into account both routes should be implemented to the benefit of epidemic control.","Danchin, Antoine; Ng, Tuen Wai; Turinici, Gabriel",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375381/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10010010,510

602438,Smart healthcare support for remote patient monitoring during covid-19 quarantine,2020-09-15,"Aim: Many governments in East and Southeast Asia responded promptly and effectively at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Synthesizing and analyzing these responses is vital for disease control evidence-based policymaking. Methods: An extensive review of COVID-19 control measures was conducted in selected Asian countries and subregions, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Vietnam from 1 January to 30 May 2020. Control measures were categorized into administrative, public health, and health system measures. To evaluate the stringency and timeliness of responses, we developed two indices: the Initial Response Index (IRI) and the Modified Stringency Index (MSI), which builds on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). Results: Comprehensive administrative, public health, and health system control measures were implemented at the onset of the outbreak. Despite variations in package components, the stringency of control measures across the study sites increased with the acceleration of the outbreak, with public health control measures implemented the most stringently. Variations in daily average MSI scores are observed, with Mainland China scoring the highest (74.2), followed by Singapore (67.4), Vietnam (66.8), Hong Kong (66.2), South Korea (62.3), Taiwan (52.1), and Japan (50.3). Variations in IRI scores depicting timeliness were higher: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Singapore acted faster (IRI > 50.0), while Japan (42.4) and Mainland China (4.2) followed. Conclusions: Timely setting of stringency of the control measures, especially public health measures, at dynamically high levels is key to optimally controlling outbreaks.","Chen, Shu; Guo, Lei; Alghaith, Taghred; Dong, Di; Alluhidan, Mohammed; Hamza, Mariam M.; Herbst, Christopher H.; Zhang, Xinqi; Tagtag, Gabrielle Charis Alano; Zhang, Yi; Alazemi, Nahar; Saber, Rana; Alsukait, Reem; Tang, Shenglan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444434/,510
603660,Guillain Barr e syndrome in COVID-19:A scoping review,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic condition resulting in movement, behavioural and cognitive impairments. People with HD have low levels of physical activity which may be compounded by insufficient support from health‐care professionals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the initial acceptability of a co‐designed tool used within a HD clinic to promote physical activity. DESIGN: Co‐design of a physical activity tool; acceptability evaluation. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Co‐design included people with HD and health‐care professionals. Acceptability was evaluated in a HD clinic in the UK. MAIN VARIABLES STUDIED: A physical activity tool was co‐designed and used within a HD clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Acceptability as assessed by semi‐structured interviews with members of the HD clinic. RESULTS: Forty people visited the HD clinic; 19 were given physical activity advice. Themes around who, where and how promotion of physical activity could take place were identified; concepts of benefits and barriers were threads through each theme. DISCUSSION: We describe for the first time the co‐design of a HD specific physical activity tool. Our associated acceptability study emphasizes the importance of individualized planning of physical activities in complex neurodegenerative conditions. Perceived barriers were time and lack of knowledge of local resources. CONCLUSIONS: A simple tool can support conversations about physical activity with people with HD and is an aid to individualized goal setting.

603749,Neurological manifestations in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: a systematic review of literature,2020-10-21,"Abstract Low Impact Developments (LIDs) employ a series of vegetative techniques to retain rainfall close to the origin. Although LIDs offer sustainable runoff management, these infrastructures can be considered a risk to public health due to the presence of pathogens in the runoff and human exposure to contaminated water held in and transported by LIDs. The objective of this study is to examine the disease burden from exposure to LIDs at the residential, neighbourhood, and municipal levels. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of literature on three water features: (1) harvested rainwater obtained from LIDs, (2) surface water, and (3) floodwater. A set of 32 studies were systematically selected to collect values of risks of infection and expressed as the disease burden, i.e. disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The results showed that the percentage of GI illness exceeding the health guidelines were high for harvested rainwater, i.e. 22% of annual disease burden exceeded the WHO guidelines (0.001 DALYs/1000 persons), and 2% exceeded the US EPA guidelines (5.75 DALYs/1000 bathers). Among the six exposures for harvested rainwater, exposure to spray irrigation, exceeded US EPA guidelines whereas; five exposures, i.e. flushing, hosing, daily shower, spray irrigation, and children playing, surpassed the WHO guidelines. Considering LID treatment, the values of annual disease burden from all the selected barriers were below US EPA guidelines however, these values exceeded the WHO guidelines for three barriers i.e. water plaza, grass swale, and open storage ponds. These findings provide a broader perspective of the disease burden associated with LIDs and emphasise to consider the type of exposures and required treatment barriers for developing LID infrastructures in urban areas.","Ishaq, Sadia; Sadiq, Rehan; Farooq, Shaukat; Chhipi-Shrestha, Gyan; Hewage, Kasun",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720343023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720343023?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32717466/,510

This review aimed to identify and compare at-home diagnostic tests that have been granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) and convey details about COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including regulatory information, pertinent to pharmacy practice. Methods Food and Drug Administration (FDA) online resources pertaining to COVID-19 tests, EUAs, and medical devices were consulted, as well as linked resources from the FDA’s webpages. Homepages of the 9 COVID-19 home tests with EUAs were comprehensively reviewed. PubMed literature searches were performed, most recently in May 2021, to locate literature about the identified home tests, as were searches of Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Literature Selection Studies were included if they were performed at home or were self-collected (or collected by a parent or guardian for patients under 18 years of age), and evaluated the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results Limited data has been published for these home tests given that they are available through EUAs that do not require clinical trials. Fifteen studies were located from searching the literature, but only 2 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the home-tests' websites yielded a single study for each test with the 3 BinaxNow platforms using the same study for their EUAs. The 9 COVID-19 home tests with EUAs as of May 7, 2021 include 3 molecular tests and 6 antigen tests. These tests had similar performance based on positive percent agreement ranging from 83.5% to 97.4% and negative percent agreement ranging from 97% to 100%. Conclusions The 9 SARS-CoV-2 home tests demonstrated satisfactory performance in comparison to laboratory real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. The convenience and ease of use of these tests make them well-suited for home-based rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Kepczynski, Casey M.; Genigeski, Jaelin A.; Koski, Renee R.; Bernknopf, Allison C.; Konieczny, Alison M.; Klepser, Michael E.",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34274214/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319121002806; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319121002806?v=s5,510

Our research is based on a detailed cartographic review of maps made during the War of Succession, largely improving preexisting studies based on books of itineraries from the sixteenth century onwards. We build a new, complete map of the main roads at the beginning of the eighteenth century along with the matrix of transport costs for all the important towns describing the communications network. Our study of this complex network, supplemented by a counterfactual analysis carried out using a simulation model based on agents using different centralized decision-making processes, allows us to establish three main results. First, existing trade flows at the beginning of the eighteenth century had a radial structure, so the Bourbon infrastructure plan only consolidated a preexisting situation. Second, the development of the network did not suppose important alterations in the comparative centrality of the regions. Finally, the design of the paved road network was adequate for the economic needs of the country. These findings are in stark contrast with claims that the radial structure of the Bourbon roads was designed ex-novo with political or ideological objectives rather than economic ones. Our methodology paves the way to further studies of path-dependent, long-term processes of network design as the key to understanding the true origin of many currently existing situations.","Pablo-Martí, Federico; Alañón-Pardo, Ángel; Sánchez, Angel",Cliometrica (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042288/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11698-020-00218-x,510

Elastic knee sleeves may be useful adjuncts to rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to determine the immediate and 6-week effects of wearing a knee sleeve on person-reported outcomes and function in participants who had undergone an ACL reconstruction and who had residual self-reported functional limitations. METHODS: Individuals with ACL reconstruction in the previous 6 months to 5 years were recruited. Immediate effects of a commercially-available elastic knee sleeve on single-leg horizontal hop distance were explored using a cross-over design. Following this first session, participants were randomised into a Control Group and a Sleeve Group who wore the sleeve for 6 weeks, at least 1 h daily. Outcome measures for the randomised clinical trial (RCT) were the International Knee Documentation Classification Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) score, the single-leg horizontal hop distance, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring peak torque. Linear mixed models were used to determine random effects. Where both limbs were measured at multiple time points, a random measurement occasion effect nested within participant was used. RESULTS: Thirty-four individuals (16 women) with ACL reconstruction completed the cross-over trial. Hop distance for the injured side during the sleeve condition increased by 3.6 % (95 % CI 0.4–6.8 %, p = 0.025). There was no evidence of differential changes between groups for the IKDC-SKF (Sleeve Group n = 15; Control Group n = 16; p = 0.327), or relative improvement in the injured side compared to the uninjured side for the physical performance measures (Sleeve Group n = 12, Control Group n = 12; three-way interaction p = 0.533 [hop distance], 0.381 [quadriceps isokinetic peak torque], and 0.592 [hamstring isokinetic peak torque]). CONCLUSIONS: Single-leg hop distance of the ACL reconstructed side improved when wearing a knee sleeve. Wearing the knee sleeve over 6 weeks did not lead to enhanced improvements in self-reported knee function, hop distance and thigh muscle strength compared to the control group.

Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a significant pathogen to Bombyx mori, yet also an efficient vector for recombinant protein production. A previous study indicated that acetylation plays many vital roles in several cellular processes of Bombyx mori while global phosphorylation pattern upon BmNPV infection remains elusive. METHOD: Employing tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and phosphorylation affinity enrichment followed by high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis and intensive bioinformatics analysis, the quantitative phosphoproteome in Bombyx mori cells infected by BmNPV at 24 hpi with an MOI of 10 was extensively examined. RESULTS: Totally, 6480 phosphorylation sites in 2112 protein groups were identified, among which 4764 sites in 1717 proteins were quantified. Among the quantified proteins, 81 up-regulated and 25 down-regulated sites were identified with significant criteria (the quantitative ratio above 1.3 was considered as up-regulation and below 0.77 was considered as down-regulation) and with significant p-value (p < 0.05). Some proteins of BmNPV were also hyperphosphorylated during infection, such as P6.9, 39 K, LEF-6, Ac58-like protein, Ac82-like protein and BRO-D. CONCLUSION: The phosphorylated proteins were primary involved in several specific functions, out of which, we focused on the binding activity, protein synthesis, viral replication and apoptosis through kinase activity.","Shobahah, Jauharotus; Xue, Shengjie; Hu, Dongbing; Zhao, Cui; Wei, Ming; Quan, Yanping; Yu, Wei",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0783-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28629377/,510

This review is focused on members of the GBF/Gea and BIG/Sec7 subfamilies of Arf GEFs, all of which use the class I Arf proteins (Arf1-3) as substrates, and play a fundamental role in trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)—Golgi and endosomal membrane systems. Members of the GBF/Gea and BIG/Sec7 subfamilies are large proteins on the order of 200 kDa, and they possess multiple homology domains. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that both of these subfamilies of Arf GEFs have members in at least five out of the six eukaryotic supergroups, and hence were likely present very early in eukaryotic evolution. The homology domains of the large Arf1 GEFs play important functional roles, and are involved in interactions with numerous protein partners. The large Arf1 GEFs have been implicated in several human diseases. They are crucial host factors for the replication of several viral pathogens, including poliovirus, coxsackievirus, mouse hepatitis coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus. Mutations in the BIG2 Arf1 GEF have been linked to autosomal recessive periventricular heterotopia, a disorder of neuronal migration that leads to severe malformation of the cerebral cortex. Understanding the roles of the Arf1 GEFs in membrane dynamics is crucial to a full understanding of trafficking in the secretory and endosomal pathways, which in turn will provide essential insights into human diseases that arise from misregulation of these pathways.","Bui, Quynh Trang; Golinelli-Cohen, Marie-Pierre; Jackson, Catherine L.",Mol Genet Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19669794/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00438-009-0473-3,510

CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the huge proportion of CAP of viral origin, the high number of co-infection by multiple viruses and the low number of bacterial CAP, notably in children under 5 years, and address the need to re-evaluate the indications of empiric antimicrobial treatment in this age group.","Cantais, Aymeric; Mory, Olivier; Pillet, Sylvie; Verhoeven, Paul O.; Bonneau, Julie; Patural, Hugues; Pozzetto, Bruno",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915939/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214001838; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214001838,510
605874,"Decline and incomplete recovery in cancer diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium: a year-long, population-level analysis",2021-06-11,"There is a paucity of studies investigating the impact of chronic corticosteroid use for coexisting conditions in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, the information regarding the impact of chronic liver disease (CLD) on COVID-19 outcomes is evolving. Our study aims to investigate hospitalization outcomes of patients with COVID-19 on long term corticosteroids for coexisting conditions while also seeking to compare outcomes between such patients with a history of CLD to analyze the impact on mortality. We conducted a retrospective chart review across our 10-hospital network identifying patients on chronic corticosteroids (Prednisone ≥ 5 mg daily dose or equivalent dose of another steroid, for a duration of 30 days or more) who were hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. Of these patients who met inclusion criteria, patients were then divided into groups based upon their history of CLD. Primary outcomes of the study looked to investigate the hospitalization outcomes of patients with a history of CLD and comorbid conditions requiring chronic corticosteroid use. Secondary outcomes sought to further investigate risk factors for mortality in our study sample. 837 charts were reviewed. 139 patients met inclusion criteria of which 34 patients had a history of CLD. Statistical analysis demonstrated no difference in length of hospital stay but increased ICU admission rate in the CLD group (41.2% vs 23.8%). No statistically significant difference was seen in between the CLD and non-CLD groups in term of complication rates and 28-day mortality. However, chronic corticosteroids patients were found to have higher rates of ICU admission and overall 28-day and ICU mortality in comparison to patients who were not on chronic corticosteroids prior to COVID-19 hospitalization. The larger contributor to COVID-19 severity was likely chronic corticosteroid use rather than CLD and thus chronic corticosteroid use should be limited throughout the COVID-19 pandemic especially in patients with additional speculated risk factors for COVID-19 such as CLD.","Liaquat, Hammad; Shupp, Brittney; Rollins, Samantha; Schneider, Yecheskel; Matin, Ayaz",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584170/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98778-z,510

AIM: This study aims to shed more light on the CSF pattern and clinical characteristics of meningoencephalitis COVID-19 patients in Zanjan, Iran. METHODS: Nine cases of laboratory and imaging confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to Valiasr Hospitals in Zanjan, Iran. Data were collected from 20 May 2020 to 20 June 2020. RESULTS: All the nine patients had positive RT-PCR COVID-19 and Pulmonary involvement who underwent Lumbar puncture and analysis, but despite neurological symptoms, the RT-PCR of CSF for COVID-19 was negative. CONCLUSION: Although we did not have any cases of positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 in lumbar puncture specimens, the justification of neurological symptoms in patients can be the transient presence of the virus in the CSF, and inflammation or autoimmune response caused by the virus, so more studies are needed to determine the cause of neurogenic symptoms.","Moghimi, Minoosh; Moghtader, Amirhossein; Jozpanahi, Manijeh; Khodadadi, Kasra; Jafarzade, Mohammad; Abbaspour, Zahra",Respir Med Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2020.101335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398243/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213007120305499?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213007120305499,510

This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 and societal lockdown measures on the mental health of adults in the UAE. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an English and Arabic online questionnaire between May and June 2020. The psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the social and family support impact was evaluated using questions from the Perceived Support Scale (PSS). A total of 4,426 participants (3,325 females and 1,101 males) completed the questionnaire. The mean IES-R score was 28.0 ± 14.6, reflecting a mild stressful impact with 27.3% reporting severe psychological impact. Over 36% reported increased stress from work, home and financial matters. Also, 43–63% of the participants felt horrified, apprehensive or helpless due to COVID-19. Females, younger participants, part-timers, and college or University graduates were more likely to have a high IES-R score (p < 0.05). The majority of participants reported receiving increased support from family members, paying more attention to their mental health, and spending more time to rest and relax. The results of this study demonstrate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among the UAE residents and highlight the need to adopt culturally appropriate interventions for the general population and vulnerable groups, such as females and younger adults.","Cheikh Ismail, Leila; Mohamad, Maysm N.; Bataineh, Mo'ath F.; Ajab, Abir; Al-Marzouqi, Amina M.; Jarrar, Amjad H.; Abu Jamous, Dima O.; Ali, Habiba I.; Al Sabbah, Haleama; Hasan, Hayder; Stojanovska, Lily; Hashim, Mona; Shaker Obaid, Reyad R.; Saleh, Sheima T.; Osaili, Tareq M.; Al Dhaheri, Ayesha S.",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796033/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.633230,510

A qualitative study method and content analysis approach was used. In‐depth interviews were conducted with health experts from the Ghana Health Service, World Health Organization (WHO), AstraZeneca, Novartis, and Medtronic Inc. in Ghana. Our analysis of data revealed that new structures, committees, advisory bodies and lines of communication in government evolved during this pandemic and are underlying the current strategy development and decision‐making on COVID‐19 vaccines. The interviews gave insights into six major factors that will aid COVID‐19 vaccine acceleration in Ghana. These factors are: (1) Access to vaccines through delivery, (2) national manufacturing of vaccines, (3) choosing the best vaccine candidates, (4) financial resources, (5) transparency, and (6) vaccine roll‐out and administration. These results could guide policymakers and other relevant stakeholders in prioritizing activities that will aid COVID‐19 vaccine acceleration in Ghana and other lower‐middle‐income countries, tailored to their specific context. As a recommendation, the Ghanaian government should embrace a multisectoral synergy approach to fight the disease.

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells and antibodies were characterized in patients with different COVID-19 related disease severity. Despite severe lymphopenia affecting all major lymphocyte subpopulations, patients with severe disease mounted significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells as compared to convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T-cells dominated over CD8 T-cells and closely correlated with the number of plasmablasts and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA- and IgG-levels. Unlike in convalescents, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells in patients with severe disease showed marked alterations in phenotypical and functional properties, which also extended to CD4 and CD8 T-cells in general. Given the strong induction of specific immunity to control viral replication in patients with severe disease, the functionally altered phenotype may result from the need for contraction of specific and general immunity to counteract excessive immunopathology in the lung.","Schub, David; Klemis, Verena; Schneitler, Sophie; Mihm, Janine; Lepper, Philipp M; Wilkens, Heinrike; Bals, Robert; Eichler, Hermann; Gaertner, Barbara C; Becker, Soeren L; Sester, Urban; Sester, Martina; Schmidt, Tina",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148718; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.08.20148718v1?rss=1,510

607498,CoVid-19: The Second Wave is not due to Cooling-down in Autumn,2020-11-30,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-born virus that is mainly transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes spp. Since its first isolation in 1947, only a few human cases had been described until large outbreaks occurred on Yap Island (2007), French Polynesia (2013), and Brazil (2015). Most ZIKV-infected individuals are asymptomatic or present with a self-limiting disease and nonspecific symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and headache. However, in French Polynesia and Brazil, ZIKV outbreaks led to the diagnosis of congenital malformations and microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in adults. These new clinical presentations raised concern from public health authorities and highlighted the need for anti-Zika treatments and vaccines to control the neurological damage caused by the virus. Despite many efforts in the search for an effective treatment, neither vaccines nor antiviral drugs have become available to control ZIKV infection and/or replication. Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds that are well-known for possessing several biological properties, have shown activity against different viruses. Additionally, the use of flavonoids in some countries as food supplements indicates that these molecules are nontoxic to humans. Thus, here, we summarize knowledge on the use of flavonoids as a source of anti-ZIKV molecules and discuss the gaps and challenges in this area before these compounds can be considered for further preclinical and clinical trials.","Cataneo, Allan Henrique Depieri; Ávila, Eloah Pereira; Mendes, Larissa Albuquerque de Oliveira; de Oliveira, Viviane Guedes; Ferraz, Camila Rodrigues; de Almeida, Mauro Vieira; Frabasile, Sandra; Duarte dos Santos, Claudia Nunes; Verri, Waldiceu Aparecido; Bordignon, Juliano; Wowk, Pryscilla Fanini",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.710359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566915/,510

Thus, anti-inflammatory therapies are attractive agents for potentially combating the uncontrolled inflammatory cascade in these patients. We designed a trial testing tocilizumab versus standard of care intending to improve the outcomes by inhibiting interleukin-6, an important inflammatory mediator in COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This open-label multicentre randomized controlled trial will compare clinical outcomes of tocilizumab plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Two of the following four criteria are required for protocol enrolment: D-dimer > 1,000ng/mL; C reactive protein > 5mg/dL, ferritin > 300mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase > upper limit of normal. The primary objective will be to compare the clinical status on day 15, as measured by a 7-point ordinal scale applied in COVID-19 trials worldwide. The primary endpoint will be assessed by an ordinal logistic regression assuming proportional odds ratios adjusted for stratification variables (age and sex). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The TOCIBRAS protocol was approved by local and central (national) ethical committees in Brazil following current national and international guidelines/directives. Each participating center had the study protocol approved by their institutional review boards before initiating protocol enrolment. The data derived from this trial will be published regardless of the results.

Symptoms of this rare interstitial pulmonary disease can be either acute or sub-acute and it can rapidly progress to death. Diagnosis should be considered in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) if patients’ symptomatology and radiology correlates with non-responding or progressive pneumonia and when morphology, on biopsies, encompasses criteria of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and organizing pneumonia (OP) balancing in between. Three clinical cases of patients presenting severe lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged intensive care fitted on the variable spectra of AFOP histopathology and had poor outcome: a 23 year-old women had AFOP in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome pulmonary compromise; a 35 year-old man developed a letal intensive care pneumonia with AFOP pattern registered in post-mortem biopsy; and a 79 year-old man died 21 days after intensive care unit treatment of a sub-pleural organizing pneumonia with intra-alveolar fibrin, seen in post-mortem biopsy. The predominance of acute fibrin alveolar deposition pattern is helpful in raising AFOP differential diagnosis while organizing pneumonia pattern establishes a wider range of diagnosis that can go till solitary pulmonary nodule, remaining indefinite to suggest diagnosis. The performance time of biopsy in a larger number of clinical cases may be helpful in establishing the evolutionary morphological pattern, taking in mind the poor outcome of the disease, deserving rapid diagnosis to define treatment.","Santos, Cláudia; Oliveira, Rui Caetano; Serra, Paula; Baptista, João Pedro; Sousa, Eduardo; Casanova, Paula; Pimentel, Jorge; Carvalho, Lina",Pathophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pathophys.2019.04.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928468018303584; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928468018303584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076239/,510

To determine whether COVID-19 prevalence and fatality are modulated by ethnics and economics, meta-regression of data from the countries in the New York metropolitan area were herein conducted. We selected 31 countries in the New York metropolitan area. 1) Prevalence and case-fatality rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 20, 2020 and 2) income and poverty estimates were obtained in each country. We performed random-effects meta-regression using OpenMetaAnalys. The covariates included 1) black (%), 2) Hispanic or Latino (%), 3) poverty rates (%), and 4) median household income ($). Statistically significant (P < .05) covariates in the univariable model were together entered into the multivariable model. A slope (coefficient) of the univariable meta-regression line for COVID-19 prevalence was not significant for household income (P = .639), whereas the coefficient was significantly positive for black (coefficient, 0.021; P = .015), Hispanic/Latino (0.033; P < .001), and poverty (0.039; P = .02), which indicated that COVID-19 prevalence increased significantly as black, Hispanic/Latino, and poverty increased. The multivariable model revealed that the slope was significantly positive for only Hispanic/Latino (P < .001). The coefficient in the univariable model for COVID-19 fatality, however, was not significant for all the covariate. In conclusion, black, Hispanic/Latino, and poverty (not household income), especially Hispanic/Latino independently, may be associated with COVID-19 prevalence. There may be no association of black, Hispanic/Latino, poverty, and household income with COVID-19 fatality.","Takagi, H.; Kuno, T.; Yokoyama, Y.; Ueyama, H.; Matsushiro, T.; Hari, Y.; Ando, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20110791; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20110791v1?rss=1,510

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. DEVELOPMENT: Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. CONCLUSION: Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","Matías-Guiu, J.; Gomez-Pinedo, U.; Montero-Escribano, P.; Gomez-Iglesias, P.; Porta-Etessam, J.; Matias-Guiu, J.A.",Neurologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32299636/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320300657; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485320300657; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.03.001,510

Football-specific strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, understanding how patterns of human mobility and connectivity affect outbreak dynamics, especially before outbreaks establish locally, is critical for informing response efforts. In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. METHODS: In collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. RESULTS: We found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few months. For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. CONCLUSIONS: To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook’s aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions. Our results can be used readily if local transmission occurs in Taiwan after relaxation of border control, providing important insights into future disease surveillance and policies for travel restrictions.","Chang, Meng-Chun; Kahn, Rebecca; Li, Yu-An; Lee, Cheng-Sheng; Buckee, Caroline O.; Chang, Hsiao-Han",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817972/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20053439,510

The aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at the Toulouse university hospital, France. Patients and methods We selected the patients included from March 7, 2020 to April 20, 2020 in the retrolective Covid-clinic-Toul cohort that follows all hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Toulouse Hospital. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We report demographics, clinical, biological and radiological features, as well as unfavorable outcome at Day 14 after admission (admission in an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, death). Results Among263 hospitalized patients, the median age was 65 years and 155 (58.9%) were males. Two hundred and twenty-seven patients (86.3%) had at least one comorbidity. The median time from first symptom to hospital admission was 7.0 days (interquartile range: 4-10). On day 14 after admission, 111 patients (42.2%) had been transferred to intensive care unit (ICU), including 50 (19.0%) on Day 1; 61 (23.1%) needed mechanical ventilation and 19 patients (7.2%) had died. Patients admitted to ICU at Day 1 of admission (n=50) were more frequently men (66.0% vs 57.3%), smokers (25.0% vs 7.1%), with obesity (42.0% vs 24.7%) and had a higher mean level of C-reactive protein (median: 110.9mg/L vs 46.2mg/L).

The provider in charge often has a difficult time weighing indications and contraindications to anticipate if the patient will benefit from this treatment, a decision that often decides life and death for the patient. To assist in this process in coming to a good evidence-based decision, we reviewed the available literature. (2) Methods: We performed a systematic review through a literature search of the MEDLINE database of former and current absolute and relative contraindications to the initiation of ECMO treatment. (3) Results: The following relative and absolute contraindications were identified in the literature: absolute—refusal of the use of extracorporeal techniques by the patient, advanced stage of cancer, fatal intracerebral hemorrhage/cerebral herniation/intractable intracranial hypertension, irreversible destruction of the lung parenchyma without the possibility of transplantation, and contraindications to lung transplantation; relative—advanced age, immunosuppressed patients/pharmacological immunosuppression, injurious ventilator settings > 7 days, right-heart failure, hematologic malignancies, especially bone marrow transplantation and graft-versus-host disease, SAPS II score ≥ 60 points, SOFA score > 12 points, PRESERVE score ≥ 5 points, RESP score ≤ −2 points, PRESET score ≥ 6 points, and “do not attempt resuscitation” order (DN(A)R status).

Residency programme stakeholders would benefit from knowledge on what students and physicians expect from this process. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to describe and contrast the perspectives of student applicants and interviewing physicians related to the residency programme virtual interview process. METHODS: A survey consisting of 24 Likert statements was administered across listservs in summer 2020 to physicians (attendings and residents who interview medical students). Medical students also received an anonymous survey and were recruited via email to participate. RESULTS: A total of 155 individuals (104 fourth-year medical students and 51 physicians) completed a survey. Results showed students would prefer in-person interviews over virtual. Residency applicants had high agreement on the limited ability to fully assess the programme and city due to virtual interviews. Individuals with lower step 1 scores had higher agreement on preferring in-person interviews. Individuals in the lowest and highest scoring groups appear more worried about the representation of themselves as a result of virtual interviews. Furthermore, applicants feel that more weight will be placed on steps 1 and 2 scores and class ranks, and they may not be able to fully demonstrate their personality compared with interviewers. CONCLUSION: The result of COVID-19 has created challenges and subsequent reshuffling of medical education requiring careful preparation and planning. This study provides insight for residency programmes to better understand the applicants’ expectations for the 2020–2021 residency interview and matching process.","Shreffler, Jacob; Platt, Melissa; Thé, Selena; Huecker, Martin",Postgrad Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504613/; https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139182,510

OBJECTIVE: To determine detection rates of PEP/PEP‐T in feces, blood, or both of horses with enteric disease and effect of detecting multiple agents on outcome of horses with colitis. ANIMALS: Thirty‐seven hundred fifty‐three fecal samples submitted to IDEXX Laboratories and 239 fecal and blood samples submitted to Michigan State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MSUVDL). METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of PEP/PEP‐T testing results was performed to determine rates of detection of 1 or more PEP/PEP‐T. Impact of detecting multiple agents on outcome was assessed in 239 horses hospitalized for colitis. RESULTS: One or more PEP/PEP‐T was detected in 1175/3753 (31.3%) and 145/239 (60.7%) of samples submitted to IDEXX Laboratories and MSUVDL, respectively. In a hospitalized cohort, survival to discharge was lower (76%) in horses with 1 agent, compared to horses with either no (88%) or multiple (89%) agents. There was no difference (P = .78) in days of hospitalization between horses with 0 (1–17), 1 (1–33), and > 1 positive (1–20) result. There was no difference in cost of hospitalization (P = .25) between horses with 0 ($2357, $1110‐15 553), 1 ($2742, $788‐11 005), and >1 positive ($2560, $1091‐10 895) result.

610684,Interruption of cancer screening services due to COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from previous disasters,2021-05-17,"BACKGROUND: Chest radiography (CXR) and computerized tomography (CT) are the standard methods for lung imaging in diagnosing COVID‐19 pneumonia in the intensive care unit (ICU), despite their limitations. This study aimed to assess the performance of bedside lung ultrasound examination by a critical care physician for the diagnosis of COVID‐19 pneumonia during acute admission to the ICU. METHOD: This was an observational, prospective, single‐center study conducted in the intensive care unit of Adan General Hospital from April 10, 2020, to May 26, 2020. The study included adults with suspicion of COVID‐19 Infection who were transferred to the ICU. Patients were admitted to the ICU directly from the ED after reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) swabs were sent to the central virology laboratory in Kuwait, and the results were released 16 to 24 hours after the time of admission. A certified intensivist in critical care ultrasound performed the lung ultrasound within 12 hours of the patient's admission to the ICU. The treating physician confirmed the diagnosis of COVID‐19 pneumonia based on a set of clinical features, inflammatory markers, biochemical profile studies, RT‐PCR test results, and CXR. RESULTS: Of 77 patients with suspected COVID‐19 pneumonia, 65 (84.4%) were confirmed. The median age of the patients was 48 (31‐68) years, and 51 (71%) were men. In the group of patients with confirmed COVID‐19 pneumonia, LUS revealed four signs suggestive of COVID‐19 pneumonia in 63 patients (96.9%) (sensitivity 96.9%, CI 85%‐99.5%). Two patients presented with unilateral lobar pneumonia without other ultrasonic signs of COVID‐19 pneumonia but with positive RT‐PCR results. Among patients in the group without COVID‐19 pneumonia who had negative RT‐PCR results, 11 (91.7%) were LUS negative for COVID‐19 pneumonia (specificity 91.7%, 95% CI 58.72%‐99.77%). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID‐19 outbreak, LUS allows the identification of early signs of interstitial pneumonia. LUS patterns that show a combination of the four major signs offer high sensitivity and specificity compared to nasopharyngeal RT‐PCR.","Bitar, Zouheir Ibrahim; Shamsah, Mohammed; Maadarani, Ossama Sajeh; Bamasood, Omar Mohammed; Al‐foudari, Huda",Health Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084945/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.302,510

We aimed to examine the population-level change in cases of alcohol-related liver disease and pancreatitis that required admission during the COVID-19 epidemic by interrupted time series (ITS) analysis using claims data. We defined the period from April 2020, when the Japanese government declared a state of emergency, as the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic. This ITS analysis included 3,026,389 overall admissions and 10,242 admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis from 257 hospitals between July 2018 and June 2020. The rate of admissions per 1000 admissions during the COVID-19 epidemic period (April 2020–June 2020) was 1.2 times (rate ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.12–1.33) compared to the pre-epidemic period. Analyses stratified by sex revealed that the increases in admission rates of alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis for females were higher than for males during the COVID-19 epidemic period. The COVID-19 epidemic in Japan might associates an increase in hospital admissions for alcohol-related liver disease and pancreatitis. Our study could support the concern of alcohol consumption and health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Itoshima, Hisashi; Shin, Jung-ho; Takada, Daisuke; Morishita, Tetsuji; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92612-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253741/,510

611570,Clinical course of Coronavirus Disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) in pregnancy,2020-05-22,"SARS-CoV-2 recognizes, via its spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD), human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate infection. Ecto-domain protein of ACE2 can therefore function as a decoy. Here we show that mutations of S19W, T27W, and N330Y in ACE2 could individually enhance SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD binding. Y330 could be synergistically combined with either W19 or W27, whereas W19 and W27 are mutually unbeneficial. The structures of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD bound to the ACE2 mutants reveal that the enhanced binding is mainly contributed by the van der Waals interactions mediated by the aromatic side-chains from W19, W27, and Y330. While Y330 and W19/W27 are distantly located and devoid of any steric interference, W19 and W27 are shown to orient their side-chains toward each other and to cause steric conflicts, explaining their incompatibility. Finally, using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we demonstrate that these residue substitutions are associated with dramatically improved entry-inhibition efficacy toward both wild-type and antibody-resistant viruses. Taken together, our biochemical and structural data have delineated the basis for the elevated S-RBD binding associated with S19W, T27W, and N330Y mutations in ACE2, paving the way for potential application of these mutants in clinical treatment of COVID-19.","Ye, Fei; Lin, Xi; Chen, Zimin; Yang, Fanli; Lin, Sheng; Yang, Jing; Chen, Hua; Sun, Honglu; Wang, Lingling; Wen, Ao; Zhang, Xindan; Dai, Yushan; Cao, Yu; Yang, Jingyun; Shen, Guobo; Yang, Li; Li, Jiong; Wang, Zhenling; Wang, Wei; Wei, Xiawei; Lu, Guangwen",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00756-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531369/,510
611970,Shielding method for the endoscopic procedures during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-10-05,"The onslaught of COVID-19 pandemic has greatly overwhelmed some of the best healthcare systems in the world. Medical practitioners working in hospitals at the epicenters of COVID-19 pandemic have emphasized on the need to manage mildly ill and convalescent COVID-19 patients at home or community facilities rather than at hospitals during a pandemic. In this article, we highlight that a standardized home- and community-based (HCBC) approach for management of COVID-19 patients will be a key component for preparing hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for a potential surge in COVID-19 cases. So far, based on the trajectory of infection, we think that SSA seems to have a window of opportunity, albeit narrowing, for implementing HCBC. However, there are challenges that will need to be addressed in order to implement and maintain HCBC. Successful implementation and maintenance of HCBC in SSA will require international agencies and key donors to work closely with the national governments; providing them with policy, technical, and financial assistance. Home- and community-based care (HCBC) is also important because it can play a role in advocacy, education, training, and health promotion during COVID-19 pandemic. We further underscore the need for a delicate balance between HCBC and hospital-based care (HBC) approach as well as with COVID-19 mitigation and suppression measures in order to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission and allow optimal continuity of the HBC. We conclude by emphasizing once again that, for countries in SSA to adequately prepare for the worst-case scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of a cure, policy makers of member states need to act collectively and fast.","Onywera, Harris; Mwapagha, Lamech Malagho; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.38.196.25559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995802/,510
612020,The missing pieces in the jigsaw and need for cohesive research amidst COVID 19 global response,2020-04-07,"Recombination and reassortment of viral genomes are major processes contributing to the creation of new, emerging viruses. These processes are especially significant in long-term persistent infections where multiple viral genotypes co-replicate in a single host, generating abundant genotypic variants, some of which may possess novel host-colonizing and pathogenicity traits. In some plants, successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues and introduction of new genotypes of a virus by vector transmission allows for viral populations to increase in complexity for hundreds of years allowing co-replication and subsequent recombination of the multiple viral genotypes. Using a resequencing microarray, we examined a persistent infection by a Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) complex in citrus, a vegetatively propagated, globally important fruit crop, and found that the complex comprised three major and a number of minor genotypes. Subsequent deep sequencing analysis of the viral population confirmed the presence of the three major CTV genotypes and, in addition, revealed that the minor genotypes consisted of an extraordinarily large number of genetic variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes. Further analysis provided evidence that some of the recombinants underwent subsequent divergence, further increasing the genotypic complexity. These data demonstrate that persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes within a host organism is sufficient to drive the large-scale production of viral genetic variants that may evolve into new and emerging viruses.","Weng, Ziming; Barthelson, Roger; Gowda, Siddarame; Hilf, Mark E.; Dawson, William O.; Galbraith, David W.; Xiong, Zhongguo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17878952/,510

During these times of uncertainty and crisis, people have turned to social media platforms as communication tools and primary information sources. Online discourse is conducted under the influence of many different factors, such as background, culture, politics, etc. However, parallel comparative research studies conducted in different countries to identify similarities and differences in online discourse are still scarce. In this study, we combine the crisis lifecycle and opinion leader concepts and use data mining and a set of predefined search terms (coronavirus and COVID-19) to investigate discourse on Twitter (101,271 tweets) and Sina Weibo (92,037 posts). Then, we use a topic modeling technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify the most common issues posted by users and temporal analysis to research the issue’s trend. Social Network Analysis (SNA) allows us to discover the opinion leader on the two different platforms. Finally, we find that online discourse reflects the crisis lifecycle according to the stage of COVID-19 in China and the US. Regarding the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, users of Twitter tend to pay more attention to the economic situation while users of Weibo pay more attention to public health. The issues focused on in online discourse have a strong relationship with the development of the crisis in different countries.

Multiple lifestyle factors, including physical, cognitive, and social activities, are crucial to forestalling a decline in cognitive functions. However, Covid-19 curtailed most activities, and therefore, strategies are needed to support older adults in remaining cognitively healthy. This study describes a newly developed and publicly available multimodal program, called “brain coach”, to support and stimulate cognitive activity in older adults. The autonomy supportive program integrates into daily life recommendations for evidence-based physical, cognitive, social, mindful, and creative activation exercises. METHODS: The study design corresponds to a correlational, analytical, and cross-sectional study with 660 older adults, who participated in the program for at least 3 months and completed an online survey. RESULTS: The survey results demonstrate that the average age of the participants was 71 years and 75 % were female. Participants experienced benefits in memory, well-being, attitudes towards the brain, and lifestyle habits. Importantly, time invested in the intervention and participant’s positive attitude toward brain health and neuroplasticity, show positive relationships with the experienced benefits.

A single-center propensity-score matched cohort study, including all consecutive COVID-19 patients, admitted to the medical center who were either discharged from the medical center or expired between March 1, 2020, and May 5, 2020, was performed. Patients were stratified according to the receipt of tocilizumab for cytokine storm and matched to controls using propensity scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A total of 274 patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified and 132 patients were included in the matched dataset (tocilizumab = 66; no tocilizumab = 66). Approximately 73% of the patients were male. Hypertension (55%), diabetes mellitus (31%), and chronic pulmonary disease (15%) were the most common comorbidities present. There were 18 deaths (27.3%) in the tocilizumab group and 18 deaths (27.3%) in the no tocilizumab group (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.465 – 2.151; p = 1.00). Advanced age, history of myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and malignancy were significantly more common in patients who died.

Of 29/30 children with MRSA who received vancomycin within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, mortality was 12.5% (N = 2/16) if treatment also included a second anti-MRSA antibiotic compared to 69.2% (N = 9/13) with vancomycin monotherapy (RR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.4, 21.3; P = .003). Vancomycin dosing did not influence initial trough levels; 78% were <10 µg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza–MRSA coinfection is associated with high fatality in critically ill children. These data support early addition of a second anti-MRSA antibiotic to vancomycin in suspected severe cases.","Randolph, Adrienne G; Xu, Ruifei; Novak, Tanya; Newhams, Margaret M; Bubeck Wardenburg, Juliane; Weiss, Scott L; Sanders, Ronald C; Thomas, Neal J; Hall, Mark W; Tarquinio, Keiko M; Cvijanovich, Natalie; Gedeit, Rainer G; Truemper, Edward J; Markovitz, Barry; Hartman, Mary E; Ackerman, Kate G; Giuliano, John S; Shein, Steven L; Moffitt, Kristin L",Clinical Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy495; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/68/3/365/27512595/ciy495.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29893805/,510

In childhood, this clinical entity is very common and carries a significant socioeconomic burden. The impact on the physical, social, and psychological well-being of family cannot be underestimated. Rhinitis is an umbrella term which includes different phenotypes of rhinitis with distinct underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. In most cases the diagnosis of rhinitis is rather straightforward; however, sometimes when based on clinical symptomatology, characterization may be challenging. Herein, we provide guidance for getting all the data needed for the differential diagnosis of rhinitis based on medical history and clinical examination.","Doulaptsi, Maria; Aoi, Noriaki; Kawauchi, Hideyuki; Milioni, Athanasia; Karatzanis, Alexander; Prokopakis, Emmanuel",Med Sci (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/medsci7030038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813653/,510

Pooling is most advantageous in populations with low infection probability, but remains better than non-pooled testing up to an infection probability of 30%. The present predictions imply that optimal pooling may be used to extremely efficiently test populations with infection percentages down to 0.1%, in which case a single round of optimal pooling with an average of as few as 6 tests may be sufficient to uniquely identify every infected individual in a population of 100 (and increases to 20 tests when at 1% infection). Additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooled testing, thus reducing the average number of tests required to test a population with 1% infection from 20 to 14 out of 100 (and from 6 to 4 with 0.1% infections). These best case predictions, obtained assuming perfect test accuracy and specificity, provide a quantitative measure of the optimal pool size and expected testing efficiency gains in populations with infection probabilities ranging from 0.1% to 30%, and are supported by recent COVID-19 detection sensitivity and optimized pool size experiments.","Ben-Amotz, D.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.05.20145805v1?rss=1,510

The biogenesis and three-dimensional organization of these membranes and the link between replication and virus assembly sites is not fully clear. Using electron microscopy, we find Dengue virus (DENV)-induced vesicles, convoluted membranes, and virus particles to be endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived, and we detect double-stranded RNA, a presumed marker of RNA replication, inside virus-induced vesicles. Electron tomography (ET) shows DENV-induced membrane structures to be part of one ER-derived network. Furthermore, ET reveals vesicle pores that could enable release of newly synthesized viral RNA and reveals budding of DENV particles on ER membranes directly apposed to vesicle pores. Thus, DENV modifies ER membrane structure to promote replication and efficient encapsidation of the genome into progeny virus. This architecture of DENV replication and assembly sites could explain the coordination of distinct steps of the flavivirus replication cycle.","Welsch, Sonja; Miller, Sven; Romero-Brey, Ines; Merz, Andreas; Bleck, Christopher K.E.; Walther, Paul; Fuller, Stephen D.; Antony, Claude; Krijnse-Locker, Jacomine; Bartenschlager, Ralf",Cell Host Microbe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19380115/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312809000985; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2009.03.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312809000985,510

Design: This single centre retrospective observational study used routinely collected electronic health data to compare patient presentation characteristics between 21st March and 26th April 2020 compared to the equivalent time period in 2019. Results: There was a 90% decrease in attendances to PED, with a 10.23% reduction re-attendance rate. Children presenting were younger during the pandemic, with a median age difference of 2 years. They were more likely to present in an ambulance (9.63%), be admitted to hospital (5.75%) and be assigned the highest two Manchester triage categories (6.26%). There was a non-significant trend towards longer lengths of stay. The top 10 presenting complaints remained constant (although the order changed) between time periods. There was no difference in mortality or admission to PICU. Implications: Our data demonstrates that there has been a significant decrease in numbers of children seeking emergency department care. It suggests that presenting patients were proportionally sicker during the pandemic; however, we would argue that this is more in keeping with appropriate acuity for PED presentations, as there were no differences in PICU admission rate or mortality. We explore some of the possible reasons behind the decrease in presentations and the implications for service planning ahead of the winter months.","Rose, K.; Van-Zyl, K.; Cotton, R.; Wallace, S.; Cleugh, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.05.20168666v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168666,510

It is challenging to discriminate COVID‐19‐related cutaneous manifestations from other closely resembling skin lesions. The aim of this study was to generate and evaluate a novel CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) ensemble architecture for detection of COVID‐19‐associated skin lesions from clinical images. An ensemble model of three different CNN‐based algorithms was trained with clinical images of skin lesions from confirmed COVID‐19 positive patients, healthy controls as well as 18 other common skin conditions, which included close mimics of COVID‐19 skin lesions such as urticaria, varicella, pityriasis rosea, herpes zoster, bullous pemphigoid and psoriasis. The multi‐class model demonstrated an overall top‐1 accuracy of 86.7% for all 20 diseases. The sensitivity and specificity of COVID‐19‐rash detection were found to be 84.2 ± 5.1% and 99.5 ± 0.2%, respectively. The positive predictive value, NPV and area under curve values for COVID‐19‐rash were 88.0 ± 5.6%, 99.4 ± 0.2% and 0.97 ± 0.25, respectively. The binary classifier had a mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 76.81 ± 6.25%, 99.77 ± 0.14% and 98.91 ± 0.17%, respectively for COVID‐19 rash. The model was robust in detection of all skin lesions on both white and skin of color, although only a few images of COVID‐19‐associated skin lesions from skin of color were available. To our best knowledge, this is the first machine learning‐based study for automated detection of COVID‐19 based on skin images and may provide a useful decision support tool for physicians to optimize contact‐free COVID‐19 triage, differential diagnosis of skin lesions and patient care.","Mathur, Jyoti; Chouhan, Vikas; Pangti, Rashi; Kumar, Sharad; Gupta, Somesh",Dermatol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604961/; https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.14902,510

This study aimed at describing self-reported changes in emotional reactions associated with COVID-19 among medical students in Jordan and to assessing the potential effect of social media utilization on emotional distress among this group. Methods: A cross-sectional design was utilized to collect data early on during the outbreak in Jordan. All medical students in Jordan were eligible to complete an online questionnaire assessing self-reported emotional reactions to COVID-19 that covered four main domains: negative emotion (anxiety, worry, depression, panic, loneliness, and nervousness), positive emotion (happiness, joy, and excitement), sleep disorders (insomnia, shallow sleep, nightmares, and insufficient sleep), and aggression (verbal argument and physical fighting). The frequency of social media utilization as a main source of COVID-19 information was also assessed. Results: 59.9% of participants were females, 64.9% were enrolled at the two major medical schools in Jordan, and 59.6% were in the pre-clinical stage (years). A significant proportion of participants self-reported increased negative emotional levels of anxiety (49.2%), worry (72.4%), depression (23.1%), panic (22.6%), and nervousness (38.2%) and decreased positive emotional levels of happiness (44.8%), joy (47.3%), and feelings of excitement (45.1%). Self-reported sleep disorders were not as common (less than 15% for any of the four items), while arguing with others was at 26.7%. Significant differences by gender and academic year were detected. Almost half of participants reported using social media as a main source of COVID-19 information “most/all-the-times” with a significant effect of such on reducing emotional distress. Conclusion: The results suggest a potential effect of COVID-19 on the emotional distress of medical students. Addressing and mitigating such effects is crucial. The buffering effect of social media should be further investigated.","Kheirallah, Khalid; Bloukh, Sarah; Khasawneh, Wasim; Alsulaiman, Jomana; Khassawneh, Adi; Al-Mistarehi, Abdel-Hameed; Alqudah, Mohammad; Elsalem, Lina; Al Bashir, Samir; Awad, Hasan H.; Al-Shatanawi, Tariq; Saleh, Tareq",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026047/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.52051.1,510

We describe the case of an orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in a young female who presented with acute liver failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity to manage abdominal pain and in the setting of a positive SARS‐CoV2 test. Despite a positive test, she had no respiratory symptoms at time of presentation. The positive test was thought to be residual viral load. The patient had a very favorable outcome, likely related to multiple factors including her young age, lack of respiratory COVID‐19 manifestations and plasma exchange peri‐operatively.

618463,Medical Intelligence Team Lessons Learned: Early Activation and Knowledge Product Development Mitigate COVID-19 Threats,2021,"H9N2 subtype low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) is distributed worldwide and causes enormous economic losses in the poultry industry. Despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines, the disease still remains widespread. We speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of H9N2 viruses. In this study, we constructed a novel Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the M1 and HA2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic H9N2 virus strain. The M1-HA2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide, and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from L. lactis by Western blotting. We assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant L. lactis strain. Eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups, and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant L. lactis strain. Fecal and intestinal samples, sera, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post-vaccination (dpv). Chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies, T cell-mediated immune responses, and mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA). Following challenge with H9N2 virus at 21 dpv, chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed decreased weight loss, lower viral titers in the lung, and reduced lung pathological damage. In summary, our results demonstrated that a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity. This oral vaccine is H9N2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies. Our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control H9N2 virus infection.","Sha, Zhou; Shang, Hongqi; Miao, Yongqiang; Huang, Jin; Niu, Xiangyun; Chen, Ruichang; Hu, Liping; Huang, He; Wei, Kai; Zhu, Ruiliang",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32266297/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00153,510

The aim of this study is to analyse the efficiency in the management of hospital beds before the COVID-19 outbreak at regional level in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This analysis can indicate a reference point for future analysis on resource management in emergency periods and help hospital managers, emergency planners as well as policy makers to put in place a rapid and effective response to an emergency situation. The results of this study clearly underline that France and Germany could rely on the robust structural components of the hospital system, compared to Italy and Spain. Presumably, this might have had an impact on the efficacy in the management of the COVID-19 diffusion. In particular, the high availability of beds in the majority of the France regions paired with the low occupancy rate and high turnover interval led these regions to have a high number of available beds. Consider also that this country generally manages complex cases. A similar structural component is present in the German regions where the number of available beds is significantly higher than in the other countries. The impact of the COVID-19 was completely different in Italy and Spain that had to deal with a relevant large number of patients relying on a reduced number of both hospital beds and professionals. A further critical factor compared to France and Germany concerns the dissimilar distribution of cases across regions. Even if in these countries the hospital beds were efficiently managed, the concentration of hospitalized patients and the scarcity of beds have put pressure on the hospital systems.","Pecoraro, Fabrizio; Luzi, Daniela; Clemente, Fabrizio",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750956/,510

METHODS: A total of 675 T2DM patients and 572 non-T2DM patients were divided into “low” and “high” CysC groups and low and high CysC-rangeability groups according to serum CysC level and range of change of CysC level, respectively. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, and laboratory results of the four groups were analyzed. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with a high level and rangeability of CysC had more organ damage and a higher risk of death compared with those with a low level or low rangeability of CysC. Patients with a higher level and rangeability of CysC had more blood lymphocytes and higher levels of C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. After adjustment for possible confounders, multivariate analysis revealed that CysC >0.93 mg/dL was significantly associated with the risk of heart failure (OR = 2.231, 95% CI: 1.125–5.312) and all-cause death (2.694, 1.161–6.252). CysC rangeability >0 was significantly associated with all-cause death (OR = 4.217, 95% CI: 1.953–9.106). These associations were stronger in patients suffering from T2DM than in those not suffering from T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: The level and rangeability of CysC may influence the prognosis of COVID-19.

In total, 33 studies, including 3073 cases and 6502 controls, were selected for meta-analysis. We found that immunosuppressant therapy significantly decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients on overall analysis (odds ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval = 0.57-0.89, p = 0.004). We also found that tocilizumab and anakinra significantly decreased mortality in patients without any increased risk of secondary infection. In addition, we found similar results in several subgroups. However, we found that tocilizumab therapy significantly increased the risk of fungal co-infections in COVID-19 patients. This represents the only systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and secondary infection risk of immunosuppressant treatment in COVID-19 patients. Overall, immunosuppressants significantly decreased mortality but had no effect on increased risk of secondary infections.

INTRODUCTION Previous case reports have described immunocompromised patients shedding COVID-19 virus RNA for 105 days and 153 days, and to our knowledge, the longest reported duration of COVID-19 virus shedding in an immunocompetent COVID-19 patient was 61 days (1-3). In this report, we describe an immunocompetent COVID-19 case in Beijing with 169 days of viral shedding.","Li, Li; Li, Siqi; Pan, Yang; Qin, Ling; Yang, Siyuan; Tan, Dawei; Hu, Yaling; Knoll, Maria Deloria; Wang, Xiaoli; Wang, Linghang; Wang, Quanyi",China CDC Wkly,https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594968/,510
621155,Potential role of hypovitaminosis D and vitamin D supplementation during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-07-31,"As of 8 January 2021, there were 86,749,940 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 1,890,342 COVID-19-related deaths worldwide, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In order to address the COVID-19 pandemic by limiting transmission, an intense global effort is underway to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The development of a safe and effective vaccine usually requires several years of pre-clinical and clinical stages of evaluation and requires strict regulatory approvals before it can be manufactured in bulk and distributed. Since the global impact of COVID-19 is unprecedented in the modern era, the development and testing of a new vaccine are being expedited. Given the high-level of attrition during vaccine development, simultaneous testing of multiple candidates increases the probability of finding one that is effective. Over 200 vaccines are currently in development, with over 60 candidate vaccines being tested in clinical trials. These make use of various platforms and are at different stages of development. This review discusses the different phases of vaccine development and the various platforms in use for candidate COVID-19 vaccines, including their progress to date. The potential challenges once a vaccine becomes available are also addressed.","Mellet, Juanita; Pepper, Michael S.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9010039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440895/,510

Here, we enhanced the functional and nutritional value of biscuits, a popular sweet snack, by replacing the wheat flour with 2%, 6%, or 10% (w/w) cricket powder. Consumer acceptance ratings for reference and 2% augmented cookies were comparable, whereas the higher levels of enhancement received inferior consumer scores. This relatively small change in biscuit recipe provided significant and nutritionally desirable enhancements in the biscuits, observed in a series of analyses. An increase in the protein content was observed, including essential amino acids, as well as minerals and fat. This conversion also affected the physical properties of the biscuits, including hardness, and water molecular dynamics measured by (1)H NMR. Cricket powder-augmented biscuits join the line of enhanced, functionally superior food products. This and similar food augmentation provide a viable scenario to meet the human food demands in the future.","Smarzyński, Krzysztof; Sarbak, Paulina; Kowalczewski, Przemysław Łukasz; Różańska, Maria Barbara; Rybicka, Iga; Polanowska, Katarzyna; Fedko, Monika; Kmiecik, Dominik; Masewicz, Łukasz; Nowicki, Marcin; Lewandowicz, Jacek; Jeżowski, Paweł; Kačániová, Miroslava; Ślachciński, Mariusz; Piechota, Tomasz; Baranowska, Hanna Maria",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34500847/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26175417,510

Both NADPH oxidase-dependent and -independent pathways are involved in NET formation. The IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin in human serum. However, the impact of the circulating IgG on NET formation is totally unexplored. In this study, the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced mature granulocytes (dHL-60) were pre-treated with monomeric human IgG, papain-digested Fab fragment, crystallizable IgG Fc portion, rituximab (a human IgG1), or IgG2. The NET formation of the dHL-60 in the presence/absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation was then measured by the fluorescent area after SYTOX green nucleic acid stain. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by flow cytometry. Total and phosphorylated Syk, SHP-1, and ERK were detected by immunoblot. We found that human monomeric IgG and its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2 per se induced negligible NET formation of dHL-60, but the FcγRIII engagement by these IgG subclasses and Fc portion augment PMA-stimulated dHL-60 NET formation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that increased Syk and ERK phosphorylation, intracellular ROS generation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and TNF-α, production could be induced after FcγRIII engagement. Blocking FcγRIII engagement by a specific antibody diminished the augmented NET formation. In conclusion, we discovered that cross-talk between FcγRIII engagement-induced Syk-ERK and PMA-induced PKC signaling pathways augment NET formation of dHL-60 via increased ROS generation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and TNF-α, production.","Lu, Cheng-Hsun; Li, Ko-Jen; Wu, Cheng-Han; Shen, Chieh-Yu; Kuo, Yu-Min; Hsieh, Song-Chou; Yu, Chia-Li",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9091127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572313/,510

The rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide is bound to escalate the demand for recombinant insulin therapeutics, and currently, the majority of recombinant insulin therapeutics are produced from E. coli inclusion bodies. Here, a comprehensive review of downstream processing of recombinant human insulin/analogue production from E. coli inclusion bodies is presented. All the critical aspects of downstream processing, starting from proinsulin recovery from inclusion bodies, inclusion body washing, inclusion body solubilization and oxidative sulfitolysis, cyanogen bromide cleavage, buffer exchange, purification by chromatography, pH precipitation and zinc crystallization methods, proinsulin refolding, enzymatic cleavage, and formulation, are explained in this review. Pertinent examples are summarized and the practical aspects of integrating every procedure into a multimodal purification scheme are critically discussed. In the face of increasing global demand for insulin product, there is a pressing need to develop a more efficient and economical production process. The information presented would be insightful to all the manufacturers and stakeholders for the production of human insulins, insulin analogues or biosimilars, as they strive to make further progresses in therapeutic recombinant insulin development and production.","Siew, Yin Yin; Zhang, Wei",Bioresour Bioprocess,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40643-021-00419-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336550/,510

This increasing trend has noted over the past several years in Thailand. This is an interpretive phenomenological study that seeks to explore Thai older grandparents’ life experience of raising grandchildren in skipped-generation families. Methods: The participants were purposively selected from older grandparents in skipped-generation families in the Northeast of Thailand in 2019. Data were collected by in-depth interviews with 29 participants. Data were analysed using Diekelmann & Allen method. Results: Three major themes emerged regarding the Thai older persons as a breadwinner of a skipped-generation family were as follows. 1) Sacrifice for the family is a value of life. 2) Day by day coping journey of individuals maintains mental well-being. 3) Being grandparents leads to spiritual pride. Conclusion: The older grandparents suffered from a variety of burden and vulnerability beyond their abilities. Social and governmental supporting systems are limited.

623503,Principles of ethics and critical communication during the COVID-19 pandemic(),2020-06-25,"[Image: see text] Containing the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge due to high horizontal transmissivity and asymptomatic carriage rates. Lateral flow device (LFD) immunoassays were introduced in late 2020 to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals rapidly. While LFD technologies have been used for over 60 years, their widespread use as a public health tool during a pandemic is unprecedented. By the end of 2020, data from studies into the efficacy of the LFDs emerged and showed these point-of-care devices to have very high specificity (ability to identify true negatives) but inadequate sensitivity with high false-negative rates. The low sensitivity (<50%) shown in several studies is a critical public health concern, as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers may wrongly be assumed to be noninfectious, posing a significant risk of further spread in the community. Here, we show that the direct visual readout of SARS-CoV-2 LFDs is an inadequate approach to discriminate a potentially infective viral concentration in a biosample. We quantified significant immobilized antigen–antibody-labeled conjugate complexes within the LFDs visually scored as negative using high-sensitivity synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging. Correlating quantitative X-ray fluorescence measurements and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) determined numbers of viral copies, we identified that negatively scored samples could contain up to 100 PFU (equivalent here to ∼10 000 RNA copies/test). The study demonstrates where the shortcomings arise in many of the current direct-readout SARS-CoV-2 LFDs, namely, being a deficiency in the readout as opposed to the potential level of detection of the test, which is orders of magnitude higher. The present findings are of importance both to public health monitoring during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to the rapid refinement of these tools for immediate and future applications.","Koller, Garrit; Morrell, Alexander P.; Galão, Rui Pedro; Pickering, Suzanne; MacMahon, Eithne; Johnson, Joanna; Ignatyev, Konstantin; Neil, Stuart J.

Lockdown and social distancing were mandated worldwide, resulting in closure of medical services. The diagnosis of various kidney diseases may have been delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic because non-urgent tests and visits were postponed due to closure of medical services during the lockdown. METHODS: We here report the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a total number of 209 native kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy for diagnosis in a retrospective observational study from a tertiary hospital in Germany. RESULTS: The lockdown period in March and April 2020 primarily affected patients admitted to the normal medical ward with a compensatory increased rate of renal biopsies in the postlockdown phase. In addition, there was a shift toward more patients admitted with hemoglobinuria during the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenon of an increased number of patients with hemoglobinuria during the COVID-19 pandemic was specifically observed in a subgroup with hypertensive nephropathy requiring renal biopsy and associated with increased proteinuria, not attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown period itself. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of identifying a subpopulation susceptible to closure of medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnostic delay of specific kidney diseases. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic should be regarded as a risk factor especially in patients with diseases other than COVID-19 primarily admitted to the normal medical ward.","Hakroush, Samy; Tampe, Désirée; Korsten, Peter; Tampe, Björn",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305628/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.649336,510

Protein over-expression studies have suggested the ability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to block IFN responses. Emerging data also suggest that timing and extent of IFN production is associated with manifestation of COVID-19 severity. In spite of progress in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 activates antiviral responses, mechanistic studies into wildtype SARS-CoV-2-mediated induction and inhibition of human type I IFN responses are lacking. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a mild type I IFN response in vitro and in moderate cases of COVID-19. In vitro stimulation of type I IFN expression and signaling in human airway epithelial cells is associated with activation of canonical transcriptions factors, and SARS-CoV-2 is unable to inhibit exogenous induction of these responses. Our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is not adept in blocking type I IFN responses and provide support for ongoing IFN clinical trials.","Banerjee, Arinjay; El-Sayes, Nader; Budylowski, Patrick; Richard, Daniel; Maan, Hassaan; Aguiar, Jennifer A.; Baid, Kaushal; D’Agostino, Michael R.; Ang, Jann Catherine; Tremblay, Benjamin J.-M.; Afkhami, Sam; Karimzadeh, Mehran; Irving, Aaron T.; Yip, Lily; Ostrowski, Mario; Hirota, Jeremy A.; Kozak, Robert; Capellini, Terence D.; Miller, Matthew S.; Wang, Bo; Mubareka, Samira; McGeer, Allison J.; McArthur, Andrew G.; Doxey, Andrew C.; Mossman, Karen",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.18.158154,510

One change is the transition of transplant selection committee meetings from in-person to remote video conference in order to maintain social distancing requirements. The impact of this transition on committee members and patient care is unknown. Methods A 35-item anonymous survey, adapted from the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire, was developed and distributed electronically to the UCLA heart transplant selection committee. Quantitative and qualitative descriptive analyses were performed. Results Of 83 committee members queried, 46 (55%) responded. 50% were non-physician members and 50% were physician members, including 48% cardiologists, 13% anesthesiologists, and 9% surgeons. Over a 6 week period, there was a 5% increase in the average number of attendees from in-person to video meetings. Respondents were satisfied with the ease of use, interface quality, and interaction quality of the video conference system, except for the ability to see meeting attendees. Overall, respondents were satisfied with video meetings, agreeing that they could contribute effectively and achieve their goals over video. However, if given the choice, 54% still preferred the in-person format. Respondents did not feel that video meetings impacted patient care, such as ability to clarify clinical questions, create management plans, and determine and/or update transplant listing status. Multitasking, technology integration, and location convenience were the predominant positive aspects of video meetings, while communication was the main negative, including inability to see attendees, audio interruptions and barriers to communication flow. Communication and clinical decision-making were the predominant positive aspects of in-person meetings (Figure). Conclusions The transition from in-person to remote video conference heart transplantation selection committee meetings during the COVID-19 era has been well-received and does not appear to affect committee members’ perception of their ability to deliver patient care. Future, longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the impact of video meetings on transplant-related outcomes.","Chandra, Neha V.; Hsu, Jeffrey; Nsair, Ali; Parikh, Rushi V.",Journal of Cardiac Failure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420311593; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1071916420311593,510

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to: 1) adapt the original Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) in order to be appropriate for the evaluation of both mobile phone applications as well as e-tools; 2) test the reliability of the revised scale; and 3) develop a quality assurance protocol for identifying and rating new apps and e-tools to determine appropriateness for use in clinical practice. METHODS: The MARS was adapted to include items specific to health-related apps and e-tools, such as the availability of resources, strategies for self-management, and quality information. The 41 apps and e-tools in the standard youth configuration of the InnoWell Platform, a digital tool designed to support or enhance mental health service delivery, were independently rated by two expert raters using the A-MARS. Cronbach's alpha was used to calculate the internal consistency and interclass correlation coefficients were used to calculate interrater reliability. RESULTS: The A-MARS was shown to be a reliable scale with acceptable to excellent internal consistency and moderate to excellent interrater reliability across the subscales. Given the ever-increasing number of health information technologies on the market, a protocol to identify and rate new apps and e-tools for potential clinical use is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the A-MARS is a useful tool to guide health professionals as they explore available apps and e-tools for potential clinical use, the training, time, and skill required to use it effectively may be prohibitive. As such, health professionals and services are likely to benefit from including a digital navigator as part of the care team to assist in selecting and rating apps and e-tools, increasing the usability of the data, and technology troubleshooting. When selecting, evaluating and/or recommending apps and e-tools to consumers, it is important to consider: 1) the availability of explicit strategies to set, monitor and review SMART goals; 2) the accessibility of credible, user friendly information and resources from reputable sources; 3) evidence of effectiveness; and 4) interoperability with other health information technologies.","Roberts, Anna E.; Davenport, Tracey A.; Wong, Toby; Moon, Hyei-Won; Hickie, Ian B.; LaMonica, Haley M.",Internet Interv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777705/,510

The Psychosis Screener (PS) comprises 7 items covering psychotic symptoms. The presence of each psychotic symptom was determined by a trained mental health professional and coded “yes” or “no.” Two psychiatrists reviewed the medical records independently and extracted the ICD-10-based diagnoses. Any differences between the two clinicians were resolved by consensus, and the agreed diagnosis was used as a gold standard in the study. RESULTS: Among 126 psychiatric outpatients who were enrolled in a consecutive manner during the study period, the proportion of psychosis was 15.1%. The PS showed 78.9% sensitivity and 72.0% specificity when the optimal cut-off was 2, indicating that a score of 2 or more on the screener identified a likely case of psychosis. The area under the curve for the PS was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67–0.87).

The resulting cell secretes not only the immunoglobulins of both parents but also hybrid molecules manifesting the binding characteristics of the individual fusion partners. Purification of the desired bispecific immunoprobe with high specific activity from a mixture of bispecific and monospecific monoclonal antibodies requires special strategies. Using a dual, sequential affinity chromatography (Protein-G chromatography followed by m-aminophenyleboronic acid agarose column), we have purified bispecific monoclonal antibodies (BsMAb) as a preformed HRPO (Horseradish Peroxidase) complex (BsMAb–HRPO). The quadroma culture supernatant was initially processed on a Protein-G column to isolate all the species of immunoglobulins. This pre-enriched fraction was subsequently passed through the aminophenyleboronic acid column super saturated with HRPO. The column matrix has the ability to bind to proteins such as HRPO with vicinal diols. The enzyme loaded column captures the desired bispecific anti-SARS-CoV × anti-HRPO species with the elimination of the monospecific anti-SARS-CoV MAb to result in a high specific activity diagnostic probe. The presence of anti-HRPO MAb is an acceptable impurity as it will not bind to the target SARS-CoV NP antigen and will get washed out during the ELISA procedure.","Bhatnagar, Pravin K.; Das, Dipankar; Suresh, Mavanur R.",Journal of Chromatography B,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570023208000172; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2008.01.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18258500/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570023208000172,510
626836,Consequences of COVID-19 Lockdown on Children and Their Pets: Dangerous Increase of Dog Bites among the Paediatric Population,2021-07-22,"BACKGROUND: The 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea was the largest event outside of the Middle East. Under such circumstances, individuals tend to resort to non-conventional solutions such as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage health. Thus, this study aims to examine characteristics of CAM use among outpatients in a community hospital setting during the 2015 MERS outbreak and to assess potential predictors of CAM use during the epidemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 331 patients (response rate: 82.75%) at a community hospital located in Seoul, South Korea. The survey instrument included 36 questions on the use of CAM, demographic characteristics, health status, and respondents’ perceptions and concerns about MERS infection. Chi-square test and logistic regression were conducted for data analysis using SPSS ver. 21.0., and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. RESULTS: 76.1% of respondents used one or more types of CAM modalities during the MERS outbreak. Consumption of easily accessible modalities such as multivitamin (51.2%) and food products (32.1%) was most popular, and the majority of CAM users relied on mass media (52.4%) and the internet (27.4%) to obtain information on CAM. The use of CAM was associated with age between 40 and 49, age over 50, prior CAM use, and dissatisfaction with the government response to the MERS outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: CAM was commonly used by outpatients during the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea, and mass media was the main source of information. Establishing a media platform is of paramount importance to provide reliable information and ensure the safety of its use.","Hwang, Jung Hye; Cho, Hyun Jeong; Im, Hyea Bin; Jung, Young Sun; Choi, Soo Jeung; Han, Dongwoon",BMC Complement Med Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404092/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-02945-0,510

Currently, two of the most important goals in cancer immunotherapy are to understand the mechanisms resulting in failure to checkpoint blockade and to identify predictive immunological biomarkers that correlate to treatment response, disease progression or adverse effects. The identification and validation of biomarkers for routine clinical use is not only critical to monitor disease or treatment progression, but also to personalize and develop new therapies. To achieve these goals, powerful research tools are needed. Flow cytometry stands as one of the most successful single-cell analytical tools used to characterize immune cell phenotypes to monitor solid tumors, hematological malignancies, minimal residual disease or metastatic progression. This technology has been fundamental in diagnosis, treatment and translational research in cancer clinical trials. Most recently, the need to evaluate simultaneously more features in each cell has pushed the field to implement more powerful adaptations beyond conventional flow cytometry, including Full Spectrum Flow Cytometry (FSFC). FSFC captures the full emission spectrum of fluorescent molecules using arrays of highly sensitive light detectors, and to date has enabled characterization of 40 parameters in a single sample. We will summarize the contributions of this technology to the advancement of research in immunotherapy studies and discuss best practices to obtain reliable, robust and reproducible FSFC results.","Bonilla, Diana L.; Reinin, Gil; Chua, Edmond",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33585561/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.612801,510

A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.","Vella, L.; Giles, J.

The application of isolation measures during the crisis resulted in changes in the acoustic environment. The aim of this work was to characterize the perception of the acoustic environment during the COVID-19 lockdown of people residing in Argentina in 2020. A descriptive cross-sectional correlational study was carried out. A virtual survey was conducted from April 14 to 26, 2020, and was answered mainly by social network users. During this period, Argentina was in a strict lockdown. The sample was finally composed of 1371 people between 18 and 79 years old. It was observed that most of the participants preferred the new acoustic environment. Mainly in the larger cities, before the isolation, mechanical sounds predominated, accompanied by the perception of irritation. Confinement brought a decrease in mechanical sounds and an increase in biological sounds, associated with feelings of tranquility and happiness. The time window opened by the lockdown offered an interesting scenario to assess the effect of anthropogenic noise pollution on the urban environment.

This study aims to predict mortality and explore the crucial factors affecting it. Generally, in the health care systems, having a fast and precise ICU mortality prediction for patients plays a key role in care quality, resulting in reduced costs and improved survival chances of the patients. In this study, we used a medical dataset, including patients’ demographic details, underlying diseases, laboratory disorder, and LOS. Since accurate estimates are required to have optimal results, various data pre-processings as the initial steps are used here. Besides, machine learning models are employed to predict the risk of mortality ICU discharge. For AdaBoost model, these measures are considered AUC= 0.966, sensitivity (recall) = 87.88%, Kappa=0.859, F-measure = 89.23% making it, AdaBoost, accounts for the highest rate. Our model outperforms other comparison models by using various scenarios of data processing. The obtained results demonstrate that the high mortality can be caused by underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure, moderate Pulmonary Embolism Wells Score risk, platelet blood count less than 100000 (mcl), hypertension (HTN), high level of Bilirubin, smoking, and GCS level between 6 and 9.","Khajehali, Naghmeh; Khajehali, Zohreh; Tarokh, Mohammad Jafar",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-021-01540-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654479/,510

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the validity of resilience (10 items Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10)) and grit (Short Grit Scale (GRIT-S)) scores among IM residents at a large academic centre, and assess potential associations with previously validated measures of medical knowledge, clinical performance and professionalism. METHODS: We evaluated CD-RISC 10 and GRIT-S instrument scores among IM residents at the Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota between July 2017 and June 2019. We analysed dimensionality, internal consistency reliability and criterion validity in terms of relationships between resilience and grit, with standardised measures of residents’ medical knowledge (in-training examination (ITE)), clinical performance (faculty and peer evaluations and Mini-Clinical Evaluation Examination (mini-CEX)) and professionalism/dutifulness (conference attendance and evaluation completion). RESULTS: A total of 213 out of 253 (84.2%) survey-eligible IM residents provided both CD-RISC 10 and GRIT-S survey responses. Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha) was excellent for CD-RISC 10 (0.93) and GRIT-S (0.82) overall, and for the GRIT subscales of consistency of interest (0.84) and perseverance of effort (0.71). CD-RISC 10 scores were negatively associated with ITE percentile (β=−3.4, 95% CI −6.2 to −0.5, p=0.02) and mini-CEX (β=−0.2, 95% CI −0.5 to −0.02, p=0.03). GRIT-S scores were positively associated with evaluation completion percentage (β=2.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.67, p=0.02) and conference attendance (β=2.70, 95% CI 0.11 to 5.29, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed favourable validity evidence for CD-RISC 10 and GRIT-S among IM residents. Residents demonstrated resilience within a competitive training environment despite less favourable test performance and grittiness that was manifested by completing tasks. This initial validity study provides a foundation for further research on resilience and grit among physicians in training.","Alahdab, Fares; Halvorsen, Andrew J; Mandrekar, Jayawant N; Vaa, Brianna E; Montori, Victor M; West, Colin P; Murad, M Hassan; Beckman, Thomas J",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323437/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040699,510

DESIGN: Multicentre, repeated measures, parallel group, evaluator masked, stratified randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Twelve cancer centres in Austria, Greece, Norway, Republic of Ireland, and UK. PARTICIPANTS: 829 patients with non-metastatic breast cancer, colorectal cancer, Hodgkin’s disease, or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma receiving first line adjuvant chemotherapy or chemotherapy for the first time in five years. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised to ASyMS (intervention; n=415) or standard care (control; n=414) over six cycles of chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was symptom burden (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale; MSAS). Secondary outcomes were health related quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—General; FACT-G), Supportive Care Needs Survey Short-Form (SCNS-SF34), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory—Revised (STAI-R), Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale for cancer (CASE-Cancer), and work limitations questionnaire (WLQ). RESULTS: For the intervention group, symptom burden remained at pre-chemotherapy treatment levels, whereas controls reported an increase from cycle 1 onwards (least squares absolute mean difference −0.15, 95% confidence interval −0.19 to −0.12; P<0.001; Cohen’s D effect size=0.5). Analysis of MSAS sub-domains indicated significant reductions in favour of ASyMS for global distress index (−0.21, −0.27 to −0.16; P<0.001), psychological symptoms (−0.16, −0.23 to −0.10; P<0.001), and physical symptoms (−0.21, −0.26 to −0.17; P<0.001). FACT-G scores were higher in the intervention group across all cycles (mean difference 4.06, 95% confidence interval 2.65 to 5.46; P<0.001), whereas mean scores for STAI-R trait (−1.15, −1.90 to −0.41; P=0.003) and STAI-R state anxiety (−1.13, −2.06 to −0.20; P=0.02) were lower. CASE-Cancer scores were higher in the intervention group (mean difference 0.81, 0.19 to 1.43; P=0.01), and most SCNS-SF34 domains were lower, including sexuality needs (−1.56, −3.11 to −0.01; P<0.05), patient care and support needs (−1.74, −3.31 to −0.16; P=0.03), and physical and daily living needs (−2.8, −5.0 to −0.6; P=0.01). Other SCNS-SF34 domains and WLQ were not significantly different. Safety of ASyMS was satisfactory. Neutropenic events were higher in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Significant reduction in symptom burden supports the use of ASyMS for remote symptom monitoring in cancer care. A “medium” Cohen’s effect size of 0.5 showed a sizable, positive clinical effect of ASyMS on patients’ symptom experiences. Remote monitoring systems will be vital for future services, particularly with blended models of care delivery arising from the covid-19 pandemic.

Measures such as mandated lockdowns and physical distancing have contributed to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other metrics indicating worsening mental health. Peer support, which is peer-to-peer provided social and emotional support, is an underutilized and effective mental health resource that can potentially be used to ameliorate mental health during these times. Objective: This review aims to summarize the toll that this pandemic has had on society's mental health as found in peer-reviewed literature from October 2019 to March 2021, as well as suggest the utility of peer support to address these needs. Methods: References for this review were chosen through searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for articles published between October 2019 and March 2021 that used the terms: “coronavirus,” “COVID-19,” “mental health,” “anxiety,” “depression,” “isolation,” “mental health resources,” “peer support,” “online mental health resources,” and “healthcare workers.” Articles resulting from these searches and relevant references cited in those articles were reviewed. Articles published in English, French and Italian were included. Results: This pandemic has ubiquitously worsened the mental health of populations across the world. Peer support has been demonstrated to yield generally positive effects on the mental health of a wide variety of recipients, and it can be provided through numerous accessible mediums. Conclusions: Peer support can overall be beneficial for improving mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be an effective tool should similar events arise in the future, although the presence of a few conflicting studies suggests the need for additional research.","Suresh, Rahul; Alam, Armaghan; Karkossa, Zoe",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.714181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322045/,510

The ultimate goal of the MLSCN and the MLI is to expand the availability, flexibility, and use of small-molecule chemical probes for basic research. A number of aspects of the MLSCN make this initiative unique from other academic screening center. First, all researchers have access to the screening centers through the NIH X01 and R03 funding mechanisms. Second, because of the diverse source of assays and the wide expertise available within the MSLCN, specific biological systems investigated and screened will include: (1) “high risk” targets—that is, proteins or biological systems whose function is unknown; (2) targets implicated in orphan diseases or diseases not typically addressed by the private sector; (3) novel or uncommon assay systems; and (4) “non-druggable” targets, such as inhibitors of aggregation and protein–protein interactions. Third, the small molecule screening library contains structures not typically found in commercial collections or those housed in pharmaceutical companies. Fourth, as the goal of the MLSCN is to develop selective chemical probes and small molecule tools that will interrogate novel biochemical pathways, the criteria for an acceptable class of molecules is broader for the MLSCN than for those involved in drug discovery and development. Fifth, is the inclusion of integral medicinal chemistry within each MLSCN Center that allows the network to produce chemical probes with particular properties, rather than simply identifying apparent activities from the screening collection.","Huryn, Donna M.; Cosford, Nicholas D.P.",Annu Rep Med Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065774307420267; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-7743(07)42026-7; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065774307420267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287469/,510

Multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was developed for simultaneous differential quantification of each virus in a single reaction tube, using Cy5- and FAM-labeled TaqMan-probes based on sequences from the TGEV and PEDV nucleocapsid genes. The copy numbers for transcripts of TGEV and PEDV were quantified using this assay over a range from 9 × 10(7) to 9 × 10(1) copies and 7 × 10(7) to 7 × 10(1) copies, respectively. The variability of the intra-assay and inter-assay were evaluated using standard solutions of each transcript, with coefficients of variation (CV) less than 3.43 and 3.33%, respectively. Piglets were experimentally infected with virulent TGEV and PEDV, and the amounts of virus from the onset of diarrhea were measured. Samples obtained from farms experiencing PED or TGE were quantified between 10(2) and 10(5) RNA copies. In conclusion, this assay provides an effective etiological diagnostic tool for detecting and quantifying viral loads. The assay may also prove useful for detecting infections, ultimately leading to better disease control on farms.","Kim, Seong-Hee; Kim, In-Joong; Pyo, Hyun-Mi; Tark, Dong-Seob; Song, Jae-Young; Hyun, Bang-Hun",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093407002467; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093407002467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17697717/,510

CASE PRESENTATION AND TREATMENT: A male centenarian with cough and dyspnea for 2 months was diagnosed with COVID-19. Without effective treatments and with the increased risks of antiviral therapy for the elderly, this patient was given convalescent plasma. The viral load, complete blood count, inflammatory indicators, vital signs, and clinical symptoms were observed before and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion. RESULTS: After convalescent plasma transfusion, significant improvement was observed on laboratory indicators and clinical symptoms of the patient. Concurrently, SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreased sharply after the first transfusion (from 2.55 × 104 to 1.39 × 103 copies/mL) and became undetectable after the second transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: With the substantial increase of COVID-19 in recent months,treatment for elderly patients has become restricted in some countries. The successful treatment of this 100-year-old patient using convalescent plasma suggests that we should consider adding convalescent plasma in th management of the elderly.","Kong, Yujie; Cai, Chen; Ling, Li; Zeng, Li; Wu, Meihong; Wu, Yanyun; Zhang, Wei; Liu, Zhong",Transfus Apher Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050220301154?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050220301154; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2020.102820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32467007/,510

Recent studies have highlighted the additional critical role of TCF1 in peripheral T cell responses to acute and chronic infections as well as cancer. Here, we review the regulatory functions of TCF1 in the differentiation of T follicular helper cells, memory T cells and recently described stem-like exhausted T cells, where TCF1 promotes less differentiated stem-like cell states by controlling common gene-regulatory networks. These studies also provide insights into the mechanisms of defective T cell responses in older individuals. We discuss alterations in TCF1 expression and related regulatory networks with age and their consequences for T cell responses to infections and vaccination. The increasing understanding of the pathways regulating TCF1 expression and function in aged T cells holds the promise of enabling the design of therapeutic interventions aiming at improving T cell responses in older individuals.","Kim, Chulwoo; Jin, Jun; Weyand, Cornelia M.; Goronzy, Jörg J.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21186497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899486/,510
632764,Serological tests for COVID-19,2020,"Members of Coronaviridae family have been the source of respiratory illnesses. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 that produced a severe lung disease in afflicted patients in China and other countries was the reason for the incredible attention paid toward this viral infection. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on TMPRSS2 activity for entrance and subsequent infection of the host cells and TMPRSS2 is a host cell molecule that is important for the spread of viruses such as coronaviruses. Different factors can increase the risk of prostate cancer, including older age, a family history of the disease. Androgen receptor (AR) initiates a transcriptional cascade which plays a serious role in both normal and malignant prostate tissues. TMPRSS2 protein is highly expressed in prostate secretory epithelial cells, and its expression is dependent on androgen signals. One of the molecular signs of prostate cancer is TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. In TMPRSS2-ERG-positive prostate cancers different patterns of changed gene expression can be detected. The possible molecular relation between fusion positive prostate cancer patients and the increased risk of lethal respiratory viral infections especially SARS-CoV-2 can candidate TMPRSS2 as an attractive drug target. The studies show that some molecules such as nicotinamide, PARP1, ETS and IL-1R can be studied deeper in order to control SARS-CoV-2 infection especially in prostate cancer patients. This review attempts to investigate the possible relation between the gene expression pattern that is produced through TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive prostate cancer and the possible influence of these fluctuations on the pathogenesis and development of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.","Afshari, Afsoon; Janfeshan, Sahar; Yaghobi, Ramin; Roozbeh, Jamshid; Azarpira, Negar",Infect Genet Evol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301988/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820305001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820305001?v=s5,510

The present study aims to understand the knowledge of possible symptoms, stress and anxiety triggers and mental health care needs related to COVID-19 pandemic among the general population of India. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted across India. In order to conduct the survey, an online survey tool (semi-structured questionnaire) was prepared using google forms. Apart from having an informed consent, the survey tool comprised 42-item questions addressing the background characters of the participants and the pertinent issues related to the study. Snowball sampling technique was adopted in the study, and the questionnaire was sent to the contacts of the surveyors. All the participants were further requested to forward the tool in their respective contacts. A total 284 respondents were covered under the survey. More than 50% of participants reported having some professional loss in the current pandemic lockdown phase and 74% of the respondents reported having stress about their business or employment in the coming times. Majority (77%) of respondents agreed on the importance of professional mental help but 40% reported not likely to take professional help if they experience extreme stress and anxiety due to COVID-19. The educated people realise the significance of mental health care needs but majority of them decline to take a professional help even after realising the extreme anxiety.

634135,The Missing Pieces of the COVID‐19 Puzzle,2020-06-23,"Cyanovirin-N (CVN) is a promising antiviral candidate that has an extremely low sequence homology with any other known proteins. The efficient and soluble expression of biologically functional recombinant CVN (rCVN) is still an obstacle due to insufficient yield, aggregation, and abnormal modification. Here, we describe an improved approach to preparing native rCVN from Escherichia coli more efficiently. A fusion gene consisting of cvn and sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) and a hexahistidine tag was constructed according to the codon bias of the host cell. This small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-fused CVN is expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli in a folded and soluble form (>30% of the total soluble protein), yielding 3 to 4 mg of native rCVN from 1 g of wet cells to a purity up to 97.6%. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis showed that the purified rCVN was an intact and homogeneous protein with a molecular weight of 11,016.68 Da. Potent antiviral activity of rCVN against herpes simplex virus type 1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1/IIIB was confirmed in a dose-dependent manner at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, the His-SUMO double-fused CVN provides an efficient approach for the soluble expression of rCVN in the cytoplasm of E. coli, allowing an alternative system to develop bioprocess for the large-scale production of this antiviral candidate.","Gao, Xianglei; Chen, Wei; Guo, Chaowan; Qian, Chuiwen; Liu, Ge; Ge, Feng; Huang, Yadong; Kitazato, Kaio; Wang, Yifei; Xiong, Sheng",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19547966/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2078-5,510

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the effect of FETP-F on participant workplace practices regarding quality and consistency of public health data, critical interaction with public health data, and improvements in on-time reporting (OTR). METHODS: Between February and April 2017, FELTP conducted a mixed methods evaluation via online survey to examine outcomes achieved among all 215 graduates from 2014 and 2015. Data quality assessment (DQA) and data consistency assessment (DCA) scores, OTR percentages, and ratings of the training experience were the quantitative measures tracked from baseline and then at 6-month intervals up to 18 months postcompletion of the training. The qualitative component consisted of semistructured face-to-face interviews and observations. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Qualitative data were transcribed and analyzed to identify key themes and dimensions. RESULTS: In total, 103 (47%) graduates responded to the survey. Quantitative analyses showed that the training significantly increased the mean DQA and OTR scores but there was a nonsignificant increase in mean DCA scores. Qualitative analyses found that 68% of respondents acquired new skills, 83% applied those skills to their day-to-day work, and 91% improved work methods.

Here we show a supporting effect in tuning the electrocatalytic kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) from four-electron to two-electron mechanism by docking metalloporphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals on graphene support, leading to highly selective peroxide production with faradaic efficiency as high as 93.4%. A magic angle of 38.1° tilting for the co-facial alignment was uncovered by electron diffraction tomography, which is attributed to the maximization of π-π interaction for mitigating the lattice and symmetry mismatch between MOF and graphene. The facilitated electron migration and oxygen chemisorption could be ascribed to the supportive effect of graphene that disperses of the electron state of the active center, and ultimately regulates rate-determining step.

To address this, we mimicked vaccination’s effects by administering keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH ) to CD1 male mice and used their sperm for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Two-cell embryos after IVF with spermatozoa from control (C) or KLH-treated (Im) male mice were transferred to surrogate mothers mated with vasectomized control (C) or KLH-treated (Im) male mice, resulting in four experimental groups: C–C, Im–C, C–Im, and Im–Im. The pre-implantation losses were significantly lower in the Im–C group than in the C–Im group. At the same time, the resorption rates reduced markedly in the C–Im compared to the Im–C group. Embryo and placenta weights were significantly higher in the Im–Im group. Although the GM-CSF levels were lower in the amniotic fluid of the gestating surrogate mothers in the Im–Im group, they were strongly correlated with embryo mass. The number–size trade-off was only significant in the Im–Im group. This suggests a positive, cooperative effect of spermatozoa and seminal fluid from immune-primed males on embryo growth and the optimal distribution of surrogate mother maternal resources despite the negative impact of males’ antigenic challenge on the IVF success rate.","Kontsevaya, Galina Vladimirovna; Gerlinskaya, Ludmila Alekseevna; Moshkin, Yury Mikhailovich; Anisimova, Margarita Vladimirovna; Stanova, Aliya Konstantinovna; Babochkina, Tatyana Ivanovna; Moshkin, Mikhail Pavlovich",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638989/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910650,510

We performed in vitro assays proving lactoferrin antiviral activity through direct attachment to both virus and cell surface components. This activity varied according to concentration (100/500μg/ml), multiplicity of infection (0.1/0.01) and cell type (Vero E6/Caco-2 cells). Interestingly, the in silico results strongly supported the hypothesis of a direct recognition between the lactoferrin and the Spike S glycoprotein, thus hindering the viral entry into the cells. Hence, we conducted a clinical trial to investigate effect and tolerability of a liposomal lactoferrin formulation as a supplementary nutraceutical agent in mild-to-moderate and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. A total of 92 mild-to-moderate (67/92) and asymptomatic (25/92) COVID-19 patients were recruited and divided in 3 groups according to the administered regimen. Thirty-two patients, 14 hospitalised and 18 in home-based insolation received oral and intranasal liposomal bovine lactoferrin (bLf), 32 hospitalised patients were treated with standard of care treatment (hydroxychloroquine, azitromicin and lopinavir/darunavir), and 28, in home-based isolation, did not take any medication. Furthermore, 32 COVID-19 negative, not-treated, healthy subjects were added as a control group for ancillary analysis. bLf-supplemented COVID-19 patients obtained an earlier and significant (p < 0,0001.) median rRT-PCR SARS-COV-2 RNA negative conversion than standard of care-treated and non-treated COVID-19 patients (14.25 vs 27.13 vs 32.61 days, respectively). In addition, bLf-supplemented COVID-19 patients showed significant fast clinical symptoms recovery than standard of care-treated and non-treated COVID-19 patients. Moreover, in bLf-supplemented patients, a significant decrease of either serum ferritin or IL-6 levels or host iron overload, all parameters characterizing inflammatory processes, were observed. Serum D-dimers was also found significantly decreased following bLf supplement. No adverse events were reported. These in vitro and in vivo observations led us to speculate a potential and safe supplementary role of Blf in the management of mild-to-moderate and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.","Campione, Elena; Lanna, Caterina; Cosio, Terenzio; Rosa, Luigi; Conte, Maria Pia; Iacovelli, Federico; Romeo, Alice; Falconi, Mattia; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Franchin, Elisa; Lia, Maria Stella; Minieri, Marilena; Chiaramonte, Carlo; Ciotti, Marco; Nuccetelli, Marzia; Terrinoni, Alessandro; Magrini, Andrea; Bernardini, Sergio; Andreoni, Massimo; Sarmati, Loredana; Miani, Alessandro; Piscitelli, Prisco; Valenti, Piera; Bianchi, Luca",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.244996,510

639155,Covid-19 and excess mortality rates not comparable across countries,2021-04-06,"Mutations in the Spike motif predicted to correspond to the fusion peptide are considered of interest as this domain is a potential target for anti-viral drug development that plays a pivotal role in inserting SARS-CoV-2 into human cell membranes. We tracked the temporal and geographical spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with the Spike D839Y mutation in the fusion peptide, which was detected early during the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. We show that this variant was most likely imported from Italy in mid-late February 2020, becoming prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal, where represented 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes, respectively, until the end of April 2020. Based on our high sequencing sampling during the early epidemics [15,5% (1275/8251) and 6,0% (1500/24987) of all confirmed cases until the end of March and April, respectively)], we estimate that, between March 14th and April 9th (covering the exponential phase of the epidemic), the relative frequency of Spike Y839 variant increased at a rate of 12.1% (6.1%-18.2%, CI 95%) at every three days, being potentially associated with one in each four (20.8-29.7%, CI 95%) COVID-19 cases in Portugal during the same period. This observation places the Spike Y839 variant in the origin of the largest SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. We hypothesize that population/epidemiological effects (founder effects) and enhanced selective advantage might have concomitantly contributed to the increasing frequency trajectory of the Spike Y839 variant. Screening of the D839Y mutation globally confirmed its detection in 12 additional countries, even though the huge differences in genome sampling between countries hampers any accurate estimate of D839Y global frequency. In summary, our data points out that SARS-CoV-2 Spike Y839 variants, namely the descendent variant of the globally spread G614 variant detected in Portugal, need continuous and close surveillance.","Borges, V.; Isidro, J.; Cortes-Martins, H.; Duarte, S.; Vieira, L.; Leite, R.; Gordo, I.; Caetano, C.

Here we report their opinions of and engagement with the service during the early pandemic. Methods: A total of 44 consecutive pwCF attending virtual clinics completed a 23-part survey composed of free text and rating scale questions to evaluate the impact of the telemedicine service and the pandemic on their CF care. We also compared telemedicine and face-to-face (FTF) appointment attendance rates during the pandemic. Results: Feedback was generally positive (see Table). The main areas of constructive criticism revolved around audio and visual quality, as well as connectivity issues associated with use of mobile devices to access the telemedicine portal. Positive comments of the telemedicine clinic included no travel requirements, and no risk of cross-infection. Between July and October 2020, attendance was higher at FTF appointments than telemedicine (166/186 vs 417/513, Chi-squared p = 0.01). [Table Presented]] Conclusions: The telemedicine service is generally popular with pwCF, and engagement with the service has been good.

Motivation: It is possible that classifiers are using spurious artifacts in dataset images to achieve high performances, and such explainable techniques can help identify this issue. Aim: For this purpose, several approaches were used in tandem, in order to create a complete overview of the classificatios. Methodology: The techniques used included GradCAM, LIME, RISE, Squaregrid, and direct Gradient approaches (Vanilla, Smooth, Integrated). Main results: Among the deep neural networks architectures evaluated for this image classification task, VGG16 was shown to be most affected by biases towards spurious artifacts, while DenseNet was notably more robust against them. Further impacts: Results further show that small differences in validation accuracies can cause drastic changes in explanation heatmaps for DenseNet architectures, indicating that small changes in validation accuracy may have large impacts on the biases learned by the networks. Notably, it is important to notice that the strong performance metrics achieved by all these networks (Accuracy, F1 score, AUC all in the 80 to 90% range) could give users the erroneous impression that there is no bias. However, the analysis of the explanation heatmaps highlights the bias.","Palatnik de Sousa, Iam; Vellasco, Marley M. B.

In this study, we carried out a systematic analysis of clinical characteristics in COVID-19 patients to determine potential risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 virus infection. METHODS: We systematically searched relevant literature published in Pubmed, Embase, Europe PMC, CNKI and other databases. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 16.0. RESULTS: We analysed 5726 confirmed cases from 17 studies. The results indicated that compared with non-cardiac-injured patients, patients with cardiac injury are older, with a greater proportion of male patients, with higher possibilities of existing comorbidities, with higher risks of clinical complications, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU transfer and mortality. Moreover, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and blood creatinine in patients with cardiac injury are also higher while lymphocyte counts and platelet counts decreased. However, we fortuitously found that patients with cardiac injury did not present higher clinical specificity for chest distress (P = 0.304), chest pain (P = 0.334), palpitations (P = 0.793) and smoking (P = 0.234). Similarly, the risk of concomitant arrhythmia (P = 0.103) did not increase observably either. CONCLUSION: Age, male gender and comorbidities are risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection. Such patients are susceptible to complications and usually have abnormal results of laboratory tests, leading to poor outcomes. Contrary to common cardiac diseases, cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection did not significantly induce chest distress, chest pain, palpitations or arrhythmias. Our study indicates that early prevention should be applied to COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury to reduce adverse outcomes.","Zeng, Linwen; Wang, Shihui; Cai, Jianing; Sun, Shaoqing; Wang, Suhuai; Li, Jingjie; Sun, Lin",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820002587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092664/,510

Greenfield's Theory of Social Change, Cultural Evolution, and Human Development predicts that when survival concerns augment, and one's social world narrows toward the family household. life shifts towards activities, values, relationships, and parenting expectations typical of small-scale rural subsistence environments with low life expectancy. Specific predictions were that, during the pandemic, respondents would report intensified survival concerns (e.g., thinking about one's own mortality); increased subsistence activities (e.g., growing food); augmented subsistence values (e.g., conserving resources); more interdependent family relationships (e.g., members helping each other obtain food); and parents expecting children to contribute more to family maintenance (e.g., by cooking for the family). All hypotheses were confirmed with a large-scale survey in California (N = 1,137) administered after about a month of stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic; results replicated in Rhode Island (N = 955). We posited that an experience of increased survival concerns and number of days spent observing stay-at-home orders would predict these shifts.

640773,Experimental Model to Test Electrostatic Precipitation Technology in the COVID-19 Era: A Pilot Study,2020-09-03,"OBJECTIVES: A wide range of duration of viral RNA shedding in patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has been observed. We aimed to investigate factors associated with prolonged and intermittent viral RNA shedding in a retrospective cohort of symptomatic COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and laboratory data from hospitalised COVID‐19 patients from a single centre with two consecutive negative respiratory reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) results were extracted from electronic medical records. Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis was used to assess the effect of clinical characteristics on the duration and pattern of shedding. Plasma levels of immune mediators were measured using Luminex multiplex microbead‐based immunoassay. RESULTS: There were 201 symptomatic patients included. Median age was 49 years (interquartile range 16–61), and 52.2% were male. Median RNA shedding was 14 days (IQR 9–18). Intermittent shedding was observed in 77 (38.3%). We did not identify any factor associated with prolonged or intermittent viral RNA shedding. Duration of shedding was inversely correlated with plasma levels of T‐cell cytokines IL‐1β and IL‐17A at the initial phase of infection, and patients had lower levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines during intermittent shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Less active T‐cell responses at the initial phase of infection were associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding, suggesting that early immune responses are beneficial to control viral load and prevent viral RNA shedding. Intermittent shedding is common and may explain re‐detection of viral RNA in recovered patients.","Lee, Pei Hua; Tay, Woo Chiao; Sutjipto, Stephanie; Fong, Siew‐Wai; Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Wei, Wycliff Enli; Chan, Yi‐Hao; Ling, Li Min; Young, Barnaby E; Toh, Matthias Paul HS; Renia, Laurent; Ng, Lisa FP; Leo, Yee‐Sin; Lye, David C; Lee, Tau Hong",Clin Transl Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742654/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1160,510

A method was developed for qualitative and quantitative detection of the seminal cell-associated PRRSV RNA in relation to endogenous and exogenous reference RNAs. As endogenous control for one-step real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR UBE2D2 mRNA was selected. Particularly for the analysis of persistent infections associated with low copy numbers of PRRSV RNA, UBE2D2 mRNA is an ideal control due to its low expression in seminal cells and its detection in all samples analysed (n = 36). However, the amount of UBE2D2 mRNA in porcine semen varied (up to 106-fold), thus its use is limited to qualitative detection of PRRSV RNA. For quantitation, a synthetic, non-metazoan RNA was added to the RNA isolation reaction at an exact copy number. The photosynthesis gene ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) from Arabidopsis thaliana was used as an exogenous spike. Unexpectedly, PRRSV RNA was detected in a herd of specific pathogen-free (SPF) boars which were tested ELISA-negative for anti-PRRSV antibodies. Therefore, RT-PCR for seminal cell-associated PRRSV is a powerful tool for managing the SPF status during quarantine programs and for routine outbreak investigations.","Revilla-Fernández, Sandra; Wallner, Barbara; Truschner, Klaus; Benczak, Alexandra; Brem, Gottfried; Schmoll, Friedrich; Mueller, Mathias; Steinborn, Ralf",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093405000303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15847915/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093405000303,510
641254,Dynamic coupling between the COVID-19 epidemic timeline and the behavioral response to PAUSE in New York State counties,2021-08-04,"Abstract In December 2019, an atypical pneumonia invaded the city of Wuhan, China, and the causative agent of this disease turned out to be a new coronavirus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 [9]. Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the “entry receptor” for the infection process involving membrane fusion [10]. A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the “time delay” given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the “exposure time” to the “interaction time” (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. Background The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the β-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. Methods A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. Results A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. Conclusions From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.","Sohail, Ayesha; Nutini, Alessandro",Prog Biophys Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079610720300262; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610720300262?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360608/,510
641583,Commentary: COVID-19 lockdown-I and rural eye centers,2021-01-11,"Anti‐tumour necrosis factor (TNF) biologicals, Dexamethasone and rIL‐7 are of considerable interest in treating COVID‐19 patients who are in danger of, or have become, seriously ill. Yet reducing sepsis mortality by lowering circulating levels of TNF lost favour when positive endpoints in earlier simplistic models could not be reproduced in well‐conducted human trials. Newer information with anti‐TNF biologicals has encouraged reintroducing this concept for treating COVID‐19. Viral models have had encouraging outcomes, as have the effects of anti‐TNF biologicals on community‐acquired COVID‐19 during their long‐term use to treat chronic inflammatory states. The positive outcome of a large scale trial of dexamethasone, and its higher potency late in the disease, harmonises well with its capacity to enhance levels of IL‐7Rα, the receptor for IL‐7, a cytokine that enhances lymphocyte development and is increased during the cytokine storm. Lymphoid germinal centres required for antibody‐based immunity can be harmed by TNF, and restored by reducing TNF. Thus the IL‐7‐ enhancing activity of dexamethasone may explain its higher potency when lymphocytes are depleted later in the infection, while employing anti‐TNF, for several reasons, is much more logical earlier in the infection. This implies dexamethasone could prove to be synergistic with rIL‐7, currently being trialed as a COVID‐19 therapeutic. The principles behind these COVID‐19 therapies are consistent with the observed chronic hypoxia through reduced mitochondrial function, and also the increased severity of this disease in ApoE4‐positive individuals. Many of the debilitating persistent aspects of this disease are predictably susceptible to treatment with perispinal etanercept, since they have cerebral origins.","Clark, Ian A.",Rev Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33580566/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2210,510

642373,"Development of septic shock and prognostic assessment in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease outside Wuhan, China.",2021,"Abstract Nuclear energy was adopted in Italy in the past to deal with the insufficient fossil fuels on the national territory. After a public vote subsequent to the Chernobyl accident, Italy abandoned the use of nuclear energy and nowadays adopts a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources for electricity production. However, the urging environmental pollution and climate change issues are forcing Italy to realize a so-called “energy transition” towards a more sustainable energy production and consumption system. In this framework, following the examples of other countries, it could be re-evaluated the adoption of nuclear to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. In the present paper, it is presented an overview of the nuclear energy history in Italy and the current and projected electricity demand and supply. Then, with reference to the Italian framework and policies, the main advantages and disadvantages of a hypothetical reintroduction of nuclear energy are presented. The analysis shows that the adoption of nuclear energy would bring several advantages in terms of lower emissions, higher security of supply and enabling of possible other technologies; the main disadvantages are related to the opposing public opinion and the nuclear waste management.","Bersano, Andrea; Segantin, Stefano; Falcone, Nicolò; Panella, Bruno; Testoni, Raffaella",The Electricity Journal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619020301056; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1040619020301056,510

Therefore, many of decisions they make require the integration of information about other social agents. This study asks to what extent information about social status and the social context in which decisions are taken impact on reward-guided decisions in rhesus macaques. We tested 12 monkeys of varying dominance status in several experimental versions of a two-choice task in which reward could be delivered to self only, only another monkey, both the self and another monkey, or neither. Results showed dominant animals were more prone to make prosocial choices than subordinates, but only when the decision was between a reward for self only and a reward for both self and other. If the choice was between a reward for self only and a reward for other only, no animal expressed altruistic behaviour. Finally, prosocial choices were true social decisions as they were strikingly reduced when the social partner was replaced by a non-social object. These results showed that as in humans, rhesus macaques' social decisions are adaptive and modulated by social status and the cost associated with being prosocial.

Data collection included symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection, hospital admission, mortality, intra-operative and post-operative surgical complications. RESULTS: A total of 649 elective cataract surgeries were performed. Two patients (0.3%) developed worsening dyspnoea during the 30 day post-operative period, but tested negative for COVID-19 infection. Three patients (0.5%) were hospitalised, unrelated to COVID-19 infection, of which one patient (0.2%) passed. Four patients (0.6%) suffered posterior capsular rupture. 601 (93.2%) had no post-operative complications.

The cases of this disease have increased and as of June 1(st), 2020 there are more than 216 countries affected. Pharmacological treatments have been proposed based on the resemblance of the HIV virus. With regard to prevention there is no vaccine, thus, we proposed to explore the spike protein due to its presence on the viral surface, and it also contains the putative viral entry receptor as well as the fusion peptide (important in the genome release). In this work we have employed In Silico techniques such as immunoinformatics tools which permit the identification of potential immunogenic regions on the viral surface (spike glycoprotein). From these analyses, we identified four epitopes E332-370, E627-651, E440-464 and E694-715 that accomplish essential features such as promiscuity, conservation grade, exposure and universality, and they also form stable complexes with MHCII molecule. We suggest that these epitopes could generate a specific immune response, and thus, they could be used for future applications such as the design of new epitope vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this study is to analyze how the treatment of acute appendicitis has been affected. METHOD: A national descriptive study was carried out by an online voluntary specific questionnaire with Google Drive™ distributed by email by the Spanish Association of Surgeons (AEC) to all affiliated surgeons currently working in Spain (5203), opened from April 14th to April 24th. RESULTS: We received 337 responses from 170 centers. During the first month of the pandemic, the incidence of acute appendicitis decreased. Although conservative management increased, the surgical option has been the most used in both simple and complicated appendicitis. Despite the fact that the laparoscopic approach continues to be the most widely used in our services, the open approach has increased during this pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Highlight the contribution of this study in terms of knowledge of the status of the treatment of acute appendicitis during this first month of the pandemic, being able to serve for a better possible organization in future waves of the pandemic and a reorganization of current protocols and management of acute appendicitis in a pandemic situation.","Prieto, Mikel; Ielpo, Benedetto; Jiménez Fuertes, Montiel; González Sánchez, María del Carmen; Martín Antona, Esteban; Balibrea, José M.; Aranda Narváez, José Manuel",Cir Esp (Engl Ed),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2173507721001502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092540/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cireng.2021.05.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173507721001502?v=s5,510

METHODS: Patients with real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–confirmed COVID-19 between January 01 and February 18, 2020, were included in this study. Laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected from medical records. Severity of lung changes on chest CT of early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages was scored according to the percentage of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1–5 for each lobe, range 0–20). Relationship between CT scores and laboratory parameters was evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation. The Bonferroni correction adjusted significance level was at 0.05/4 = 0.0125. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (mean age, 47.8 ± 12.0 years [standard deviation]; age range, 24–80 years) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 339 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3–5 days). Median chest CT scores peaked at 4 days after the beginning of treatment and then declined. CT score of the early stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.531, P = 0.011). CT score of the progressive stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.502, P < 0.001), white blood cell count (r = 0.414, P = 0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.511, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (r = 0.423, P = 0.004), and lactose dehydrogenase (r = 0.369, P = 0.010). However, CT scores of the peak and absorption stages were not correlated with any parameter (P > 0.0125). No sex difference occurred regarding CT score (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Severity of lung abnormalities quantified on chest CT might correlate with laboratory parameters in the early and progressive stages. However, larger cohort studies are necessary.","Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Jue; Chen, Hui; Chen, Luyan; Chen, Qiuying; Li, Minmin; Chen, Zhuozhi; You, Jingjing; Yang, Ke; Zhang, Shuixing",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399620/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-04854-3,510

Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that the closure of service activities is very effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality - this was about 15% lower in municipalities with a 10 percentage points higher employment share in shut down services. Shutting down factories, instead, is much less effective, plausibly because factory workers engage in more limited physical interactions relative to those in the consumer-facing service sector. Concerning the management of the health care system, we find that mortality strongly increases with distance from the intensive care unit (ICU). Municipalities at 10 km from the closest ICU experienced up to 50% higher mortality. This effect - which is largest within the epicenter and in days of abnormally high volumes of calls to the emergency line - underscores the importance of improving pre-hospital emergency services and building ambulance capacity to ensure timely transportation of critical patients to the ICU.","Ciminelli, G.; Garcia-Mandico, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.19.20106575v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.20106575,510

644645,Initiation of a survey of healthcare worker distress and moral injury at the onset of the COVID‐19 surge,2020-07-16,"INTRODUCTION: The interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial factor in the viral infections leading to the release of inflammatory proteins, such as TNF-α. Thus, it is hypothesized that TNF-α blockers can prevent either COVID-19 incidence or its serious symptoms. TNF-α blockers are prescribed to treat various autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA). Therefore, the objective of this work was to examine this hypothesis that TNF-α blockers can prevent COVID-19 incidence in patients with RA or SpA. METHODS: A case–control study was conducted through interviews based on a structured questionnaire to investigate the frequency of COVID-19 incidence in 254 eligible patients with RA or SpA about whom 45% were under treatment with one type of TNF-α blockers including infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept at least for 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were carried out twice, at the beginning and the end of the study (June–December 2020). Patients with COVID-19 during the study or before that were considered as cases. The control group was patients without COVID-19 experience. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression was used to determine the relationships between COVID-19 incidence and independent variables. RESULTS: A small percentage of patients treated with TNF-α blockers (5.22%, 6/115) experienced COVID-19, while a large percentage of patients with COVID-19 did not receive TNF-α blockers (27.34%, 38/139). According to odds ratio, adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept decreased significantly the risk of developing COVID-19 up to 96.8, 95, and 80.3% (p < 0.05), respectively. Therefore, TNF-α blockers could probably decrease the chances of the COVID-19 incidence in patients with RA or SpA. CONCLUSIONS: A direct and positive correlation between the use of TNF-α blockers and a reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 could suggest the prophylactic role of these drugs in preventing COVID-19 in patients with RA and SpA.","Salesi, Mansour; Shojaie, Behrokh; Farajzadegan, Ziba; Salesi, Naghmeh; Mohammadi, Erfan",Rheumatol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34297311/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40744-021-00342-8,510

NDIS funding to support education during the first COVID‐19 lockdown period forms an important case study of the flexibility of individualized funding schemes. Our results suggest that participant experiences varied widely, with some people able to make the changes they required and others left with a significant service gap. This shows that individual funding schemes are not necessarily more flexible than traditional systems in an emergency situation—useful flexibility depends on many factors, such as clarity of information giving, all actors having a shared message, proactive support of flexibility initiatives, and participants' ability to quickly navigate a complicated system.

Many guidelines on chronic liver diseases have been released to optimize the use of medical resources and patient management. However, most of these guidelines have been established through expert consensus because the existing data do not provide strong evidence for developing effective recommendations. As Wilson disease (WD) is a rare chronic liver disease, the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical status of patients with WD is unclear. The present study showed a marked shortage of medical resources for clinically managing patients with WD during the pandemic. Although patients with WD who consistently took anticopper therapy showed no significant differences in hepatic and extrahepatic markers before and after the pandemic, their complication incidences, especially the infection incidence, were significantly increased during the study period. Therefore, patients with WD should be encouraged to adhere to anticopper therapy and be closely monitored to prevent infections and other complications. The present study provides a clinical basis for further managing WD during the pandemic.","Zhuang, Yu-Pei; Zhong, Hao-Jie",World J Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i26.4248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326624/,510

However, in some facilities, diagnostic breast imaging services continued for patients with a high clinical suspicion of breast cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the diagnostic interval (DI) of non-screening patients presenting for diagnostic mammography during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting for non-screening diagnostic mammography from April 1 to June 30, 2020 (pandemic group) and April 1 to June 30, 2019 (pre-pandemic group). Age, reason for referral, number and type of imaging studies/biopsies necessary for a final diagnosis were recorded. Diagnostic interval (DI) was defined as the number of days from the date of the diagnostic mammogram to the date of the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-pandemic group (n = 64), the pandemic group (n = 77) showed a reduction in DI of the entire cohort (pandemic: 1 day; pre-pandemic: 15 days, p < 0.0001) for patients not requiring tissue sampling (pandemic: 1 day; pre-pandemic: 11 days, .p < 0.0001) and those requiring tissue sampling with benign pathology (pandemic 9 days; pre-pandemic, 33 days, p = 0.0002). A higher percentage of patients in the pandemic group had their assessment completed during the initial visit (pandemic: 50.6%; pre-pandemic: 23.4%, p = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DI for patients with non-screening-related diagnostic mammography was significantly shorter, with a higher percentage of patients completing their assessments on the initial visit, compared to one year prior. KEY POINTS: • Despite reductions in manpower and clinical services, during pandemic times, it is possible to maintain a diagnostic breast imaging service for women at high clinical suspicion for breast cancer. • During pandemic times, breast imaging departments should consider restructuring to a Rapid Diagnostic Unit model with a navigation team that follows patients through the assessment process to a final diagnosis. • Departmental restructuring and patient navigation during pandemic times could either maintain or shorten the diagnostic interval for patients presenting for diagnostic mammography.","Crivellaro, Priscila; Tafur, Monica; George, Ralph; Muradali, Derek",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-08117-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143286/,510

While a number of different cardiovascular histopathologies have been described at post-mortem examination, the incidence of typical viral myocarditis in COVID-19 positive patients appears very low [1], [2], [3]. In this study, we further characterize and quantify the inflammatory cell infiltrate in a COVID-19 study cohort and compare the findings to both an age and disease matched control cohort and a cohort of patients diagnosed with typical inflammatory myocarditis. All study and control cohorts had one or more of the comorbidities most commonly associated with severe disease (hypertension, type II diabetes, obesity, or known cardiovascular disease). The results demonstrate a skewed distribution of the number of CD68+ cells in COVID-19 hearts, with upper quantiles showing a significant increase as compared to both matched control hearts, and those with myocarditis. In contrast, hearts from typical inflammatory myocarditis contained increased numbers of CD4+, and CD8+ cells compared to both COVID-19 and control cohorts. In conclusion, the presence of an increased number of CD68+ cells suggests that COVID-19 may incite a form of myocarditis different from typical viral myocarditis, and associated with diffusely infiltrative cells of monocytes/macrophage lineage.","Fox, Sharon E.; Falgout, Lacey; Vander Heide, Richard S.",Cardiovasc Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174415/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054880721000454?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054880721000454; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carpath.2021.107361,510

In spite of the success of neural networks methods in improving learning structural reliability, they result in inadequate accuracy of the bio-medical sentiment classification when employing less useful features sets. Therefore, they lack discriminatory potential. In this study, we propose to add a deep associative memory into neural networks for an effective sentiment decomposition, which emphasizes correctly on bio-medical entities related to the extraction of different data-object properties, and contextual-semantics dependencies for a given aspect. The underlying trust of these measures is behind the ability to compute the completion of unseen medical patterns, where comprehensive bio-medical distributed representations are used for representing the formal medical connections from PubMed databases. Experiments on a biomedical sentiment analysis task show that the model provides comprehensive embeddings with meaningful medical patterns. It achieved an average performance of 87% on varied large online datasets. It also outperforms baselines in discovering and identifying medical natural concepts.

Quantifying the risk of congenital malformations associated with early pregnancy exposure to HCQ is important both in the context of its ongoing use for rheumatological disorders as well as its potential future use for COVID-19 prophylaxis, for which a number of clinical trials are ongoing despite initial trials for COVID-19 treatment having been negative. Objective The study objective was to evaluate the risk of major congenital malformations associated with exposure to HCQ during the first trimester, the period of organogenesis. Study Design We performed a population-based cohort study nested in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX, 2000-2014) and IBM MarketScan Research Database (MarketScan, 2003-2015). The source cohort included 2,045 HCQ exposed and 3,198,589 unexposed pregnancies continuously enrolled in their respective insurance program from 3 months before the last menstrual period through at least one month after delivery; infants were enrolled for at least 3 months after birth. We compared the risk of congenital malformations in women with HCQ use during the first trimester versus no use, restricting the cohort to women with rheumatic disorders and using propensity score matching to control for indication, demographics, medical comorbidities, and concomitant medications (N= 1,867 HCQ exposed; 19,080 unexposed pregnancies). The outcomes considered included major congenital malformations diagnosed during the first 90 days after delivery, and specific malformation types for which there were at least 5 exposed events: oral clefts, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genital, urinary, musculoskeletal, and limb defects. Results Overall, 54.8 per 1,000 infants exposed to HCQ were born with a major congenital malformation versus 35.3 per 1,000 unexposed infants, corresponding to an unadjusted relative risk of 1.51 (95% CI, 1.27–1.81). Patient characteristics were balanced in the restricted, propensity score matched cohort. The adjusted relative risk was 1.26 (1.04–1.54); it was 1.33 (1.08-1.65) for a daily dose ≥400mg and 0.95 (0.60-1.50) for <400mg. Among the different malformation groups considered, more substantial increases in the risk for oral clefts, respiratory anomalies and urinary defects were observed, although estimates were imprecise. No pattern of malformations was identified. Conclusions Our findings suggest a small increase in the risk of malformations associated with first trimester HCQ use. For most patients with autoimmune rheumatic disorders, the benefits of treatment during pregnancy will likely outweigh this risk. If HCQ were shown to be effective for COVID-19 prophylaxis in ongoing trials, the risk of malformations would need to be balanced against such benefits.","HUYBRECHTS, Krista F.; BATEMAN, Brian T.; ZHU, Yanmin; STRAUB, Loreen; MOGUN, Helen; KIM, Seoyoung C.; DESAI, Rishi J.; HERNANDEZ-DIAZ, Sonia",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.09.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820310644?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820310644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32961123/,510

The uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine among children will be instrumental in limiting the spread of the disease as herd immunity may require vaccine coverage of up to 80% of the population. Prior history of pandemic vaccine coverage was as low as 40% among children in the United States during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Purpose To investigate predictors associated with global caregivers’ intent to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, when the vaccine becomes available. Method An international cross sectional survey of 1541 caregivers arriving with their children to 16 pediatric Emergency Departments (ED) across six countries from March 26 to May 31, 2020. Results 65% (n = 1005) of caregivers reported that they intend to vaccinate their child against COVID-19, once a vaccine is available. A univariate and subsequent multivariate analysis found that increased intended uptake was associated with children that were older, children with no chronic illness, when fathers completed the survey, children up-to-date on their vaccination schedule, recent history of vaccination against influenza, and caregivers concerned their child had COVID-19 at the time of survey completion in the ED. The most common reason reported by caregivers intending to vaccinate was to protect their child (62%), and the most common reason reported by caregivers refusing vaccination was the vaccine’s novelty (52%). Conclusions The majority of caregivers intend to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, though uptake will likely be associated with specific factors such as child and caregiver demographics and vaccination history. Public health strategies need to address barriers to uptake by providing evidence about an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine’s safety and efficacy, highlighting the risks and consequences of infection in children, and educating caregivers on the role of vaccination.","Goldman, Ran D.; Yan, Tyler D.; Seiler, Michelle; Parra Cotanda, Cristina; Brown, Julie C.; Klein, Eileen J.; Hoeffe, Julia; Gelernter, Renana; Hall, Jeanine E.; Davis, Adrienne L.; Griffiths, Mark A.; Mater, Ahmed; Manzano, Sergio; Gualco, Gianluca; Shimizu, Naoki; Hurt, Thomas L.; Ahmed, Sara; Hansen, Matt; Sheridan, David; Ali, Samina; Thompson, Graham C.; Gaucher, Nathalie; Staubli, Georg",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.09.084; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20313177; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20313177?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071002/,510

649696,Impact of COVID-19 on autoimmune blistering diseases,2021-02-02,"INTRODUCTION: : During the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and consequent government measures to prevent the overwhelming of public hospitals, emergency department (ED) orthopaedic turnout was significantly altered. This study compared the turnout of patients with upper extremity (UE) and hand & wrist (H&W) emergencies during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the same period of 2019, in the public and private sector. MATERIAL-METHODS: : Data from a two-month period [March 23, 2020 (application of severe restrictions of civilian circulation) to May 18, 2020 (two weeks after lockdown cessation)] were collected from a public-university hospital and a private hospital and were compared with data from the same “normal” period in 2019. RESULTS: : During the pandemic, the number of patients with orthopaedic, UE, and H&W problems was significantly reduced by 57.09%, 49.77%, 49.92% respectively (p<0.001) compared to 2019. However, the ratios of UE/total orthopaedic emergencies and of H&W/total orthopaedic emergencies increased significantly during the pandemic from 37.17% to 43.32% and from 25.07% to 29.15% (p=0.006 and p<0.001) respectively, compared to 2019. In the private sector, the turnout was increased for patients with UE problems (8.82%, p=0.67) and H&W problems (24.39%, p=0.3), while in the public sector the turnout was significantly decreased for UE (49.77%, p<0.001) and H&W problems (49.92%, p<0.001) in 2020 compared to 2019. DISCUSSION: : The extent of lockdown was unprecedented in recent years. The reduction of orthopaedic, UE and H&W emergencies during lockdown can be attributed to the fear of contracting the virus in the hospitals and even more in hospitals serving as COVID-19 reference centers. Despite the decrease -in absolute numbers- of patients, the increased percentages of UE to total orthopaedic and of H&W to total orthopaedic emergencies in 2020 in both hospitals, reflect the new hobbies’ uptake and the increase of domestic accidents during the lockdown, despite overall activity decrease, and underline the necessity of presence of hand surgeons in the EDs. This is one of the very few population-based studies worldwide to show trends in incidence of different injuries of the UE at a regional level during the pandemic, and its results could affect future health care policies.","Fyllos, Apostolos; Varitimidis, Sokratis; Papageorgiou, Fotios; Karamanis, Nikolaos; Alexiou, Konstantinos; Veloni, Aikaterini; Malizos, Konstantinos; Dailiana, Zoe",Injury,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33246643/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020138320309700; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2020.11.045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020138320309700?v=s5,510

OATH study",2021-09-30,"While the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of people to stay home and minimize their social contacts, newspaper reports worldwide raised concerns as they reported an increasing rate of intimate partner violence (IPV). One link of the measures enforced to control the pandemic to IPV might be a possible side effect of those measures, namely social and geographical isolation. As there was no scientific data investigating the association of IPV and social and geographical isolation in the context of epidemics or pandemics at the time of conducting this rapid review, we aimed at investigating a broader range of contexts of social as well as geographical isolation and its association with IPV to draw conclusions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (core collection). A research strategy was developed and observational studies were included if they considered men and/or women, estimates of social and geographical isolation, and IPV as a primary outcome. Of the 526 identified studies, 11 were included in this review. The included studies involved 15,695 women and were conducted in the USA, Sweden, Ethiopia, Egypt, Spain, and Turkey. Indicators of social isolation such as lack of social, emotional, or informational support or the frequency and quality of social contacts were narratively assessed. Geographical isolation was primarily assessed by physical distance to the next town or support service. Both social and geographic isolation were found to be associated with an increased risk of IPV. Recommendations made by the individual studies include the following: (a) improving access to social networks outside the victims' own group, (b) improving their economic circumstances, (c) asserting the responsibility for those in contact with the victims, and (d) increasing the focus on access to preventive services and programs need to be taken into account. Therefore, considering the particular infrastructure and legislation of the countries affected by the pandemic, policies need to ensure constant access to shelters and other help services and increase awareness for IPV in the society. In addition, future studies are warranted to assess prevalence rates and risk factors of IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mojahed, Amera; Brym, Stephanie; Hense, Helene; Grafe, Bianca; Helfferich, Cornelia; Lindert, Jutta; Garthus-Niegel, Susan",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.578150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33927649/,510

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, causes substantial economic loss in the swine industry worldwide. Previous studies reported miRNA involvement in viral infection; however, their role in regulating PEDV infection remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulatory relationship between miRNA-221-5p and PEDV infection, finding that miR-221-5p overexpression inhibited PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner, and that silencing endogenous miR-221-5p enhanced viral replication. Our results showed that miR-221-5p directly targets the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of PEDV genomic RNA to inhibit PEDV replication, and that miR-221-5p overexpression activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling via p65 nuclear translocation, thereby upregulating interferon (IFN)-β, IFN-stimulated gene 15, and MX1 expression during CH/HBTS/2017 infection. We subsequently identified NF-κB-inhibitor α and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, negative regulators of the NF-κB pathway, as miR-221-5p targets. These results demonstrated the ability of miR-221-5p to inhibit PEDV replication by targeting the 3’ UTR of the viral genome and activating the NF-κB-signaling pathway. Our findings will aid the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for PEDV infection.","Zheng, Hongqing; Xu, Lei; Liu, Yuzhong; Li, Cheng; Zhang, Liang; Wang, Tao; Zhao, Di; Xu, Xingang; Zhang, Yanming",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380612/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19113381,510
650564,Challenges facing nurse managers during and beyond COVID‐19 pandemic in relation to perceived organizational support,2021-04-19,"Patients with serious mental illness are a high-risk category of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Patients with schizophrenia are not participatory and have increased mortality and morbidity, patients with dementia cannot be cared for while depression, anxiety, bipolar tubing are associated with low immune status. Social stress is amplified by social isolation, amplifying depression and the mechanisms of decreased immunity. Hygiene measures and prophylactic behavior are impossible to put into practice in conditions of chronic mental illness. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the risk for severe development is associated with the presence of comorbidities and immune system deficiency. Prothrombotic status, cytokine storm and alveolar destruction are mechanisms that aggravate the evolution of patients, especially in the context in which they have dysfunction of the autonomic system. The activity of proinflammatory cytokines is accentuated by hyperglutamatergia, which potentiates oxidative stress and triggers the mechanisms of neural apoptosis by stimulating microglial activation. Activation of M1-type microglia has an important role in pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and may associate hippocampal atrophy and disconnection of cognitive structures. Memantine and Amantadine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor inhibitors, have demonstrated, through their pharmacological profile, psychotropic effects but also antiviral properties. In the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on these arguments, we suggest that they can be associated with the therapy with the basic psychotropics, Memantine or Amantadine, for the control of neuropsychiatric symptoms but also as adjuvants with antiviral action.","Marinescu, Ileana; Marinescu, Dragoş; Mogoantă, Laurenţiu; Efrem, Ion Cristian; Stovicek, Puiu Olivian",Rom J Morphol Embryol,https://doi.org/10.47162/rjme.61.4.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171050/,510

The public health restrictions in response to COVID-19 have interrupted habitual physical activity behaviours in older adults. In response, numerous exercise programmes have been developed for older adults, many involving chair-based exercise. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise the effects of chair-based exercise on the health of older adults. Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PyscInfo and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from inception to 1 April 2020. Chair-based exercise programmes in adults ≥50 years, lasting for at least 2 weeks and measuring the impact on physical function were included. Risk of bias of included studies were assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool v2. Intervention content was described using TiDieR Criteria. Where sufficient studies (≥3 studies) reported data on an outcome, a random effects meta-analysis was performed. In total, 25 studies were included, with 19 studies in the meta-analyses. Seventeen studies had a low risk of bias and five had a high risk of bias. In this systematic review including 1388 participants, results demonstrated that chair-based exercise programmes improve upper extremity (handgrip strength: MD = 2.10; 95% CI = 0.76, 3.43 and 30 s arm curl test: MD = 2.82; 95% CI = 1.34, 4.31) and lower extremity function (30 s chair stand: MD 2.25; 95% CI = 0.64, 3.86). The findings suggest that chair-based exercises are effective and should be promoted as simple and easily implemented activities to maintain and develop strength for older adults.","Klempel, Natalie; Blackburn, Nicole E.; McMullan, Ilona L.; Wilson, Jason J.; Smith, Lee; Cunningham, Conor; O’Sullivan, Roger; Caserotti, Paolo; Tully, Mark A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669357/,510

Owing to this broad range of influence, type I IFNs also exhibit critical functions in many sterile inflammatory diseases and immunopathologies, especially those associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-driven signaling pathways. Indeed, over the years accumulating evidence has indicated that the presence of ER stress can influence the production, or sensing of, type I IFNs induced by perturbations like pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, infections (bacterial, viral or parasitic) or autoimmunity. In this article we discuss the link between type I IFNs and ER stress in various diseased contexts. We describe how ER stress regulates type I IFNs production or sensing, or how type I IFNs may induce ER stress, in various circumstances like microbial infections, autoimmunity, diabetes, cancer and other ER stress-related contexts.","Sprooten, Jenny; Garg, Abhishek D.",Int Rev Cell Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32138904/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.10.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644819301017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644819301017,510

Comparison of locations with over 50 deaths shows all outbreaks have a common feature: H(t) defined as loge(X(t)/X(t 1)) decreases linearly on a log scale, where X(t) is the total number of Cases or Deaths on day, t (we use ln for loge). The downward slopes vary by about a factor of three with time constants (1/slope) of between 1 and 3 weeks; this suggests it may be possible to predict when an outbreak will end. Is it possible to go beyond this and perform early prediction of the outcome in terms of the eventual plateau number of total confirmed cases or deaths? We test this hypothesis by showing that the trajectory of cases or deaths in any outbreak can be converted into a straight line. Specifically , is a straight line for the correct plateau value N, which is determined by a new method, Best-Line Fitting (BLF). BLF involves a straight-line facilitation extrapolation needed for prediction; it is blindingly fast and amenable to optimization. We find that in some locations that entire trajectory can be predicted early, whereas others take longer to follow this simple functional form. Fortunately, BLF distinguishes predictions that are likely to be correct in that they show a stable plateau of total cases or death (N value). We apply BLF to locations that seem close to a stable predicted N value and then forecast the outcome at some locations that are still growing wildly. Our accompanying web-site will be updated frequently and provide all graphs and data described here.","Levitt, Michael; Scaiewicz, Andrea; Zonta, Francesco",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32607515/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.26.20140814v1?rss=1,510

METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to hospital or managed in the community and their household contacts across a London population during March 1 - April 1, 2020. Symptomatology and duration were extracted from routinely collected clinical data and follow-up telephone consultations. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Of 386 patients, 141 (92 community patients, 49 discharged inpatients) were included for analysis. 77/141 (55%) reported anosmia and ageusia; nine reported only ageusia and three only anosmia. The median onset of anosmia in relation to onset of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms (as defined by the Public Health England case definition) was 4 days (Interquartile range 5). Median duration of anosmia was 8 days (IQR 16). Median duration of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in community patients was 10 days (IQR 8) versus 18 days (IQR 13.5) in admitted patients. As of April 1, 45 patients had ongoing SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and/or anosmia. 107/141 (76%) patients had household contacts. Of 185 non-tested household contacts, 79 (43%) had SARS-CoV-2 symptoms with 46/79 (58%) reporting anosmia. Six household contacts had anosmia only. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of positive patients reported anosmia and ageusia suggesting these should be added to the case definition and guide self-isolation protocols. This adaptation may be integral to case finding in the absence of population-level testing. Until we have successful population-level vaccination coverage, these steps remain critical in the current and future waves of this pandemic.","Patel, A.; Charani, E.; Ariyanayagam, D.; Abdulaal, A.; Denny, S.J.; Mughal, N.; Moore, L.S.P.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20303037?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32502645/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.05.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20303037,510

Clinical outcomes, stratified as outpatient treatment, inpatient without mechanical ventilation, inpatient with mechanical ventilation, or death, will be correlated with CT and biological markers. The main objective is to assess the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities–including pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac morphology, and vascular congestion. Secondary objectives include the predictive value of cardiovascular abnormalities in terms of disease severity and fatal outcome and the association of lung inflammation with vascular abnormalities at the segmental level. New quantitative approaches derived from CT imaging are developed and evaluated in this study. Patients with and without vascular abnormalities will be compared, which is supposed to provide insights into the prognostic role and potential impact of such signs on treatment strategy.

652836,EARLY REPORT ON THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN NEUROSURGICAL PRACTICE AMONG MEMBERS OF THE LATIN AMERICAN FEDERATION OF NEUROSURGICAL SOCIETIES,2020-05-07,"BACKGROUND: Following the West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak (2013–2016), WHO developed a preparedness checklist for its member states. This checklist is currently being applied for the first time on a large and systematic scale to prepare for the cross border importation of the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo hence the need to document the lessons learnt from this experience. This is more pertinent considering the complex humanitarian context and weak health system under which some of the countries such as the Republic of South Sudan are implementing their EVD preparedness interventions. MAIN TEXT: We identified four main lessons from the ongoing EVD preparedness efforts in the Republic South Sudan. First, EVD preparedness is possible in complex humanitarian settings such as the Republic of South Sudan by using a longer-term health system strengthening approach. Second, the Republic of South Sudan is at risk of both domestic and cross border transmission of EVD and several other infectious disease outbreaks hence the need for an integrated and sustainable approach to outbreak preparedness in the country. Third, a phased and well-prioritized approach is required for EVD preparedness in complex humanitarian settings given the costs associated with preparedness and the difficulties in the accurate prediction of outbreaks in such settings. Fourth, EVD preparedness in complex humanitarian settings is a massive undertaking that requires effective and decentralized coordination. CONCLUSION: Despite a very challenging context, the Republic of South Sudan made significant progress in its EVD preparedness drive demonstrating that it is possible to rapidly scale up preparedness efforts in complex humanitarian contexts if appropriate and context-specific approaches are used. Further research, systematic reviews and evaluation of the ongoing preparedness efforts are required to ensure comprehensive documentation and application of the lessons learnt for future EVD outbreak preparedness and response efforts.","Olu, Olushayo Oluseun; Lako, Richard; Wamala, Joseph Francis; Ramadan, Patrick Otim; Ryan, Caroline; Udenweze, Ifeanyi; Berta, Kibebu; Guyo, Argata Guracha; Sokemawu, Alex; Tukuru, Michael; Gray, Henry John; Chimbaru, Alex",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312320/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00657-8,510

Although liver transplant patients represent only a minority of the population, the hepatologists who follow these patients have tried to coordinate efforts to produce a protocol the management of immunosuppression during SARS Cov-2 infection. Although there are no solid studies to support general recommendations, experiences with other viral infections (hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus) suggest that management of immunosuppression without mycophenolate mofetil or m-Tor inhibitors (drugs that are also associated with leukopenia and lymphopenia) may be beneficial. It is also important to pay attention to possible drug interactions, especially in the case of tacrolimus, with some of the treatments with antiviral effect given in the context of COVID 19 (lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin). Finally, the immunosuppressive effect of immunomodulating drugs (tocilizumab and similar) administered to patients with severe lung disease should be taken into account.

The purpose of this study was to investigate day-to-day variations in SR while performing self-selected exercise sessions to evaluate error in SR estimations in similar temperature conditions. Thirteen endurance-trained athletes completed training sessions in a case-series design 1x/week for a minimum 30 min of running/biking over 24 weeks. Body mass was recorded pre/post-training and corrected for fluid consumption. Data were split into three Wet-Bulb Globe Thermometer (WBGT) conditions: LOW (<10 °C), MOD (10–19.9 °C), HIGH (>20 °C). No significant differences existed in exercise duration, distance, pace, or WBGT for any group (p > 0.07). Significant differences in SR variability occurred for all groups, with average differences of: LOW = 0.15 L/h; MOD = 0.14 L/h; HIGH = 0.16 L/h (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in mean SR between LOW-MOD (p > 0.9), but significant differences between LOW-HIGH and MOD-HIGH (p < 0.03). The assessment of SR can provide useful data for determining hydration strategies. The significant differences in SR within each temperature range indicates a single assessment may not accurately represent an individual’s typical SR even in similar environmental conditions.","Smith, JohnEric W.; Bello, Marissa L.; Price, Ffion G.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073387/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061807,510

To hasten the treatment process, repurposed drugs are being evaluated. Favipiravir is one such oral drug that was approved for new and reemerging pandemic influenza in Japan in 2014 and has shown potent in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. It has a wide therapeutic safety margin indicated by a wide CC50/EC50 ratio for a high dose. From the clinical studies in COVID-19, it has shown rapid viral clearance as compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) and superior recovery rate than umifenovir. Overall, favipiravir has shown promising results in clinical studies in China, Russia, and Japan, and more trials are underway in multiple countries, including USA, UK, and India. Recently, treatment guidelines from many countries and some states from India have included favipiravir in the treatment protocol. This review provides insights into the evidence-based evolving role of favipiravir in the management of COVID-19 infection with emphasis on benefits of initiating an early antiviral therapy with special focus on favipiravir, its pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, in vitro, clinical data, and inclusion in the treatment protocols of COVID-19.","Joshi, Shashank; Parkar, Jalil; Ansari, Abdul; Vora, Agam; Talwar, Deepak; Tiwaskar, Mangesh; Patil, Saiprasad; Barkate, Hanmant",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220322736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33130203/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220322736,510

The north-eastern section of the country, including the predominantly rural uMkhanyakude District Municipality, is among the most vulnerable regions, where a growing trend of lightning-related deaths and injuries has been observed in recent years. Despite this, and the Disaster Management Act (No. 57 of 2002), which mandates the implementation of hazard and risk assessments at all scales, no detailed research on the community risk perception of lightning incidents has yet been conducted, although such information could help to facilitate mitigation strategies. This explorative study involved a questionnaire survey of 150 community members that aimed to address this gap. Our results suggest that lightning is a real danger and the community had failed to effectively and successfully respond to its various socio-economic implications at the community and individual levels; this demonstrated the vulnerability of the community to the lightning activity in the study area. The contribution of this study is the identification and explanation of how lightning is regarded, understood, interpreted and responded to and how this information provides an opportunity for effective government intervention.","Moyo, Inocent; Xulu, Sifiso",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299900/,510
657876,Air dispersal of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: implications for nosocomial transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-08-14,"SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress that can progress to multiorgan failure and death in a minority of patients. Although severe COVID-19 disease is linked to exuberant inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not understood. Monocytes and macrophages are sentinel immune cells in the blood and tissue, respectively, that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and processing and release of IL-1 family cytokines, potent inflammatory mediators. Here we show that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) linked to higher GSDMD expression increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio, 1.3, p<0.005). We find that about 10% of blood monocytes in COVID-19 patients are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection depends on viral antibody opsonization and uptake of opsonized virus by the Fc receptor CD16. After uptake, SARS-CoV-2 begins to replicate in monocytes, as evidenced by detection of double-stranded RNA and subgenomic RNA and expression of a fluorescent reporter gene. However, infection is aborted, and infectious virus is not detected in infected monocyte supernatants or patient plasma. Instead, infected cells undergo inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) mediated by activation of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and GSDMD. Moreover, tissue-resident macrophages, but not infected epithelial cells, from COVID-19 lung autopsy specimens showed evidence of inflammasome activation. These findings taken together suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of monocytes/macrophages triggers inflammatory cell death that aborts production of infectious virus but causes systemic inflammation that contributes to severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis.","Junqueira, Caroline; Crespo, Ângela; Ranjbar, Shahin; Lewandrowski, Mercedes; Ingber, Jacob; de Lacerda, Luna B.; Parry, Blair; Ravid, Sagi; Clark, Sarah; Ho, Felicia; Vora, Setu M.; Leger, Valerie; Beakes, Caroline; Margolin, Justin; Russell, Nicole; Kays, Kyle; Gehrke, Lee; Adhikari, Upasana Das; Henderson, Lauren; Janssen, Erin; Kwon, Douglas; Sander, Chris; Abraham, Jonathan; Filbin, Michael; Goldberg, Marcia B.; Wu, Hao; Mehta, Gautam; Bell, Steven; Goldfeld, Anne E.; Lieberman, Judy",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-153628/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34401873/,510

658714,Weight Bias During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-03-18,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable stress throughout the world. Little is known about how postpartum women who gave birth during the early months of the pandemic were impacted. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the associations between potential risk, protective factors, and psychological distress among postpartum women who gave birth during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Postpartum women over the age of 18 years who gave birth in the US hospitals between March and July of 2020 and spoke English completed a survey about their experiences. Demographic and health variables were measured via self-report. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale-10. Mastery was measured with the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Resilience was measured with the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale-2. RESULTS: This study included 885 women. Participants had higher stress and lower resilience relative to pre-pandemic norms. Participants had high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Women who had an infant admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit had more stress. Income, full-time employment, and partnered relationships were associated with lower stress. Resilience and mastery were related to lower stress, depression, and anxiety. Black, Indigenous, or People of Color women showed higher stress and lower resiliency. Single women were likely to report lower levels of mastery than partnered women. CONCLUSION: Stress, depression, and anxiety were high in postpartum women in this study. Income, partnered relationships, and employment security, along with protective traits such as mastery and resilience, may reduce the impact of stress on postpartum women in a pandemic. Care models should be modified to support women during a pandemic. Health disparities exist in postpartum stress. Future interventions should focus on building resiliency and mastery and ensuring appropriate resources are available to postpartum women in a pandemic.","Mollard, Elizabeth; Kupzyk, Kevin; Moore, Tiffany",Womens Health (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1177/17455065211042190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465268/,510

Both of these are also recognized as risk factors for severity and poor outcome of COVID-19 disease. It is assumed that COVID-19 outbreak as well as an effective lockdown might have affected the incidence and outcome of some of these. Methods: To substantiate above hypothesis, an online survey was mailed to 547 pulmonologists across the country;314 (54.7%) responses were recorded in the given period. The survey included observations on incidence and outcome of common chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD and interstitial lung diseases (ILD) in predefined pre-COVID and during COVID period in a total of 24 questions. Results: It was observed that the reduction in incidence of outpatient department cases, acute exacerbations and hospitalization for asthma, COPD and ILD was statistically significant. The outcome of acute exacerbations of these chronic respiratory diseases was analyzed in terms of discharges from hospitals after satisfactory recovery and/ or mortalities. For COPD and ILD, it was not significantly affected during the COVID period. At the same time, a relatively higher proportion of acute asthma mortality was reported. A wide variation in nebulization practices was reported during this period. The doses of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma management were not affected. A wide variety of factors including effective lockdown, better quality of air and regular use of masks were probably responsible for reduced incidence of exacerbations of these chronic respiratory diseases. Conclusion: We conclude that while outpatient department visits, acute exacerbations and hospitalizations were significantly reduced during COVID-19 period, outcome of asthmatics was relatively unfavorable as compared to that of COPD and ILDs.

Rural communities are particularly at risk because of their low socio-economic status and high illiteracy level. There is currently uncertainty regarding how to effectively raise awareness about the pandemic and educate rural communities about it. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of interpersonal communication in awareness creation and knowledge about COVID-19 among rural communities in a developing country. We tested three hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. The sample size was made up 470 participants. The questionnaire served as the instrument for data collection. In the analysis of data, both descriptive and inferential statistics were used. The results demonstrate that interpersonal communication is effective in creating awareness about COVID-19 among rural communities. It was also found that interpersonal communication was effective in improving knowledge about the pandemic among rural communications.

To better understand teachers’ risk perception, we conducted a survey in Germany. Participants were recruited through various associations and invited to take part in a cross-sectional COVID-19-specific online survey. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Factors associated with teachers’ fears of contracting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were evaluated with an adjusted multivariable regression analysis. The median age of the 6753 participating teachers was 43 years, and 77% were female. Most teachers worked in high schools (29%) and elementary schools (26%). The majority of participants (73%) feared contracting SARS-CoV-2 at school, while 77% intended to receive their COVID-19 vaccination. Ninety-eight percent considered students to pose the greatest risk. Female and younger teachers were significantly more anxious to get infected and teachers who opposed the re-opening of schools had significantly higher odds of being more anxious (p < 0.001). To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to describe teachers’ risk perception of COVID-19 and their attitudes towards vaccinations in a nationwide survey. The anxiety correlates with the COVID-19 protection measures demanded and appears to be a driving factor rather than rational logic.","Weinert, Stefanie; Thronicke, Anja; Hinse, Maximilian; Schad, Friedemann; Matthes, Harald",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501807/,510

There are currently very limited treatment options for SFTSV infection. We conducted a drug repurposing program by establishing a two-tier test system to rapidly screen a Food and Drug Administration- (FDA)-approved drug library for drug compounds with anti-SFTSV activity in vitro. We identified five drug compounds that inhibited SFTSV replication at low micromolar concentrations, including hexachlorophene, triclosan, regorafenib, eltrombopag, and broxyquinoline. Among them, hexachlorophene was the most potent with an IC(50) of 1.3 ± 0.3 µM and a selectivity index of 18.7. Mechanistic studies suggested that hexachlorophene was a virus entry inhibitor, which impaired SFTSV entry into host cells by interfering with cell membrane fusion. Molecular docking analysis predicted that the binding of hexachlorophene with the hydrophobic pocket between domain I and domain III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein was highly stable. The novel antiviral activity and mechanism of hexachlorophene in this study would facilitate the use of hexachlorophene as a lead compound to develop more entry inhibitors with higher anti-SFTSV potency and lower toxicity.","Yuan, Shuofeng; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Ye, Zi-Wei; Wen, Lei; Tsang, Terance Gi-Wai; Cao, Jianli; Huang, Jingjing; Chan, Chris Chun-Yiu; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Choi, Garnet Kwan-Yue; Cai, Jian-Piao; Yin, Feifei; Chu, Hin; Liang, Mifang; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027241/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11040385,510
659863,1638P Experience with telemedicine during COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-30,"Improving early diagnosis along with timely and effective treatment of COVID-19 are urgently needed. However, at present, the mechanisms underlying disease spread and development, defined prognosis, and immune status of patients with COVID-19 remain to be determined. Patients with severe disease state exhibit a hyperinflammatory response associated with cytokine storm syndrome, hypercoagulability, and depressed cell-mediated immunity. These clinical manifestations, sharing similar pathogenesis, have been well-studied in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The present review suggests treatment approaches for COVID-19 based on strategies used against ovarian cancer, which shares similar immunopathology and associated coagulation disorders. The chronicization of the hyperinflammatory cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19 highlights a defective resistance phase that leads to aspecific chronic inflammation, associated with oxidative stress, which impairs specific T-cell response, induces tissue and endothelial damage, and thrombosis associated with systemic effects that lead to severe multi-organ failure and death. These events are similar to those observed in advanced ovarian cancer which share similar pathogenesis mediated primarily by Interleukin-6, which is, as well demonstrated in ovarian cancer, the key cytokine driving the immunopathology, related systemic symptoms, and patient prognosis. Consistent with findings in other disease models with similar immunopathology, such as advanced ovarian cancer, treatment of severe COVID-19 infection should target inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation disorders, and immunodepression to improve patient outcome. Correctly identifying disease stages, based on available laboratory data, and developing a specific protocol for each phase is essential for effective treatment.","Macciò, Antonio; Oppi, Sara; Madeddu, Clelia",J Ovarian Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-021-00772-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550983/,510

In this report we describe the successful generation of a live recombinant virus, cSN-KBLV; where the full-length genome clone of RABV vaccine strain, SAD-B19, was constructed with the glycoprotein of KBLV. Subsequent in vitro characterisation of cSN-KBLV is described here. In addition, the ability of a human rabies vaccine to confer protective immunity in vivo following challenge with this recombinant virus was assessed. Naïve or vaccinated mice were infected intracerebrally with a dose of 100 focus-forming units/30 µL of cSN-KBLV; all naïve mice and 8% (n = 1/12) of the vaccinated mice succumbed to the challenge, whilst 92% (n = 11/12) of the vaccinated mice survived to the end of the experiment. This report provides strong evidence for cross-neutralisation and cross-protection of cSN-KBLV using purified Vero cell rabies vaccine.","Shipley, Rebecca; Wright, Edward; Lean, Fabian Z.

661433,Stuck Outside and Inside: An Exploratory Study on the Effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Italian Parents and Children’s Internalizing Symptoms,2020-10-22,"SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID19, has caused a pandemic that has infected more than 80 M and killed more than 1.6 M persons worldwide. In the US as of December 2020, it has infected more than 32 M people while causing more than 570,000 deaths. As the pandemic persists, there has been a public demand to reopen schools and university campuses. To consider these demands, it is necessary to rapidly identify those individuals infected with the virus and isolate them so that disease transmission can be stopped. In the present study, we examined the sensitivity of the Quidel Rapid Antigen test for use in screening both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals at the University of Arizona from June to August 2020. A total of 885 symptomatic and 1551 asymptomatic subjects were assessed by antigen testing and real-time PCR testing. The sensitivity of the test for both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons was between 82 and 90%, with some caveats.","Harris, David T.; Badowski, Michael; Jernigan, Brandon; Sprissler, Ryan; Edwards, Taylor; Cohen, Randall; Paul, Stephen; Merchant, Nirav; Weinkauf, Craig C.; Bime, Christian; Erickson, Heidi E.; Bixby, Billie; Parthasarathy, Sairam; Chaudhary, Sachin; Natt, Bhupinder; Cristan, Elaine; El Aini, Tammer; Rischard, Franz; Campion, Janet; Chopra, Madhav; Insel, Michael; Sam, Afshin; Knepler, James L.; Knox, Kenneth; Mosier, Jarrod; Spier, Catherine; Dake, Michael D.",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9050539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066047/,510
661584,Reallocation of Carotid Surgery Activity with the Support of Telemedicine in a COVID-Free Clinic during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-07-23,"The month of December 2019 became a critical part of the time of humanity when the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Wuhan, Hubei Province in China. As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19. The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans. In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly. Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions. The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea. However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms. It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential. Recently, cases of fecal–oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract. Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.","Kopel, Jonathan; Perisetti, Abhilash; Gajendran, Mahesh; Boregowda, Umesha; Goyal, Hemant",Dig Dis Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06362-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447742/,510

For situational awareness and decision-support, quickly available yet accurate big-data analytics about human mobility and social distancing is invaluable to agencies and decision-makers. This paper presents a big-data-driven analytical framework that ingests terabytes of data on a daily basis and quantitatively assesses the human mobility trend during COVID-19. Using mobile device location data of over 150 million monthly active samples in the United States (U.S.), the study successfully measures human mobility with three main metrics at the county level: daily average number of trips per person; daily average person-miles traveled; and daily percentage of residents staying home. A set of generalized additive mixed models is employed to disentangle the policy effect on human mobility from other confounding effects including virus effect, socio-demographic effect, weather effect, industry effect, and spatiotemporal autocorrelation. Results reveal the policy plays a limited, time-decreasing, and region-specific effect on human movement. The stay-at-home orders only contribute to a 3.5%-7.9% decrease in human mobility, while the reopening guidelines lead to a 1.6%-5.2% mobility increase. Results also indicate a reasonable spatial heterogeneity among the U.S. counties, wherein the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, income levels, industry structure, age and racial distribution play important roles. The data informatics generated by the framework are made available to the public for a timely understanding of mobility trends and policy effects, as well as for time-sensitive decision support to further contain the spread of the virus.","Hu, Songhua; Xiong, Chenfeng; Yang, Mofeng; Younes, Hannah; Luo, Weiyu; Zhang, Lei",Transp Res Part C Emerg Technol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X20308524?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2020.102955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33456212/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968090X20308524,510
662125,Management of cardiac implantable electronic device follow‐up in COVID‐19 pandemic: Lessons learned during Italian lockdown,2020-09-30,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts of more than 200 nucleotides, which lack protein-coding potential. LncRNAs have been well characterized in many organisms, but their functions in insects have not been well deciphered. Advancement of high-throughput technologies has enabled the sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes of several insects, which has led to the identification of many important lncRNAs in insects. Characterization of lncRNAs and their regulatory roles in insects may provide insights of novel pest control strategies. Through this comprehensive review, we present an overview of insect lncRNAs, their identification as well as their function in insects of different orders. Toward the end of the review, we highlight the role of lncRNAs in insect developmental processes and discuss the future prospects of lncRNAs in insects. ABSTRACT: Only a small subset of all the transcribed RNAs are used as a template for protein translation, whereas RNA molecules that are not translated play a very important role as regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Besides traditionally known RNAs (ribosomal and transfer RNAs), ncRNAs also include small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The lncRNAs, which were initially thought to be junk, have gained a great deal attention because of their regulatory roles in diverse biological processes in animals and plants. Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of animals on this planet. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of lncRNAs in almost all aspects of insect development, reproduction, and genetic plasticity. In this review, we describe the function and molecular mechanisms of the mode of action of different insect lncRNAs discovered up to date.","Choudhary, Chhavi; Sharma, Shivasmi; Meghwanshi, Keshav Kumar; Patel, Smit; Mehta, Prachi; Shukla, Nidhi; Do, Duy Ngoc; Rajpurohit, Subhash; Suravajhala, Prashanth; Shukla, Jayendra Nath",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11041118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919662/,510

Secondly, we compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients hospitalized with influenza. METHODS We conducted a cohort study using eight routinely-collected healthcare databases from Spain and the US, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: i) diagnosed with COVID-19, ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017-2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes. RESULTS We included 366,050 and 119,597 patients diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID-19, respectively. Prostate and breast cancers were the most frequent cancers (range: 5-19% and 1-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematological malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma being among the 5 most common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort. Overall, patients were aged above 65 years and had multiple comorbidities. Occurrence of death ranged from 2% to 14% and from 6% to 26% in the diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts, respectively. Patients hospitalized with influenza (n=67,743) had a similar distribution of cancer subtypes, sex, age and comorbidities but lower occurrence of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Patients with a history of cancer and COVID-19 had multiple comorbidities and a high occurrence of COVID-19-related events. Hematological malignancies were frequent.

Methods: Data for 485 patients were extracted from the medical records from the infectious disease center of Prince Mohammed bin Abdul Aziz Hospital in Riyadh. Patients' basic information, laboratory test results, signs and symptoms, medication prescribed, other comorbidities, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Descriptive data were reported to examine the distribution of study variables between the severe and not severe groups. Results: Of 458 included patients, 411 (89.7%) were classified as not severe, 47 (10.3%) as severe. Most (59.1%) patients were aged between 20 and 39 years. Patients with severe conditions were non-Saudi, with a chronic condition history, and tended to have more chronic conditions compared with those without severe disease. Diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disease were significantly higher in patients with severe disease. Death was reported in only 4.26% of severe patients. Only 16 (34.04%) patients remained in the hospital in the severe group. Conclusions: Severe cases were more likely to have more comorbidities, diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disorders were most common compared with non-severe cases.","Alqahtani, Abdulhadi M.; AlMalki, Ziyad S.; Alalweet, Randah M.; Almazrou, Saja H.; Alanazi, Abdullah Salah; Alanazi, Mona A.; AlShehri, Abdussalam A.; AlGhamdi, Saleh",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.593256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330336/,510

Its surface glycoprotein (spike protein) is considered to be one of the prime targets for SARS therapeutics and intervention because its proteolytic maturation by a host protease is crucial for host–virus fusion. Using intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic (IQF) peptides based on hSARS‐CoV spike protein (Abz‐(755)Glu‐Gln‐Asp‐Arg‐Asn‐Thr‐Arg‐Glu‐Val‐Phe‐Ala‐Gln(766)‐Tyx‐NH(2)) and in vitro studies, we show that besides furin, other PCs, like PC5 and PC7, might also be involved in this cleavage event. Through kinetic measurements with recombinant PCs, we observed that the peptide was cleaved efficiently by both furin and PC5, but very poorly by PC7. The cleavage could be blocked by a PC‐inhibitor, α1‐PDX, in a dose‐dependent manner. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that this peptide possesses a high degree of sheet structure. Following cleavage by furin, the sheet content increased, possibly at the expense of turn and random structures. (1)H NMR spectra from 2D COSY and ROESY experiments under physiological buffer and pH conditions indicated that this peptide possesses a structure with a turn at its C‐terminal segment, close to the cleavage site. The data suggest that the cleavable peptide bond is located within the most exposed domain; this is supported by the nearby turn structure. Several strong to weak NMR ROESY correlations were detected, and a 3D structure of the spike IQF peptide that contains the crucial cleavage site R(761)↓E has been proposed.","Basak, Ajoy; Mitra, Abhijit; Basak, Sarmistha; Pasko, Carolyn; Chrétien, Michel; Seaton, Pamela",Chembiochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17471479/,510
663130,The effect of COVID-19 on children with congenital talipes equinovarus in a tertiary service in the United Kingdom,2021,"The rapid spread of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic poses particular challenges to the management of persons with chronic disease. Reports of a possible neuroinvasiveness of SARS‐CoV‐2 as well as pathophysiological mechanisms and indirect consequences in severe COVID‐19 cases raise the question of whether the infection can be associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence or the development of new onset and acute symptomatic seizures. Although the literature does not provide relevant evidence for seizure worsening in persons with epilepsy during the course of a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, there are theoretical risks, for example, seizures triggered by fever. Moreover, a severe disease course and advanced disease stages can, for instance, result in hypoxic encephalopathy, cerebrovascular events, and cytokine storm, which may trigger the development of acute seizures. This is further confirmed by reports of occasional seizures in COVID‐19 patients. Although the low number of reports so far suggests that the risk may be relatively low, the reports indicate that an early neurological manifestation with seizures should not be ruled out. In the context of these cases, we discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms that may trigger ictogenesis in patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Vohora, Divya; Jain, Shreshta; Tripathi, Manjari; Potschka, Heidrun",Epilepsia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32944929/; https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16656,510

663807,Retrospective Analysis of Intracranial Hemorrhages in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Face coverings constitute an important strategy for containing pandemics, such as COVID-19. Infection from airborne respiratory viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur in at least three modes; tiny and/or dried aerosols (typically < 1.0 μm) generated through multiple mechanisms including talking, breathing, singing, large droplets (> 0.5 μm) generated during coughing and sneezing, and macro drops transmitted via fomites. While there is a growing number of studies looking at the performance of household materials against some of these situations, to date, there has not been any systematic characterization of household materials against all three modes. METHODS: A three-step methodology was developed and used to characterize the performance of 21 different household materials with various material compositions (e.g. cotton, polyester, polypropylene, cellulose and blends) using submicron sodium chloride aerosols, water droplets, and mucous mimicking macro droplets over an aerosol-droplet size range of ~ 20 nm to 0.6 cm. RESULTS: Except for one thousand-thread-count cotton, most single-layered materials had filtration efficiencies < 20% for sub-micron solid aerosols. However, several of these materials stopped > 80% of larger droplets, even at sneeze-velocities of up to 1700 cm/s. Three or four layers of the same material, or combination materials, would be required to stop macro droplets from permeating out or into the face covering. Such materials can also be boiled for reuse. CONCLUSION: Four layers of loosely knit or woven fabrics independent of the composition (e.g. cotton, polyester, nylon or blends) are likely to be effective source controls. One layer of tightly woven fabrics combined with multiple layers of loosely knit or woven fabrics in addition to being source controls can have sub-micron filtration efficiencies > 40% and may offer some protection to the wearer. However, the pressure drop across such fabrics can be high (> 100 Pa).","Guha, Suvajyoti; Herman, Alexander; Carr, Ian A.; Porter, Daniel; Natu, Rucha; Berman, Shayna; Myers, Matthew R.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439878/,510
663988,COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on doctors in training,2020-09-30,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and aging is the most common risk factor for developing the disease. The etiology of AD is not known but AD may be considered as a clinical syndrome with multiple causal pathways contributing to it. The amyloid cascade hypothesis, claiming that excess production or reduced clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and its aggregation into amyloid plaques, was accepted for a long time as the main cause of AD. However, many studies showed that Aβ is a frequent consequence of many challenges/pathologic processes occurring in the brain for decades. A key factor, sustained by experimental data, is that low-grade infection leading to production and deposition of Aβ, which has antimicrobial activity, precedes the development of clinically apparent AD. This infection is chronic, low grade, largely clinically silent for decades because of a nearly efficient antimicrobial immune response in the brain. A chronic inflammatory state is induced that results in neurodegeneration. Interventions that appear to prevent, retard or mitigate the development of AD also appear to modify the disease. In this review, we conceptualize further that the changes in the brain antimicrobial immune response during aging and especially in AD sufferers serve as a foundation that could lead to improved treatment strategies for preventing or decreasing the progression of AD in a disease-modifying treatment.","Fulop, Tamas; Tripathi, Shreyansh; Rodrigues, Serafim; Desroches, Mathieu; Bunt, Ton; Eiser, Arnold; Bernier, Francois; Beauregard, Pascale B; Barron, Annelise E; Khalil, Abdelouahed; Plotka, Adam; Hirokawa, Katsuiku; Larbi, Anis; Bocti, Christian; Laurent, Benoit; Frost, Eric H; Witkowski, Jacek M",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s264910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976546/,510

However, so far only WNV has been demonstrated to be transmitted via blood transfusion. Pasteurization (heat treatment in aqueous stabilized solution at 60°C for 10 hours) is an integral part of the manufacturing process of ZLB Behring's coagulation factor concentrates such as Haemate P / Humate-P, Monoclate-P, Beriate P, and Berinin P as well as other plasma-derived medicinal products. Therefore, the virus inactivation capacity of this manufacturing step was evaluated utilizing these emerging viruses or appropriate model viruses in virus spiking studies in order to assess the safety of plasma derivatives. The studies demonstrated that WNV was inactivated very effectively by pasteurization in different plasma derivatives resulting in an inactivation factor of more than 7 log10 and that BVDV (bovine viral diarrhea virus, as WNV a member of the family Flaviviridae) is a suitable model virus for WNV. Furthermore, coronaviruses and influenza viruses, of both avian and human origin, were highly susceptible to inactivation by pasteurization resulting in complete inactivation of virus infectivity within a short period of time. In addition, feline calicivirus, a model virus for hepatitis E virus (HEV), was inactivated very effectively within a short period of time. We demonstrate that pasteurization is an effective method to inactivate the emerging viruses WNV, SARS coronavirus, and avian influenza viruses as well as HEV below detection limit of a sensitive cell culture infectivity assay resulting in a safe plasma derivative.","Groener, Albrecht; Schäfer, Wolfram; Nowak, Thomas",Blood,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497118680097; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006497118680097,510

However, the full impact of these cardiovascular risk factors is still under investigation. This study aimed to investigate the association between patients' level of cardiovascular risk and the severity of COVID-19. Materials and methods This observational study included all adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at Sheikh Khalifa Ibn Zaid International University Hospital from March 20 to May 10, 2020. The cardiovascular risk level was assessed by the doctor responsible for each patient based on the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines. We examined the association between the patients' level of cardiovascular risk and their severity of COVID-19 disease by using a logistic regression model. Results Among 133 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 46.6% had a low cardiovascular risk level, 19.5% had a moderate risk level, 15.8% had a high risk level, and 18.1% was found to have a very high risk level. Patients with different cardiovascular risk levels had significantly different rates of complications including secondary infection (p-value: <0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (p-value = 0.017), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (p-value: <0.001), and death (p-value: <0.001).

It's impact on the healthcare system has been devastating. The medical fraternity across the world, including India, is facing unprecedented challenges in striving to cope up with this catastrophic outbreak. Like all other specialties, dermatology practice has been profoundly affected by this pandemic. Measures have been taken by dermatologists to control the transmission of the virus, whereas providing health care to patients in the constrained environment. Preventive measures such as social distancing and hand hygienic practices along with patient education is being prioritized. Dermatological conferences and events scheduled across the globe in the first half of year 2020 have been either cancelled or postponed to discourage gatherings. Rationalization of resources and practice of teledermatology are being encouraged in current scenario. Non-urgent visits of the patients are being discouraged and elective dermatology procedures are being postponed. Many national and international dermatology societies have recently proposed recommendations and advisories on usage of biologicals and immunomodulators in present context of COVID-19 pandemic. Urticarial, erythematous, varicelliform, purpuric and livedoid rash as well as aggravation of preexisting dermatological diseases like rosacea, eczema, atopic dermatitis, and neurodermatitis rash have been reported in Covid-19 patients. Self medications and poor compliance of dermatology patients in addition to lack of proper treatment protocols and monitoring are a serious concern in the present scenario. Strategies for future course of action, including the dermatology specific guidelines need to be framed. This issue includes a special symposium on dermatology and COVID-19 having recommendations from special interest groups (SIGs) of Indian Association of Dermatologists, Venereologists and Leprologists (IADVL) Academy on leprosy, dermatosurgery, lasers and dermoscopy.","Bhat, Yasmeen Jabeen; Aslam, Aaqib; Hassan, Iffat; Dogra, Sunil",Indian Dermatol Online J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32695687/; https://doi.org/10.4103/idoj.idoj_180_20,510

This finding was instrumental in the development of the gauze mask introduced by Johann von Mikulicz Radecki in the same year. A surgical mask has become an indispensable tool in the armamentarium to fight the COVID 19 pandemic. Surgical masks which were once limited to the confines of healthcare setups are now donned by the members of the general public. It has become imperative that a healthcare worker selects the right kind of respiratory protective equipment to protect himself and his patients. The surgical mask has become essential, in a way, for survival.","Gandhi, Jignesh A.; Churiwala, Jayati J.; Shinde, Pravin H.; Chaudhari, Sadashiv N.",Indian J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-020-02438-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837074/,510
669136,Reimagining the Future of HIV Service Implementation in the Philippines Based on Lessons from COVID-19,2020-05-25,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation is a cost-effective management strategy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which improves exercise performance and health-related quality of life. Nutritional supplementation may counter malnutrition and enhance pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes but rigorous evidence is absent. We aimed to investigate the effect of high-protein supplementation (Fortisip Compact Protein (FCP)) during pulmonary rehabilitation on exercise capacity. METHODS: This was a double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing FCP (intervention) with PreOp (a carbohydrate control supplement) in COPD patients participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. Participants consumed the supplement twice a day during pulmonary rehabilitation and attended twice-weekly pulmonary rehabilitation sessions, with pre- and post-pulmonary rehabilitation measurements, including the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance at 6 weeks as the primary outcome. Participants’ experience using supplements was assessed. RESULTS: 68 patients were recruited (intervention n=36 and control n=32). The trial was stopped early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although statistical significance was not reached, there was the suggestion of a clinically meaningful difference in the ISWT distance at 6 weeks favouring the intervention group (intervention 342±149 m (n=22) versus control 305±148 m (n=22); p=0.1). Individuals who achieved an improvement in the ISWT had a larger mid-thigh circumference at baseline (responders 62±4 cm versus nonresponders 55±6 cm; p=0.006). 79% of the patients were satisfied with the taste and 43% would continue taking the FCP. CONCLUSIONS: Although the data did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the ISWT, high-protein supplementation in COPD during pulmonary rehabilitation may result in a clinically meaningful improvement in exercise capacity and was acceptable to patients. Large, adequately powered studies are justified.","Aldhahir, Abdulelah M.; Aldabayan, Yousef S.; Alqahtani, Jaber S.; Ridsdale, Heidi A.; Smith, Colette; Hurst, John R.; Mandal, Swapna",ERJ Open Res,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00077-2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816594/,510
669158,A national study to assess pharmacists’ preparedness against COVID-19 during its rapid rise period in Pakistan,2020-11-05,"A degraded/dysfunctional immune system appears to be the main determinant of serious/fatal reaction to viral infection (for COVID-19, SARS, and influenza alike). There are four major approaches being employed or considered presently to augment or strengthen the immune system, in order to reduce adverse effects of viral exposure. The three approaches that are focused mainly on augmenting the immune system are based on the concept that pandemics/outbreaks can be controlled/prevented while maintaining the immune-degrading lifestyles followed by much of the global population. The fourth approach is based on identifying and introducing measures aimed at strengthening the immune system intrinsically in order to minimize future pandemics/outbreaks. Specifically, the four measures are: 1) restricting exposure to virus; 2) providing reactive/tactical treatments to reduce viral load; 3) developing vaccines to prevent, or at least attenuate, the infection; 4) strengthening the immune system intrinsically, by a) identifying those factors that contribute to degrading the immune system, then eliminating/reducing them as comprehensively, thoroughly, and rapidly as possible, and b) replacing the eliminated factors with immune-strengthening factors. This paper focuses on vaccine safety. A future COVID-19 vaccine appears to be the treatment of choice at the national/international level. Vaccine development has been accelerated to achieve this goal in the relatively near-term, and questions have arisen whether vaccine safety has been/is being/will be compromised in pursuit of a shortened vaccine development time. There are myriad mechanisms related to vaccine-induced, and natural infection-induced, infections that could adversely impact vaccine effectiveness and safety. This paper summarizes many of those mechanisms.","Kostoff, Ronald N.; Kanduc, Darja; Porter, Alan L.; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Calina, Daniela; Briggs, Michael B.; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Tsatsakis, Aristidis",Toxicol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.10.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110761/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214750020304248,510

However, with the current technologies available, continuing to replace laboratory-based, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests with rapid (point-of-care) tests may lead to an increased number of false negative tests. Moreover, the more rapid dissemination of false negative results that can occur with the use of rapid tests for COVID-19 may lead to increased spread of the novel coronavirus if patients do not understand the concept of false negative tests. One means of combatting this would be to tell patients who have a “negative” rapid COVID-19 test that their test result was “indeterminate.”","Zitek, Tony; Fraiman, Joseph B.",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2021.2.50550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125024/,510

This single-center case series from Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, China, included 2,980 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized between February 4, 2020 and April 10, 2020. Patients were diagnosed as asymptomatic (n = 39), presymptomatic (n = 34), and symptomatic (n = 2,907) upon admission. This study provided an overview of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic COVID-19 patients, including detection, demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes. Upon admission, there was no significant difference in clinical symptoms and CT image between asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients for diagnosis reference. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the differential diagnosis model to discriminate presymptomatic patients from asymptomatic patients was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81-0.98). Importantly, the severe and non-severe presymptomatic patients can be further stratified (AUC = 0.82). In conclusion, the two-step risk-stratification model based on 10 laboratory indicators can distinguish among asymptomatic, severe presymptomatic, and non-severe presymptomatic COVID-19 patients on admission. Moreover, single-cell data analyses revealed that the CD8+T cell exhaustion correlated to the progression of COVID-19.","Shi, Lei; Ding, Rong; Zhang, Tingting; Wu, Wei; Wang, Ziyu; Jia, Xiuzhi; Li, Kening; Liang, Yuan; Li, Jie; Zhu, Mengyan; Huang, Bin; Wu, Lingxiang; Wu, Min; Chen, Jing; Wang, Chaochen; Huang, Bin; Liu, Caidong; Shen, Hongbing; Wang, Qianghu; Xia, Xinyi; Li, Pengping; Lyu, Sali; Xiao, Ying",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305939/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.700449,510

670318,Outcomes of COVID‐19 Patients After Inpatient Rehabilitation,2021-05-22,"The natural response of pigs to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infections and vaccinations needs to be altered so that better protection is afforded against both homologous and heterologous challenges by this pathogen. To address this problem, real-time gene expression assays were coupled with cytokine Elispot and protein analyses to assess the nature of the anti-PRRSV response of pigs immunized with modified live virus (MLV) vaccine. Although T helper 1 (Th1) immunity was elicited in all vaccinated animals, as evidenced by the genesis of PRRSV-specific interferon-gamma secreting cells (IFNG SC), the overall extent of the memory response was variable and generally weak. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from these pigs responded to PRRSV exposure with a limited increase in their expression of the Th1 immune markers, IFNG, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-15 (IL15), and a reduction in the quantity of mRNAs encoding the innate and inflammatory proteins, IL1B, IL8 and IFNA. Efforts to enhance Th1 immunity, by utilizing an expression plasmid encoding porcine IFNA (pINA) as an adjuvant, resulted in a temporary increase in the frequency of PRRSV-specific IFNG SC but only minor changes overall in the expression of Th1 associated cytokine or innate immune marker mRNA by virus-stimulated PBMC. Administration of pINA, however, did correlate with decreased IL1B secretion by cultured, unstimulated PBMC but had no effect on their ability to release IFNG. Thus, while exogenous addition of IFNA during PRRSV vaccination has an impact on the development of a Th1 immune response, other alterations will be required for substantial boosting of virus-specific protection.","Royaee, Atabak R.; Husmann, Robert J.; Dawson, Harry D.; Calzada-Nova, Gabriela; Schnitzlein, William M.; Zuckermann, Federico A.; Lunney, Joan K.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704002533; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704002533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15507306/,510

A paradoxical decrease in emergency hernia surgery during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-16,"COVID-19 is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of COVID-19 virus, Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. One important consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle: reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet. 2019 guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease indicate that “Adults should engage in at least 150 minute per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minute per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce ASCVD risk.” During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to follow a healthy diet should be implemented. Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to good lifestyle.","Mattioli, Anna Vittoria; Ballerini Puviani, Matteo; Nasi, Milena; Farinetti, Alberto",Eur J Clin Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0646-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371988/,510

AIM: To investigate the rapid implementation of remote consulting and explore impact over the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Mixed-methods study in 21 general practices in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. METHOD: Longitudinal observational quantitative analysis compared volume and type of consultation in April to July 2020 with April to July 2019. Negative binomial models were used to identify if changes differed among different groups of patients. Qualitative data from 87 longitudinal interviews with practice staff in four rounds investigated practices’ experience of the move to remote consulting, challenges faced, and solutions. A thematic analysis utilised Normalisation Process Theory. RESULTS: There was universal consensus that remote consulting was necessary. This drove a rapid change to 90% remote GP consulting (46% for nurses) by April 2020. Consultation rates reduced in April to July 2020 compared to 2019; GPs and nurses maintained a focus on older patients, shielding patients, and patients with poor mental health. Telephone consulting was sufficient for many patient problems, video consulting was used more rarely, and was less essential as lockdown eased. SMS-messaging increased more than three-fold. GPs were concerned about increased clinical risk and some had difficulties setting thresholds for seeing patients face-to-face as lockdown eased. CONCLUSION: The shift to remote consulting was successful and a focus maintained on vulnerable patients. It was driven by the imperative to reduce contagion and may have risks; post-pandemic, the model will need adjustment.","Murphy, Mairead; Scott, Lauren J; Salisbury, Chris; Turner, Andrew; Scott, Anne; Denholm, Rachel; Lewis, Rhys; Iyer, Geeta; Macleod, John; Horwood, Jeremy",Br J Gen Pract,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp.2020.0948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558332/,510

Patients and Methods We deployed the baseline questionnaire of a prospective online survey from November 20, 2020-February 8, 2021 to U.S.-based employees. The survey included questions on psychosocial and behavioral responses in addition to transmission prevention behaviors (e.g., mask wear). Select questions asked employees to report perceptions and behaviors ‘before’ and ‘during’ the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed descriptively and stratified by work from home (WFH) percentage. Results In total, 3,607 employees completed the survey from eight companies. Most participants (70.0%) averaged ≥90% of their time WFH during the pandemic. Employees reported increases in stress (54.0%), anxiety (57.4%), fatigue (51.6%), and feeling unsafe (50.4%) from before to during the pandemic, while feeling a lack of companionship (60.5%) and isolation from others (69.3%). Productivity was perceived to decrease, and non-work screen time and alcohol consumption to increase, for 43.0%, 50.7%, and 25.1% of employees, respectively, from before to during the pandemic. Adverse changes were worse among those with lower WFH percentages.

However, a wide array of cardiovascular complications has also been described in the setting of COVID-19. Wellens' syndrome, also regarded as a left anterior descending coronary T-wave syndrome, is an electrocardiography (EKG) pattern that indicates critical proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery stenosis. It is characterized by deeply inverted T-waves or biphasic T-waves in the anterior precordial chest leads in a patient with unstable angina. Patients typically present with symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome. To our knowledge, we present the first case of Wellens' syndrome in a patient with a COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, this case describes stenosis of the left circumflex artery, a variant of the unusual angiographic findings associated with Wellens', as it is usually associated with occlusion of the proximal LAD. The pathophysiology of cardiovascular complications associated with COVID-19 is not well-understood; nevertheless, it was reported that mortality from coronary artery disease (CAD) complications is significantly higher in these patient populations. Healthcare providers should also be aware of identifying Wellens' syndrome, as urgent coronary angiography is superior to stress testing.","Elkholy, Karim O; Mirashi, Elidona; Malyshev, Yury; Charles, Gregory; Sahni, Sonu",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728223/,510

Research, practice, and policy have focused on educating family caregivers to sustain care but failed to equip healthcare providers to effectively support family caregivers. Family physicians are well-positioned to care for family caregivers. Methods. We adopted an interpretive description design to explore family physicians and primary care team members’ perceptions of their current and recommended practices for supporting family caregivers. We conducted focus groups with family physicians and their primary care team members. Results. Ten physicians and 42 team members participated. We identified three major themes. “Family physicians and primary care teams can be a valuable source of support for family caregivers” highlighted these primary care team members’ broad recognition of the need to support family caregiver’s health. “What stands in the way” spoke to the barriers in current practices that precluded supporting family caregivers. Primary care teams recommended, “A structured approach may be a way forward.” Conclusion. A plethora of research and policy documents recommend proactive, consistent support for family caregivers, yet comprehensive caregiver support policy remains elusive. The continuity of care makes primary care an ideal setting to support family caregivers. Now policy-makers must develop consistent protocols to assess, and care for family caregivers in primary care.","Parmar, Jasneet; Anderson, Sharon; Abbasi, Marjan; Ahmadinejad, Saeed; Chan, Karenn; Charles, Lesley; Dobbs, Bonnie; Khera, Amandeep Sheny; Stickney-Lee, Jennifer; Tian, Peter George J.; Jain, Suvidha",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806725/,510

Here we estimate the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 and propose a dynamical model for the time course of infection number. With this model, we assessed the effects of different measures for infection risk control. The model is different from the previous ones as it models the population as heterogeneous, with subpopulations having different infection risks. Our analyses showed that after this heterogeneity is incorporated in the model, several characteristics of the epidemic are estimated more accurately: the total number of cases and peak number of cases are lower compared to the homogeneous case, the early-stage growth rate in the number of infection cases is little affected, and the decrease in the number of infections slows down during the epidemic late stage. The comparison of our model results with the available data for COVID-19 indicates that the anti-epidemic measures undertaken in China and the rest of the world managed to decrease the basic reproductive number but did not assure an accumulation of sufficient collective immunity. Thus, the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart, which necessitates a careful approach to lifting the quarantine measures.","Gerasimov, A.; Lebedev, G.; Lebedev, M.; Semenycheva, I.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20090688v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20090688,510
675906,DC/L‐SIGNs of Hope in the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2020-05-06,"An improved understanding of human T cell-mediated immunity in COVID-19 is important for optimizing therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8(+) T cell memory to peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2, which enhances recovery and diminishes clinical severity upon reinfection. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2−specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in vitro, with CD4(+) T cells being robust. We identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8(+) T cell epitopes, A2/S(269–277) and A2/Orf1ab(3183–3191). Using peptide−HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) and A2/Orf1ab(3183)(+)CD8(+) populations indicated that A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) T cells were detected at comparable frequencies (∼1.3 × 10(−5)) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01(+) patients. These frequencies were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01(+) donors (∼2.5 × 10(−6)), but low when compared to frequencies for influenza-specific (A2/M1(58)) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-specific (A2/BMLF(1280)) (∼1.38 × 10(−4)) populations. Phenotyping A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) T cells from COVID-19 convalescents ex vivo showed that A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) T cells were predominantly negative for CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1, and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8(+) T cells expressed granzymes and/or perforin. Furthermore, the bias toward naïve, stem cell memory and central memory A2/S(269)(+)CD8(+) T cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be compromising CD8(+) T cell activation. Priming with appropriate vaccines may thus be beneficial for optimizing CD8(+) T cell immunity in COVID-19.","Habel, Jennifer R.; Nguyen, Thi H.

We anonymously identified users who used a web search engine (i.e., Yahoo! JAPAN) to search for COVID-19 or its symptoms. We regarded them as web searchers who were suspicious of their own COVID-19 infection (WSSCI). We extracted the location of WSSCI via a mobile operating system application and compared the spatio-temporal distribution of WSSCI with the actual location of the two known clusters. In the early stage of cluster development, we confirmed several WSSCI. Our approach was accurate in this stage and became biased after a public announcement of the cluster development.

Each drug or drug combination was tested in patch clamp assays on 7 cardiac ion channels, in in silico models of human ventricular electrophysiology (Virtual Assay(®)) using control (healthy) or high‐risk cell populations, and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)‐derived cardiomyocytes. In each assay, concentration‐response curves encompassing and exceeding therapeutic free plasma levels were generated. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine showed blocking activity against some potassium, sodium and calcium currents. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibited I(Kr) (IC(50): 1µM and 3‐7µM, respectively) and I(K1) currents (IC(50): 5 and 44µM, respectively). When combining hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, no synergistic effects were observed. The two macrolides had no or very weak effects on the ion currents (IC(50)>300‐1000µM). Using Virtual Assay(®), both antimalarials affected several TdP indicators, chloroquine being more potent than hydroxychloroquine. Effects were more pronounced in the high‐risk cell population. In hiPSC‐derived cardiomyocytes, all drugs showed early‐after‐depolarizations, except azithromycin. Combining chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide did not aggravate their effects. In conclusion, our integrated nonclinical CiPA dataset confirmed that, at therapeutic plasma concentrations relevant for malaria or off‐label use in COVID‐19, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use is associated with a proarrhythmia risk, which is higher in populations carrying predisposing factors but not worsened with macrolide combination.","Delaunois, Annie; Abernathy, Matthew; Anderson, Warren D.; Beattie, Kylie A.; Chaudhary, Khuram W.; Coulot, Julie; Gryshkova, Vitalina; Hebeisen, Simon; Holbrook, Mark; Kramer, James; Kuryshev, Yuri; Leishman, Derek; Lushbough, Isabel; Passini, Elisa; Redfern, Will S.; Rodriguez, Blanca; Rossman, Eric I.; Trovato, Cristian; Wu, Caiyun; Valentin, Jean‐Pierre",Clin Transl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33620150/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.13011,510

At the primary prevention level, several lines of evidence support that physical activity is an immune system adjuvant in combating infectious diseases. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that regular physical activity is associated with a reduced risk for COVID-19, similar to what has been reported for other respiratory infections. Although specific COVID-19-related studies are needed, data from investigations with other types of infectious agents, such as influenza, support the potential role of physical activity in augmenting COVID-19 vaccine efficacy (secondary prevention level). There is a growing awareness that COVID-19 can cause sustained morbidity in some patients, and physical training and rehabilitation (tertiary prevention level) can be directed toward improvement in physical fitness, quality of life, and immune health.","Nieman, David C",Curr Sports Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357885/; https://doi.org/10.1249/jsr.0000000000000867,510

Here, we report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of a family cluster with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the family cluster, a 32-year-old male (case 1) and a 53-year-old female (case 2, the mother-in-law of case 1) exhibited clinical symptoms of COVID-19, while case 1's 32-year-old wife (case 3) and their 11-month-old daughter (case 4) were both asymptomatic. Notably, case 4's nasopharyngeal swab samples was negative for nearly 80 days, and her immune system has been boosted for at least 57 days, but the fecal samples have tested positive for 100 days (May 13, 2020), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may invade enterocytes and may exist in individuals with low antiviral immunity for a long term.

However, little is known about its pathological mechanism, and there are still no clinical study reports on specific treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy on COVID-19. Methods In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, adult critical COVID-19 patients (including severe type and critical type, according to the clinical classification defined by National Health Commission of China) in 8 government designated treatment center in China from Dec 23, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020 were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, prognosis were extracted from electronic medical records, and IVIG was exposure factor. Primary outcomes were the 28 days and 60 days mortality, and secondary outcomes were the total length of in-hospital and the total duration of the disease. Meanwhile, the parameters of inflammation response and organ function were detected. The risk factors were determined by COX proportional hazards model. The subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification of COVID-19, IVIG dosage and timing. Findings 325patients were included in this study, of whom 222 (68%) were severe type, 103 (32%) were critical type. 42 (13%) died in 28 days within hospitalization, total 54 (17%) died in 60 days, and 6 (3%) died in severe type, 48 (47%) died in critical type. 174 cases were used IVIG, and 151 cases were not. Compared with the baseline characteristics between two groups, the results showed that the patients in IVIG group had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHII) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, IL-6 and lactate level, lower lymphocyte count and oxygenation index (all P<0.05). The 28 day and 60 day mortality did not improve with IVIG in overall patients. The in-hospital stay and the total duration of disease were longer in IVIG group (p<0.001). Risk factors were clinical classification (hazards ratio 0.126, 95% confidence interval 0.039-0.413, P=0.001), and using IVIG (hazards ratio 0.252, 95% confidence interval 0.107-0.591, P=0.002) with COX regression. Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28 day mortality, decrease the inflammatory response and improve some organ functions (all p<0.05), and 60-day mortality reduced significantly by using IVIG in the early stage (admission[≤]7 days) and with high dose (>15 g/d). Interpretation Early and high dose of IVIG therapy may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients only in critical type, which provides the clinical basis for the choice of treatment population and method of IVIG therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study aimed to assess the predictors of in-hospital mortality of elderly patients with moderate to severe TBI who presented during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: In this retrospective analytical study, all elderly patients with moderate to severe TBI who were referred to our center between March 2nd, 2020 to August 1st, 2020 were investigated and compared against the TBI patients receiving treatment during the same time period within the year 2019. Patients were followed until discharge from the hospital or death. The demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory test data were evaluated. Data were analyzed using SPSS-21 software. FINDINGS: In this study, 359 elderly patients were evaluated (n = 162, Post-COVID-19). Fifty-four patients of the cohort had COVID-19 disease with a mortality rate was 33.3%. The patients with COVID-19 were 5.45 times more likely to expire before discharge (P < 0.001) than the TBI patients who were not COVID-19 positive. Other variables such as hypotension (OR, 4.57P < 0.001), hyperglycemia (OR, 2.39, P = 0.002), and use of anticoagulant drugs (OR, 2.41P = 0.001) were also associated with in-hospital death.

The patient was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection by a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test. Three months after his clinic visit, he had regained most of his pre-COVID-19 level of health. However, qRT-PCR tests continued to be positive. At day 111, specimens from a nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were inoculated into VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.(1) Three to five days post-inoculation, cytopathic effects were observed, and viral RNA was detected in the culture supernatant by qRT-PCR (Ct values: 29–37). The culture supernatant of the VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells cocultured with the nasopharyngeal swab was passaged to the fresh VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, and after 3 days of the passage, cytopathic effect was observed again. In the supernatant of the passaged cell culture, viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR (Ct value: 29). By sequencing the qRT-PCR product using Illumina iSEQ100, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was verified. These results indicate the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal specimen even at day 111. Although SARS-CoV-2 was present, the patient developed neutralizing antibodies by a microtiter method. We tested but did not isolate SARS-CoV-2 in samples of saliva, urine, blood, or stool.

This study examines health inequality by SES amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its underlying mechanisms in Wuhan, China’s epicenter. Using survey data collected in the city during the lockdown period from February 20 to March 6, 2020, we identify two ways in which SES shapes health inequalities—vulnerability and resilience to COVID-19. First, higher SES is associated with a lower risk of infection for both survey respondents and their family members. Second, higher SES reduces mental distress during the pandemic, and this protective effect is particularly strong for individuals who contract the virus or who have family members infected with the disease. Mediation analysis further illustrates that SES shapes the risk of infection and mental distress primarily through three channels: access to daily essential and protective supplies, employment status, and the community environment. These findings lend support to the fundamental cause theory that links socioeconomic differentials to health inequality in a unique context. The outbreak of COVID-19 magnifies pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities.","Wu, Xiaogang; Li, Xiaoguang; Lu, Yao; Hout, Michael",Res Soc Stratif Mobil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562421000044?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0276562421000044; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2021.100584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612911/,510

Data published thus far indicate that spirometric indices appear to be generally well preserved, but that a defect in diffusing capacity (DLco) is a prevalent abnormality identified on follow-up lung function; present in 20-30% of those with mild to moderate disease and 60% in those with severe disease. Reductions in total lung capacity were commonly reported. Functional capacity is also often impaired, with data now starting to emerge detailing walk test and cardiopulmonary exercise test outcome at follow-up.

681763,Victimes du Covid-19: être ou ne pas être,2020-05-19,"Having a trusted and useful system that helps to diminish the risk of medical errors and facilitate the improvement of quality in the medical education is indispensable. Thousands of surgical errors are occurred annually with high adverse event rate, despite inordinate number of devised patients safety initiatives. Inadvertently or otherwise, surgeons play a critical role in the aforementioned errors. Training surgeons is one of the most crucial and delicate parts of medical education and needs more attention due to its practical intrinsic. In contrast to engineering, dealing with mortal alive creatures provides a minuscule chance of trial and error for trainees. Training in operative rooms, on the other hand, is extremely expensive in terms of not only equipment but also hiring professional trainers. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused to establish initiatives such as social distancing in order to mitigate the rate of outbreak. This leads surgeons to postpone some non-urgent surgeries or operate with restrictions in terms of safety. Subsequently, educational systems are affected by the limitations due to the pandemic. Skill transfer systems in cooperation with a virtual training environment is thought as a solution to address aforesaid issues. This enables not only novice surgeons to enrich their proficiency but also helps expert surgeons to be supervised during the operation. This paper focuses on devising a solution based on deep leaning algorithms to model the behavior of experts during the operation. In other words, the proposed solution is a skill transfer method that learns professional demonstrations using different effective factors from the body of experts. The trained model then provides a real-time haptic guidance signal for either instructing trainees or supervising expert surgeons. A simulation is utilized to emulate an operating room for femur drilling surgery, which is a common invasive treatment for osteoporosis. This helps us with both collecting the essential data and assessing the obtained models. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of emitting guidance force haptic signal with an acceptable error rate.","Fekri, Pedram; Dargahi, Javad; Zadeh, Mehrdad",Front Robot AI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33553246/; https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2020.586707,510

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes lung infection, gastrointestinal symptoms described in COVID-19 patients and detection of the viral RNA in feces of infected patients drove attentions to a possible fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. However, not only the viral RNA but also the infectious viral particles are required for the viral infection and no proof has been demonstrated the transmission of the infectious virus particles via the fecal-oral route yet. Growing evidence indicates the crosstalk between gut microbiota and lung, that maintains host homeostasis and disease development with the association of immune system. This gut-lung interaction may influence the COVID-19 severity in patients with extrapulmonary conditions. Severity of COVID-19 has mostly associated with old ages and underlying medical conditions. Since the diversity in the gut microbiota decreases during aging, dysbiosis could be the reason for older adults being at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. We believe that gut microbiota contributes to the course of COVID-19 due to its bidirectional relationship with immune system and lung. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota results in gut permeability leading to secondary infection and multiple organ failure. Conversely, disruption of the gut barrier integrity due to dysbiosis may lead to translocation of SARS-CoV-2 from the lung into the intestinal lumen via circulatory and lymphatic system. This review points out the role of dysbiosis of the gut microbiota involving in sepsis, on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, this review aims to clarify the ambiguity in fecal-oral transmission of SARS- CoV-2.","AKTAS, Busra; ASLIM, Belma",Turk J Biol,https://doi.org/10.3906/biy-2005-102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595361/,510

This situation may influence current medical and health-related students’ decision on the choices of their future careers. Hence, this study investigated the impact of COVID-19 on their future career intentions. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study that included medical and health-related students from three universities between October 2020 and January 2021. The study questionnaire was divided into two main sections: Section 1, which comprised students’ basic information. And section 2 focused mainly on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on students’ professional intentions. The chi-squared χ(2) test was used to compare the responses before and after the pandemic outbreak among Chinese and non-Chinese students. RESULTS: In overall, 1253 students completed the questionnaires. The responses showed that the number of students who preferred clinical medicine, public health, pharmacy and oral medicine increased significantly after the pandemic outbreak. In contrast, the number of students who chose nursing and medical technology decreased significantly. The change mainly occurred in Chinese students, predominantly females. Half of students (50.35%) were more willing to engage in medical and health work after completing their current program. Also, 36.39% of students felt that knowledge was too limited in the pandemic’s face and would like to continue studying after graduation to gain more knowledge. Due to the pandemic, 34.18% of students would like a future workplace near their hometown, and 19.63% preferred to work in urban areas. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak impacted current medical and health-related students’ career planning on their future workplaces and employment time choices. Additionally, the pandemic influenced the intention of Chinese students in choosing their future careers. This study provided the basis for the policymaking, specialty setting of colleges and supplied the medical health department’s talent reserve information.","Gong, Zheng; Li, Wen; Bu, Huimin; He, Mingyu; Hou, Hongjian; Ma, Tongtong; Hu, Xide; Fu, Lu; Adu-Amankwaah, Joseph; Sun, Hong",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02922-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34503514/,510

We introduce a novel approach to calculate the transfer rate from the free environment to the isolated environment, and we incorporate into the model the fact that many individuals were misdiagnosed as SARS suspected and hence were mistakenly put in the isolated environment due to lack of fast and effective SARS diagnostic tests. We develop some methods for the parameter identification using the daily reported data from the Ministry of Health of China. Simulations based on these parameters agree with the accural data well, thus provide additional validation of the model. We then vary some parameters to assess the effectiveness of different control measures: these new parameters correspond to the situation when the quarantine measures in the free-environment were prematurely relaxed (we thus observe the second outbreak with the maximal number of daily SARS patients much higher than the first outbreak) or when the quarantine time of SARS patients is postponed (we observe delayed peak time but with much higher number of SARS patients at the peak).

We studied the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 on a group and individual level in intubated ICU patients. METHODS: In a cohort of 86 patients, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal and sputum samples (obtained as part of clinical care twice a week) according to time after intubation. Subsequently, we performed survival analyses. RESULTS: 870 samples were tested by RT-PCR. Overall viral load was highest in the first week (median nasopharynx 3.1, IQR 1.4–4.0; median sputum 4.0, IQR 3.1–5.2) and decreased over time. In 19% of patients a relapsing pattern was observed. Nasopharyngeal and sputum PCR status on day 14 was not significantly associated with survival up to day 60 in this small cohort. CONCLUSION: In general SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in respiratory samples in patients with severe COVID-19 decrease after the first week after intubation, but individual SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels can show a relapsing pattern. Larger studies are needed to address the association of clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory samples with survival, because we observed a trend towards better survival in patients with early clearance from sputum.","Boef, Anna G.C.; van Wezel, Esther M.; Gard, Lilli; Netkova, Kala; Lokate, Mariëtte; van der Voort, Peter H.J.; Niesters, Hubert G.M.; Buter, Coretta Van Leer",J Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2021.04.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088394412100071X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023553/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088394412100071X,510

Currently, there is no specific developed drug against COVID-19 and the challenge of developing effective antiviral strategies based on natural agents with different mechanisms of action becomes an urgent need and requires identification of genetic differences among variants. Such data is used to improve therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 variants. Nature is known to offer many biotherapeutics from animal venoms, algae and plant that have been historically used in traditional medicine. Among these bioresources, snake venom displays many bioactivities of interest such as antiviral, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antitumoral. COVID-19 is a viral respiratory sickness due to SARS-CoV-2 which induces thrombotic disorders due to cytokine storm, platelet hyperactivation and endothelial dysfunction.

In fact, a very high number of patients with COVID-19 die because of thromboembolic causes. A role of plasminogen, as precursor of fibrinolysis, has been hypothesized. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between plasminogen levels and COVID-19-related outcomes in a population of 55 infected Caucasian patients (mean age: 69.8 ± 14.3, 41.8% female). Low levels of plasminogen were significantly associated with inflammatory markers (CRP, PCT, and IL-6), markers of coagulation (D-dimer, INR, and APTT), and markers of organ dysfunctions (high fasting blood glucose and decrease in the glomerular filtration rate). A multidimensional analysis model, including the correlation of the expression of coagulation with inflammatory parameters, indicated that plasminogen tended to cluster together with IL-6, hence suggesting a common pathway of activation during disease’s complication. Moreover, low levels of plasminogen strongly correlated with mortality in COVID-19 patients even after multiple adjustments for presence of confounding. These data suggest that plasminogen may play a pivotal role in controlling the complex mechanisms beyond the COVID-19 complications, and may be useful both as biomarker for prognosis and for therapeutic target against this extremely aggressive infection.","Della-Morte, David; Pacifici, Francesca; Ricordi, Camillo; Massoud, Renato; Rovella, Valentina; Proietti, Stefania; Iozzo, Mariannina; Lauro, Davide; Bernardini, Sergio; Bonassi, Stefano; Di Daniele, Nicola",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354045/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-04070-3,510

OBJECTIVE: To examine how medication-, dietary supplement- and health-related behaviors, beliefs and other psychological constructs changed in Polish online health service users during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: A one-time online survey accessed through a health service website was completed before and during the pandemic lockdown by separate samples of respondents. The survey examined beliefs about medicines and dietary supplements, consumption of dietary supplements, trust and contact with their advertisements, sources of dietary supplement knowledge as well as perceived health, diet, physical activity and smoking, among other things. RESULTS: The study included 1560 participants. Most examined outcomes remained unchanged over COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Beliefs that the dietary supplement quality is well controlled became significantly more pronounced during the lockdown (adjusted ratio of estimates 1.16, 95%CI 1.06-1.27, p=0.001).

Phys Ther. 2020;100:1260–1264",2020-09-25,"The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with new phenotypic properties is a critical challenge to the control of the ongoing pandemic. B.1.1.7 was monitored in the UK through routine testing and S-gene target failures (SGTF), comprising over 90% of cases by March 2021. Now, the reverse is occurring: SGTF cases are being replaced by an S-gene positive variant, which we associate with B.1.617.2. Evidence from the characteristics of S-gene positive cases demonstrates that, following importation, B.1.617.2 is transmitted locally, growing at a rate higher than B.1.1.7 and a doubling time between 5-14 days. S-gene positive cases should be prioritised for sequencing and aggressive control in any countries in which this variant is newly detected.","Challen, R.; Dyson, L.; Overton, C.; Guzman-Rincon, L.; Hill, E.; Stage, H.; Brooks-Pollock, E.; Pellis, L.; Scarabel, F.; Pascall, D.

690311,Being pregnant in the COVID‐19 pandemic: Effects on the placenta in all aspects,2021-02-15,"The ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has resulted in rapid surges of critically ill patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pneumonia presenting to the emergency department (ED) and requiring ICU admission nationwide. Despite adaptations in critical care personnel staffing, bed availability and supply provision, many inpatient ICUs have become acutely crowded, leading to boarding of critically ill patients with COVID‐19 and other diseases in the ED. To address this scenario at our urban, safety net, tertiary care institution in the spring of 2020, we designed and implemented a temporary “emergency department‐intensive care unit” (ED‐ICU) patient care service. Critical care‐trained emergency physicians took call and came into the hospital overnight/on weekends to provide bedside treatment to admitted ICU patients boarding for prolonged periods in our ED. In this manuscript, we describe the creation and execution of the ED‐ICU service and the characteristics and management of the patients who received care under this model.","Drumheller, Byron C.; Mareiniss, Darren P.; Overberger, Ryan C.; Sabolick, Erin E.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33363286/,510
