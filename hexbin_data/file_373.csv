2790,2790,2790,Dysregulation of pulmonary endothelial protein C receptor and thrombomodulin in severe falciparum malaria-associated ARDS relevant to hemozoin,17.306822,8.768117,2017-07-21,"To investigate the role of the protein C system, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and thrombomodulin (TM) in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in relation to hemozoin and proinflammatory cytokines-induced type II pneumocyte injury and -aggravated pulmonary resolution. A total of 29 left-over lung specimens that were obtained from patients who died from severe falciparum malaria were examined. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that ARDS coexisted with pulmonary edema and systemic bleeding; the severity was dependent on the level of hemozoin deposition in the lung and internal alveolar hemorrhaging. The loss of EPCR and TM was primarily identified in ARDS patients and was related to the level of hemozoin, parasitized red blood cell (PRBC) and white blood cell accumulation in the lung. Moreover, an in vitro analysis demonstrated that interleukin-13 and -31 and hemozoin induced pneumocytic cell injury and apoptosis, as assessed by EB/AO staining, electron microscopy and the up-regulation of CARD-9 mRNA (caspase recruitment domain-9 messenger-ribonucleic acid). The dysregulation of EPCR and TM in the lung, especially in those with increased levels of hemozoin, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ARDS through an apoptotic pathway.","Maknitikul, Sitang; Luplertlop, Natthanej; Grau, Georges E.

4381,4381,4381,Effects of inhaled nitric oxide for postoperative hypoxemia in acute type A aortic dissection: a retrospective observational study,17.28331,8.638699,2020-01-22,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative hypoxemia in acute type A aortic dissection (AADA) is a common complication and is associated with negative outcomes. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of low-dose (5–10 ppm) inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in the management of hypoxemia after AADA surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, Medical records of patients who underwent AADA surgery at two institutions between January 2015 and January 2018 were collected. Patients with postoperative hypoxemia were classified as iNO and control groups. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared using a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Among 436 patients who underwent surgical repair, 187 (42.9%) had hypoxemia and 43 were treated with low-dose iNO. After PSM, patients were included in the iNO treatment (n = 40) and PSM control (n = 94) groups in a 1:3 ratio. iNO ameliorated hypoxemia at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation, and shortened the durations of ventilator support (39.0 h (31.3–47.8) vs. 69.0 h (47.8–110.3), p < 0.001) and ICU stay (122.0 h (80.8–155.0) vs 179.5 h (114.0–258.0), p < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in mortality, complications, or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that low-dose iNO improved oxygenation in patients with hypoxemia after AADA surgery and shortened the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. No significant side effects or increase in postoperative mortality or morbidities were observed with iNO treatment. These findings warrant a randomized multicenter controlled trial to assess the exact efficiency of iNO for hypoxemia after AADA.","Zhang, Hang; Liu, Yaoyang; Meng, Xiangdong; Yang, Dicheng; Shi, Sheng; Liu, Jian; Yuan, Zhongxiang; Gu, Tongtong; Han, Lin; Lu, Fanglin; Xu, Zhiyun; Liu, Yang; Yu, Min",J Cardiothorac Surg,373,1

Twenty-six recipients undergoing ABO-I LDLT and 92 undergoing ABO-compatible (ABO-C) LDLT were classified into three groups according to preoperative proportion of CD8 T(+) cells: naive-dominant (group I), effector memory-dominant (group II), and effector-dominant (group III) recipients. The clinical courses were analyzed. The results showed that in ABO-C groups I and II and in ABO-I group I, effector cells remained above the pretransplant levels after tacrolimus administration. However, in ABO-C group III and ABO-I groups II and III, effector cells were down-regulated for a prolonged period, along with markedly decreased perforin expression and frequent life-threatening complications. ABO-I group II and group III recipients had higher infection rates. It was concluded that recipients with preexisting high effector CD8 T(+) cells are unfavorable candidates for ABO-I LDLT.","Egawa, Hiroto; Ozawa, Kazue; Takada, Yasutsugu; Teramukai, Satoshi; Mori, Akira; Kasahara, Mureo; Ogawa, Kohei; Ogura, Yasuhiro; Oike, Fumitaka; Kaido, Toshimi; Ono, Masako; Sato, Hiroshi; Takai, Kenji; Uemoto, Shinji",Dig Dis Sci,373,22

If not cleared, apoptotic neutrophils are postulated to release histotoxic granular contents. Since numerous cellular proteins are degraded during apoptosis, we sought to determine whether functional serine proteinases are indeed released by apoptosing neutrophils in vitro. In a coculture system, cytokine-activated neutrophils induced detachment in the human epithelial cell line, A549. This process was CD18- and serine proteinase-dependent. Early apoptotic neutrophils induced significant detachment, but live, senescent, resting neutrophils and terminal, secondary necrotic neutrophils had a different effect. This detachment process was CD18-independent but serine proteinase-dependent. Similarly, detachment occurred with primary human small airway epithelial cells. Notably, epithelial cell detachment correlated with the transition of early apoptotic neutrophils to secondary necrosis and with the accumulation of elastase in the supernatant. The membrane integrity of lung epithelial cells was damaged in advance of significant cell detachment. These observations suggest that not only live activated neutrophils but also apoptosing neutrophils can reveal functional elastase activities. Furthermore, the rapidity of the transition emphasizes the importance of the prompt clearance of apoptotic neutrophils before they progress to secondary necrosis at the site of lung inflammation.","Liu, Chien-Ying; Liu, Yun-Hen; Lin, Shu-Min; Yu, Chih-Ten; Wang, Chun-Hua; Lin, Horng-Chyuan; Lin, Chien-Huang; Kuo, Han-Pin",J Biomed Sci,373,22

This study aimed to describe the resource consumption and characteristics of long-stay patients in a PICU. METHODS: This was a single-center descriptive cohort study of 1309 patients admitted to a PICU in 2017. The main outcome was ICU length of stay (LOS). Patients were divided into prolonged LOS (PLS) and non-PLS groups if they had an LOS of ≥ 28 or < 28 days, respectively. Two groups were compared to characterize PLS. RESULTS: Thirty-two (2.4%) patients had a PLS and utilized 33% of PICU bed days. Factors associated with PLS with odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] were being a neonate (7.8 [2.5–25.4], p = <0.001), being an infant (2.9 [1.0–9.0], p = 0.04), admission for a respiratory ailment (7.3 [1.6–44.2], p = 0.003), cardiovascular dysfunction (24.1 [4.8–152.1], p = <0.001), post-cardiac operation (8.0 [1.7–50.1], p = 0.003), post-cardiopulmonary arrest (22.8 [1.7–211.9], p = 0.01), and transfer from another facility (4.2 [1.8–10.7], p = 0.001). PLS patients developed more nosocomial infections and disproportionately received monitoring and therapeutic resources. CONCLUSIONS: A PLS was associated with substantial PICU utilization and complication rates. Future studies should aim to alleviate both institutional and patient-related issues in the affected population harboring possible risk factors for PLS.","Miura, S.; Fukushima, M.; Kurosawa, H.; Kimura, S.",Z Gesundh Wiss,373,1

Similarly, there has been a resurgence of interest in motor aspects of the neurodevelopmental disorder of schizophrenia, including spontaneous parkinsonism that appears to be independent of antipsychotic treatment. This review first addresses the clinical and nosological challenges of these superficially paradoxical insights and then considers pathobiological challenges. It proposes that diverse modes of disturbance to one or more element(s) in a cortical-striatal-thalamocortical neuronal network, whether neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental, can result in movement disorder, psychosis or both. It then proposes that time- and site-dependent dysfunction in such a neuronal network may be a generic substrate for the emergence of psychosis not only in Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders but also in other neuropsychiatric disorders in which psychosis, and sometimes movement disorders, can be encountered; these include substance abuse, cerebrovascular disease, cerebral trauma, cerebral neoplasia, epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis.","Waddington, John L.",Acta Pharmacol Sin,373,1
14177,14177,14177,Effect of home-based high-intensity interval training using telerehabilitation among coronary heart disease patients,17.632372,8.711015,2020-11-20,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a devastating CNS infection caused by JC virus (JCV), a polyomavirus that commonly establishes persistent, asymptomatic infection in the general population. Emerging evidence that PML can be ameliorated with novel immunotherapeutic approaches calls for reassessment of PML pathophysiology and clinical course. PML results from JCV reactivation in the setting of impaired cellular immunity, and no antiviral therapies are available, so survival depends on reversal of the underlying immunosuppression. Antiretroviral therapies greatly reduce the risk of HIV-related PML, but many modern treatments for cancers, organ transplantation and chronic inflammatory disease cause immunosuppression that can be difficult to reverse. These treatments — most notably natalizumab for multiple sclerosis — have led to a surge of iatrogenic PML. The spectrum of presentations of JCV-related disease has evolved over time and may challenge current diagnostic criteria. Immunotherapeutic interventions, such as use of checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell transfer, have shown promise but caution is needed in the management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, an exuberant immune response that can contribute to morbidity and death. Many people who survive PML are left with neurological sequelae and some with persistent, low-level viral replication in the CNS. As the number of people who survive PML increases, this lack of viral clearance could create challenges in the subsequent management of some underlying diseases.","Cortese, Irene; Reich, Daniel S.; Nath, Avindra",Nat Rev Neurol,373,19

This paper presents the results of the study of protection of the vaccine using on guinea pigs, including various options of administering, dose and frequency. Provided data of the novel vaccine candidate will contribute to its further movement into the preclinical stage study. METHODS: General states of guinea pigs was assessed based on behavior and dynamics of a guinea pig weight-gain test. The effectiveness of the new anti-brucellosis vector vaccine was determined by studying its protective effect after conjunctival, intranasal and sublingual administration in doses 10(5) EID(50), 10(6) EID(50) and 10(7) EID(50) during prime and boost vaccinations of animals, followed by challenge with a virulent strain of B. melitensis 16 M infection. For sake of comparison, the commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine was used as a control. The protective properties of vaccines were assessed by quantitation of Brucella colonization in organs and tissues of infected animals and compared to the control groups. RESULTS: It was observed a gradual increase in body weight of guinea pigs after prime and booster immunization with the vaccine using conjunctival, intranasal and sublingual routes of administration, as well as after using various doses of vaccine. The most optimal way of using the vaccine has been established: double intranasal immunization of guinea pigs at a dose of 10(6) EID(50), which provides 80% protection of guinea pigs from B. melitensis 16 M infection (P < 0.05), which is comparable to the results of the effectiveness of the commercial B. melitensis Rev.1 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: We developed effective human vaccine candidate against brucellosis and developed its immunization protocol in guinea pig model. We believe that because of these studies, the proposed vaccine has achieved the best level of protection, which in turn provides a basis for its further promotion.

We investigated whether out-group animosity was particularly successful at generating engagement on two of the largest social media platforms: Facebook and Twitter. Analyzing posts from news media accounts and US congressional members (n = 2,730,215), we found that posts about the political out-group were shared or retweeted about twice as often as posts about the in-group. Each individual term referring to the political out-group increased the odds of a social media post being shared by 67%. Out-group language consistently emerged as the strongest predictor of shares and retweets: the average effect size of out-group language was about 4.8 times as strong as that of negative affect language and about 6.7 times as strong as that of moral-emotional language—both established predictors of social media engagement. Language about the out-group was a very strong predictor of “angry” reactions (the most popular reactions across all datasets), and language about the in-group was a strong predictor of “love” reactions, reflecting in-group favoritism and out-group derogation. This out-group effect was not moderated by political orientation or social media platform, but stronger effects were found among political leaders than among news media accounts. In sum, out-group language is the strongest predictor of social media engagement across all relevant predictors measured, suggesting that social media may be creating perverse incentives for content expressing out-group animosity.","Rathje, Steve; Van Bavel, Jay J.; van der Linden, Sander",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,373,1

As a result, federated networks have arisen, which allow simultaneously querying medical databases at a group of connected institutions. The most basic such query is the aggregate count—e.g. How many patients have diabetes? However, depending on the protocol used to estimate that total, there is always a tradeoff in the accuracy of the estimate against the risk of leaking confidential data. Prior work has shown that it is possible to empirically control that tradeoff by using the HyperLogLog (HLL) probabilistic sketch.

More recent studies have also deep-sequenced longitudinal viral samples originating from experimental challenges to gain a better understanding of how these viruses may evolve in vivo and between transmission events. These studies have often identified nucleotide variants that can replicate more efficiently within hosts and also transmit more effectively between hosts. Quantifying the degree to which a mutation impacts viral fitness within a host can improve identification of variants that are of particular epidemiological concern and our ability to anticipate viral adaptation at the population level. While methods have been developed to quantify the fitness effects of mutations using observed changes in allele frequencies over the course of a host’s infection, none of the existing methods account for the possibility of cellular coinfection. Here, we develop mathematical models to project variant allele frequency changes in the context of cellular coinfection and, further, integrate these models with statistical inference approaches to demonstrate how variant fitness can be estimated alongside cellular multiplicity of infection. We apply our approaches to empirical longitudinally sampled H5N1 sequence data from ferrets. Our results indicate that previous studies may have significantly underestimated the within-host fitness advantage of viral variants. These findings underscore the importance of considering the process of cellular coinfection when studying within-host viral evolutionary dynamics.","Zhu, Huisheng; Allman, Brent E.; Koelle, Katia",Viruses,373,1

This study was performed with the aim to develop and validate a novel scoring model to predict mortality risk in HIV-infected patients with CM (HIV/CM). METHODS: Data on HIV/CM inpatients were obtained from a Multicenter Cohort study in China. Independent risk factors associated with mortality were identified based on data from 2013 to 2017, and a novel scoring model for mortality risk prediction was established. The bootstrapping statistical method was used for internal validation. External validation was performed using data from 2018 to 2020. RESULTS: We found that six predictors, including age, stiff neck, impaired consciousness, intracranial pressure, CD4(+) T-cell count, and urea levels, were associated with poor prognosis in HIV/CM patients. The novel scoring model could effectively identify HIV/CM patients at high risk of death on admission (area under curve 0.876; p<0.001). When the cut-off value of 5.5 points or more was applied, the sensitivity and specificity was 74.1 and 83.8%, respectively. Our scoring model showed a good discriminatory ability, with an area under the curve of 0.879 for internal validation via bootstrapping, and an area under the curve of 0.886 for external validation. CONCLUSIONS: Our developed scoring model of six variables is simple, convenient, and accurate for screening high-risk patients with HIV/CM, which may be a useful tool for physicians to assess prognosis in HIV/CM inpatients.","Zhao, Ting; Xu, Xiao-Lei; Nie, Jing-Min; Chen, Xiao-Hong; Jiang, Zhong-Sheng; Liu, Shui-Qing; Yang, Tong-Tong; Yang, Xuan; Sun, Feng; Lu, Yan-Qiu; Harypursat, Vijay; Chen, Yao-Kai",BMC Infect Dis,373,17

In patients with septic shock, treatment with antibiotics and vasopressors are recommended to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mm Hg and lactate < 2 mmol/L. Because of the lack of effectiveness and possible adverse effects, routine corticosteroids should be avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and septic shock in whom fluids and vasopressors do not restore hemodynamic stability). There is currently no sufficient evidence of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, remdesivir, and other antivirals in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Limited evidence shows that COVID-19 convalescent plasma can be used as a treatment of COVID-19 without the occurrence of severe adverse events. Drug regulatory agencies granted an emergency-use authorization of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir to treat patients when a clinical trial is not available or participation is not feasible. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with QT interval prolongation and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Guidelines are issued for use of convalescent plasma in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19. Data from several ongoing randomized controlled trials will provide further evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Jha, Ashish K.; Kumar, Ravikant; Goenka, Mahesh K.; Dayal, Vishwa M.",,373,31

The automatic detection of bugs or, even better, verification of their absence is thus most desirable, yet the size of the network and the complexity of the controller makes this a challenging undertaking. In this paper, we propose MOCS, a highly expressive, optimised SDN model that allows capturing subtle real-world bugs, in a reasonable amount of time. This is achieved by (1) analysing the model for possible partial order reductions, (2) statically pre-computing packet equivalence classes and (3) indexing packets and rules that exist in the model. We demonstrate its superiority compared to the state of the art in terms of expressivity, by providing examples of realistic bugs that a prototype implementation of MOCS in Uppaal caught, and performance/scalability, by running examples on various sizes of network topologies, highlighting the importance of our abstractions and optimisations.","Klimis, Vasileios; Parisis, George; Reus, Bernhard",Computer Aided Verification,373,31

Symmetry transformations map any solution of the system to another solution. We show that this property can be used to transform cached reachsets to compute new reachsets, for hybrid and multi-agent models. We develop a notion of a virtual system which defines symmetry transformations for a broad class of agent models that visit waypoint sequences. Using this notion of a virtual system, we present a prototype tool CacheReach that builds a cache of reachsets, in a way that is agnostic of the representation of the reachsets and the reachability analysis method used. Our experimental evaluation of CacheReach shows up to 64% savings in safety verification computation time on multi-agent systems with 3-dimensional linear and 4-dimensional nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft models following sequences of waypoints. These savings and our theoretical results illustrate the potential benefits of using symmetry-based caching in the safety verification of multi-agent systems.","Sibai, Hussein; Mokhlesi, Navid; Fan, Chuchu; Mitra, Sayan",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,373,33

They are important for increasing community awareness of health behavior changes. In the application of health promotion, social marketing can be used to influence changes in individual behavior. Social marketing encourages the social behavioral change of the target audience. This social behavioral change refers to the behavior of a certain number of target audiences, not just individual behavior. This research identified various social marketing success criteria to improve the performance of health promotion using decision-making method. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) is a structural causal relation method that has been verified effectual in congregating the viewpoints of professionals and thus providing information of greater reliability in various areas. F-DEMATEL method helps to identify the core problems and direction of improvement in complex systems by quantifying the degree to which criteria attributes interact with each other. This research applied F-DEMATEL to evaluate the complex interrelation success criteria of social marketing in order to effectively implement health promotion. Several effective criteria were derived from this research. These influential criteria are “Designing effective Communication message”, “Meeting the needs of beneficiaries”, “Providing more benefit than cost”, “Marketing mix elements”, “Customer orientation”, “Organizational advantage” and “Market selection”. The practitioner must consider the needs of the recipients to accomplish a successful social marketing campaign in health promotion. Moreover, the practitioner also has to design an attractive message and marketing mix strategy to communicate the benefits of the behavioral change to the target audience. Besides, the message delivered by the known organization increases the success of social marketing in promoting healthy lifestyle. This study provides important information for the non-profit organization about selecting the significant criteria to lead to the success of the campaign.","Liao, Chi-Horng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,373,1

Matrix metalloproteinases-7 (Matrilysin), the smallest member of the MMP family also performs quite alike; thus serves as a potential candidate for anti-tumor immunotherapy. Conversely, being an endogenous tumor-associated antigen (TAA), targeting MMP-7 for immunization is challenging. But MMP-7-based xenovaccine can surmount the obstacle of poor immunogenicity and immunological tolerance, often encountered in TAA-based conventional vaccine for anti-tumor immunotherapy. This paves the way for investigating the potential of MMP-7-derived major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding peptides to elicit precise epitope-specific T-cell responses towards their possible inclusion in anti-tumor vaccine formulations. Perhaps it also ushers the path of achieving multiple epitope-based broad and universal cellular immunity. In current experiment, an immunoinformatics approach has been employed to identify the putative canine matrix matelloproteinases-7 (cMMP-7)-derived peptides with MHC class-I-binding motifs which can elicit potent antigen-specific immune responses in BALB/c mice. Immunization with the cMMP-7 DNA vaccine induced a strong CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Th1- type response, with high level of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production in BALB/c mice. The two identified putative MHC-I-binding nonameric peptides (Peptide(32-40) and Peptide(175-183)) from cMMP-7 induced significant lymphocyte proliferation along with the production of IFN-γ from CD8(+) T-cells in mice immunized with cMMP-7 DNA vaccine. The current observation has depicted the immunogenic potential of the two cMMP-7-derived nonapeptides for their possible exploitation in xenovaccine-mediated anti-tumor immunotherapy in mouse model.","Yadav, Pavan Kumar; Gupta, Shishir Kumar; Kumar, Saroj; Ghosh, Mayukh; Yadav, Brijesh Singh; Kumar, Dinesh; Kumar, Ajay; Saini, Mohini; Kataria, Meena",Mol Cell Biochem,373,1

Some experts think AI can reduce infection probability of medical staffs and improve medical efficiency, while opponents believe AI will increase unemployment and medical ethical crises. We try to answer the question: From public perspective, could AI replace human doctors? METHODS: According to occupational status and biological gender, we select four groups as respondents: on-job and retired men, on-job and retired women. We investigate their attitudes towards AI application in medical field. After collecting 400 anonymous questionnaires, we use sample statistics, ANOVA and cluster method (CFSFDP) to find out cognitive similarities and differences between different groups. RESULTS: Reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficient) and validity (KMO test) of questionnaires are 0.740 and 0.875 respectively. To the four groups, there are significant (p < 0.01) differences in answers of 7 questions but non-significant differences in the remaining 3 questions. By CFSFDP, questionnaires are automatically grouped into two clusters. Largest group in two clusters are on-job women and on-job men, respectively. Although 82.5% of respondents pay attention to news about AI, the overall average score for “public attitude to AI application in medical field” is 2.828 (full-score is 5.000), below neutral-score (3.000). CONCLUSIONS: To AI application in medical field, cognitive differences among different groups are in existence, especially between on-job men and women. But in general, the public held a negative attitude towards the AI application in medical field, and trust human doctors more. KEY MESSAGES: According to the survey, it seems that AI is lesser probability to replace human doctors in recent years. It is also necessary to consider the public attitudes when promoting medical AI.","Chen, Y Y; Li, Y; Li, C J",Eur J Public Health,373,16

This study aimed to correlate the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) temporal bone and intraoperative findings in the patients with the unsafe type of CSOM. METHODS: This prospective study included 50 patients (28 males: 22 females; mean age 24 ± 14 years) who presented with clinically suspected unsafe CSOM. All patients underwent HRCT of the temporal bone and subsequent surgical procedure. The intraoperative and histopathological findings were compared with HRCT findings. Descriptive statistics, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for HRCT were calculated. Student's t-test and Chi-square test were performed. RESULTS: Out of 50 patients, left, right, and bilateral ear involvement were seen in 42% (21/50), 38% (19/50), and 20% (10/50) patients, respectively. Ear discharge was the most common symptom (100%) followed by earache (66%), vertigo (16%), and tinnitus (14%), respectively. Cholesteatoma was reported in 82% (49/60) of ears on HRCT while histopathological and intraoperative evaluation confirmed the diagnosis in 40 out of 49 ears. In 18% (11/60) ears, the cholesteatoma was not diagnosed on HRCT evaluation; however, the intraoperative and histopathological assessment revealed cholesteatoma in six patients while the rest had granulation tissue. For detection of ossicular erosions, tegmen erosions, erosions of facial nerve canal, erosions of sigmoid sinus plate, and erosions of lateral/posterior semicircular canals; HRCT had high sensitivity (86.44%–100%) and specificity (93.33%–100%).

While there is little doubt about the existence of the bias, its magnitude varies across countries and investor groups. The home bias has to be regarded as a multifactorial phenomenon, a combination of numerous causes which all synergistically contribute. In contrast to other biases the home bias can at least partially be explained by reasons beyond irrational investor behaviour. While institutional restrictions play a minor role, informational asymmetries and superior information of domestic investors are important factors. Thus, the performance of investments may well benefit from a home bias, and the bias then no longer would be a puzzle but rather rational behaviour as a lower diversification level may lead to higher returns. The contemporary understanding of the home bias gains in relevance as the ongoing political debate in Germany has to clarify an institutional framework for long-run retirement savings plans of private households based on equity investments.","Gaar, Eduard; Scherer, David; Schiereck, Dirk",Manag Rev Q,373,1

This article argues that a deeper appreciation of these risks as complex—as opposed to complicated—is vital to an effective global governance response. It joins other IR scholarship seeking to invigorate a rigorous research agenda on complex system dynamics within world politics, highlighting the value of complexity theory, not simply as a contextual descriptor, but as a conceptual toolkit to inform CGCR governance research and action. Taking seriously the implications of “restricted complexity,” it interrogates why the legacy governing toolkit—the assumptions, heuristics, models, and practices conventionally employed to solve international collective action problems—are unlikely to suffice. It further draws laterally upon design science to offer a novel design model for governing complex systems, with broad application across global policy domains. A case study of the COVID-19 pandemic response illustrates the importance of supplementing inherited “complicated” governance system design and practices with design principles explicitly oriented to working with complexity, rather than against it. We contend that IR scholars and practitioners must update old ways of thinking in light of a complexification of the discipline. Such a shift involves both revisiting the design logics underlying how we build global governance structures, as well as pursuing a generative research agenda more capable of responding adequately to instability, surprise, and extraordinary change.","Kreienkamp, Julia; Pegram, Tom",,373,16

The average total incidence of billed office visits per outcome related to the outcomes were compared across groups (Relative Incidence of Office Visit (RIOV)). RIOV is shown to be more powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses. Full cohort, cumulative incidence analyses, matched for days of care, and matched for family history analyses were conducted across quantiles of vaccine uptake. Increased office visits related to many diagnoses were robust to days-of-care-matched analyses, family history, gender block, age block, and false discovery risk. Many outcomes had high RIOV odds ratios after matching for days-of-care (e.g., anemia (6.334), asthma (3.496), allergic rhinitis (6.479), and sinusitis (3.529), all significant under the Z-test). Developmental disorders were determined to be difficult to study due to extremely low prevalence in the practice, potentially attributable to high rates of vaccine cessation upon adverse events and family history of autoimmunity. Remarkably, zero of the 561 unvaccinated patients in the study had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to 0.063% of the (partially and fully) vaccinated. The implications of these results for the net public health effects of whole-population vaccination and with respect for informed consent on human health are compelling. Our results give agency to calls for research conducted by individuals who are independent of any funding sources related to the vaccine industry. While the low rates of developmental disorders prevented sufficiently powered hypothesis testing, it is notable that the overall rate of autism spectrum disorder (0.84%) in the cohort is half that of the US national rate (1.69%). The practice-wide rate of ADHD was roughly half of the national rate. The data indicate that unvaccinated children in the practice are not unhealthier than the vaccinated and indeed the overall results may indicate that the unvaccinated pediatric patients in this practice are healthier overall than the vaccinated.","Lyons-Weiler, James; Thomas, Paul",Int J Environ Res Public Health,373,22

Their unique role through the means of quantifying the definite magnitude of relative risk they contribute during hospitalization still requires further investigation. The aim of this study was to describe the impact of commonly used anti-infectives on the QT interval in hospitalized patients during the COVID-19 era. METHODS: Demographic information, medical history, laboratory data, medication administration history and ECG recording data was collected from the electronic records of adult patients admitted to two urban hospitals. A mixed effects approach with four sub-models for the QT interval comprised of: heart rate, circadian rhythm, gender, and the drug (regressed as the cumulative mg dose administered over time) and disease effects was used. Fixed and random effects with between occasion variability were estimated for the parameters with a Bayesian approach using the STAN software. RESULTS: Data from 2180 patients were used with baseline characteristics shown in Table 1. Observed vs. predicted plots based on the training (Figure 1.A) and validation data set (Figure 1.B) showed excellent fit. The parameters for QT(c0), α, gender, and circadian rhythm were identified within the range previously described (Table 2.). Similarly, the model correctly identified the impact of acute or chronic diseases on the QT interval. Model coefficient estimates [mean (95% CI) of 0.010 (0.006, 0.15) and 0.0045 (0.0013, 0.01100) msec/mg cumulative dose, respectively] suggest that patients treated with conventional regimens of fluconazole and levofloxacin are most likely to present with a QT interval increase > 5 msec, the cutoff threshold of regulatory concern.

The effects of digital confidence on both pandemic anxiety and COVID-19 comprehension persist, even after a broad range of potentially confounding factors are taken into account, including sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, metropolitan status, and partner status. They also remain discernable after the introduction of general anxiety, as well as income and education. These results offer evidence that the digitally disadvantaged experience greater vulnerability to the secondary effects of the pandemic in the form of increased somatized stress and decreased COVID-19 comprehension. Going forward, future research and policy must make an effort to address digital confidence and digital inequality writ large as crucial factors mediating individuals’ responses to the pandemic and future crises.","Robinson, Laura; Schulz, Jeremy; Wiborg, Øyvind N.; Johnston, Elisha",Am Behav Sci,373,0

But over the years, the all-pervading grasp of international human rights has not let the matter of citizenship go untouched as it has pondered over the issues of the right to nationality, statelessness, and dual citizenship due to the substantial human rights implications stemming from them. Although the decision of the Supreme Court of Liberia in the case of Alvin Teage Jalloh v Olubanke King-Akerele was based entirely on its constitutional norms, the findings of the Court reflect the stand of international law in this matter. Due to the massive legal, social, and political implications of the status of citizenship, the latter has been gradually gaining momentum in the realm of international law. Both Myanmar’s Nationality Law of 1982 and India’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) are shrouded in controversy due to their impact on the human rights of a considerable human population. The issue of the automatic loss of citizenship can snowball into a ‘leviathan’ in the contemporary politics of different states. The present case note looks into how this issue was handled by the Liberian Supreme Court and evaluates the decision on the scales of the established principles of international law.","Bashar, Arafat Ibnul",Jindal Global Law Review,373,25

Guidelines published by rheumatology, physiotherapy, orthopaedic and pain medicine societies have advised on the restricted use of corticosteroids for musculoskeletal and rheumatic conditions. For clinicians across the specialities there is a challenge to safely conducting best practice, yet ensuring patients have access to the significant functional benefits of steroid injections. METHODS: The STING prospective service evaluation will collect data on steroid injections undertaken during this part of the pandemic. Clinicians will be able to input information on patient demographics, background Covid risk and steroid injection specifics. At follow up at 4-6 weeks complications and Covid specific outcomes will be recorded, as well as patient perceived symptom improvement. Each unit collecting data will have assigned collaborator(s), with a senior consultant validating the data. Data will be collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). Data collection and management will adhere to Caldicott II principles and GDPR. RESULTS: Results will be analysed through RedCap and compared to national Covid incidence. Local complication and patient reported outcomes will be compared between specialities, environments and steroid specifics (volume, location etc.). CONCLUSION: A pan-speciality look at steroid injection use during the pandemic will be useful primarily to contribute to understanding the safety of steroid use. Secondarily to look at cross speciality differences in administration, PROMs and to appreciate patient groups who may be excluded from steroid treatment. Join the team!

Treatment depends on a multitude of factors including the pattern / displacement of the fracture, patient age, pre-morbid function, and surgeon preference. We aim to investigate the effect of the pandemic on the management and short-term outcomes of patients with DRF’s. METHOD: Retrospective review of all adult DRF’s two months before and after BOA released emergency standards on trauma management. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients managed non-operatively before and during COVID-19. Data extracted: demographics, comorbidities, cognitive baseline, treatment, and follow-up. Radiographs were reviewed for displacement [dorsal tilt (>10(o)), ulnar variance (>3mm), intra-articular step (>2mm)]. RESULTS: Pre-COVID (n = 29), COVID (n = 35). Characteristics were comparable in terms of median age (66 and 72 years, p = 0.41), %aged ≤65 (48% and 37%, p = 0.37), dominant side fracture (36% and 40%, p = 0.52), presence ≥ 2 co-morbidities (41% and 43%, p = 0.91). More patients were managed non-operatively during COVID (86% vs. 69%, p = 0.11), 2 of whom had unstable fracture pattern and developed malunion, compared to none in pre-COVID period. CONCLUSIONS: Management of DRF’s remains a controversial topic, particularly in age <65 years. Long term follow up of patients with significant fracture displacement managed conservatively during COVID pandemic could help guide future practice.","East, J; Tahir, M; Bose, D; Quraishi, H",Br J Surg,373,24

A tailored questionnaire was created and sent via e-mails to 500 respondents, to identify a snapshot of participants daily buying and consuming actions. 483 responses received and analyzed using statistical tools. They respond to recommendations for enhancing sustainability consciousness at individual level, inspiring people to buy sustainable, creating new consumption attitudes that are key factors for moving towards a sustainable citizenship. The findings will further provide information for a second paper on developing the ‘Go Sustainable Living’ digital application to be uploaded in individuals’ mobile phones, for rewarding users with points that correspond to each sustainable action and can later be used for discounts in all participating stores. The analysis showed that <30% of consumers are considered sustainability-conscious, 57.6% are in a transition phase, while 13% fell into the category of non-conscious. To make sustainable decisions and actions in every daily life, individuals need to have knowledge of sustainability, awareness, consciousness of their actions, and be active citizens.

This paper proposes a new method which profiles social media users based on their interest on research topics using altmetric data. Social media users are clustered based on the topics related to the research publications they share in social media. This allows removing linkages which respond to social or personal proximity and identifying disconnected users who may have similar research interests. We test this method for users tweeting publications from the fields of Information Science & Library Science, and Microbiology.

VR relaxation (VRelax, containing 360° immersive environments) provides an easy-to-use and effective means to induce positive affect and reduce perceived stress. We investigated feasibility and immediate effect on perceived stress of VRelax use by ICU nurses during work shifts. ICU nurses working with COVID-19 patients in an academic hospital could use VRelax as a 10-min break during their shift. Primary outcome was the difference between perceived stress immediately before and after VRelax use measured by a single-question VAS-stress scale. Statistically significant difference of the mean VAS-stress before and after use was determined using the paired t student test. A socio-demographic questionnaire, a questionnaire on perceived stress and stress resilience and VRelax user experiences were sent by email. Eighty-six (26%) nurses used VRelax at least once; 77% (N=66) of these filled out the VAS-stress scale before and after use of VRelax. Mean perceived stress lowered with 39.9% after use of VRelax (mean difference=14.0, SD=13.3, p<0.005). Mean score on the perceived stress scale-10 was 11.4 (SD=6.50), mean score on the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 was 29.0 (SD=5.51). Sixty-two percentage of the ICU nurses thought VRelax was helpful to reduce stress. Main barrier for use was a high workload. It is feasible for nurses to use VRelax in an ICU context. VRelax is an effective intervention to reduce immediate perceived stress and is of added value in stressful situations as during the COVID-19 pandemic, inducing a positive affective state and lowering perceived stress.","Nijland, J.

A retrospective comparison of the signalment between cats with confirmed FIP and the general cat population was designed. The patient signalment of 382 FIP confirmed cases were compared with the Companion Animal Register of NSW and the general cat population of Sydney. Younger cats were significantly over-represented among FIP cases. Domestic crossbred, Persian and Himalayan cats were significantly under-represented in the FIP cohort, while several breeds were over-represented, including British Shorthair, Devon Rex and Abyssinian. A significantly higher proportion of male cats had FIP compared with female cats. This study provides further evidence that FIP is a disease primarily of young cats and that significant breed and sex predilections exist in Australia. This opens further avenues to investigate the role of genetic factors in FIP.","Worthing, Kate A; Wigney, Denise I; Dhand, Navneet K; Fawcett, Anne; McDonagh, Phillip; Malik, Richard; Norris, Jacqueline M",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,373,1

Yet, we know little about how this enriched language environment influences the connectivity of children's brains. Behavioural research in children and adults has shown that bilingualism experience may boost executive control (EC) skills, such as inhibitory control and attention. Moreover, increased structural and functional (resting-state) connectivity in language-related and EC-related brain networks is associated with increased executive control in bilingual adults. However, how bilingualism factors alter brain connectivity early in brain development remains poorly understood. We will combine standardised tests of attention with structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in bilingual children. This study will allow us to address an important field of inquiry within linguistics and developmental cognitive neuroscience by examining the following questions: Does bilingual experience modulate connectivity in language-related and EC-related networks in children? Do differences in resting-state brain connectivity correlate with differences in EC skills (specifically attention skills)? How do bilingualism-related factors, such as age of exposure to two languages, language usage and proficiency, modulate brain connectivity? We will collect structural and functional MRI, and quantitative measures of EC and language skills from two groups of English-Greek bilingual children - 20 simultaneous bilinguals (exposure to both languages from birth) and 20 successive bilinguals (exposure to English between the ages of 3 and 5 years) - and 20 English monolingual children, 8-10 years old. We will compare connectivity measures and attention skills between monolinguals and bilinguals to examine the effects of bilingual exposure. We will also examine to what extent bilingualism factors predict brain connectivity in EC and language networks. Overall, we hypothesize that connectivity and EC will be enhanced in bilingual children compared to monolingual children, and each outcome will be modulated by age of exposure to two languages and by bilingual language usage.","Goksan, Sezgi; Argyri, Froso; Clayden, Jonathan D; Liegeois, Frederique; Wei, Li",F1000Research,373,23

As a result of the morbidity associated with open TME, minimally invasive techniques have become popular. Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been held as the next revolution in surgical techniques, offering the possibility of 'incisionless' TME. Early clinical series of transanal TME with laparoscopic assistance (n = 72) are promising, with overall intraoperative and postoperative complication rates of 8.3% and 27.8%, respectively, similar to laparoscopic TME. The mesorectal specimen was intact in all patients, and 94.4% had negative margins. There was no oncological recurrence in average-risk patients at short-term follow up, and 2-year survival rates in high-risk patients were comparable to that after laparoscopic TME. These preliminary studies demonstrate transanal NOTES TME with laparoscopic assistance to be clinically feasible and safe given careful patient selection, surgical expertise, and appropriate procedural training. We are hopeful that with optimization of transanal instruments and surgical techniques, pure transanal NOTES TME will become a viable alternative to open and laparoscopic TME in the future.","Emhoff, Isha Ann; Lee, Grace Clara; Sylla, Patricia",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,373,33

The risks related to this replacement substantially impact long-term outcome for S-ICD recipients, as the majority will undergo one or several of these procedures in their lifetime. We aim to describe the procedural characteristics of the replacement procedure and to provide an insight in the complications associated with these replacements. METHODS AND RESULTS In this retrospective analysis, data from replacement procedures and follow-up visits were collected from all patients who underwent elective S-ICD generator replacement in our tertiary centre from June 2014 until November 2019. Original device position was assessed using the PRAETORIAN score. Complications were defined as those requiring surgical intervention, systemic antibiotic treatment, or device extraction. Seventy-two patients were included, with a median follow-up of 1.9 years (IQR 0.6-3.3 years) after replacement. Battery depletion occurred after 5.9 ± 0.7 years. The pulse generator was repositioned in patients with a PRAETORIAN score ≥90 to minimize the defibrillation threshold. Although there was an increase in impedance compared to the implant procedure, first shock conversion rate during defibrillation testing was 91.4% with a success rate of 100% after multiple attempts. Two patients developed a complication after, respectively, 9 and 21 months, resulting in a complication rate of 1.4% per year.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of GGT serum levels in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy for the treatment of HCC. METHODS This retrospective study included 254 patients with small liver cancer (tumor of ≤5 cm in diameter and nodule of ≤3 cm) who had been treated with RFA. Baseline serum GGT was examined before therapy, and overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the significance of GGT and other serum markers as prognostic factors. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 27 months, 51 patients had died and 123 had hepatic recurrence. After treatment with RFA, HCC patients with elevated GGT had a shorter OS versus those with normal GGT level (p = 0.001); they also had higher recurrence (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, albumin (p = 0.003), GGT (p = 0.035), and tumor size (p = 0.027) were independent risk factors for survival, and GGT (p = 0.010) and tumor size (p = 0.026) were significant risk factors for recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Serum GGT is a convenient prognostic biomarker related to OS and recurrence in HCC patients undergoing RFA treatment.","Ma, Hui; Zhang, Lan; Tang, Bei; Wang, Yan; Chen, Rongxin; Zhang, Boheng; Chen, Yi; Ge, Ningling; Wang, Yanhong; Gan, Yuhong; Ye, Shenglong; Ren, Zhenggang",Annals of surgical oncology,373,31

The outcomes were compared between open and laparoscopic repairs in meta-analyses. RESULTS We included ten studies with 1270 patients involving 1392 hernias. We found no differences in recurrence rate, testicular atrophy, hydrocele, hematoma, seroma, infection, pain, length of hospital stay, or time to full recovery. Laparoscopic repair was superior regarding wound appearance. Laparoscopic repair had shorter operative time than open repair for bilateral groin hernias. For unilateral groin hernias, extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair was faster than open repair, but open repair was faster than intraperitoneal laparoscopic repair. CONCLUSION Our results indicate similar outcome after laparoscopic and open techniques for groin hernia repair in children. The surgeon's preference as well as the wishes of the patient and parents should therefore determine the surgical approach.","Olesen, Christoffer Skov; Andresen, Kristoffer; Öberg, Stina; Rosenberg, Jacob",Surgical endoscopy,373,19

MATERIAL AND METHODS The Internet-based survey covered 353 individuals who had participated in a psychological support project operated by one of the non-governmental organizations in Lublin, Poland, in the 12 months prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The questionnaire used in the study contained questions to collect sociodemographic data and psychometric scales to measure resource gains and losses (the Conservation of Resources - Evaluation questionnaire), the quality of life (the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF), and strategies of coping with the pandemic situation (a modified Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced questionnaire). RESULTS A higher global quality of life occurred with higher gains and minor losses, as well as with coping through planning, positive reframing, emotional support seeking, a reduced substance use tendency, low self-blame, avoidance, and disengagement. Moreover, helplessness-based coping strategies were found to mediate both the relationships between resource gains and the quality of life, and between resource losses and the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Factors that may reduce people's quality of life during the COVID‑19 pandemic are an increase in losses and limited gains, experienced over the 6 months preceding the pandemic, as well as not using active, meaning-oriented, and support-seeking coping strategies, but using avoidance behaviors instead. Coping strategies specific to people experiencing helplessness are a mediating mechanism between losses and limited gains of resources, and the quality of life.","Chwaszcz, Joanna; Palacz-Chrisidis, Agnieszka; Wiechetek, Michał; Bartczuk, Rafał P; Niewiadomska, Iwona; Wośko, Patrycja; Sławska-Jaroszewska, Patrycja",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,373,33

After extensive practice in a biomechanical model, the operation was performed as a nonrobotic approach in an animal study. METHODS Six large domestic pigs were anesthetized and intubated. Port access and endoscopic vision were used exclusively during the intrathoracic procedure. In five animals, an internal mammary artery was harvested, extracorporeal circulation was established via peripheral vessel access, and the ascending aorta occluded with an intraluminal balloon. In cardioplegic arrest, an anastomosis of internal mammary artery and left anterior descending coronary artery was performed with shortened 7-0 monofil thread running suture. As a terminal study, the animals were humanely killed and the quality of the anastomoses was checked. RESULTS After a steady learning curve, the fifth animal was operated on successfully and a satisfactory anastomosis was documented. CONCLUSION Despite demanding differences to humans as shape of thoracic cavity and size of peripheral access vessels, the viability of the nonrobotic TECAB concept was documented in a living animal model.","Gorki, Hagen; Liu, Jun; Poelzing, Frank; Gorki, Susanne D; Pasche, Heidi; Albrecht, Guenter; Liebold, Andreas",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,373,0

Little is known about the outcomes of infections in pregnant women. The management and characteristics of preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers need to be clarified. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we describe the clinical courses of 6 preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers, the management protocol, and related outcomes. RESULTS Six preterm infants were admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 23 and March 19, 2020. Gestational age ranged from 28+5 to 36+3 weeks. One late preterm infant was delivered early due to maternal dyspnea from COVID-19. Five infants were delivered by Caesarean section. None had perinatal asphyxia. Two infants required respiratory support due to respiratory distress syndrome and apnea of prematurity. All infants did not develop severe complications of prematurity and are negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSION With an expedited and adequate delivery protocol, less invasive treatment principle, and active infection precautious, we found a limited impact of COVID-19 mothers on preterm delivery and neonatal short-term outcomes. The risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is low in preterm infants born to COVID-19 mothers if appropriate management is implemented.","Hu, Xiaolin; Gao, Jinzhi; Wei, Ying; Chen, Hui; Sun, Xuan; Chen, Juan; Luo, Xiaoping; Chen, Ling",Neonatology,373,31

Our working hypothesis was that cardiac microthrombosis would play an important role in the pathogenesis. We investigated that cardiac microthrombi were observed by Martius, Scarlet, Blue methocl (MSB) and Masson trichrome staining. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of fibrinogen-like protein 2 (fgl2) in rats with acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) and its possible pathological and clinical significance. The fgl2 was highly expressed in myocardium of rats with acute MI/R and located at cardiac microvascular walls. We found that the expression of fgl2 in peripheral mononuclear cells of rats with acute MI/R significantly increased correspondingly with its cardiac expression. Expression of cardiac fgl2 was correlated with no-reflow size of rats with acute MI/R, which was detected and calculated by thioflavin S staining. No-reflow size was in line with cardiac diastolic dysfunction of rats with acute MI/R monitored by hemodynamics. Thus, microthrombosis is involved in cardiac microvascular dysfunction or disturbance of rats with acute MI/R as one cause, and fgl2 may emerge as a predictor of the occurrence of no-reflow phenomenon.","Shao, Liang; Wu, Daying; Zhang, Ping; Li, Wenzhu; Wang, Jue; Su, Guanhua; Liao, Yuhua; Wang, Zhaohui; Liu, Kun",Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,373,1

The bilateral lungs of eight living adult swine were used. A tumor-mimic model was made by percutaneous injection of 1.0 ml muscle paste through the bone biopsy needle into the lung. An RFA probe was then inserted into the tumor mimics immediately after tumor creation. Ablation time, tissue impedance, and temperature were recorded. The tumor mimics and their coagulated regions were evaluated microscopically and macroscopically. The muscle paste was easily injected into the lung parenchyma through the bone biopsy needle and well visualized under fluoroscopy. In 10 of 12 sites the tumor mimics were oval shaped, localized, and homogeneous on gross specimens. Ten tumor mimics were successfully ablated, and four locations were ablated in the normal lung parenchyma as controls. In the tumor and normal lung parenchyma, ablation times were 8.9 +/- 3.5 and 4.4 +/- 1.6 min, respectively; tissue impedances at the start of ablation were 100.6 +/- 16.6 and 145.8 +/- 26.8 Omega, respectively; and temperatures at the end of ablation were 66.0 +/- 7.9 and 57.5 +/- 7.6 degrees C, respectively. The mean size of tumor mimics was 13.9 x 8.2 mm, and their coagulated area was 18.8 x 13.1 mm. In the lung parenchyma, the coagulated area was 15.3 x 12.0 mm. In conclusion, our tumor-mimic model using muscle paste can be easily and safely created and can be ablated using the ablation algorithm in the clinical setting.","Kawai, T; Kaminou, T; Sugiura, K; Hashimoto, M; Ohuchi, Y; Adachi, A; Fujioka, S; Ito, H; Nakamura, K; Ogawa, T",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,373,19

METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to primary DES or PTA. In the Japanese cohort, 27 patients (21 men; mean age 71.2±9.6 years) were randomized to PTA and 25 patients (19 men; mean age 69.8±10.2 years) to primary DES. In the non-Japanese cohort, 211 patients (131 men; mean age 67.3±10.6 years) were randomized to PTA and 211 patients (136 men; mean age 67.6±9.5 years) to primary DES. Outcome measures included event-free survival (EFS), freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), patency, stent fracture, and sustained clinical benefit through 2 years. RESULTS Safety and effectiveness outcomes were similar in the Japanese and non-Japanese cohorts, although the outcomes in the Japanese cohort treated with primary DES were numerically better. In the DES group, the 2-year EFS was 92.0% vs. 85.0% (p=0.61), freedom from TLR was 96.0% vs. 85.5% (p=0.55), primary patency was 80.0% vs. 74.3% (p=0.61), and clinical benefit was sustained in 88.5% vs. 80.5% of patients (p=0.31) in the Japanese and non-Japanese cohorts, respectively. Stent fractures were seen in 4 of 457 stents at 12 months: 3 in the Japanese cohort and 1 in the non-Japanese cohort. CONCLUSION The subgroup analysis comparing Japanese and non-Japanese patients supports the safety and effectiveness of the paclitaxel-coated DES in Japanese patients with stenotic lesions in the femoropopliteal arteries. The lack of major differences associated with ethnicity in these 2-year outcomes supports the validity and value of multinational clinical trials.","Ohki, Takao; Yokoi, Hiroyoshi; Kichikawa, Kimihiko; Kimura, Takeshi; Snyder, Scott A; Ragheb, Anthony O; O'Leary, Erin E; Jaff, Michael R; Ansel, Gary M; Dake, Michael D",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,373,16

We investigated the role and underlying mechanism of sulfiredoxin-1 (Srxn1) in AP. Mild AP was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein and severe AP was induced by partial duct ligation with cerulein stimulation or intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine in mice. Acinar cells, neutrophils, and macrophages were isolated. The pancreas was analyzed by histology, immunochemistry staining, and TUNEL assays, and the expression of certain proteins and RNAs, cytokine levels, trypsin activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined. Srxn1 was inhibited by J14 or silenced by siRNA, and overexpression was introduced by a lentiviral vector. Transcriptomic analysis was used to explore the mechanism of Srxn1-mediated effects. We also evaluated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 by intraductal administration and the protection of AP. We found that Srxn1 expression was upregulated in mild AP but decreased in severe AP. Inhibition of Srxn1 increased ROS, histological score, the release of trypsin, and inflammatory responses in mice. Inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the production of ROS and induced apoptosis, while overexpression of Srxn1 led to the opposite results in acinar cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the inflammatory response by accumulating and activating M1 phenotype macrophages and neutrophils in AP. Mechanistically, ROS-induced ER stress and activation of Cathepsin B, which converts trypsinogen to trypsin, were responsible for the Srxn1 inhibition-mediated effects on AP. Importantly, we demonstrated that AAV-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 attenuated AP in mice. Taken together, these results showed that Srxn1 is a protective target for AP by attenuating acinar injury and inflammation through the ROS/ER stress/Cathepsin B axis.","He, Jun; Ma, Miaomiao; Li, Daming; Wang, Kunpeng; Wang, Qiuguo; Li, Qiuguo; He, Hongye; Zhou, Yan; Li, Qinglong; Hou, Xuyang; Yang, Leping",Cell death & disease,373,1

The emergent structure and heterogeneity of the urban landscape drives the biotic outcomes observed, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies effectively consider structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes, instead focusing on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. We explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships binding social inequities, specifically racism, and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices - including residential segregation - to the observed heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. As a result, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors driving biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.","Schell, Christopher J; Dyson, Karen; Fuentes, Tracy L; Des Roches, Simone; Harris, Nyeema C; Miller, Danica Sterud; Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo A; Lambert, Max R",Science,373,13

For this purpose, the Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations (ODISSEI) consortium has supported the development of the ODISSEI Secure Supercomputer (OSSC) platform that allows researchers to link cohort data to data from Statistics Netherlands and run large-scale analyses in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment. Here, we report a successful record linkage genomewide association (GWA) study on expenditure for total health, mental health, primary and hospital care, and medication. Record linkage for genotype data from 16,726 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) with data from Statistics Netherlands was accomplished in the secure OSSC platform, followed by gene-based tests and estimation of total and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability. The total heritability of expenditure ranged between 29.4% (SE 0.8) and 37.5% (SE 0.8), but GWA analyses did not identify SNPs or genes that were genomewide significantly associated with health care expenditure. SNP-based heritability was between 0.0% (SE 3.5) and 5.4% (SE 4.0) and was different from zero for mental health care and primary care expenditure. We conclude that successfully linking genotype data to administrative health care expenditure data from Statistics Netherlands is feasible and demonstrates a series of analyses on health care expenditure. The OSSC platform offers secure possibilities for analyzing linked data in large scale and realizing sample sizes required for GWA studies, providing invaluable opportunities to answer many new research questions.","de Zeeuw, Eveline L; Voort, Lykle; Schoonhoven, Ruurd; Nivard, Michel G; Emery, Thomas; Hottenga, Jouke-Jan; Willemsen, Gonneke A H M; Dykstra, Pearl A; Zarrabi, Narges; Kartopawiro, John D; Boomsma, Dorret I",Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies,373,11

We describe the discovery of a novel feline picornavirus (FePV) from stray cats in Hong Kong. From samples from 662 cats, FePV was detected in fecal samples from 14 cats and urine samples from 2 cats by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Analysis of five FePV genomes revealed a distinct phylogenetic position and genomic features, with low sequence homologies to known picornaviruses especially in leader and 2A proteins. Among the viruses that belong to the closely related bat picornavirus groups 1 to 3 and the genus Sapelovirus, G+C content and sequence analysis of P1, P2, and P3 regions showed that FePV is most closely related to bat picornavirus group 3. However, FePV possessed other distinct features, including a putative type IV internal ribosome entry site/segment (IRES) instead of type I IRES in bat picornavirus group 3, protein cleavage sites, and H-D-C catalytic triad in 3C(pro) different from those in sapeloviruses and bat picornaviruses, and the shortest leader protein among known picornaviruses. These results suggest that FePV may belong to a new genus in the family Picornaviridae. Western blot analysis using recombinant FePV VP1 polypeptide showed a high seroprevalence of 33.6% for IgG among the plasma samples from 232 cats tested. IgM was also detected in three cats positive for FePV in fecal samples, supporting recent infection in these cats.

The purposes of this study were to determine whether early intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle would improve pulmonary status, reduce mortality, and reduce chronic lung disease morbidity. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a prospective, randomized blind trial in 116 very low birth weight infants (< 1500 g) who had severe radiographic respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation with fraction of inspired oxygen > or = 0.6 shortly after birth: 60 were in the treated group (intratracheal instillation of a mixture of 0.25 mg/kg of budesonide and 100.00 mg/kg of survanta, every 8 hours) and 56 were in the control group (100 mg/kg of survanta only, every 8 hours). The end point assessment was the number of infants who would die or develop chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' postconceptional age. RESULTS Infants in the treatment group required significantly lower mean airway pressure on day 1 and day 3 and had significantly lower oxygen index and PCO(2) during the first 3 days than infants in the control group. More infants were extubated in the treatment group than controls at 1 and 2 weeks. The combined outcome of deaths or chronic lung disease was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (19 of 60 vs 34 of 56). No clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study indicated that early postnatal intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as vehicle significantly improved the combined outcome of death or chronic lung disease in small premature infants without causing immediate adverse effects. The results are encouraging, and a large sample multicenter trial is warranted.","Yeh, Tsu F; Lin, Hong C; Chang, Chien H; Wu, Tien S; Su, Bai H; Li, Tsai C; Pyati, Suma; Tsai, Chang H",Pediatrics,373,13

Additionally, to determine how this changes in abnormal nasal function. DESIGN A cross-sectional study measuring UPNIF and UMCA in controls demonstrating normal nasal function and in patients with nasal obstruction. SETTING Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, London. PARTICIPANTS A total of 39 participants, 26 controls and 13 patients, were recruited. Controls exhibited normal nasal function with SNOT-22 <5. Patients nasal obstruction symptoms secondary to inflammation or structural abnormality with SNOT-22 >9. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS Airflow rates and resistance values were derived from UPNIF and UMCA measurements respectively based on Poiseuille's laws. Ratios between right and left UPNIF and UMCA values were taken to adjust for confounding factors. The relationship of 1/Resistance Ratio and Airflow Rate Ratio demonstrated a linear of direct proportionality of strong correlation and statistical significance (correlation coefficient = 0.76, P « 0.01). This suggests that data points from controls with a normal nasal cycle lie closely along the regressed line, whilst those lying significantly away were shown to belong to patients with nasal dysfunction. Olfactory dysfunction appears to be a sensitive discriminator in predicting this. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the directly proportional relationship of 1/Resistance Ratio and Airflow Rate Ratio in normal nasal function. Furthermore, nasal pathology can be predicted if data points lie significantly outside these normal limits. Further studies are needed to validate exact normal and abnormal thresholds.","Tan, Martin Fan Min; Whitcroft, Katherine Lisa; Mehta, Nishchay; Schilder, Anne; Leung, Terence S; Andrews, Peter J",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,373,1

Coronaviruses are composite particles with a core of nucleic acids complexed to proteins surrounded by a protein-studded lipid bilayer shell. A dominant route for transmission is via air-borne aerosols and droplets. Viral interaction with polymeric body fluids, particularly mucus, and cell membranes controls their infectivity, while their interaction with skin and artificial surfaces underpins cleaning and disinfection and the efficacy of masks and other personal protective equipment. The global response to COVID-19 has highlighted gaps in the soft matter knowledge base. We survey these gaps, especially as pertaining to the transmission of the disease, and suggest questions that can (and need to) be tackled, both in response to COVID-19 and to better prepare for future viral pandemics.","Poon, Wilson C K; Brown, Aidan T; Direito, Susana O L; Hodgson, Daniel J M; Le Nagard, Lucas; Lips, Alex; MacPhee, Cait E; Marenduzzo, Davide; Royer, John R; Silva, Andreia F; Thijssen, Job H J; Titmuss, Simon",Soft matter,373,14

Existing studies have examined this association across intervals ranging from days to years, leaving it unclear as to what extent differences in timing may explain differences across studies. In the present study, we used continuous time structural equation models (i.e., CT-SEM) to examine cross-lagged relations between the constructs, and also distinguished between-person differences from within-person processes (i.e., RI-CT-SEM). We analyzed 10 years of annual data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies of the Social Sciences (N = 14,741). When using CT-SEM, we found a bidirectional positive relation between self-esteem and satisfaction with social relationships, with larger effects over longer intervals. When using RI-CT-SEM, we found the largest effects of self-esteem and satisfaction with social relationships across intervals of 1 year, with smaller effect sizes at both shorter and longer intervals. In addition, the effect of fluctuations in people's satisfaction with social relationships on fluctuations in their self-esteem was greater than the reverse effect. Our results highlight the importance of considering time when examining the relation between self-esteem and interpersonal outcomes and likely psychological constructs in general.

DESIGN AND SETTING The Partnerships in Research to Implement and Disseminate Sustainable and Scalable Evidence (PRIDE) study is a cluster-randomised hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial comparing three delivery pathways for integrating comprehensive mental healthcare into primary care in Mozambique. Innovations include the use of EBPs and scaling-up of task-shifted mental health services using mobile applications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We examined EBP training attendance, certification, knowledge and intentions to deliver each component. We collected qualitative data through rapid ethnography and focus groups. We tracked the use of the mobile applications to investigate early reach of a valid screening tool (Electronic Mental Wellness Tool) and the roll out of the EBPs PARTICIPANTS: Psychiatric technicians and primary care providers trained in the EBPs. RESULTS PRIDE has trained 110 EBP providers, supervisors and trainers and will train 279 community health workers in upcoming months. The trainings improved knowledge about the EBPs and trainees indicated strong intentions to deliver the EBP core components. Trained providers began using the mobile applications and appear to identify cases and provide appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS The future of EBPs requires implementation within existing systems of care with fidelity to their core evidence-based components. To sustainably address the vast mental health treatment gap globally, EBP implementation demands: expanding the mental health workforce by training existing human resources; sequential use of EBPs to comprehensively treat mental disorders and their comorbid presentations and leveraging digital screening and treatment applications.","Wainberg, Milton L; Gouveia, Maria Lídia; Stockton, Melissa Ann; Feliciano, Paulino; Suleman, Antonio; Mootz, Jennifer J; Mello, Milena; Fiks Salem, Andre; Greene, M Claire; Bezuidenhout, Charl; Ngwepe, Phuti; Lovero, Kathryn L; Fortunato Dos Santos, Palmira; Schriger, Simone H; Mandell, David S; Mulumba, Rogerio; Neves Anube, Anibal; Mabunda, Dirceu; Mandlate, Flavio; Cournos, Francine; Alves-Bradford, Jean-Marie; Nicholson, Terriann; Kann, Bianca; Fumo, Wilza; Duarte, Cristiane S; de Jesus Mari, Jair; Mello, Marcelo F; Mocumbi, Ana O; Oquendo, Maria A; Weissman, Myrna M",Evidence-based mental health,373,16

METHODS e retrospectively analysed the 200 donors and recipients who underwent a planned laparoscopic nephrectomy at two hospitals between September 1998 and December 2006. The impact of donor right kidney and multiple donor renal arteries on operative time, hospital stay, graft function, and donor and recipient complications were analysed. RESULTS Of the total cohort (n=200), 140 (70%) were classified as Simple LLDN (left live donor kidney with single renal artery). The Complex LLDN group (n=60) contained all right-sided kidney (n=28) and left-sided kidneys with multiple renal arteries (n=32). Baseline characteristics, extraction time, conversion to open, length of admission, overall graft function and complication rates were similar between the simple and complex groups. The second warm ischaemic time in the Simple LLDN group was slightly shorter than the Complex LLDN group (32 versus 36 min P=0.016). The 1-month post-operative recipient serum creatinine level was lower in the Simple LLDN group when compared with the Complex LLDN group (117 versus 125 µmol/L P=0.025). There was no difference in post op dialysis, acute rejection within 3 months or graft survival between the Simple and Complex LLDN groups. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic procurements of right kidneys and kidneys with multiple arteries were safe and yielded kidneys with excellent function comparable with those of laparoscopic left donor nephrectomy with single artery.","Crane, Catherine; Lam, Vincent W T; Alsakran, Abdulrahman; Vasilaras, Arthur; Lau, Howard; Ryan, Brendan; Pleass, Henry C C; Allen, Richard D M",ANZ journal of surgery,373,22

Digital divide and socio-demographic disparity create an information hiatus and therefore unhealthy practices with regard to dealing with COVID-19, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Aims We assessed knowledge, attitudes, practices and their determinants regarding COVID-19 in Pakistan during March-April 2020. Methods 905 adults ≥18 years (males and females) participated: 403 from a web-based survey; 365 from an urban survey; and 137 from a rural survey. Frequency of adequate knowledge, attitudes and practices for the three populations was determined based on available global guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression analysis determined factors of adequacy of knowledge, attitudes, practices, and association of knowledge with attitudes and practices. Results Mean age of the participants was 33.5 (+ SD 11.1) years, 51% were females. More females and young adults (18-30 years) participated in the web-based survey. The urban survey and web-based survey participants had significantly higher adequate knowledge (2-7 times) and practices (4-5 times) towards COVID-19. Adequate knowledge had a significant influence on healthy attitudes and practices for COVID-19, after adjustment for covariates. Overall, two-thirds of the population had high levels of fear about COVID-19, which was highest among the rural survey population. Conclusion Substantial gaps exist in adequate knowledge, attitudes and practices, particularly among rural populations, and underscores the variation in access to information according to level of education and access to the internet. Thus, a comprehensive, contextually congruent awareness raising strategy is urgently needed to confront COVID-19 among these populations.","Fatmi, Zafar; Mahmood, Shafaq; Hameed, Waqas; Qazi, Ibtisam; Siddiqui, Muhammad; Dhanwani, Anny; Siddiqi, Sameen",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,373,17

Adjuvanted subunit vaccines are well controlled, safe and effective. This review discusses about COVID-19 subunit vaccines and their signaling pathways which could provide a glimpse into the selection of appropriate adjuvants for prospective vaccine development studies. AREAS COVERED In the introduction, a brief background about SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the current state of vaccine development race were highlighted. Then the general classes of vaccine adjuvants were briefly introduced. In the body of the review, the included articles were identified at PubMed and SCOPUS on 19th may 2021 using keywords such as ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""COVID-19"" and ""Immunologic adjuvant"" or ""subunit vaccine"". Then, the antigen, trial stage and types of adjuvants were extracted. Finally, the pattern recognition receptors (PRR), their classes, cognate adjuvants and potential signaling pathways were comprehended. EXPERT OPINION Adjuvants are unsung heroes of subunit vaccines. The in silico studies are very vital in avoiding several costly trial errors and save much work times. Majority of (pre) clinical studies are promising. It is encouraging that, most of the selected adjuvants are novel meaning that they have known PRR to study their effector mechanisms. Much emphasis must be paid to the optimal paring of antigen-adjuvant-PRR for obtaining the desired vaccine effect. A good subunit vaccine/adjuvant is one that has high efficacy, safety, dose sparing, rapid seroconversion rate and induce a broad spectrum of immune response. In the years to come, COVID-19 adjuvanted subunit vaccines are expected to have superior utility than any other vaccines including the breakthrough mRNA vaccines for various reasons.","Mekonnen, Daniel; Mengist, Hylemariam Mihiretie; Jin, Tengchuan",Expert review of vaccines,373,1

APPROACH A cross-sectional survey was conducted online for understanding skin injuries among medical staff fighting against COVID-19 in February 8-22, 2020. Participants voluntarily answered and submitted the questionnaire with cellphone. The questionnaire items included demographic data, grade of PPE and daily wearing time, skin injuries types, anatomical sites, and preventive measures. Univariable analyses and logistic regression analyses were employed to explore the risk factors associated with skin injuries. RESULTS A total of 4,308 respondents were collected from 161 hospitals and 4,306 respondents were valid. The overall prevalence of skin injuries was 42.8% (95% CI 41.30%-44.30%) with three types of device-related pressure injuries, moist associated skin damage and skin tear. Co-skin injuries and multiple locations injuries were 27.4% and 76.8%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis indicated that sweating (95%CI for OR 87.52-163.11), daily wearing time (95% CI for OR1.61-3.21), male (95% CI for OR 1.11-2.13) and grade 3 PPE (95% CI for OR1.08-2.01) were associated with skin injuries. Only 17.7% respondents took prevention and 45.0% skin injuries were treated. INNOVATION This the first cross-sectional survey to understand skin injuries in medical staff caused by PPE, which is expected to be a benchmark. CONCLUSION The skin injuries among medical staff are serious, with insufficient prevention and treatment. A comprehensive program should be taken in future.","Jiang, Qixia; Song, Siping; Zhou, Jihong; Liu, Yuxiu; Chen, Aihua; Bai, Yuxuan; Wang, Jing; Jiang, Zhixia; Zhang, Yanhong; Liu, Haiying; Hua, Jiao; Guo, Jinli; Han, Qiuying; Tang, Yongli; Xue, Jiayu",Advances in wound care,373,9

In order to curb the SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, the Chinese government enacted a series of containment strategies including household quarantine, traffic restriction, city lockdowns etc. Indeed, the pandemic has been effectively mitigated, but the global transmission is not still optimistic. Evaluating such control measures in detail plays an important role in limiting SARS-Cov-2 spread for public health decision and policymakers. In this paper, based on the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths of SARS-Cov-2 infection, from January 31st to March 31st, announced by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, we established a mean-field model, considering the substantial contact change under some restrictive measures, to study the dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 infection in mainland China. By the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm of Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method, our model provided a good fitting to the overall trends of SARS-Cov-2 infections and discovers the transmission heterogeneities by some extreme containment strategies to some extent. The basic reproduction number was approximated to be 2.05 (95% CI [1.35,2.87]); the hospitalized cases arrived at the peak of 29766 (95% CI [29743,29868]) on February 7th (95% CI [Feb.6th, Feb.8th]). Importantly, we identified that the highest risk group of SARS-Cov-2 was the family of four, which has the biggest probability of degree distributions at such node, suggesting that contact patterns play an important role in curtailing the disease spread.","Yang, Jun Yuan; Wang, Guo Qiang; Zhang, Shuo",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,373,11

RFA may be able to provide better renal preservation, while achieving appropriate cancer control. This investigation takes a critical look at pertinent aspects of RFA principles and reviews oncological and renal function outcomes. METHODS A review of the most current English literature using a PubMed search was done. Oncological and renal function outcomes were reviewed from selected articles published between 2003 and 2009. Oncological outcome was determined by ""single treatment"" success rate at first follow-up and ""After single treatment"" success rate after first follow-up. Renal function outcome was determined by either change in creatinine, creatinine clearance, or GFR after RFA. RESULTS The mean tumor size was 2.5 cm for 16/17 studies. Average mean and median follow-up was 23.3 months in 13/17 studies and 19.8 months for 4/17 studies. ""Single Treatment"" success rates of 90-100% (average = 97.2%) were noted in 13 studies. Average increase in serum creatinine was +0.14 mg/dL in four studies. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance change in one solitary kidney study was +11 mmol/L and -8 mL/min., respectively. CONCLUSIONS RFA is fast emerging as a safe and efficacious treatment for small renal masses. Compared to extirpative treatment options, RFA seems to provide the lowest rate of renal impairment, while providing acceptable rates of tumor ablation. As long-term results emerge, this may become one of the treatment modalities for renal tumors in patients with solitary kidneys and renal impairment.","Salas, Nelson; Ramanathan, Rajan; Dummett, Scott; Leveillee, Raymond J",World journal of urology,373,1

Here, mid-infrared chiral plasmonic metasurfaces with high circular dichroism (CD) in absorption over 0.65 in the frequency range of 50 to 60 THz are demonstrated to strongly interact with the phonon vibrational resonance of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) molecules at 52 THz, under both left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) light. The mode splitting features in the absorption spectra of the coupled metasurface-PMMA systems under both circular polarizations are studied in PMMA layers with different thicknesses. The relation between the mode splitting gap and the PMMA thickness is also revealed.

The survivals were quite different between the trials despite the similar eligibility criteria. The aim of this study was to investigate if survival is still better in JCOG0405 after adjusting baseline factors and if there is any subset of patients who benefit more from either treatment. METHODS Eligibility criteria for both trials included histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma; bulky nodal involvement around the celiac artery and its major branches (bulky N) and/or para-aortic lymph node (PAN); cM0 (except PAN); negative lavage cytology; not linitis plastica type; PS of 0 or 1. Patients received two or three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy of irinotecan plus cisplatin in JCOG0001, or S-1 plus cisplatin in JCOG0405, followed by D3 gastrectomy. Multivariable analysis for overall survival adjusting baseline and treatment factors was performed with the Cox regression model. RESULTS After adjusting baseline factors, S-1 plus cisplatin was superior to irinotecan plus cisplatin for overall survival (HR = 0.39: 95% CI 0.22-0.67). The 5-year overall survival was poor for patients with bulky N+/PAN+ (19.2%) compared with bulky N+/PAN- (50.7%) or bulky N-/PAN+ (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS S-1 plus cisplatin was shown to be a favorable preoperative treatment for gastric cancer with extensive lymph node metastasis by multivariable analysis, while poor prognosis in patients having both bulky N+ and PAN+ may necessitate further treatment improvement.","Katayama, Hiroshi; Tsuburaya, Akira; Mizusawa, Junki; Nakamura, Kenichi; Katai, Hitoshi; Imamura, Hiroshi; Nashimoto, Atsushi; Fukushima, Norimasa; Sano, Takeshi; Sasako, Mitsuru",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,373,1

METHODS The authors analyzed referrals to the crisis resolution and home treatment (CRHT) team and inpatient admissions to acute adult wards, at Leicestershire Partnership National Health Service Trust, an integrated community and mental health trust in the United Kingdom. Number of CRHT referrals and inpatient admissions during a 4-week period starting March 16, 2020 (""COVID-19 period""), was studied and compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019 (""control periods""). Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were compared with those admitted during the 2019 control period. RESULTS The number of CRHT referrals and inpatient admissions were lower during the COVID-19 period, compared with the control periods, by approximately 12% and 20%, respectively. Patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were significantly more often detained under the Mental Health Act and were considered to pose a risk of aggression. The pattern of diagnoses differed significantly between 2020 and 2019. A higher percentage of patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were diagnosed as having nonaffective psychotic disorders (52% versus 35%) or bipolar disorder (25% versus 15%), and fewer received a diagnosis of depression (8% versus 16%), anxiety disorder (0% versus 3%), adjustment disorder (0% versus 8%), emotionally unstable personality disorder (6% versus 15%), or any other personality disorder (0% versus 5%) (p=0.01).

Carotid CTA is a routine acute stroke investigation and includes the lung apices. We evaluated CTA as a potential COVID-19 diagnostic imaging biomarker. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a multicenter, retrospective study (n = 225) including CTAs of patients with suspected acute stroke from 3 hyperacute stroke units (March-April 2020). We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of candidate diagnostic imaging biomarkers. Demographics, clinical features, and risk factors for COVID-19 and stroke were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS Apical ground-glass opacification was present in 22.2% (50/225) of patients. Ground-glass opacification had high interrater reliability (Fleiss κ = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and, compared with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, had good diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 75% [95% CI, 56-87]; specificity, 81% [95% CI, 71-88]; OR = 11.65 [95% CI, 4.14-32.78]; P < .001) on multivariate analysis. In contrast, all other contemporaneous demographic, clinical, and imaging features available at CTA were not diagnostic for COVID-19. The presence of apical ground-glass opacification was an independent predictor of increased 30-day mortality (18.0% versus 5.7%, P = .017; hazard ratio = 3.51; 95% CI, 1.42-8.66; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS We identified a simple, reliable, and accurate COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic imaging biomarker obtained from CTA lung apices: the presence or absence of ground-glass opacification. Our findings have important implications in the management of patients presenting with suspected stroke through early identification of COVID-19 and the subsequent limitation of disease transmission.","Siddiqui, J; Bala, F; Sciacca, S; Falzon, A M; Benger, M; Matloob, S A; Miller, F N A C; Simister, R J; Chatterjee, I; Sztriha, L K; Davagnanam, I; Booth, T C",AJNR.

METHODS We examined 31 eyes of 31 patients with pseudoexfoliation and cataract (without glaucoma) and 30 eyes of 30 patients with cataract. We collected aqueous humor samples from all patients at the time of cataract surgery through a limbal paracentesis via a 25-gauge cannula mounted on a tuberculin syringe that received 100 to 150 µL of aqueous humor. We measured levels of aqueous humor Heat shock protein 70, periostin, and irisin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. RESULTS The age (p=0.221) and gender (p=0.530) means were similar between the pseudoexfoliation and control groups. The mean Heat shock protein 70 level (29.22 ± 9.46 ng/mL; 17.88-74.46) in the pseudoexfoliation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (19.03 ± 7.05 ng/mL; 9.93-35.52; p<0.0001). The mean periostin level was significantly higher (6017.32 ± 1271.79 pg/mL; 3787.50-10803.57) in the pseu doexfoliation group than that in the control group (4073.63 ± 1422.79 pg/mL; 2110.44-7490.64; p<0.0001). The mean irisin level (53.77 ± 10.19 ng/mL; 29.46-71.16) was significantly higher than that in the control group (39.29 ± 13.58 ng/mL; 19.41-70.56; p<0.0001).

ProGrip™ is a self-gripping mesh which aims to reduce rates of chronic pain. The aim of this study is to perform an update meta-analysis to consolidate the non-superiority hypothesis in terms of postoperative pain and recurrence and perform a trial sequential analysis. METHODS Systematic review of randomised controlled trials performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) method. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pain and secondary outcomes were recurrence, operative time, wound complications, length of stay, re-operation rate, and cost. Trial sequential analysis was performed. RESULTS There were 14 studies included in the quantitative analysis with 3180 patients randomised to self-gripping mesh (1585) or standard mesh (1595). At all follow-up time points, there was no significant difference in the rates of chronic pain between the self-gripping and standard mesh (risk ratio, RR 1.10, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.83-1.46). There were no significant differences in recurrence rates (RR 1.13, CI 0.84-2.04). The mean operating time was significantly shorted in the ProGrip™ mesh group (MD - 7.32 min, CI - 10.21 to - 4.44). Trial sequential analysis suggests findings are conclusive. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis has confirmed no benefit of a ProGrip™ mesh when compared to a standard sutured mesh for open inguinal hernia repair in terms of chronic pain or recurrence. No further trials are required to address this clinical question.","Bullen, N L; Hajibandeh, S; Hajibandeh, S; Smart, N J; Antoniou, S A",Surgical endoscopy,373,1

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of salinity stress on the expression of key genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of triterpenoids such as glycyrrhizin, betulinic acid, soyasaponins, and phytosterols in licorice root, as well as providing a phonemic platform to characterize antioxidant properties, glycyrrhizin, and total phenolic content. This study also includes measuring the gene expression level and glycyrrhizin content in leaves and roots of control plants. The studied genes included squalene synthase (SQS1 and SQS2), β-amyrin synthase (bAS), lupeol synthase (LUS), cycloartenol synthase (CAS), β-amyrin 11-oxidase (CYP88D6), and β-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (CYP93E6). Our results revealed that all of the mentioned genes were upregulated following the stress condition with different transcription rates. The highest increase (12-fold) was observed for the expression of the LUS gene, which is related to the betulinic acid pathway. Also, the highest content of glycyrrhizin was observed at 72 h post-treatment, which was consistent with the upregulated transcription levels of the glycyrrhizin pathway genes especially SQS1 and CYP88D6 at the same time. Correlation and stepwise regression analysis proved the key role of SQS1 gene in the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin. Antioxidant activity and phenolic content also were increased following stress condition. A comparison between the expression levels of SQS1 and other genes involved in the production of glycyrrhizin, phytosterols, and soyasaponins revealed a similar transcription trend, which shows the gene expression in the roots was significantly higher than the leaves. In contrast, SQS2 and LUS genes displayed a higher expression in leaf tissues. The genes related to betulinic acid biosynthetic pathway exhibited an expression rate different from other triterpenoid pathway genes, which could be observed in the leaves and roots of control plants and the roots of salt-treated plants. Furthermore, results showed that these two SQS genes have different expression rates due to different plant tissues (roots and leaves) and stress conditions. Importantly, in contrast to previous reports, we detected the glycyrrhizin in leaf tissues. This result may indicate the presence of a different genetic background in native Iranian licorice germplasm.","Shirazi, Zahra; Aalami, Ali; Tohidfar, Masoud; Sohani, Mohammad Mehdi",Protoplasma,373,9

Causes are multifactorial, with the size of the end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler a modifiable factor and potential target for risk reduction. Our goal was to examine the impact of the EEA stapler size on the risk of anastomotic complications in left-sided colorectal resections. METHODS A prospective divisional database was reviewed for consecutive elective left-sided resections with a colorectal anastomosis using an EEA stapler from January 2013 May 2018 inclusive. Patients were stratified into 25-29 mm or 30-33 mm cohorts. Patient and disease demographics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. The main outcome measures were the rate and factors associated with anastomotic complications. RESULTS Four hundred seventy-three cases were evaluated, 185 ( 39.1%) were in the 25-29 mm group and 288 (60.9%) in the 30-33 mm group. Patients were comparable in demographics and operative variables. More males were anastomosed with the 30-33 mm than with the 25-29 mm stapler (57.6% vs 28.6%, p < 0.01). Significantly more patients developed an anastomotic stricture with the 25-29 mm than with the 30-33 mm staplers (7.1% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.007). There was no significant difference in leak rates or reoperation/interventions between groups. On logistic regression, neither gender, operative indication nor approach were associated with anastomotic leak, readmission, or reoperation/intervention. Stapler size remained significantly associated with stricture (p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS The 25-29 mm EEA staplers were associated with an increased rate of anastomotic stricture compared to 30-33 mm staplers in left-sided colorectal anastomoses. As stapler size is a simple process measure that is easily modifyable, this is a potential target for improving anastomotic complication rates. Further controlled trials may help assess the impact of stapler size on improving patient and quality outcomes.","Reif de Paula, T; Simon, H; Shah, M; Lee-Kong, S; Kiely, J M; Kiran, R P; Keller, D S",Techniques in coloproctology,373,27

The training is based on the method of video analysis, involving simulated patients, making online implementation extremely challenging. AIM The study aims to present our experiences with the online training and to analyse the students' evaluations. METHOD We used the free version of Zoom for small groups of five students, a trainer and a simulated patient. All students participated in a situation that we recorded. The viewing of the recordings was followed by group discussion. Then, the students evaluated the course using an online questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS 74.4% of the students (n = 64) completed the questionnaire. 78.1-100% of them gave a good (4) or excellent (5) evaluation for the questions. The highest average score (4.95 ± 0.21) was given to the professionalism of the trainers, the lowest was given to the choice of topic of the theoretical part (4.06 ± 1.02). The majority of the students were satisfied with the course, they would be happy to attend it again; however, in-person learning still seems to be the preferred option. CONCLUSION The online practice was a success. In many ways, it proved to be an adequate replacement for the traditional form. The students evaluated the training similarly to those of previous years. The lack of personal contact is a limiting factor, thus, online practice should not be seen as an alternative to personal communication trainings; however, as an independent form of training, it can make a significant contribution to effective, modern education.

The following ethnic groups are included: Non-Latino Whites, African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, Spanish Caribbean Blacks, Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Other Latinos, Chinese, Filipinos, Vietnamese, and Other Asian Americans. In addition, the study assesses the extent to which social factors (socioeconomic status, stress exposure, social support) account for ethnic differences in physical-psychiatric comorbidity (PPC). DESIGN This study uses data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) (N = 12,787). Weighted prevalence rates of physical-psychiatric comorbidity (PPC) - the co-occurrence of physical and psychiatric health problems - are included to examine ethnic group differences among women and men. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to determine group differences in PPC before and after adjusting for social factors. RESULTS Puerto Rican men have significantly higher risk of PPC in comparison to Non-Latino White men. Among women, Blacks and Cubans were more likely than Non-Latino Whites to experience PPC as opposed to 'Psychiatric Only' health problems. Social factors account for the Puerto Rican/Non-Latino White difference in comorbid health among men, but have little explanatory power for understanding ethnic differences in comorbidity among women. CONCLUSION These findings have implications for medical care and can guide intervention programs in targeting a specific constellation of co-occurring physical and psychiatric health problems for diverse ethnic groups in the United States. As comorbidity rates increase, it is crucial to identify the myriad factors that give rise to ethnic group differences therein.","Erving, Christy L",Ethnicity & health,373,8

The association of race in a cohort of gynecologic oncology patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection is unknown. METHODS Data were abstracted from gynecologic oncology patients with COVID-19 infection among 8 New York City area hospital systems. A multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression model accounting for county clustering was used to analyze COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS Of 193 patients who had gynecologic cancer and COVID-19, 67 (34.7%) were Black, and 126 (65.3%) were non-Black. Black patients were more likely to require hospitalization compared with non-Black patients (71.6% [48 of 67] vs 46.0% [58 of 126]; P = .001). Of 34 (17.6%) patients who died from COVID-19, 14 (41.2%) were Black. Among those who were hospitalized, compared with non-Black patients, Black patients were more likely to: have ≥3 comorbidities (81.1% [30 of 37] vs 59.2% [29 of 49]; P = .05), to reside in Brooklyn (81.0% [17 of 21] vs 44.4% [12 of 27]; P = .02), to live with family (69.4% [25 of 36] vs 41.6% [37 of 89]; P = .009), and to have public insurance (79.6% [39 of 49] vs 53.4% [39 of 73]; P = .006). In multivariable analysis, among patients aged <65 years, Black patients were more likely to require hospitalization compared with non-Black patients (odds ratio, 4.87; 95% CI, 1.82-12.99; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS Although Black patients represented only one-third of patients with gynecologic cancer, they accounted for disproportionate rates of hospitalization (>45%) and death (>40%) because of COVID-19 infection; younger Black patients had a nearly 5-fold greater risk of hospitalization.

Studies reporting data on PLWHA affected by SARS-CoV-2 were considered for inclusion. The aim of this study was the systematic characterization of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWHA, particularly focusing on age, clinical findings at diagnosis, radiological features, therapeutic management and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Twenty three relevant articles were identified, which reported 164 adults with both HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, the large majority were males (120/142, 84.5%), often with one or more comorbidities. Fifteen cases needed intensive care treatment and 16 died. For each group, respectively three patients had underlying comorbidities. There were no studies on children. The included studies were mostly retrospective or case series/reports (19 studies). The overall risk of bias was moderate, due to the study types and characteristics. CONCLUSION It is still unclear if HIV infection may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease course, however some PLWHA and particularly males affected by ARV-related complications may be at greater risk of severe Covid-19 course.","Costenaro, Paola; Minotti, Chiara; Barbieri, Elisa; Giaquinto, Carlo; Donà, Daniele",Reviews in medical virology,373,12

The successful coordination of public health responses to disease threats, and in particular the epidemiological modelling underpinning infection control, has influenced economists' understanding of the risks posed to the stability of the financial system by 'contagion'. While the exportation of analytic models and frames of reference can be fruitful, reinvigorating the destination domain, such analogizing can have a distorting effect. There are differences between biological and financial systems. Moreover, the migration of highly context-specific epidemiological models may undermine the basis of the analogy.

METHODS Established synthetic methods and antiviral and cytostatic activity assays were used for the evaluation of new 1,2,4-triazole and purine acyclic nucleoside analogues. RESULTS The synthesis of new types of acyclic nucleoside analogues which incorporate 1,2,4-triazole or purine moiety bound via flexible methylenic spacer to the bis(1,2-hydroxymethyl) cyclopropane ring. None of the new compounds showed pronounced antiviral activities at subtoxic concentrations on a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses. Evaluation of their affinity for herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and varicella-zoster virus-encoded thymidine kinases (VZV TK) also showed that none of the compounds was able to significantly inhibit 1 μM deoxythymidine phosphorylation by HSV-1 and VZV TK at 500 μM concentrations. The in vitro cytostatic activity evaluation results indicated a weak antiproliferative activity for all tested compounds. Only 6-pyrrolylpurine derivative bearing a carboxylic group substituted cyclopropane ring produced a rather slight inhibitory effect at higher micromolar concentrations on a breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7) and no cytotoxic effect on human normal fibroblasts (WI 38). CONCLUSIONS The lack of antiherpetic activity may be due to poor, if any, recognition of the compounds by virus-induced nucleoside kinases as an alternative substrate to become metabolically activated.","Benci, Krešimir; Suhina, Tomislav; Mandić, Leo; Pavelić, Sandra Kraljević; Paravić, Andrea Tomljenović; Pavelić, Krešimir; Balzarini, Jan; Wittine, Karlo; Mintas, Mladen",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,373,1

The analysis reported here identifies characteristics, risk factors, and long-term outcome of endoleaks in patients treated with EVAR in the OVER cohort. METHODS The OVER trial enrolled 881 patients, of whom 439 received successful EVAR. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for endoleaks and secondary interventions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, longitudinal plots, and generalized linear mixed models methods were used to describe time to endoleak detection, resolution, or death. RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 6.2 ± 2.4 years, 135 patients (30.5%) developed 187 endoleaks. Four patients with EVAR went on to rupture; these four patients did not all have an endoleak. Mortality between patients who did and did not develop endoleaks was not significantly different. The 187 endoleaks included 12% type I, 76% type II, 3% type III, 3% type IV, and 6% indeterminate. Patient demographics and vascular risk factors were not associated with endoleak development. The presence of endoleaks resulted in an increase in aneurysm diameter over time (P < .0001). Fifty-three percent of endoleaks resolved spontaneously, and 31.9% received secondary interventions. The initial aneurysm size independently predicted a need for secondary interventions (P < .0003). Delayed type II endoleaks (detected >1 year after EVAR) were associated with aneurysm enlargement compared with the early counterpart. There was no difference in aneurysm size or length of survival between type II and other types of endoleak. CONCLUSIONS We present one of the most comprehensive and longest follow-up analyses of patients treated with aortic endografts. Endoleaks were common and negatively affected aneurysm diameter reduction. Delayed type II endoleaks were associated with late aneurysm diameter enlargement. Endoleaks and aneurysm diameter enlargement were not associated with excess mortality compared with those without these features.","Lal, Brajesh K; Zhou, Wei; Li, Ziyi; Kyriakides, Tassos; Matsumura, Jon; Lederle, Frank A; Freischlag, Julie",Journal of vascular surgery,373,24

The aim of this study was to assess whether percutaneous application of fibrin sealant in the hernia sac after LVHR reduces the incidence and volume of the postoperative seroma, and to analyze whether the percentage of patients achieving complete normalization of the abdominal wall increases. METHODS Prospective and comparative study. Patients were distributed into 2 control-case groups. Group 1 comprised patients submitted to LVHR using the double crown technique and a compressing bandage as the only method for prevent seroma. Group 2 comprised patients admitted to LVHR using the same technique together with percutaneous injection of fibrin sealant in the sac, and later applying the same bandage. Patients were examined clinically and radiologically at 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were included in each group. There were significant differences in the incidence of seroma by the day 7 after surgery (92% in group 1 vs. 64 % in group 2, p = 0.017) and by 1 month (72% in group 1 vs. 28% in group 2, p = 0.002). The difference was also significant regarding the achievement of normalization of the abdominal wall by day 7 (24% in group 1 vs. 52% in group 2, p = 0.041) and by month 1 (64% in group 1 vs. 88% in group 2, p = 0.047) after operation. Volume of seroma was larger among patients of group 1 after the week (p = 0.002) and 1 month after operation (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Fibrin sealant application after LVHR reduces the incidence and volume of the seroma 7 days and 1 month after surgery. The treated patients obtain a larger normalization of the abdominal wall 1 week and 1 month after the operation.","Morales-Conde, Salvador; Suárez-Artacho, Gonzalo; Socas, María; Barranco, Antonio",Surgical endoscopy,373,1

The upregulation of many cytokines is dependent on signaling through the Janus kinase 1 (JAK-1) and JAK-2 pathways. Ruxolitinib, a JAK-1 and JAK-2 inhibitor, is documented to have potent anti-inflammatory activity by targeting several cytokines and growth factors with proposed efficacy in the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 patients; therefore, this study examines the efficacy and tolerability of ruxolitinib for adult COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS This review was conducted using preferred reporting items for aystematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Six reviewers analyzed 1,120 results. Seven studies were selected and validated. A quantitative meta-analysis was further performed to evaluate clinical improvement at day 28, mortality at day 28, and oxygen requirements comparing treatment and standard of care groups. RESULTS 168 individuals were involved in the studies selected: 122 in cohort studies, 4 in case reports, and 41 in randomized controlled studies. The ruxolitinib group had a higher likelihood of clinical improvement by the 28th day of treatment when assessed with the standard of care (SOC) group (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53 - 4.16; P = 0.45; I² = 0%). The SOC group was at a higher risk of experiencing serious adverse events (OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.03 - 1.13; P = 0.07). Notably the SOC group had a higher likelihood of death (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.11-2.29; P = 0.07; I² = 0%). CONCLUSION Prior studies on ruxolitinib have demonstrated it is able to decrease inflammatory markers. In recent studies on COVID-19, treatment with ruxolitinib decreased the time on mechanical ventilation, hospitalization time, and the need for vasopressor support. Additionally, ruxolitinib showed decreased mortality and demonstrated improvement in lung congestion as evidenced by computerized tomography imaging. These findings warrant further clinical investigation into Ruxolitinib as a potential treatment approach for severe COVID-19.","Quiros, Jorge R; Ross-Comptis, Jennifer; Hathaway, Donald; Sarfraz, Azza; Sarfraz, Zouina; Grigoryan, Zhanna; Romero, Kimberly Anne; Gapizov, Abubakar; Príncipe-Meneses, Fortunato S; Somagutta, Manoj Reddy; Riva-Moscoso, Adrian; Kapasi, Abdulhusein",Infection & chemotherapy,373,5

DESIGN Pilot feasibility trial (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING Academic-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS Twenty women undergoing TLH for benign disease. INTERVENTIONS Participants underwent 1:1 randomization of energy method used for colpotomy (ultrasonic vs monopolar) and vaginal cuff closure suture (barbed vs nonbarbed). After intravenous administration of ICG, laser angiography was used to capture images of the vaginal cuff before and after closure. Three reviewers analyzed fluorescent images of vaginal cuffs to determine percent of cuff perimeter with adequate perfusion when open and length of vaginal cuff adequately perfused when closed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS ICG fluorescence was visible at the vaginal cuff in all participants. Mean time to appearance of ICG in the pelvis after administration was 19.8 ± 6.8 seconds (mean ± SD) preclosure, and 26.0 ± 22.2 seconds postclosure. With ultrasonic energy 67.5% ± 17.4% of open cuff perimeter and 74.4% ± 20.5% of closed cuff length were adequately perfused, whereas with monopolar energy use 59.1% ± 17.4% of the open cuff perimeter and 66.3% ± 15.4% of closed cuff length were adequately perfused. Cuffs closed with barbed suture showed adequate perfusion along 71.5% ± 15.1% of the length, whereas those closed with nonbarbed suture showed 68.9% ± 20.9% adequate perfusion. When normalized to cervical cup circumference, ultrasonic energy required 1.0 ± .2 s/mm, whereas monopolar energy required .8 ± .3 s/mm (p = .162). Linear regression showed no association of normalized time of energy activation to percentage of perimeter of open cuff (R2 = .007) or length of closed cuff (R2 = .005) with adequate perfusion. No complications related to intravenous ICG administration occurred. CONCLUSION Laser angiography with ICG allows evaluation of vascular perfusion at the vaginal cuff during TLH. This technique may facilitate future prospective studies examining causes for vaginal cuff dehiscence, a complication with potential for severe morbidity.","Beran, Benjamin D; Shockley, Marie; Arnolds, Katrin; Escobar, Pedro; Zimberg, Stephen; Sprague, Michael L",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,373,31

METHODS Medical records of 42 consecutive eyes of 34 patients diagnosed with OAG who underwent MLT were retrospectively reviewed. The effectiveness was determined using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Failure was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction of <20% from baseline, an IOP >21 mm Hg during two consecutive follow-up visits, or surgical intervention for OAG. To determine the impact of MLT surgical expertise on clinical effectiveness, the eyes were divided into two groups according to whether the procedure was conducted by an experienced specialist (defined as a glaucoma specialist who had conducted at least ten MLT procedures) or a less experienced glaucoma specialist. The difference in expertise was determined using a log-rank test. RESULTS MLT was conducted by three glaucoma specialists. The overall survival rates were 0.76, 0.48, and 0.44 at 1, 3, and 6mo, respectively. The survival rates for MLT performed by a less experienced glaucoma specialist were 0.62, 0.31, and 0.25 (n=21 eyes) at 1, 3, and 6mo, respectively, whereas the survival rates for MLT performed by an experienced glaucoma specialist were 0.90, 0.64, and 0.64 (n=21 eyes) at 1, 3, and 6mo, respectively. The log-rank test showed a significant difference in the survival curves of the two groups (P=0.0061). CONCLUSION The 6-month effectiveness of MLT for controlling IOP is relatively limited in eyes with OAG using maximal tolerable glaucoma eyedrops. However, its effectiveness may be improved if performed by a glaucoma specialist with sufficient MLT experience.","Kakihara, Shinji; Hirano, Takao; Imai, Akira; Kurenuma, Taihei; Chiku, Yoshiaki; Murata, Toshinori",International journal of ophthalmology,373,16

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the safety of vaccines recommended for children, adults, and pregnant women in the United States. METHODS We searched the literature in November 2020 to update a 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review by integrating newly available data. Studies of vaccines that used a comparator and reported the presence or absence of key adverse events were eligible. Adhering to Evidence-based Practice Center methodology, we assessed the strength of evidence (SoE) for all evidence statements. The systematic review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020180089). RESULTS Of 56,603 reviewed citations, 338 studies reported in 518 publications met inclusion criteria. For children, SoE was high for no increased risk of autism following measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. SoE was high for increased risk of febrile seizures with MMR. There was no evidence of increased risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccine at the latest follow-up (moderate SoE), nor of diabetes (high SoE). There was no evidence of increased risk or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for newer vaccines such as 9-valent human papillomavirus and meningococcal B vaccines. For adults, there was no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for the new adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine and recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine. We found no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) for key adverse events among pregnant women following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine, including stillbirth (moderate SoE). CONCLUSIONS Across a large body of research we found few associations of vaccines and serious key adverse events; however, rare events are challenging to study. Any adverse events should be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide.","Gidengil, Courtney; Goetz, Matthew Bidwell; Newberry, Sydne; Maglione, Margaret; Hall, Owen; Larkin, Jody; Motala, Aneesa; Hempel, Susanne",Vaccine,373,16

Many nonurgent surgeries are delayed to preserve hospital resources, and patient visits to health care settings are limited to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Providers must carefully weigh risks and benefits of delivering immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic. For breast cancer, a key difference is increased use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy due to deferral of many breast surgeries during the pandemic. In some cases, this necessitates increased use of genomic tumor profiling on core biopsy specimens to guide neoadjuvant therapy decisions. Breast cancer treatment during the pandemic requires multidisciplinary input and varies according to stage, tumor biology, comorbidities, age, patient preferences, and available hospital resources. We present here the Johns Hopkins Women's Malignancies Program approach to breast cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. We include algorithms based on tumor biology and extent of disease that guide management decisions during the pandemic. These algorithms emphasize medical oncology treatment decisions and demonstrate how we have operationalized the general treatment recommendations during the pandemic proposed by national groups, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic Breast Cancer Consortium. Our recommendations can be adapted by other institutions and medical oncology practices in accordance with local conditions and resources.

There is paucity of data on the association between EIH and angiotensin II in well-trained middle-aged marathoners. Therefore, we investigated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and total nitric oxide activity in middle-aged marathoners with EIH.Seventy middle-aged marathoners were divided into 3 groups: normal blood pressure ([NBPG] [n = 21]), EIH group ([EIHG] [n = 35]), and complex hypertension group ([CHG] [n = 14]). We defined NBPG as resting systolic BP/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) of ≤140/90 mm Hg and maximal exercise SBP of ≤210 mm Hg, EIHG as resting SBP/DBP ≤140/90 mm Hg and maximal exercise SBP of ≥210 mm Hg, and CHG as resting SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm Hg and maximal exercise SBP of ≥210 mm Hg. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and NO levels were measured before and 30 minutes after the graded exercise test.Renin level was elevated while angiotensin level was reduced after 30 minutes of graded exercise test. There was no change in angiotensin I and angiotensin converting enzyme levels. Comparing the groups, renin level was only elevated in the CHG during recovery, while aldosterone level was higher than the baseline level in the recovery phase in all groups. Angiotensin I level remained unchanged in all groups. Angiotensin II level reduced significantly in the NBPG group but remained at the baseline in the EIHG and CHG groups. NO level was unchanged in the NBPG group but reduced in the EIHG and CHG groups after exercise. At 3 minutes of recovery, SBP was the highest in the NBPG group, followed by the EIHG and CHG groups (P < .05).In conclusion, angiotensin II activity and reduced NO level are associated with EIH in middle-aged long-distance runners. Angiotensin II inhibitors may; therefore, be the more appropriate antihypertensive medication for runners with EIH.","Kim, Chul-Hyun; Park, Yongbum; Chun, Min Young; Kim, Young-Joo",Medicine,373,16

METHODS Our series includes thirteen patients, who underwent LLDN using 3-mm instruments and laparoscope and 5-mm transumbilical trocar. The patients were followed at 7 and 14 days from discharge and were specifically asked about their cosmetic satisfaction. At follow-up, the recipient graft function was controlled, as well as the donor's cosmetic results. Eight months after surgery, all thirteen patients were asked to fill out the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire and Scoring System (PSAQ). RESULTS All patients presented good recovery after surgery. Regarding cosmetic outcomes, the donors expressed their satisfaction toward the minimal incision size and optimal esthetic results at 7 and 14 days from discharge home. The low scores on each section of the PSAQ confirmed the favorable outcomes. Early graft function was satisfactory at 1 and 3 months after the kidney transplantation. Furthermore, there were no major complications in the recipients. CONCLUSIONS Our persistent positive results with the use of 3-mm instruments during LLDN support this technique as a good alternative to the standard laparoscopic approach for minimizing the incision site, while maintaining safety and excellent clinical outcomes. The fact that the general laparoscopic standards are maintained could make this approach a very attractive alternative to the other minimally invasive approaches for live donor nephrectomy. The hope is in that the higher degree of satisfaction in the donor population demonstrated in this study may likely enhance living kidney donation.","Breda, Alberto; Schwartzmann, Ivan; Emiliani, Esteban; Rodriguez-Faba, Oscar; Gausa, Lluis; Caffaratti, Jorge; de León, Xavier Ponce; Villavicencio, Humberto",World journal of urology,373,19

These proteins bind to and regulate target mRNA localization, stability, and translation. Their structure, expression and functions in bony fish are not well understood. Here, we characterized the zebrafish igf2bp2 gene and investigated its functional role in early development. Zebrafish igf2bp2 gives rise to 4 alternatively spliced transcripts. When expressed in cultured cells, all 4 proteins were detected in the cytoplasm. Igf2bp2-A, the longest isoform, has a domain structure similar to its mammalian counterpart. Igf2bp2-B lacks one of the C-terminal KH domains, while Igf2bp2-C lacks the two N-terminal RRM domains. Igf2bp 2-D lacks both regions. In adult fish, these igf2bp2 isoforms were detected exclusively in the oocyte. After fertilization, they disappeared within 6 hours post fertilization (hpf). At 20∼24 hpf, igf2bp2-A mRNA, but not other mRNAs, was re-expressed in the embryos including in primordial germ cells. Targeted knockdown of Igf2bp2s reduced the numbers of primordial germ cells but did not affect global patterning or growth. The effect was rescued by overexpression of Igf2bp2-A. Likewise, dominant-negative inhibition of Igf2bp2 resulted in a similar reduction in primordial germ cell number. These results not only provide new information about the structure and expression of zebrafish Igfbp2, but also reveal a critical role of this conserved RNA binding protein in primordial germ cell development.","Li, Mingyu; Rong, Xiaozhi; Lu, Ling; Li, Yun; Yao, Kai; Ge, Wei; Duan, Cunming",General and comparative endocrinology,373,1

Gluten exclusion from the diet failed to relieve symptoms of enteropathy in 127 (97.7%) of 130 patients with information. Complete remission of symptoms after discontinuation of ARB was reported in 233 (97.4%) of the 239 patients with information. Seven cases (2.8%) reported recurrence of symptoms after restarting olmesartan; rechallenge was not reported for the non-olmesartan ARBs. The retrospective studies conducted worldwide had inconsistent study designs (e.g. differences in periods of study and case definition) and findings. Conclusions Although enteropathy is rare, clinicians should remain vigilant of this potential adverse event even years after medication initiation.","Kamal, Ayesha; Fain, Christopher; Park, Angela; Wang, Peiqi; Gonzalez-Velez, Eduardo; Leffler, Daniel A; Hutfless, Susan M",Gastroenterology report,373,17

Real per capita provincial government health expenditures (GHE) over the period 2002-2006 are examined using panel regression analysis. Key determinants of real per capita provincial GHE are real provincial per capita general budget revenue, real provincial per capita transfers from the central government, the proportion of provincial population under age 15, urban employee basic health insurance coverage, and proportion of urban population. Roughly equal and relatively low elasticities of budget revenue and transfers imply that the GHE is a necessity rather than a luxury good, and transfers have yet to become efficient instruments for the fair allocation of health resources by policy makers. Moreover, severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak has increased the GHE, but we find no statistical evidence that provincial GHE have fluctuated according to the public health status.","Pan, Jay; Liu, Gordon G",Health economics,373,4

Because cooling may participate in heart rate control, we studied the respective impact of heart rate and temperature lowering on mortality. METHODS Post hoc analysis of the Sepsiscool randomized controlled trial database (NCT00527007). Cooling was applied to maintain normothermia (36.5-37 °C) during 48 h. We assessed the time spent below different thresholds of temperature and heart rate on day 14 mortality. The best threshold was selected by AUC-ROC and tested as a potential mediator of mortality reduction. Mediation analysis was adjusted for severity and treatments influencing temperature and heart rate evolution. Sensitivity analysis was done using only patients with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS A total of 197/200 patients with adequate heart rate and temperature monitoring were analyzed. The best threshold differentiating survivors and nonsurvivors was 38.4 °C for temperature and 95 b/min for heart rate. During the 48 h of intervention, cooling significantly increased the time spent with a temperature below 38.4 °C, p = 0.001, and with a heart rate below 95 b/min, p < 0.01. The longer was the time spent with a temperature below 38.4 °C, the lower was the mortality [adjOR 0.17 (0.06-0.49), p = 0.001]. The time spent with a heart rate below 95 b/min was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors [adjOR 0.68 (0.27-1.72), p = 0.42]. Mediation analysis showed that the time spent with a temperature below 38.4 °C was a significant mediator of mortality. CONCLUSION The time spent with a temperature below 38.4 °C was independently associated with patient's outcome and explained 73% of the effect of the randomization on the day 14 mortality. Heart rate lowering was not a mediator of mortality.","Schortgen, Frédérique; Charles-Nelson, Anaïs; Bouadma, Lila; Bizouard, Geoffray; Brochard, Laurent; Katsahian, Sandrine",Intensive care medicine,373,1

The aim of this review is to provide an update of the current state of knowledge on health surveillance in a globalized world. Three key areas will be highlighted in this review: 1) the role of the new International Health Regulations, 2) the emergence of new global health networks for surveillance and bioterrorism, and 3) the reshaping of guidelines for the collection, dissemination, and interventions in global surveillance. A discussion is also presented of the more important challenges of global health surveillance. Global surveillance has been reshaped by important changes in the new International Health Regulations and the rapid development of new global networks for disease surveillance and bioterrorism. These networks provide for the first time at the global scale real-time information about potential outbreaks and epidemics of newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. The recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic provide evidence of the benefits of the new global monitoring and of the importance of the World Health Organization in its coordinating role in the multilateral response of the global public health community.","Castillo-Salgado, Carlos",Epidemiologic reviews,373,1

It has been used for centuries for the treatment of fever and chills, and has been recently approved for the treatment of malaria due to its endoperoxidase properties. Progressively, research has found that artemisinins displayed multiple pharmacological actions against inflammation, viral infections, and cell and tumour proliferation, making them effective against diseases. Moreover, it has displayed a relatively safe toxicity profile. The use of artemisinins against different respiratory diseases has been investigated in lung cancer models and inflammatory-driven respiratory disorders. These studies revealed the ability of artemisinins in attenuating proliferation, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis, and in inducing apoptosis. Artemisinins can regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote cell cycle arrest, drive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induce Bak or Bax-dependent or independent apoptosis. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases. In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.","Cheong, Dorothy H J; Daniel Tan, W S; Fred Wong, W S; Tran, Thai",Pharmacological research,373,1

In light of this and the COVID-19 pandemic we aimed to assess whether these patients could be safely assessed without direct contact between the clinician and patient. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive patients seen in our 'blurred disc clinic' between August 2018 and October 2019. We then presented anonymous information from their referral letter, their visual fields and optic nerve images to two consultant neuro-ophthalmologists blinded to the outcome of the face-to-face consultation. In the simulated virtual clinic, the two consultants were asked to choose an outcome for each patient from discharge, investigate or bring in for a face-to-face assessment. RESULTS Out of 133 patients seen in the blurred disc clinic, six (4.5%) were found to have papilloedema. All six were identified by both neuro-ophthalmologists as needing a face-to-face clinic consultation from the simulated virtual clinic. One hundred and twenty (90%) patients were discharged from the face-to-face clinic at the first consultation. The two neuro-ophthalmologists chose to discharge 114 (95%) and 99 (83%) of these respectively from the simulated virtual clinic. The virtual clinic would have potentially missed serious pathology in only one patient who had normal optic discs but reported diplopia at the previous face-to-face consultation. CONCLUSIONS A virtual clinic model is an effective way of screening for papilloedema in patients referred to the eye clinic with suspicious optic discs. Unrelated or incidental pathology may be missed in a virtual clinic.","Jefferis, Joanna M; Griffith, Nigel; Blackwell, Daniel; Batty, Ruth; Hickman, Simon J; Pepper, Irene M",European journal of ophthalmology,373,31

This study aims to assess the effect of PE and E on rScO2 and rSpsO2, measured with near-infrared spectroscopy. A randomized 4-treatment cross-over trial was designed in 28 patients under BIS-titrated anaesthesia with sevoflurane. If MAP decreased more than 20% from baseline, incremental doses of PE and/or E were given according to the randomization (group I: E-PE-E, group II: PE-E-PE, group III: E-E-E, group IV: PE-PE-PE). rScO2 and rSpsO2 on T3-T4, T9-T10 and L1-L2 were recorded. Differences in rSO2 (post-pretreatment) within each group were analyzed with paired Student's t test. Differences in effects of PE and E on rScO2 and rSpsO2 were analyzed with linear mixed-modelling. Following PE administration, rScO2 decreased significantly (- 2.7% ± 3.5), while it remained stable following E (- 0.6% ± 3.6). Contrastingly, rSpsO2 at T3-T4, T9-T10 and L1-L2 slightly increased following PE (0.4% ± 2.5, 0.7% ± 2.0 and - 0.1% ± 1.4, respectively), while it decreased after E administration (- 1.3% ± 3.4%, - 0.7% ± 2.6% and - 1.3% ± 2.7%, respectively). Compared to E, PE administration was associated with a significant decrease in rScO2 (- 2.1%, 95% CI [- 3.1%, - 1.2%], p < 0.001). In contrast, compared to PE, E was associated with a significant decrease in rSpsO2 at T3-T4, T9-T10 and L1-L2 (- 2.0%, 95% CI [- 2.8, - 1.1], p < 0.001; - 1.4%, 95% CI [- 2.4%, - 0.4%], p = 0.006; and - 1.5%, 95% CI [- 2.3%, - 0.8%], p < 0.001, respectively).

The FCV-19S also showed good concurrent validity, as it was significantly and positively related to the Preventive Behaviors related to COVID-19 Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale as well as significantly and negatively related to the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. The scale also showed good internal consistency reliability. Further, the association of age with FCV-19S indicated that younger students experienced greater fear of COVID-19. The analyses of mean differences revealed that women as compared to men, bachelor's and master's students as compared to post-master's students, and unemployed students as compared to employed students experienced greater fear of the outbreak. Also, those suffering from severe anxiety experienced greater fear of COVID-19 followed by those suffering from moderate, mild, and minimal anxiety.

DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis), HHS (Hyperglycaemic Hyperosmolar State) and recently focused EDKA (Euglycaemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis) are life-threatening different entities. DKA and HHS have distinctly different pathophysiology but basic management protocols are the same. EDKA is just like DKA but without hyperglycaemia. T1D, particularly children are vulnerable to DKA and T2D, particularly elderly with comorbidities are vulnerable to HHS. But these are not always the rule, these acute conditions are often occur in different age groups with diabetes. It is essential to have a coordinated care from the multidisciplinary team to ensure the timely delivery of right treatment. DKA and HHS, in many instances can present as a mixed entity as well. Mortality rate is higher for HHS than DKA but incidences of DKA are much higher than HHS. The prevalence of HHS in children and young adults are increasing due to exponential growth of obesity and increasing T2D cases in this age group. Following introduction of SGLT2i (Sodium-GLucose co-Transporter-2 inhibitor) for T2D and off-label use in T1D, some incidences of EDKA has been reported. Healthcare professionals should be more vigilant during acute illness in diabetes patients on SGLT2i without hyperglycaemia to rule out EDKA. Middle aged, mildly obese and antibody negative patients who apparently resemble as T2D without any precipitating causes sometime end up with DKA which is classified as KPD (Ketosis-prone diabetes). Many cases can be prevented by following 'Sick day rules'. Better access to medical care, structured diabetes education to patients and caregivers are key measures to prevent acute metabolic crisis.","Muneer, Muhammad; Akbar, Ijaz",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,373,24

Methods: Double-blind randomized trial comparing tDCS with anode over the left DLPFC (groups: rectangular electrodes, circular electrodes, sham) and 2 active subgroup references (right shoulder vs. right DLPFC cathodes). Results: Twenty-four randomized participants were assessed. We indeed found higher average EEG power spectral density (PSD) across bands for circular vs. rectangular electrodes, largely confined to F3 and there was a significant increase at AF3 for low alpha (p=0.037). Significant differences included: increased PSD in low beta (p=0.024) and theta bands (p=0.021) at F3, and in theta (p=0.036) at FC5 for the right DLPFC vs. shoulder with no coherence changes. We also found PSD differences between active vs. sham tDCS at Fz for alpha (p=0.043), delta (p=0.036), high delta (p=0.030); and at FC1 for alpha (p=0.031), with coherence differences for F3-Fz in beta (p=0.044), theta (p=0.044), delta (p=0.037) and high delta (p=0.009). Conclusion: This pilot study despite having low statistical power given its small sample size shows that active left DLPFC tDCS modulates EEG frontocentrally and suggests that electrode shapes/reference locations affect its neurophysiological effects, such as increased low alpha power at AF3 using circular vs. rectangular electrodes.

Therefore, attempts to discover new antiviral agents in particular from natural compounds are required. In this study, we evaluated the possible inhibitory effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Sambucus ebulus (S. ebulus ) against HSV-1. Methods: S. ebulus extract was produced by maceration method. MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity effects of the S. ebulus extract; also, antiviral effects were measured both by test TCID50 and quantitative real-time PCR methods. To study the inhibitory impact of S. ebulus extract on the expression of HSV-1 antigens, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was also performed. All analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software v. 7.0. Results: In the postexposure assay of HSV-1 with S. ebulus extract at the highest nontoxic concentration (75 μg/mL), S. ebulus extract led to 2.6 log10 TCID50 reduction in infectious virus titer. At the highest nontoxic concentration, the S. ebulus extract led to inhibition rates of 91.2%, based on the quantitative real-time PCR assay results (p<0.001). Also, in the immunofluorescence assay, a significant reduction was observed in fluorescence emission intensity in HSV-1-infected cell treated with S. ebulus extract compared to the control group. Conclusion: S. ebulus extract is a novel and effective natural compound in reducing HSV-1 titer and future studies should be conducted to discover the complete mechanism of antiviral effect of this natural compound.","Ghaffari, Hadi; Ataei-Pirkooh, Angila; Mirghazanfari, Sayid Mahdi; Barati, Mohammad",Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,373,16

The proliferation and apoptosis in all groups of cells were detected, as well as the expression levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins, β-catenin and c-Myc. The results revealed that bortezomib could inhibit the proliferation of myeloma cells. The apoptotic rates of RPMI-8226 cells in the groups treated with 20, 50 and 80 nmol/l of bortezomib were 12.08±0.61, 35.97±3.11 and 57.22±5.47%, respectively, which were significantly higher than that in the control group (8.28±0.39%) (P<0.05).

Like all industrial sectors, the aviation sector must implement measures to reduce its climate impact. This paper focuses on the simulation and evaluation of climate scenarios for air transport. For this purpose, a specific tool (CAST for ""Climate and Aviation - Sustainable Trajectories"") has been developed at ISAE-SUPAERO. This tool follows a methodology for the assessment of climate impacts adapted to aviation. Firstly, models for the main levers of action, such as air traffic, aircraft energy consumption and energy decarbonization, are provided using trend projections from historical data or assumptions from the literature. Second, the evaluation of scenarios is based on aviation carbon budgets, which are also extended to non-CO2 effects using the concept of GWP*. Several scenario analyses are performed in this paper using CAST allowing different conclusions to be drawn. For instance, the modelling of the scenarios based on the more recent ATAG (Air Transport Action Group) commitments shows that aviation would consume 6.5% of the world carbon budget for +1.5 °C. Some illustrative scenarios are also proposed. By allocating 2.6% of the world carbon budget to aviation, it is shown that air transport is compatible with a +2 °C trajectory when the annual growth rate of air traffic varies between -1.8% and +2.9%, depending on the technological improvements considered. However, using the same methodology for a +1.5 °C trajectory shows that a drastic decrease in air traffic is necessary. Lastly, analyses including non-CO2 effects emphasize the importance of implementing specific strategies for mitigating contrails.","Planès, T; Delbecq, S; Pommier-Budinger, V; Bénard, E",Journal of environmental management,373,31

Numerous wearable technologies specific to physical activity and diet are available, but it is unclear if these are effective at improving weight loss. Objective To test the hypothesis that, compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (standard intervention), a technology-enhanced weight loss intervention (enhanced intervention) would result in greater weight loss. Design, Setting, Participants Randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and enrolling 471 adult participants between October 2010 and October 2012, with data collection completed by December 2014. Interventions Participants were placed on a low-calorie diet, prescribed increases in physical activity, and had group counseling sessions. At 6 months, the interventions added telephone counseling sessions, text message prompts, and access to study materials on a website. At 6 months, participants randomized to the standard intervention group initiated self-monitoring of diet and physical activity using a website, and those randomized to the enhanced intervention group were provided with a wearable device and accompanying web interface to monitor diet and physical activity. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome of weight was measured over 24 months at 6-month intervals, and the primary hypothesis tested the change in weight between 2 groups at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included body composition, fitness, physical activity, and dietary intake. Results Among the 471 participants randomized (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40; age range, 18-35 years; 28.9% nonwhite, 77.2% women), 470 (233 in the standard intervention group, 237 in the enhanced intervention group) initiated the interventions as randomized, and 74.5% completed the study. For the enhanced intervention group, mean base line weight was 96.3 kg (95% CI, 94.2-98.5) and 24-month weight 92.8 kg (95% CI, 90.6- 95.0) [corrected]. For the standard intervention group, mean baseline weight was 95.2kg (95%CI,93.0-97.3)and24-month weight was 89.3 kg (95%CI, 87.1-91.5) [corrected]. Weight change at 24 months differed significantly by intervention group (estimated mean weight loss, 3.5 kg [95% CI, 2.6-4.5} in the enhanced intervention group and 5.9 kg [95% CI, 5.0-6.8] in the standard intervention group; difference, 2.4 kg [95% CI, 1.0-3.7]; P = .002). Both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, with no significant difference between groups. Conclusions and Relevance Among young adults with a BMI between 25 and less than 40, the addition of a wearable technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 24 months. Devices that monitor and provide feedback on physical activity may not offer an advantage over standard behavioral weight loss approaches.

Our goal was to study the evolution of flow-diverter endothelialization and thrombus organization at different time points after flow-diverter treatment in giant fusiform aneurysms to better understand reasons for flow-diverter thrombosis and delayed aneurysm ruptures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two giant anterior and 2 posterior circulation aneurysms, all of which had partially thrombosed before treatment, were studied. An unruptured, untreated posterior circulation aneurysm was used as a control. Each specimen was removed at 7 days or at 6, 9, or 13 months after flow-diverter treatment. The 3 patients who survived longer than 7 days were followed up by angiography and MR imaging. Formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were stained by using H&E, Van Gieson elastic, CD34, h-Caldesmon, and Picrosirius stains and studied by light microscopy. RESULTS According to angiography, aneurysms were found to be obliterated partially at 6 and 9 months and completely at 13 months. MR imaging revealed that mass effect remained unchanged in each case. Sections of the flow diverter within the normal parent artery were covered by an endothelialized fibrous layer as early as 6 months, but there was no tissue coverage or endothelialization seen even at 13 months inside the aneurysm itself. Each treated aneurysm had a thin wall with complete lack of smooth muscle cells. No signs of thrombus organization were found at any of the time points studied. CONCLUSIONS Endothelialization of the flow diverter in giant fusiform aneurysms may not occur and thrombus organization may not be initiated inside these aneurysms for as long as 1 year, which explains delayed flow-diverter thrombosis and the possibility of delayed ruptures.","Szikora, I; Turányi, E; Marosfoi, M",AJNR.

This observation suggests functional differences in the motor networks subserving bicycling and walking. However, a direct comparison of brain activity related to bicycling and walking has never been performed, neither in healthy participants nor in patients. Such a comparison could potentially help elucidating the cortical involvement in motor control and the mechanisms through which bicycling ability may be preserved in patients with freezing of gait. The aim of this study was to contrast the cortical oscillatory dynamics involved in bicycling and walking in healthy participants. To this end, EEG and EMG data of 14 healthy participants were analyzed, who cycled on a stationary bicycle at a slow cadence of 40 revolutions per minute (rpm) and walked at 40 strides per minute (spm), respectively. Relative to walking, bicycling was associated with a stronger power decrease in the high beta band (23-35 Hz) during movement initiation and execution, followed by a stronger beta power increase after movement termination. Walking, on the other hand, was characterized by a stronger and persisting alpha power (8-12 Hz) decrease. Both bicycling and walking exhibited movement cycle-dependent power modulation in the 24-40 Hz range that was correlated with EMG activity. This modulation was significantly stronger in walking. The present findings reveal differential cortical oscillatory dynamics in motor control for two types of complex coordinated motor behavior, i.e., bicycling and walking. Bicycling was associated with a stronger sustained cortical activation as indicated by the stronger high beta power decrease during movement execution and less cortical motor control within the movement cycle. We speculate this to be due to the more continuous nature of bicycling demanding less phase-dependent sensory processing and motor planning, as opposed to walking.","Storzer, Lena; Butz, Markus; Hirschmann, Jan; Abbasi, Omid; Gratkowski, Maciej; Saupe, Dietmar; Schnitzler, Alfons; Dalal, Sarang S",Frontiers in human neuroscience,373,1

The aim of this study was to assess a predictive model using preoperatively accessible clinical parameters and radiographic features developed and validated to predict MVI. This predictive model can distinguish clinical outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) for HCC patients. METHODS In total, 455 HCC patients who underwent LT between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019, were retrospectively enrolled in two centers in China as a training cohort (ZFA center; n = 244) and a test cohort (SLA center; n = 211). Univariate and multivariate backward logistic regression analysis were used to select the significant clinical variables which were incorporated into the predictive nomogram associated with MVI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on clinical parameters were plotted to predict MVI in the training and test sets. RESULTS Univariate and multivariate backward logistic regression analysis identified four independent preoperative risk factors for MVI: α-fetoprotein (AFP) level (p < 0.001), tumor size ((p < 0.001), peritumoral star node (p = 0.003), and tumor margin (p = 0.016). The predictive nomogram using these predictors achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.85 and 0.80 in the training and test sets. Furthermore, MVI could discriminate different clinical outcomes within the Milan criteria (MC) and beyond the MC. CONCLUSIONS The nomogram based on preoperatively clinical variables demonstrated good performance for predicting MVI. MVI may serve as a supplement to the MC.","Zhang, Wenhui; Liu, Zhikun; Chen, Junli; Dong, Siyi; Cen, Beini; Zheng, Shusen; Xu, Xiao",Translational oncology,373,1

Sixteen studies, representing data from 17 patients, were included for final analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to synthesis available data. Eleven protein kinase inhibitors were implicated, with a mean exposure of 13 months prior to MRONJ. Renal cell carcinoma was the primary diagnosis in 41.2% of patients. Patient symptoms, clinical features, radiographic findings and histological findings were consistent with those previously described in patients with MRONJ associated with antiresorptive medications. Overall, there was a 75% rate of cure, with a mean healing time of 17.2 weeks. Patients were treated surgically in 53.3% of the cases. Patients treated surgically achieved complete healing in 100% of cases, compared with 58% in those treated conservatively. Drug discontinuation was reported in 69.2% of patients. Patients who had the offending drug discontinued achieved complete healing in 75% of cases, compared with 50% in those who did not. Evidence relating to MRONJ associated with protein kinase inhibitors is of low quality. From the available data, there are notable differences relating to patient characteristics, treatment strategies and outcomes, between MRONJ associated with protein kinase inhibitors compared with antiresorptives. Higher quality evidence is required to support the findings of this review.","Mian, Mustafa; Sreedharan, Subhashaan; Kumar, Ricky",Oral and maxillofacial surgery,373,19

However, lignocellulose recalcitrance hinders microbial degradation, especially in case of contaminated materials such as creosote (CRO)-treated wood, which necessitates appropriate processing in order to eliminate pollution. This study might be the first to explore a novel bacterial consortium SST-4, for decomposing birchwood sawdust, capable of concurrently degrading lignocellulose and CRO compounds. Afterwards, SST-4 which stands for molecularly identified bacterial strains Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BSW-11, Shewanella putrefaciens BSW-18, Bacillus cereus BSW-23, and Novosphingobium taihuense BSW-25 was evaluated in terms of biological sawdust pre-treatment, resulting in effective lignocellulose degradation and 100% removal of phenol and naphthalene. Subsequently, the maximum biogas production observed was 18.7 L/kg VS, while cumulative methane production was 162.8 L/kg VS, compared to 88.5 without microbial pre-treatment. The cumulative energy production from AD-I and AD-II through biomethanation was calculated as 3177.1 and 5843.6 KJ/kg, respectively. The pretreatment process exhibited a significant increase in the energy yield by 83.9%. Lastly, effective CRO detoxification was achieved with EC50 values exceeding 90%, showing the potential for an integrated process of effective contaminated wood management and bioenergy production.","Ali, Sameh Samir; Jiao, Haixin; Mustafa, Ahmed M; Koutra, Eleni; El-Sapagh, Shimaa; Kornaros, Michael; Elsamahy, Tamer; Khalil, Maha; Bulgariu, Laura; Sun, Jianzhong",Journal of hazardous materials,373,1

METHODS We describe telemedicine onboarding and utilization across a statewide oncology practice, covering 221 sites of service and more than 650 practitioners. We describe qualitatively the onboarding process of a diverse set of administrative, technical, and clinical partners. We describe quantitatively utilization throughout the practice. We describe a survey conducted to enlighten barriers and opportunities for optimal utilization. RESULTS Multistakeholder education was directed to clinical teams, administrative and technical support staff, and patients through webinars and team meetings. Utilization was high from April through October 2020, representing 15% to 20% of new-patient visits and 20% to 25% of established-patient visits. In a survey offered to all clinicians, 96% of respondents indicated they are using telemedicine, with 33% using it for more than 25% of patient encounters. Among respondents, 59% reported that the use of telemedicine helps expedite diagnosis and treatment more than seeing patients in person in the clinic, 55% of respondents managed urgent issues by telemedicine, 80% believed that patients benefited From urgent assessment by telemedicine, and 57% believed an emergency department visit or a hospitalization was avoided because of a telemedicine visit. Most clinicians reported that patients enjoy benefits of telemedicine because of decreased exposure risk, decreased transportation requirements, and ease of including caregivers in the visit with the treating clinician. The most common barriers to patients accessing telemedicine were technical challenges and broadband access. Despite this, less than 5% of respondents routinely use telephone-only communication, as most typically use bimodal audio/video communication. Many clinicians have expansion ideas on how telemedicine can further expand the longitudinal care delivery for our patient population. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine can be implemented successfully across a large statewide oncology practice and service a high volume of patients. Clinicians utilize telemedicine for new and established patients with minimal dysfunction. Clinicians believe patients benefit From telemedicine For new, established, and urgent care visits.

Dip-tanksters and febrilers had evidence of past infection to Rickettsia spp. (IgG 92.2% and 63.4%, respectively) and C. burnetii (IgG 60.9% and 37.8%, respectively). No Brucella infection or current Bartonella infection was found in the dip-tanksters, although they had higher levels of recent exposure to Leptospira spp. (IgM 21.9%) compared to the febrilers. Low levels of West Nile and Sindbis, and no Rift Valley fever virus exposure were found in either groups. The only risk factor found to be significant was attending dip-tanks in febrilers for Q fever (p = 0.007). Amoxicillin is the local standard treatment for AFI, but would not be effective for Bartonella spp. infections, SFG rickettsiosis, Q fever infections, or the viral infections. There is a need to revise AFI treatment algorithms, educate medical and veterinary staff about these pathogens, especially SFG rickettsiosis and Q fever, support disease surveillance systems, and inform the population about reducing tick and surface water contact.","Simpson, Gregory J G; Quan, Vanessa; Frean, John; Knobel, Darryn L; Rossouw, Jennifer; Weyer, Jacqueline; Marcotty, Tanguy; Godfroid, Jacques; Blumberg, Lucille H",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,373,31

Methods An electronic survey was developed to record the general characteristics of the laboratory, as well as the pre-analytical, analytical, post-analytical and operational practices of biochemistry laboratories that are managing clinical samples of patients with COVID-19. Results A total of 1210 submissions were included in the analysis. The majority of responses came from hospital central/core laboratories that serve hospital patient groups and handle moderate daily sample volumes. There has been a decrease in the use of pneumatic tube transport, increase in hand delivery and increase in number of layers of plastic bags for samples of patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Surgical face masks and gloves are the most commonly used personal protective equipment (PPE). Just >50% of the laboratories did not perform an additional decontamination step on the instrument after analysis of samples from patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A fifth of laboratories disallowed add-on testing on these samples. Less than a quarter of laboratories autoclaved their samples prior to disposal. Conclusions The survey responses showed wide variation in pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical practices in terms of PPE adoption and biosafety processes. It is likely that many of the suboptimal biosafety practices are related to practical local factors, such as limited PPE availability and lack of automated instrumentation.","Loh, Tze Ping; Horvath, Andrea Rita; Wang, Cheng-Bin; Koch, David; Lippi, Giuseppe; Mancini, Nicasio; Ferrari, Maurizio; Hawkins, Robert; Sethi, Sunil; Adeli, Khosrow",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,373,19

METHODS In the DEFINITIVE LE trial, follow-up assessments occurred up to 1 year postprocedure. Of the 800 patients enrolled, 145 subjects with 189 infrapopliteal lesions met the criteria for this analysis. Seventy (48.3%) and 75 (51.7%) patients were suffering critical limb ischemia (CLI) and intermittent claudication, respectively; 68.3% (99/145) had diabetes. The mean lesion length was 58±44 mm (all lesions); 20.2% were occluded. The primary endpoint for patients with claudication was duplex ultrasound-derived primary patency, while for subjects with CLI it was freedom from major amputation of the target limb at 1 year. Endpoints and adverse events were independently assessed. RESULTS Procedure success (≤30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 84% of treated lesions. The 1-year primary patency rate was 84% (claudicants 89.6% and CLI patients 78%, p=0.11), and the freedom from major amputation rate was 97.1% (claudicants 100% and CLI 93.8%, p=0.03). In both claudication and CLI patients, significant improvements in Rutherford category and objective measures of walking distance and quality of life were seen at 1 year in comparison to baseline. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that directional atherectomy in infrapopliteal arteries results in promising technical and clinical results at 1 year for claudicant as well as CLI patients.","Rastan, Aljoscha; McKinsey, James F; Garcia, Lawrence A; Rocha-Singh, Krishna J; Jaff, Michael R; Noory, Elias; Zeller, Thomas",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,373,24

The policy responses of governments to the pandemic should be integrated with public behavioral changes. This study examines public attitudes, practices and perceived quarantine competency in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional descriptive design using an online survey was employed. Convenience and snowball sampling were adopted, and 1022 valid responses were received. FINDINGS Most respondents demonstrated satisfactory practices, including wearing face masks (76.5%), keeping a safe distance (97.8%) and appropriate hand hygiene (99.2%). Fear of stigma (8.9%) and of financial consequences (0%) were minimal drivers of underreporting of symptoms among the respondents, whereas uncertainty of the relevance of symptoms (30.3%) was a main cause of not reporting to health authorities. Most participants (73.4%) abided by government instructions due to fear of infection rather than of legal penalties. Participants, especially females and Saudi citizens, reported a high level of perceived quarantine competence (12.9±2.59). Spearman's rho correlation showed a significant positive association between wearing face masks and other precautionary practices, including keeping a safe distance (0.25, p<0.01) and frequent handwashing (0.224, p<0.01), which rules out the concern that wearing face masks would result in less adherence of the participants to other protective measures. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that COVID-19 awareness programs should focus more on males and non-Saudi populations. We also recommend the development of screening protocols and education programs for asthmatic patients in Saudi Arabia to avoid the consequences of confusing COVID-19 symptoms with those of asthma.","Almarwani, Abdulaziz Mofdy; Aljohani, Mohammed Saeed; Eweda, Ghada",International journal of clinical practice,373,25

These differences highlight a fundamental question of microbial pathogenesis: why are some individuals susceptible to infectious diseases while others who acquire the same microbe remain well? For most of human history, the answer assumed the hand of providence. With the advent of the germ theory of disease, the focus on disease causality became the microbe, but this did not explain how there can be different outcomes of infection in different individuals with the same microbe. Here we examine the attributes of susceptibility in the context of the ""damage-response framework"" of microbial pathogenesis. We identify 11 attributes that, although not independent, are sufficiently distinct to be considered separately: microbiome, inoculum, sex, temperature, environment, age, chance, history, immunity, nutrition, and genetics. We use the first letter of each to create the mnemonic MISTEACHING, underscoring the need for caution in accepting dogma and attributing disease causality to any single factor. For both populations and individuals, variations in the attributes that assemble into MISTEACHING can create an enormity of combinations that can in turn translate into different outcomes of host-microbe encounters. Combinatorial diversity among the 11 attributes makes identifying ""signatures"" of susceptibility possible. However, with their inevitable uncertainties and propensity to change, there may still be a low likelihood for prediction with regard to individual host-microbe interactions, although probabilistic prediction may be possible.","Casadevall, Arturo; Pirofski, Liise-Anne",Infection and immunity,373,1

Advanced age and female sex are two of the most prominent risk factors for AD. AD is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, especially in the cortex and hippocampus, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed to be an early event in the onset and progression of the disease. Our results showed early perturbations in mitochondrial function in 3xTg mouse brain, with the cortex being more susceptible to mitochondrial changes than the hippocampus. In the cortex of 3xTg females, decreased coupled and uncoupled respiration were evident early (at 2 months of age), while in males it appeared later at 6 months of age. We observed increased coupled respiration in the hippocampus of 2-month-old 3xTg females, but no changes were detected later in life. Changes in mitochondrial dynamics were indicated by decreased mitofusin (Mfn2) and increased dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) (only in females) in the hippocampus and cortex of 3xTg mice.

Bacterial capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are poorly immunogenic, but anti-CPS antibodies are essential to the host defense against encapsulated bacteria. In addition to the previously known serotypes 2 and 14, that are non-immunogenic, we have recently purified and described the CPS structures for serotypes 1, 1/2, 3, 7, 8, and 9. Here, we aimed to elucidate how these new structurally diverse CPSs interact with the immune system to generate anti-CPS antibody responses. CPS-stimulated dendritic cells produced significant levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 3, partially via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2- and myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent pathways, and CCL2, via TLR-independent mechanisms. Mice immunized with purified serotype 3 CPS adjuvanted with TiterMax Gold® produced an opsonizing IgG response, whereas other CPSs or adjuvants were negative. Mice hyperimmunized with heat-killed S. suis serotypes 3 and 9 both produced anti-CPS type 1 IgGs, whereas serotypes 7 and 8 remained negative. Also, mice infected with sublethal doses of S. suis serotype 3 produced primary anti-CPS IgM and IgG responses, of which only IgM were boosted after a secondary infection. In contrast, mice sublethaly infected with S. suis serotype 9 produced weak anti-CPS IgM and IgG responses following a secondary infection. This study provides important information on the divergent evolution of CPS serotypes with highly different structural and/or biochemical properties within S. suis and their interaction with the immune system.","Goyette-Desjardins, Guillaume; Auger, Jean-Philippe; Dolbec, Dominic; Vinogradov, Evgeny; Okura, Masatoshi; Takamatsu, Daisuke; Van Calsteren, Marie-Rose; Gottschalk, Marcelo; Segura, Mariela",Infection and immunity,373,1

Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and synthesised qualitatively. In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral, mucolytic, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease. Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited. Many trials had a moderate-to-high risk of bias, particularly in terms of blinding; most were short-term and some included low patient numbers.This review highlights the need for well-designed clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 to increase the quality of available evidence.

A vaccination coverage survey and vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) risk analysis were undertaken to clarify the VPD risk and vaccination needs. This was followed by a measles Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA). We describe the methods and results used for this prioritisation activity around vaccination in Kobanê in 2015. Methods We implemented a pre-SIA survey in 135 randomly-selected households in Kobanê using a vaccination history questionnaire for all children <5 years. We conducted a VPD Risk Analysis using MSF 'Preventive Vaccination in Humanitarian Emergencies' guidance to prioritize antigens with the highest public health threat for mass vaccination activities. A Measles SIA was then implemented and followed by vaccine coverage survey in 282 randomly-selected households targeting children <5 years. Results The pre-SIA survey showed that 168/212 children (79.3%; 95%CI=72.7-84.6%) had received one vaccine or more in their lifetime. Forty-three children (20.3%; 95%CI: 15.1-26.6%) had received all vaccines due by their age; only one was <12 months old and this child had received all vaccinations outside of Syria. The VPD Risk Analysis prioritised measles, Haemophilus Influenza type B (Hib) and Pneumococcus vaccinations. In the measles SIA, 3410 children aged 6-59 months were vaccinated. The use of multiple small vaccination sites to reduce risks associated with crowds in this active conflict setting was noted as a lesson learnt. The post-SIA survey estimated 82% (95%CI: 76.9-85.9%; n=229/280) measles vaccination coverage in children 6-59 months. Discussion As a result of the conflict in Syria, the progressive collapse of the health care system in Kobanê has resulted in low vaccine coverage rates, particularly in younger age groups. The repeated displacements of the population, attacks on health institutions and exodus of healthcare workers, challenge the resumption of routine immunization in this conflict setting and limit the use of SIAs to ensure sustainable immunity to VPDs. We have shown that the risk for several VPDs in Kobanê remains high. Conclusion We call on all health actors and the international community to work towards re-establishment of routine immunisation activities as a priority to ensure that children who have had no access to vaccination in the last five years are adequately protected for VPDs as soon as possible.","de Lima Pereira, Alan; Southgate, Rosamund; Ahmed, Hikmet; O'Connor, Penelope; Cramond, Vanessa; Lenglet, Annick",PLoS currents,373,1

Drawing upon scarcity theory, the purpose of this study was to examine whether the economic stressors of perceived job insecurity and perceived financial insecurity are related to employee self-reports of enacting such behaviors. Moreover, we tested propositions regarding the impact of two state-level contextual variables that may moderate those relationships: the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits and extensiveness of statewide COVID-19-related restrictions. Using a multilevel data set of N = 745 currently employed U.S. workers nested within 43 states, we found that both job insecurity and financial insecurity were negatively related to the enactment of the CDC-recommended guidelines. However, the state-level variables acted as cross-level moderators, such that the negative relationship between job insecurity and compliance with the CDC guidelines was attenuated within states that have a more robust unemployment system. However, working in a state with more extensive COVID-19 restrictions seemed to primarily benefit more financially secure workers. When statewide policies were more restrictive, employees reporting more financial security were more likely to enact the CDC-recommended guidelines compared to their financially insecure counterparts. We discuss these findings in light of the continuing need to develop policies to address the public health crisis while also protecting employees facing economic stressors.

Cerebrovascular autoregulation, the mechanism that maintains cerebral perfusion during changes in blood pressure, may influence outcomes. Our objective was to describe the relationship between acute autoregulatory vasoreactivity during treatment and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age. METHODS In a pilot study of 28 neonates with HIE, we measured cerebral autoregulatory vasoreactivity with the hemoglobin volume index (HVx) during therapeutic hypothermia, rewarming, and the first 6 h of normothermia. The HVx, which is derived from near-infrared spectroscopy, was used to identify the individual optimal mean arterial blood pressure (MAPOPT) at which autoregulatory vasoreactivity is greatest. Cognitive and motor neurodevelopmental evaluations were completed in 19 children at 21-32 months of age. MAPOPT, blood pressure in relation to MAPOPT, blood pressure below gestational age + 5 (ga + 5), and regional cerebral oximetry (rSO2) were compared to the neurodevelopmental outcomes. RESULTS Nineteen children who had HIE and were treated with therapeutic hypothermia performed in the average range on cognitive and motor evaluations at 21-32 months of age, although the mean performance was lower than that of published normative samples. Children with impairments at the 2-year evaluation had higher MAPOPT values, spent more time with blood pressure below MAPOPT, and had greater blood pressure deviation below MAPOPT during rewarming in the neonatal period than those without impairments. Greater blood pressure deviation above MAPOPT during rewarming was associated with less disability and higher cognitive scores. No association was observed between rSO2 or blood pressure below ga + 5 and neurodevelopmental outcomes. CONCLUSION In this pilot cohort, motor and cognitive impairments at 21-32 months of age were associated with greater blood pressure deviation below MAPOPT during rewarming following therapeutic hypothermia, but not with rSO2 or blood pressure below ga + 5. This suggests that identifying individual neonates' MAPOPT is superior to using hemodynamic goals based on gestational age or rSO2 in the acute management of neonatal HIE.","Burton, Vera Joanna; Gerner, Gwendolyn; Cristofalo, Elizabeth; Chung, Shang-en; Jennings, Jacky M; Parkinson, Charlamaine; Koehler, Raymond C; Chavez-Valdez, Raul; Johnston, Michael V; Northington, Frances J; Lee, Jennifer K",BMC neurology,373,16

Guidelines to manage post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia are available for adults, but not children. The objective of this review was to identify practices related to hypocalcemia prevention and management in pediatric patients. METHODS We identified studies examining the prevention and management of hypocalcemia in pediatric patients post-thyroidectomy within PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Three independent reviewers screened citations and reviewed full-text papers. RESULTS A total of 15 studies were included, representing 1552 patients. The overall study quality was weak with lack of randomization and inconsistent outcome reporting. The pooled incidence of hypocalcemia from the 15 studies was 35.5% for transient hypocalcemia and 4.2% for permanent hypocalcemia. All studies discussed post-operative hypocalcemia treatment, with most patients requiring admission for intra-venous calcium therapy. One study described a protocol discharging asymptomatic patients on calcitriol and calcium. Three studies discussed preoperative calcium supplementation in patients at risk of hypocalcemia. No studies examined routine use of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation to prevent post-operative hypocalcemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 57 patients (37 male, 20 female; age range, 22-86 y) underwent 62 IVC stent placement procedures using 97 stents (47 Wallstents, 15 S.M.A.R.T. stents, 18 Wallflex stents, 17 others) from 2005 to 2016 for malignant IVC obstruction caused by hepatic metastases (n = 22; 39%), primary hepatic malignancy (n = 16; 28%), retroperitoneal metastases (n = 16; 28%), or other primary malignancy (n = 5; 9%). Presenting symptoms included lower-extremity edema (n = 54; 95%), ascites (n = 28; 50%), and perineal edema (n = 14; 25%). Sixteen percent (n = 10) and 10% (n = 6) of the procedures involved tumor and bland thrombus, respectively. RESULTS Stent placements resulted in 100% venographic patency and significantly decreased pressure gradients (P < .0001). Lower-extremity swelling, perineal swelling, and abdominal distension improved within 7 days in 83% (35 of 42), 100% (9 of 9), and 40% (6 of 15) of patients, respectively, and at 30 days after the procedure in 86% (25 of 29), 89% (8 of 9), and 80% (4 of 5) of patients, respectively. Increased pre- and post-stent placement pressure gradients were associated with worse outcomes. A 4% stent misplacement rate (4 of 97) was related to the use of Wallstents with caudal stent tapering, asymmetric deployment superior to the obstruction, suprahepatic IVC involvement, and decreased stent adherence to the IVC wall as a result of local mechanical factors. CONCLUSIONS Stent placement is reliable, rapid, and durable in improving malignant IVC syndrome. Understanding of technical and anatomic factors can improve accuracy and avoid complications of stent misplacement.","Devcic, Zlatko; Techasith, Tust; Banerjee, Arjun; Rosenberg, Jarrett K; Sze, Daniel Y",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,373,8

They are also a conduit for legal and illegal trade in wildlife, which threatens thousands of species. Yet wet markets supply food to millions of people around the world, and differ drastically in their physical composition, the goods they sell, and the subsequent risks they pose. As such, policy makers need to know how to target their actions to efficiently safeguard human health and biodiversity without depriving people of ready access to food. Here, we propose a taxonomy of wet markets, oriented around the presence of live or dead animals, and whether those animals are domesticated or wild (either captive-reared or wild-caught). We assess the dimensions and levels of risk that different types of wet markets pose to people and to biodiversity. We identify six key risk factors of wet markets that can affect human health: (1) presence of high disease-risk animal taxa, (2) presence of live animals, (3) hygiene conditions, (4) market size, (5) animal density and interspecies mixing, and (6) the length and breadth of animal supply chains. We also identify key factors informing risk to biodiversity. Finally, we recommend targeted, risk-adjusted policies to more efficiently and humanely address the dangers posed by wet markets.","Lin, Bing; Dietrich, Madeleine L; Senior, Rebecca A; Wilcove, David S",The Lancet.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-two patients with 43 malignant liver lesions (23/20: metastases/hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC)) underwent liver MRI (3.0 T) before (<1 month) and after RF ablation (at 1, 3 and 6 months) using T2-, gadolinium-enhanced T1- and DWI-weighted MR sequences. Jointly, two radiologists prospectively measured ADCs for each lesion by means of two different regions of interest (ROIs), first including the whole lesion and secondly the area with the visibly most restricted diffusion (MRDA) on ADC map. Changes of ADCs were evaluated with ANOVA and Dunnett tests. RESULTS Thirty-one patients were successfully treated, while one patient was excluded due to focal recurrence. In metastases (n=22), the ADC in the whole lesion and in MRDA showed an up-and-down evolution. In HCC (n=20), the evolution of ADC was more complex, but with significantly higher values (p=0.013) at 1 and 6 months after RF ablation. CONCLUSION The ADC values of malignant liver lesions successfully treated by RF ablation show a predictable evolution and may help radiologists to monitor tumor response after treatment.","Lu, Tri-Linh; Becce, Fabio; Bize, Pierre; Denys, Alban; Meuli, Reto; Schmidt, Sabine",European journal of radiology,373,1

Therefore, the main intent of this study was to estimate the prevalence of trauma among young adults exposed to violent and stressful events of armed conflict. Method: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on the prevalence of trauma in all the 10 districts of Kashmir Valley using multistage sampling technique. Data were collected from 693 students by means of the Demographic Information Questionnaire and Kashmir Conflict Exposure Checklist (KCEC). Results: Findings revealed that one third of the respondents were exposed to high traumatic exposure (33.3%), close to quarter of the participants reported extremely high traumatic exposure (23.7%), over one third of the respondents were exposed to moderate traumatic exposure (33.5%), and about one tenth of the sample were exposed to low traumatic exposure (9.5%) in the context of the Kashmir conflict. The prevalence of trauma was 100% in both males and females. The traumatic events with highest rate of prevalence were ""feeling stressed"" (97.3%), followed by ""fear of search operations, crackdowns or curfews"" (89.2%); ""witnessing a protest or being part of it"" (88.3%); ""a family member, relative or friend being hit with a bullet, pellet, or any other explosive"" (76.5%); and ""exposure to violent media portrayals"" (74.3%). Thirteen of 17 traumatic events were significantly associated with gender wherein males reported significantly higher prevalence in all of these events than females, except one. Conclusions: The findings of the current study revealed a very disturbing picture regarding the prevalence of traumatic experience of Kashmiri young adults and recommends that educational institutions and nongovernment organizations in Kashmir should pay attention toward guiding the young adults of Kashmir in the right direction for their growth, safety, and welfare, in addition to providing mental health support services, to enhance psychological competence, prevent the development of psychiatric disorders, and utilize the potentials of youth for nation building.

In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people's mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. METHODS Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series. RESULTS The mean %EWL in group 1 is 47,37±18,59 and in group 2 is 51,13±17,59, being p=0,438. Meanwhile, the mean %TWL in group 1 is 21,14±8,17 and in group 2 is 24,67±8,01, with p=0,115. CONCLUSIONS Population lockdown by COVID-19 did not get worse short-term results of vertical gastrectomy.

A physical examination revealed abdominal distension without rigidity. Laboratory data showed severe systemic inflammation, multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Computed tomography showed multifocal thickness of the gastroduodenal wall with surrounding panniculitis, gas in a portal vein and a perigastric vein. Emergency esophago-gastro duodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated a large erosion in the antrum of the stomach, and penetration surrounded by circumferentially ischemic mucosa in the second and third portions of the duodenum. Based on informed consent, conservative therapy was performed, and his condition improved enabling the start of oral intake on the 37th hospital day. However, 7 days later, there was a relapse of epigastralgia after a meal. Gastrointestinal series and EGD revealed a 10-mm-long pinhole-like stricture at the site.

The present study provides further insight into the role of miR-27a-3p in the regulation of CDH5 expression in renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC). METHODS Thedysregulation of CDH5 expression in ccRCC and its association with clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed using the TCGA database. A meta-analysis was performed to verify the alteration of CDH5 expression in ccRCC using the GEO database. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining were applied to assess the transcriptional and protein levels of CDH5. TargetScan and Tarbase were employed to predict the miRNAs with the potential to target mRNA of CDH5. RESULTS The mRNA level of CDH5 in ccRCCwas significantly higher than in normal tissue. CDH5 mRNA expression could therefore serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for ccRCC (AUC = 0.844). However, the reduced CDH5 transcription levels were significantly correlated with patients in the T3-4 stage, lymph node, and distant metastasis, as well as with a worse clinical outcome. We further observed that CDH5, at the protein level, was almost absent in ccRCC samples. In addition, a few databases screen showed that mir-27a-3p is a highly conserved miRNA targeting CDH5. The expression of mir-27a-3p was significantly elevated in ccRCC tissues in contrast to normal tissues. Importantly, it was positively associated with the T3-4 stage and M stage, respectively, suggesting that the expression level of mir-27a-3p could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for ccRCC (AUC = 0.775). CONCLUSION Our data suggest that thereduced translational level of CDH5 in ccRCC was related to the overexpression of mir-27a-3p. The higher mir-27a-3p and lower CDH5 expression significantly correlated with advanced clinical stages for ccRCC patients.","Wang, Yifang; Zhou, Xiaohui; Han, Peipei; Lu, Yunliang; Zhong, Xuemin; Yang, Yanping; Li, Danping; Liu, Deling; Li, Qiuyun; Pan, Nenghui; Mo, Yingxi; Luo, Wenqi; Li, Ping; Zhou, Xiaoying; Liudmila, Matskova","Pathology, research and practice",373,16

Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. In this work, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, the optimal combination of 5' and 3' UTR are identified and termed NASAR, which are 5- to 10-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived TT3 nanoparticles trigger a dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The antigen-specific antibodies induced by TT3-nanoparticles and NASAR mRNAs are over two orders of magnitude more than that induced by the FDA-approved lipid nanoparticle material MC3 in vaccinated mice. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Zeng, Chunxi; Hou, Xucheng; Yan, Jingyue; Zhang, Chengxiang; Li, Wenqing; Zhao, Weiyu; Du, Shi; Dong, Yizhou",Advanced materials,373,5

Of particular and growing concern are shortages of allied health professionals (AHPs). This study explored the contextual factors impacting the recruitment and retention of AHPs in rural Australia. A qualitative approach using a constructivist-interpretivist methodology was taken. Semi-structured interviews (n = 74) with executive staff, allied health (AH) managers and newly recruited AHPs working in two rural public health services in Victoria, Australia were conducted. Data was coded and categorised inductively and analysed thematically. The findings suggest that to support a stable and sustainable AH workforce, rural public sector health services need to be more efficient, strategic and visionary. This means ensuring that policies and procedures are equitable and accessible, processes are effective, and action is taken to develop local programs, opportunities and supports that allow AH staff to thrive and grow in place at all grade levels and life stages. This study reinforces the need for a whole-of-community approach to effectively support individual AH workers and their family members in adjusting to a new place and developing a sense of belonging in place. The recommendations arising from this study are likely to have utility for other high-income countries, particularly in guiding AH recruitment and retention strategies in rural public sector health services.

In March 2020, ASCO launched a survey of clinical programs represented on its Cancer Research Committee and Research Community Forum Steering Group and taskforces to learn about the types of changes and challenges that clinical trial programs were experiencing early in the pandemic. There were 32 survey respondents; 14 represented academic programs, and 18 represented community-based programs. Respondents indicated that COVID-19 is leading programs to halt or prioritize screening and/or enrollment for certain clinical trials and cease research-only visits. Most reported conducting remote patient care where possible and remote visits and monitoring with sponsors and/or contract research organizations (CROs); respondents viewed this shift positively. Numerous challenges with conducting clinical trials were reported, including enrollment and protocol adherence difficulties with decreased patient visits, staffing constraints, and limited availability of ancillary services. Interactions with sponsors and CROs about modifying trial procedures were also challenging. The changes in clinical trial procedures identified by the survey could serve as strategies for other programs attempting to maintain their clinical trial portfolios during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, many of the adaptations to trials made during the pandemic provide a long-term opportunity to improve and transform the clinical trial system. Specific improvements could be expanded use of more pragmatic or streamlined trial designs, fewer clinical trial-related patient visits, and minimized sponsor and CRO visits to trial programs.","Waterhouse, David M; Harvey, R Donald; Hurley, Patricia; Levit, Laura A; Kim, Edward S; Klepin, Heidi D; Mileham, Kathryn Finch; Nowakowski, Grzegorz; Schenkel, Caroline; Davis, Courtney; Bruinooge, Suanna S; Schilsky, Richard L",JCO oncology practice,373,26

We aimed to investigate for which pathogens this association is particularly strong. DESIGN A retrospective observational study was conducted. METHODS Data from the SSI-module of the German nosocomial infection surveillance system between 2000 and 2016 were linked with data from the German Meteorological Service. Patient- and procedure-related data were associated with monthly aggregated meteorological data. Due to high correlation with other meteorological parameters, we focused on the outside temperature. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for SSI rates relating to temperature. SSIs were stratified by pathogen. A P value of <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Altogether, 2,004,793 procedures resulting in 32,118 SSIs were included. Generally, warmer temperatures were associated with a higher SSI risk, especially for SSIs with gram-negative pathogens. This association was particularly prominent for Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and certain Enterobacteriaceae. Per additional 1°C, we observed a 6% increase in the SSI risk for Acinetobacter spp and a 4% increase for Enterobacter spp. Superficial SSIs with Acinetobacter spp were 10 times more likely to occur when comparing surgeries in months with mean temperatures of ≥20°C to mean temperatures of <5°C. CONCLUSIONS Higher temperatures were associated with increased SSI rates caused by gram-negative bacteria. Future SSI prevention measures should consider this aspect. Underlying shifts in microbiome composition due to climate factors should be included in further analyses.

METHODS In a cross-sectional study, the authors investigated all patients who visited the emergency department of Imam Khomeini hospital with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 from February 20 to April 20, 2020. Then the authors assessed all patient outcomes (outpatient vs hospitalization or death). Finally, the authors compared the outcomes between athletes with regular sports participation and others, adjusting for confounding factors of age and sex. RESULTS Of all 4694 adult patients, 249 individuals (137 males and 112 females with mean [SD] age of 36.45 [9.77] y) had regular participation in different sport disciplines. Overall, 30 (12%) athletes were hospitalized or died (30 and 0, respectively) compared with 957 (21.5%) nonathletes (878 and 79, respectively). Athletes with regular sports participation were 1.49 times less likely to be hospitalized (P = .044). CONCLUSIONS Regular sports participation may positively affect the clinical outcome, regardless of confounding factors of age and sex. The probability of hospitalization in athletes with regular sports participation was 33% lower than nonathletes. However, more longitudinal studies are needed to determine the causal effects.","Halabchi, Farzin; Mazaheri, Reza; Sabeti, Khashayar; Yunesian, Masoud; Alizadeh, Zahra; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Aghili, Seyed Mojtaba; Tavakol, Zahra",Journal of physical activity & health,373,19

METHODS Patients who were admitted to the hospital with a new fracture during pandemic period (March 16 to May 22, 2020) were evaluated. Control group consisted of patients with new fractures admitted to the hospital in the same date range in 2018 and 2019. The patients were divided into two groups as ≤16 years old (group 1) and >16 years old (group 2). The evaluation was based on the age and gender of the patients and localization of the fractures. Hospitalized and surgically treated patients were evaluated as well. RESULTS A total of 1794, 1747, and 670 fractures were observed in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Mean age of the patients in group 1 was found to have decreased in the pandemic period (p<0.001). The most common fracture sites in the pediatric population were the distal forearm and distal arm, whereas hand, distal forearm, and foot were most common fracture sites in adults, in both pandemic and non-pandemic periods. The proportional increase in femoral and tibial shaft fractures in group 1, and toe, tibial shaft, and metacarpal fractures in group 2 was found to be statistically significantly (p<0.05). In group 1; 6.8%, 7.7%, and 14.6% of the fractures were treated surgically in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively (p<0.001). For group 2, these rates were 20.1%, 18.6%, and 18.1%, respectively (p=0.67). There were 48, 29, and 26 open fractures in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively (p=0.066). In pandemic period, duration of the hospital stay was significantly shorter for distal humerus and proximal femur fractures (p values= 0.001 and 0.017, respectively). CONCLUSION We observed that the frequency of fractures decreased by approximately one-third during the pandemic period compared with that in the non-pandemic period. The mean age of the patients with a fracture in the pediatric group was found to have decreased also. Finger fractures in pediatric patients and metatarsal fractures in adult patients were found to have significantly decreased during the pandemic.

143817,143817,143817,A systematic review of the incidence of and risk factors for postoperative atrial fibrillation following general surgery.,17.497028,8.611319,2018,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS About 15% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) express fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins (FFs), most often in concert with mutational inactivation of TP53, CDKN2A or BAP1. In FFs, FGFR2 residues 1-768 are fused to sequences encoded by a diverse array of partner genes (>60), a configuration that causes oncogenic FF activation. While FGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (F-TKI) provide clinical benefit in FF+ iCCA, responses are partial and/or limited by resistance mechanisms, including FF tyrosine kinase domain mutations, such as the V565F substitution in the FGFR2 gatekeeper residue. Improving on FF targeting in iCCA therefore remains a critical and unmet need. Herein, we present the generation of FF-driven murine iCCA models and their exploitation for discovering actionable FF-associated dependencies. METHODS Four iCCA FFs carrying different fusion sequences were expressed in Tp53-/- mouse liver organoids. Tumorigenic properties of genetically modified liver organoids were assessed by transplantation in immuno-deficient mice. Cellular models derived from neoplastic lesions were exploited for pre-clinical studies. RESULTS Transplantation of FF-expressing liver organoids yielded tumors diagnosed as CCA based on histological, phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses. The penetrance of this tumorigenic phenotype was influenced by FF identity. Tumor organoids and 2D cell lines derived from CCA lesions were addicted to FF signaling via Ras-Erk, regardless of FF identity or V565F mutation. Dual blockade of FF and Ras-Erk pathway by concomitant pharmacological inhibition of FFs and Mek1/2 provided greater therapeutic efficacy than single agent F-TKI in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS FF-driven iCCA pathogenesis was successfully modeled in murine Tp53-/-background, revealing biological heterogeneity among structurally different FFs. Double blockade of FF-Erk signaling deserves consideration for precision-based approaches against human FF+ iCCA. LAY SUMMARY Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a difficult-to-treat rare type of cancer. A subtype of iCCA is caused by genomic alterations that generate oncogenic drivers known as FGFR2 fusions. CCA patients with FGFR2 fusions respond to FGFR inhibitors, but clinical responses are often of modest duration. We generated animal and cellular models of iCCA driven by FGFR2 fusions, which showed sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors. In addition, we showed that FGFR2 fusions require the activity of a downstream effector named Mek1/2. We found that dual blockade of FGFR2 fusions and Mek1/2 in iCCA was more effective than isolated inhibition of FGR2 fusions, pointing to potential clinical utility of dual FGFR2-MEK1/2 blockade.","Cristinziano, Giulia; Porru, Manuela; Lamberti, Dante; Buglioni, Simonetta; Rollo, Francesca; Amoreo, Carla Azzurra; Manni, Isabella; Giannarelli, Diana; Cristofoletti, Cristina; Russo, Giandomenico; Borad, Mitesh J; Grazi, Gian Luca; Diodoro, Maria Grazia; Giordano, Silvia; Sacconi, Andrea; Forcato, Mattia; Anastasi, Sergio; Leonetti, Carlo; Segatto, Oreste",Journal of hepatology,373,1

Calcium-normalized barium and lead concentrations in tooth enamel and dentine may reflect milk and formula consumption with minimal modification during subsequent tooth mineralization, particularly in dentine. However, skeletal resorption during severe illness, and bioavailable metals in nonmilk foods, can complicate interpretations of nursing behavior.

METHODS From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at a tertiary care hospital in Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for 3 months from admission. RESULTS We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61% vs. 67%) and had at least one comorbidity (68% vs. 85%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18%] vs. 15 [45%], p=.03 and 1 [4%] vs. 10 [30%], p=.008). In chest X-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68%] and 7 [21%], p<.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93%] vs. 19 [58%], p=.003 and 8 [29%] vs. 2 [6%], p=.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (six days [IQR 4-21] vs. 3 [2-4], p<.001). CONCLUSIONS Bilateral GGOs and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.","Auvinen, Raija; Nohynek, Hanna; Syrjänen, Ritva; Ollgren, Jukka; Kerttula, Tuija; Mäntylä, Jarkko; Ikonen, Niina; Loginov, Raisa; Haveri, Anu; Kurkela, Satu; Skogberg, Kirsi",Infectious diseases,373,1

An element-specific corrective term is derived as the difference between the 1s eigenvalues obtained from the self-consistent solutions to the non- or scalar-relativistic Kohn-Sham equations and the four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham equations for a free neutral atom. We examine the dependence of this corrective term on the molecular environment and the amount of exact exchange in hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. This corrective term is then added as a perturbation to the quasiparticle energies from partially self-consistent and single-shot GW calculations. We show that this element-specific relativistic correction, when applied to a previously reported benchmark set of 65 core-state excitations [D. Golze et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 1840-1847 (2020)], reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) with respect to the experiment from 0.55 eV to 0.30 eV and eliminates the species dependence of the MAE, which otherwise increases with the atomic number. The relativistic corrections also reduce the species dependence for the optimal amount of exact exchange in the hybrid functional used as a starting point for the single-shot G0W0 calculations. Our correction scheme can be transferred to other methods, which we demonstrate for the delta self-consistent field (ΔSCF) approach based on density functional theory.","Keller, Levi; Blum, Volker; Rinke, Patrick; Golze, Dorothea",The Journal of chemical physics,373,17

Employing survey methodology, our framework was tested using a sample of U.S. adults (N=628). The major results include (a) information gained through interpersonal sources and perceived benefits of the prescription drugs positively and sequentially mediate the association between mass media exposure and intent to seek prescription drug information, (b) interpersonal health information positively moderate the mediation of mass media exposure-perceived benefits-intent to seek prescription drug information, and (c) the inexpert interpersonal information's positive interaction effect with mass media exposure on intent to seek prescription drug information mediated through perceived benefits was greater with high expert interpersonal communication.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at investigating the published evidence of L-TOT effects on the endocrine system in adult CNCP patients. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT A systematic search of the literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the CINAHL was performed. Studies examining measures of endocrine function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, -adrenal, -thyroid, -somatotropic and -prolactin axis in adult CNCP patients in L-TOT (≥4 weeks of use) were included. Outcomes and the level of evidence were analyzed (The Cochrane Collaboration Tool, modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Rating of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group). RESULTS A total of 2660 studies were identified; 1981 excluded and finally thirteen studies (one randomized controlled trial (RCT), three longitudinal- and nine cross-sectional studies) were analyzed. L-TOT was associated with low insulin, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in both men and women with CNCP compared to different control groups (CNCP or healthy pain-free). No other significant differences were reported. The studies had a high risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence was low. CONCLUSION There seems to be an impact of L-TOT in CNCP patients on several components of the endocrine system, but the level of evidence is weak. Given the high prevalence of L-TOT use systematic studies of larger patient populations are urgently needed.","Diasso, Pernille D K; Benedikte, Frederiksen S; Nielsen, Susanne D; Main, Katharina M; Sjøgren, Per; Kurita, Geana P",European journal of pain,373,0

According to the conventional understanding of world history, the historical process to modernity that has led to the Civil Revolution, Scientific Revolution, and Capitalism is linear and universally inevitable, and this-in other words, Eurocentrism-implies that only the historical experiences of Europeans are relevant. This mainstream view of world history has spread the dichotomous analytic framework of historiography and reinforced cultural essentialism, which has eventually given a Euro- or Sino-centric hierarchical presentation of history. This type of world view rests on the assumption that there are intrinsic and incommensurable differences between cultures or localities, which a lot of commentators and scholars have constantly countered by arguing that that presumption does not comply with what historical sources say. Drawing on some trail-blazing scholarship of cultural studies and others, this essay turns away from this ""conventional"" framework of historiography and presents a world view that is framed in the context of trans-locality, interconnectedness, plurality, heterogeneity, polycentricity, and diversity. In recent years, in an attempt to search for new analytic frames, some endeavors have emerged in the field of cultural or science studies to go beyond just providing critical commentaries or case studies. Furthermore, researchers and scholars in the history of science, technology and medicine in East Asia have put an effort into conceptualizing and establishing such new analytic frames. Among those approaches are attempts to shed light upon the trans-local yet global interconnectedness (emphatically in pre-modern periods), diverse historical trajectories to modernities, and polycentric as well as plural landscape of scientific enterprises over time and across the world. On top of these new visions of world history, this essay further elaborates on and proposes some conceptive ideas: (1) ""Tradition"" as a set of recipes, which could replace the idea of the living yet dead tradition; (2) ""Medicine"" as a problem-solving activity, which calls more attention to historical actors of East Asian medicine; (3) ""East Asian medicines"" as a family of trans-locally related practices in East Asia, which would lead to going beyond the nationalist historiography such as Sino-centrism; (4) ""Problematique"" as the system of questions and concepts which make up East Asian medicine, which should reveal what East Asian medicines have been about; (5) ""Styles of Practice"" for the historiography of East Asian medicines, as opposed to the cultural account, epistemological historiography or praxiography; and, as an illustrative example, (6) ""Topological Bodies"" for the history of anatomy in East Asia. Going beyond tradition and dichotomous historiography, these new methodologies or conceptual ideas will contribute to the understanding of the history of East Asian medicines.","Yi, Kiebok",Ui sahak,373,7

TBA Care is a secretion detector that analyses airway sounds and indicates the need for suctioning. OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of TBA Care in detecting retained secretions, compared to standard indications. METHODS We conducted a prospective randomized trial with 72 general intensive care unit patients randomized at intubation into 2 groups, differing only in suctioning indications. The control group indications were at least 3 scheduled suctionings per day or were clinically driven. The secretion-detector group indications were device signal or clinically driven. At each suctioning session we recorded the indication for suctioning and the amount of secretions removed. Patients were followed until intensive care unit discharge or extubation. Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia was confirmed via microbiological analysis of suctioned secretions. RESULTS We analyzed 1,705 suctionings in the control group and 1,354 in the secretion-detector group. The secretion-detector group had fewer suctionings per day (3.9 ± 2.3 vs 4.8 ± 1.2, P = .002) and a lower rate of unnecessary suctionings (4% vs 12%, P < .001). In the secretion-detector group, 97% of the suctionings were performed following the signal from the TBA Care device. In the control group, clinical deterioration (65%) was the most frequent indication for suctioning. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was similar in the groups. CONCLUSIONS TBA Care seems to give valid and timely indications for suctioning, anticipating clinical deterioration due to secretion retention and reducing unnecessary suctionings.

The first population comprised 1769 registered Angus bulls born between 1955 and 2003, with Expected Progeny Differences computed by the American Angus Association. The second comprised 38 half-sib families containing 1622 steers with six post-natal growth and carcass phenotypes. Linkage analysis was performed by half-sib least squares regression with gridqtl or Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of complex pedigrees with loki. Of the 673 detected QTL, only 118 have previously been reported, reflecting both the conservative approach to QTL reporting in the literature, and the more liberal approach taken in this study. From 33 to 71% of the genetic variance and 35 to 56% of the phenotypic variance in each trait was explained by the detected QTL. To analyse the effects of 11 SNPs and one duplication locus within candidate genes on each trait, a single marker analysis was performed by fitting an additive allele substitution model in both mapping populations. There were 53 associations detected between the SNP/duplication loci and traits with -log(10) P(nominal) ≥ 4.0, where each association explained 0.92% to 4.4% of the genetic variance and 0.01% to 1.86% of the phenotypic variance. Of these associations, only six SNP/duplication loci were located within 8 cM of a QTL peak for the trait, with two being located at the QTL peak: SST_DG156121:c.362A>G for ribeye muscle area and TG_X05380:c.422C>T for calving ease. Strong associations between several SNP/duplication loci and trait variation were obtained in the absence of any detected linked QTL.

A systematic review of PubMed (through 13th December 2019) for studies providing epidemiological, clinical, microbiological as well as treatment data and outcomes of IE in kidney transplant recipients was performed. A total of 60 studies, containing data of 117 patients, were included in the analysis. The most common causative pathogens were gram-positive microorganisms in 57.4%, gram-negative microorganisms in 14.8%, fungi in 20%, while in 18.9% of cases, IE was culture-negative. Aortic valve was the most commonly infected valve followed by mitral, tricuspid and the pulmonary valve.

Renal involvement may present as an active urinary sediment or as changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output leading to acute kidney injury. In common with acute kidney injury complicating critical illness, the cause is often multifactorial and often presents as part of a multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.

Few data currently exist as to the long-term burden of COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury but evidence suggests that only approximately one-third of patients are discharged with recovered renal function.","Alvarez-Belon, Lucas; Sarnowski, Alexander; Forni, Lui G",British journal of hospital medicine,373,16

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature related to exercise timing, relative to meal consumption, and glycemic control in individuals with T2DM. METHODS Systematic searches in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov Registry databases were performed to identify articles published in English from inception to October 2017. Two authors independently extracted data and evaluated the quality of studies using the Cochrane Collaboration Data Collection Form and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, respectively. A qualitative synthesis was performed on the included studies, and results summarized in tables. RESULTS Nineteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 346 participants were included. Improvements in glycemia (glucose concentrations and glucose area under the curve) and insulin area under the curve appeared more consistent when exercise was performed during the postmeal period as compared with the premeal period; however, this observation was largely based on indirect comparisons between studies. CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence from randomized controlled trials that exercise performed 30 min after meal consumption may convey greater improvements in glycemic control for individuals with T2DM. However, there are only two studies that have directly assessed the role of exercise timing on glycemic management, and adopted methodologies are heterogeneous. Future low-risk trials in this field are warranted.","Teo, Shaun Y M; Kanaley, Jill A; Guelfi, Kym J; Cook, Summer B; Hebert, Jeffrey J; Forrest, Mitchell R L; Fairchild, Timothy J",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,373,1

Grit has emerged as a recent topic of interest within the medical community. With ever-increasing rates of burnout and psychological distress, increasing attention has been directed towards modulatory or protective factors for these deleterious outcomes. Grit has been studied in regard to a variety of outcomes and variables in medicine. This article reviews the current literature on grit in medicine and summarises the current research on grit and performance metrics, personality characteristics, longitudinal progression, psychological well-being, diversity, equity and inclusion, burnout and residency attrition. While there is inconclusive evidence on the influence of grit on performance metrics in medicine, research consistently demonstrates a positive correlation between grit and psychological well-being and a negative correlation between grit and burnout. After discussing some of the inherent limitations of this type of research, this article suggests some possible implications and future areas for research and their potential role in cultivating psychologically healthy physicians and promoting successful careers in medicine.","Lee, Donald H; Reasoner, Kaitlyn; Lee, Diane",Postgraduate medical journal,373,20

The aim of the present study was to perform morphological analyses and morphometry of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow of patients with severe COVID-19 and to correlate the findings to the clinical course of the disease. METHODS AND RESULTS In the single-centre study at the University Hospital Jena bone marrow specimens of 15 deceased patients with severe course of COVID-19 were sampled from vertebral column during autopsy. Slides of bone marrow were stained with routine stains or immunohistochemistry and further examined for haemophagocytosis using light microscopy. To substantiate morphological findings additional slides were stained against CD163 and morphometry was performed. In all bone marrow samples, a relative increase in cellularity was found. Haemophagocytes with erythrophagocytosis were detectable in 67% of the deceased patients. In tissues with low number of haemophagocytes or ill-defined haemophagocytes, an increase in iron deposits was frequently seen. Next, morphological findings were correlated with several important clinical data and the H-Score was calculated to posthumously confirm the diagnosis secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Median duration of disease and hospitalisation time were shorter in patients with haemophagocytosis (n=10) compared to patients without haemophagocytosis (n=5). In addition, patients with haemophagocytes showed increased inflammatory parameters two to five days prior to death compared to patients without haemophagocytes. CONCLUSIONS Haemophagocytosis is a common finding in the bone marrow of deceased with severe COVID-19 and may designate fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Swoboda, Julia; Wittschieber, Daniel; Sanft, Juliane; Kleemann, Sandra; Elschner, Stefan; Ihle, Hannah; Hubig, Michael; Pletz, Mathias W; Mall, Gita; Gassler, Nikolaus",Histopathology,373,11

While many individual studies have examined the reliability and validity of various self-report measures for assessing SB, it is not clear, in general, how self-reported SB (e.g., questionnaires, logs, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs)) compares to device measures (e.g., accelerometers, inclinometers). OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this systematic review was to compare self-report versus device measures of SB in adults. METHODS Six bibliographic databases were searched to identify all studies which included a comparable self-report and device measure of SB in adults. Risk of bias within and across studies was assessed. Results were synthesized using meta-analyses. RESULTS The review included 185 unique studies. A total of 123 studies comprising 173 comparisons and data from 55,199 participants were used to examine general criterion validity. The average mean difference was -105.19 minutes/day (95% CI: -127.21, -83.17); self-report underestimated sedentary time by ~1.74 hours/day compared to device measures. Self-reported time spent sedentary at work was ~40 minutes higher than when assessed by devices. Single item measures performed more poorly than multi-item questionnaires, EMAs and logs/diaries. On average, when compared to inclinometers, multi-item questionnaires, EMAs and logs/diaries were not significantly different, but had substantial amount of variability (up to 6 hours/day within individual studies) with approximately half over-reporting and half under-reporting. A total of 54 studies provided an assessment of reliability of a self-report measure, on average the reliability was good (ICC = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS Evidence from this review suggests that single-item self-report measures generally underestimate sedentary time when compared to device measures. For accuracy, multi-item questionnaires, EMAs and logs/diaries with a shorter recall period should be encouraged above single item questions and longer recall periods if sedentary time is a primary outcome of study. Users should also be aware of the high degree of variability between and within tools. Studies should exert caution when comparing associations between different self-report and device measures with health outcomes.

However, their roles in Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) still remain unclear. This study aimed to test whether NLR, PLR, CAR, and AFR serve as predictive markers of disease severity and systemic inflammation in patients with SJS/TEN. This retrospective study included 40 patients with SJS/TEN and 60 healthy controls. The correlation between these markers and severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis (SCORTEN), ABCD-10, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed and compared. Univariable and multivariable analysis were used to assess associations of variables with mortality. The receiver-operator curves (ROC) were used to evaluate the predictive value of variables for mortality in SJS/TEN patients. The results demonstrated that the NLR and PLR of SJS/TEN patients were significantly higher and the AFR was significantly lower when compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). The NLR and CAR were positively correlated with SCORTEN, ABCD-10, PCT, and CRP. The NLR in SCORTEN of ≥3 group was significantly higher than that in SCORTEN <3 group (p < 0.05) and there were no significant differences between PLR, CAR, and AFR between the two groups. The univariate analysis suggested that NLR of >5.79 was a risk factor for mortality (odds ratio, 10.5; p < 0.05), but the association was no longer statistically significant in multivariable analysis. The ROC showed that NLR had a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 63.6% for predicting death with a cut-off value of 5.79 (p < 0.05) in SJS/TEN patients. In conclusion, among the four markers, NLR and CAR can partially reflect severity and inflammatory status in patients with SJS/TEN. NLR was also a predictor of death.","Wang, Qian; Lan, Yun-Ping; Qi, Bo; Yin, Lin; Zhang, Li-Xia; Liu, Wei",The Journal of dermatology,373,5

We examined the association between psychiatric disorders and hydroxychloroquine adherence and determined whether psychiatric treatment modifies this association. METHODS We identified incident hydroxychloroquine users among youth with SLE (ages 10-24 years) using de-identified U.S. commercial insurance claims in Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart (2000-2016). Adherence was estimated using medication possession ratios (MPR) over a 365-day interval. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of having any psychiatric disorder on MPR, as well as the independent effects of depression, anxiety, adjustment and other psychiatric disorders. We tested for interactions between psychiatric diagnoses and treatment with psychotropic medications or psychotherapy. RESULTS Among 873 subjects, 20% had a psychiatric diagnosis, most commonly depression. Only adjustment disorders were independently associated with decreased MPRs (β -0.12, p=0.05). We observed significant crossover interactions, in which psychiatric disorders had opposite effects on adherence depending on the receipt of psychiatric treatment. Among youth with any psychiatric diagnosis, psychotropic medication use was associated with a 0.15 increase in MPR compared with no psychotropic medication (p=0.02 for interaction). Among youth with depression or anxiety, psychotherapy was also associated with a higher MPR compared with no psychotherapy (p=0.05 and p<0.01 for interaction, respectively). CONCLUSION The impact of psychiatric disorders on medication adherence differed by whether youth had received psychiatric treatment. Improving recognition and treatment of psychiatric conditions may increase adherence in youth with SLE.","Chang, Joyce C; Davis, Alaina M; Klein-Gitelman, Marisa S; Cidav, Zuleyha; Mandell, David S; Knight, Andrea M",Arthritis care & research,373,7

Methods: A retrospective case analysis of effectiveness and safety of aliskiren treatment to lower blood pressure in three severe and one critically ill patients of COVID-19 with hypertension. Results: Four patients, two males and two females, with an average age of 78 years (66-87 years), were referred to hospital mainly because of respiratory symptoms. Three cases were confirmed by 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and antibody detection (severe type), and one with cardiac insufficiency was clinically determined (critically ill type). The previous diagnosis of hypertension was clear. Two patients took calcium channel antagonist (CCB), one patient took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and one patient took angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB). After admission, ACEI or ARB were discontinued, one patient with heart failure patient was treated by aliskiren combined with diuretic; 3 patients were treated with aliskiren combined with CCB. Two patients were stopped to use CCB due to low blood pressure after 1 to 2 weeks of using CCB and aliskiren.

METHODS Pub Med and Google Scholar databases were searched systematically for studies concerning pheochromocytomas (intra-adrenal paragangliomas) from 1980 until 2016. Bibliographies were searched to find additional articles. RESULTS More than four times elevation of plasma fractionated metanephrines or elevated 24-h urinary fractionated metanephrines are keys to diagnosing pheochromocytoma. If the results are equivocal then we perform the clonidine test. If we have not done it already, we preferably do a CT scan and/or an MRI scan. The patient needs pre-treatment with α1-blockers at least 10-14 days before operation. Alternatives or sometimes adjuncts are Calcium Channels Blockers and/or β-Blockers. Several familial syndromes are associated with PHEO and genetic testing should be considered. CONCLUSIONS The biggest problem for pheochromocytoma is to suspect it in the first place. Elevated metanephrines establish the diagnosis. With the proper preoperative preparation the risks during operation and the postoperative period are minimal. If there is a risk of the hereditable mutation, it is strongly suggested that all the patients with pheochromocytoma need clinical genetic testing.","Farrugia, F A; Martikos, G; Tzanetis, P; Charalampopoulos, A; Misiakos, E; Zavras, N; Sotiropoulos, D",Endocrine regulations,373,1

METHODS We investigated if disease severity, phenotype or survival in patients with new-onset PD correlates with cNfL concentrations around the time of diagnosis in the population-based NYPUM study cohort (n = 99). A second, larger new-onset PD cohort (n = 194) was used for independent validation. Association of brain pathology with the cNfL concentration was examined using striatal dopamine transporter imaging and repeated diffusion tensor imaging, at baseline, 1 and 3 years. RESULTS Higher cNfL in the early phase of PD was associated with greater severity of all cardinal motor symptoms except tremor, in both cohorts, and with shorter survival and impaired olfaction. cNfL concentrations above the median of 903 ng/L conferred an overall 5.8 times increased hazard of death, during follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex, higher cNfL correlated with striatal dopamine transporter uptake deficits and lower fractional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging of several axonal tracts. CONCLUSIONS cNfL shows usefulness as a biomarker of disease severity and to predict survival in PD. The present results indicate that the cNfL concentration reflects the intensity of the neurodegenerative process, which could be of importance in future clinical trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with PD, cNFL concentrations are associated with more severe disease and shorter survival.","Bäckström, David; Linder, Jan; Mo, Susanna Jakobson; Riklund, Katrine; Zetterberg, Henrik; Blennow, Kaj; Forsgren, Lars; Lenfeldt, Niklas",Neurology,373,1

METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of SMA1 patients and their outcomes according to the following choices: letting nature take its course (NT); tracheostomy and invasive mechanical ventilation (TV); continuous noninvasive respiratory muscle aid (NRA), including noninvasive ventilation; and mechanically assisted cough. RESULTS Of 194 consecutively referred patients enrolled in this study (103 males, 91 females), NT, TV, and NRA were chosen for 121 (62.3%), 42 (21.7%), and 31 (16%) patients, respectively. Survival at ages 24 and 48 months was higher in TV than NRA users: 95% (95% confidence interval: 81.8%-98.8%) and 67.7% (95% confidence interval: 46.7%-82%) at age 24 months (P < .001) and 89.43% and 45% at age 48 months in the TV and NRA groups, respectively (P < .001). The choice of TV decreased from 50% (1992-1998) to 12.7% (2005-2010) (P < .005) with a nonstatistically significant increase for NT from 50% to 65%. The choice of NRA increased from 8.1% (1999-2004) to 22.7% (2005-2010) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Long-term survival outcome is determined by the choice of the treatment. NRA and TV can prolong survival, with NRA showing a lower survival probability at ages 24 and 48 months.","Gregoretti, Cesare; Ottonello, Giancarlo; Chiarini Testa, Maria Beatrice; Mastella, Chiara; Ravà, Lucilla; Bignamini, Elisabetta; Veljkovic, Aleksandar; Cutrera, Renato",Pediatrics,373,26

In addition, the canonical cGAS-stimulator of interferon gene (STING)-IFN axis is required for protecting mice from P. aeruginosa-induced mouse acute pulmonary infection, confirmed in cGAS pathway-specific gene deficiency mouse models. cGAS -/- and STING -/- mice exhibited reduced type I IFNs production, excessive inflammatory response accompanied with decreased resistance to P. aeruginosa challenge.

The recent appearance of avian cholera, a highly virulent disease of birds caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, at remote Arctic seabird colonies is an emerging conservation concern. Determining disease risk to population viability requires a quantitative understanding of transmission potential and the factors that regulate epidemic persistence. Estimates of the basic (R0 ) and real-time (Rt ) reproductive number are critical in this regard - enumerating the number of secondary infections caused by each primary infection in a newly invaded host population and the decline in transmission rate as susceptible individuals are removed via mortality or immunized recovery. Here, we use data collected at a closely monitored common eider (Somateria mollissima) breeding colony located in the Canadian Arctic to examine transmission and host population dynamics. Specifically, we infer epidemic curves from daily mortality observations and use a likelihood-based procedure to estimate changes in the reproductive number over a series of annual outbreaks. These data are interpreted in relation to concurrent changes in host numbers to assess local extinction risk. Consistent with expectations for a novel pathogen invasion, case incidence increased exponentially during the initial wave of exposure (R0 = 2·5; generation time = 6·5 days ± 1·1 SD). Disease conditions gradually abated, but only after several years of smouldering infection (Rt ≈ 1). In total, 6194 eider deaths were recorded during outbreaks spanning eight consecutive breeding seasons. Breeding pair abundance declined by 56% from the pre-outbreak peak; however, a robust population of >4000 pairs remained intact upon epidemic fade-out. Overall, outbreak patterns were consistent with herd immunity acting as a mitigating factor governing in the extent and duration of mortality. Disease mortality is frequently modelled as a form of stochastic catastrophe in wildlife population assessments, whereas our approach gives shape to the functional response between transmission and host population dynamics. We conclude that increased emphasis on integrating epidemiological and population processes is essential to predicting the conservation impact of emerging infectious diseases in wildlife.","Iverson, Samuel A; Gilchrist, H Grant; Soos, Catherine; Buttler, Isabel I; Harms, N Jane; Forbes, Mark R",The Journal of animal ecology,373,17

The RIG-I-like-receptors (RLRs) bind viral RNA and engage the adaptor MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) to promote IFN expression, whereas cGAS (cGMP-AMP synthase) binds viral DNA and activates an analogous pathway via the protein STING (stimulator of IFN genes). In this study, we confirm that STING is not necessary to induce IFN expression during RNA virus infection but also find that STING is required to restrict the replication of diverse RNA viruses. The antiviral activities of STING were not linked to its ability to regulate basal expression of IFN-stimulated genes, activate transcription, or autophagy. Using vesicular stomatitis virus as a model, we identified a requirement of STING to inhibit translation during infection and upon transfection of synthetic RLR ligands. This inhibition occurs at the level of translation initiation and restricts the production of viral and host proteins. The inability to restrict translation rendered STING-deficient cells 100 times more likely to support productive viral infections than wild-type counterparts. Genetic analysis linked RNA sensing by RLRs to STING-dependent translation inhibition, independent of MAVS. Thus, STING has dual functions in host defense, regulating protein synthesis to prevent RNA virus infection and regulating IFN expression to restrict DNA viruses.","Franz, Kate M; Neidermyer, William J; Tan, Yee-Joo; Whelan, Sean P J; Kagan, Jonathan C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,373,31

METHODS A total of 1,950 cancer patients finished questionnaires in four provinces in southern China. The survey included socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of participants, dosage forms, efficacy, and side effects. RESULTS The study results showed that cancer patients with higher education (>12 years) were more likely to accept the treatment of Chinese herbs. There were 54.61% (1,065 cases) of patients chose Chinese herbs for the initial treatment and 14.46% (282 cases) chose Chinese herbs as monotherapy. Most patients (54.51%, 1,063 cases) continuously used CM for more than 6 months, and a few of them (212 cases) used CM for up to 3 years. All kinds of dosage forms of CM had been used, including CM decoction, CM patent prescription and CM injection. Concerning the efficacy in the view of patients, 40.31% (786 cases) believed that it would be effective to take Chinese herbs before they starting the anti-cancer treatment, and the percentage increased to 81.08% after 1-month CM treatment. The effect of Chinese herbs was mainly demonstrated by symptom relief and improvement of quality of life, and 8.31% (162 cases) of patients experienced control of tumor growth and decreased tumor markers. Furthermore, only 14.31% (279 cases) participants reported that they experienced side effects during CM treatment. CONCLUSION This large scale investigation reflects the current situation of domestic CM usage objectively and comprehensively, which might provide new ways for cancer treatment.","Xiong, Shao-Quan; Chen, Yu; Wang, Li-Juan; Lyu, Pan-Pan; Liao, Wan; Wang, Cui; Ke, Jian-Long; Zhu, Xi; Wang, Jin-Yang; Shen, Xian-Ying; Li, Guang-Ping; Lin, Li-Zhu",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,373,20

The results show that (1) thermal power generation efficiency (TGE) is relatively low but shows a fluctuation growth trend, and TGGE is lower than thermal power generation production efficiency (TGPE); (2) CER has a significant single-threshold effect on the TGGE in China. When the proportion of CER to gross domestic production (GDP) is less than 3.023, the regulation has a significant positive effect on TGGE, while when the proportion of CER to GDP is larger than 3.023, the positive effect is greatly reduced from 0.073 to 0.002. The same conclusion can be obtained using the ratio of CER to gross industrial output value as the threshold variable, although with a different threshold value. From the average value of the sample period, for the vast majority of provinces, the effects of CER on TGGE are not significant. Based on these, relevant policy implications are presented to further promote TGGE.","Wang, Xiping; Li, Moyang",Environmental science and pollution research international,373,23

Although extensive research has been carried out on the effects of physical exercise and physical syndromes, there is a knowledge gap when it comes to the effect of resistance training on muscular strength, physical performance, and body composition at early (prevention) and late (treatment) stages in both syndromes combined. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis (CRD42019138253) to gather the evidence of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of resistance training programs lasting ≥8 weeks on strength, physical function, and body composition of adults ≥65 years old diagnosed with pre-sarcopenia, sarcopenia, pre-frailty, or frailty. A search from the earliest record up to and including December 2020 was carried out using the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. A total of 25 studies (n = 2267 participants) were included. Meta-analysis showed significant changes in favour of resistance training for handgrip (ES = 0.51, p = 0.001) and lower-limb strength (ES = 0.93, p < 0.001), agility (ES = 0.78, p = 0.003), gait speed (ES = 0.75, p < 0.001), postural stability (ES = 0.68, p = 0.007), functional performance (ES = 0.76, p < 0.001), fat mass (ES = 0.41, p = 0.001), and muscle mass (ES = 0.29, p = 0.002). Resistance training during early stages had positive effects in all variables during early stages (ES > 0.12), being particularly effective in improving gait speed (ES = 0.63, p = 0.016) and functional strength (ES = 0.53, p = 0.011). Based on these results, resistance training should be considered as a highly effective preventive strategy to delay and attenuate the negative effects of sarcopenia and frailty in both early and late stages.","Talar, Karolina; Hernández-Belmonte, Alejandro; Vetrovsky, Tomas; Steffl, Michal; Kałamacka, Ewa; Courel-Ibáñez, Javier",Journal of clinical medicine,373,16

Among these is the investigation of the viral communities residing in the human body and their impact on health and disease. To this end, the study of samples from multiple tissues is critical, yet, the complexity of such analysis calls for a dedicated pipeline. We provide an automatic and efficient pipeline for identification, assembly, and analysis of viral genomes that combines the DNA sequence data from multiple organs. TRACESPipe relies on cooperation among 3 modalities: compression-based prediction, sequence alignment, and de novo assembly. The pipeline is ultra-fast and provides, additionally, secure transmission and storage of sensitive data. FINDINGS TRACESPipe performed outstandingly when tested on synthetic and ex vivo datasets, identifying and reconstructing all the viral genomes, including those with high levels of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. It also detected minimal levels of genomic variation between different organs. CONCLUSIONS TRACESPipe's unique ability to simultaneously process and analyze samples from different sources enables the evaluation of within-host variability. This opens up the possibility to investigate viral tissue tropism, evolution, fitness, and disease associations. Moreover, additional features such as DNA damage estimation and mitochondrial DNA reconstruction and analysis, as well as exogenous-source controls, expand the utility of this pipeline to other fields such as forensics and ancient DNA studies.

The novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China initially and in a short time crossed the European borders. After mitigating the epidemic in China, Italy became one of the most COVID-19 affected countries worldwide. International travelers are important sources of infectious diseases and a possible source of epidemic. Due to its political, geographic, and cultural similarities, Italy is one of the main economic partners of Southeast European (SEE) countries. Our data show that infection in index cases in all 11 SEE countries was travel-related with Italy being a source country for 8/11 countries. After the first case identifications on February 25, the number of cases in SEE countries is continually rising reaching the total number of 15,612 with 565 fatal cases and overall case fatality ratio (CFR) of 3.6 (median 3.8, range 0.8-5.5) by April 10, 2020.

OBJECTIVE To study outcomes in patients with M2 occlusion treated with endovascular procedures in the era of stentrievers. METHODS We studied patients prospectively included in the SONIIA registry (years 2011-2012)-a mandatory, externally audited registry that monitors the quality of reperfusion therapies in Catalonia in routine practice. Good recanalization was defined as postprocedure Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score 2b-3; dramatic recovery as drop in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score >10 points or NIHSS score <2 at 24-36 h; and good outcome as modified Rankin score (mRS) 0-2 at 3months. A 24 h CT scan determined symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) and infarct volume. RESULTS Of 571 patients who received endovascular treatment, 65 (11.4%) presented an M2 occlusion on initial angiogram, preprocedure NIHSS 16 (IQR 6). Mean time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 289 ± 195 min. According to interventionalist preferences 86.2% (n=56) were treated with stentrievers (n=7 in combination with intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), 4.6% (n=3) received intra-arterial tPA only, and 9.2% (n=6) diagnostic angiography only. Good recanalization (78.5%) was associated with dramatic improvement (48% vs 14.8%; p=0.02), smaller infarct volumes (8 vs 82 cc; p=0.01) and better outcome (mRS 0-2: 66.3% vs 30%; p=0.03). SICH (9%) was not associated with treatment modality or device used. After adjusting for age and preprocedure NIHSS, good recanalization emerged as an independent predictor of dramatic improvement (OR=5.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 29.2), p=0.03). Independent predictors of good outcome at 3 months were age ( OR=1.067 (95% CI 1.005 to 1132), p=0.03) and baseline NIHSS ( OR=1.162 (95% CI 1.041 to 1.297), p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of M2 MCA occlusion with stentrievers seems safe.

METHOD Using a prospective cohort design with a convenience sample of third-year medical students during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 academic years, the authors compared the OSCE scores of students assigned to the curriculum to both historical and concurrent control groups of students who had not received the curriculum. Additionally, the authors compared the costs of the recommended testing by students in each group using the 2018 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. RESULTS Students assigned to the telephone medicine curriculum (students in the intervention group) had a significantly higher mean overall score on the simulated OSCE telephone medicine case compared to the students in the control groups who did not receive the curriculum (the mean score for students in the intervention group was 7.38 vs 6.92 for students in the control groups, P = .02). Additionally, the intervention group had statistically significantly lower costs for their recommended testing compared to the control groups (the median value for tests ordered by students in the intervention group was $27.91 vs $51.23 for students in the control groups, P = .03).

The differential soluble ligand-induced clustering behavior of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2 was modeled. METHODS A structured, rule-based model implemented ligand-independent pre-ligand binding assembly domain (PLAD)-mediated homotypic low affinity interactions of unliganded and liganded TNF receptors. RESULTS Soluble TNF initiates TNFR1 signaling but not TNFR2 signaling despite receptor binding unless it is secondarily oligomerized. We consider high affinity binding of TNF to signaling-incompetent pre-assembled dimeric TNFR1 and TNFR2 molecules and secondary clustering of liganded dimers to signaling competent ligand-receptor clusters. Published receptor numbers, affinities and measured different activities of clustered receptors validated model simulations for a large range of receptor and ligand concentrations. Different PLAD-PLAD affinities and different activities of receptor clusters explain the observed differences in the TNF receptor stimulating activities of soluble TNF.

An emerging theme in the analyses of these networks is that cells use many layers of regulatory feedback to constantly assess and precisely react to their environment. The importance of complex feedback in controlling the real-time response to external stimuli has led to a need for the next generation of cell-based technologies that enable both the collection and analysis of high-throughput temporal data. Toward this end, we have developed a microfluidic platform capable of monitoring temporal gene expression from over 2,000 promoters. By coupling the ""Dynomics"" platform with deep neural network (DNN) and associated explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms, we show how machine learning can be harnessed to assess patterns in transcriptional data on a genome scale and identify which genes contribute to these patterns.

However, the complexity of the surgical skills required and the steep learning curve have thus far confined the minimally invasive approach to selected tertiary centres. The oesophagogastric and the oesophagojejunal anastomosis can be challenging and often time-consuming. The recently developed transorally inserted anvil (OrVil(™)) is a technique aimed to simplify the anastomotic procedure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of OrVil(™)-assisted anastomosis during laparoscopic surgery in a tertiary upper-GI cancer centre. METHODS From July 2008 to July 2010, 53 consecutive patients underwent MIOG for cancer performed by one surgeon at our institution. Thirty patients underwent laparoscopic Ivor-Lewis oesophagectomy (ILO) and 23 patients underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy. Of the latter group, 13 had a total gastrectomy (TG) and 10 had a subtotal gastrectomy (SG). The gastrointestinal anastomosis was checked with intraoperative endoscopy in all cases. RESULTS There were three in-hospital deaths. Median hospital stay was 14 days for oesophagectomies and 11 days for gastrectomies. There were three anastomotic leaks (5.6%), all in the oesophageal group, successfully treated conservatively. Two patients needed conversion to open surgery (3.7%), 3 patients (5.6%) required re-exploration (for bleeding, infected haematoma, and diaphragmatic hernia), and 18 patients (34%) had respiratory complications (pneumonia, pleural effusions, respiratory failure). Four patients developed anastomotic stricture requiring endoscopic balloon dilatation. The average number of lymph nodes harvested was 22 (range = 11-39) and 26 (range = 5-78) for oesophagectomies and gastrectomies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The principles of a good anastomosis are good vascular supply, must be tension-free, and the use of a high-quality surgical technique. The use of the OrVil(™) in laparoscopic upper-gastrointestinal surgery is safe and does not have an increased complication rate. It is quicker and easier compared to the traditional purse-string technique and it may help to expand the adoption of MIOG surgery.","Marangoni, Gabriele; Villa, Francesco; Shamil, Eamon; Botha, Abraham J",Surgical endoscopy,373,1

Health social media also provides various benefits for patients and laypersons, such as allowing users to be part of virtual support groups, having quick access to advice, and the convenience of access via the Internet. At the same time, it raises concerns about misinformation being propagated by laypersons without professional medical expertise, especially during pandemics like COVID-19, leading to an infodemic. There are only a handful of health social media websites that allow medical professionals to participate in discussions with patients online. We postulate that the modern face of medicine and healthcare needs medical professionals to be included in the online patient discourse so misinformation can be addressed early on and head on. To this end, we propose a new and free health social network named Cardea that is under development which aims to bring patients, laypersons, and medical professionals together on the world wide web. Users can share experiences, ask questions, and get answers in three streamlined environments: Patient to Patient (P2P), Patient to Medic (P2M), and Medic to Medic (M2M). While there are several forums that cater specifically to patient-patient discussions or medic-medic connections, Cardea's added value is in providing a unified portal for both patients and medics, as well as enabling interactions between patients and medics. Moreover, Cardea applies machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing methods to promote credible health information and demote misinformation. At the same time, with enhanced veracity, anonymity, and privacy controls, the vision of Cardea is for e-patients to confidently share experiences and opinions without being stigmatized or compromising their right to privacy. Our hope is to generate discussion and gather insights from other researchers on developing Cardea.","Samuel, H.; Hassan, F.; Zaiane, O.",Healthinf: Proceedings of the 14th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies - Vol. 5: Healthinf,373,24

Monodisperse particle generation and measurement techniques were used to evaluate the effect of virus-laden droplet nuclei size on short-range airborne transmission risk. We analysed four particle sizes (1.0, 1.5, 2.5, and 5.0?µm) to simulate the transport of exhaled droplet nuclei within an interpersonal distance of 0.5?m. The results indicated that the size distribution of airborne droplet nuclei could significantly influence transmission, with the inhalation fraction decreasing with increasing droplet nuclei size. Additionally, results showed that proximity to the source manikin could influence transmission. Inhalation fraction decreased with increasing interpersonal distance, fitting well with the 1/d rule of droplet nuclei concentration decay.

For the low-prevalence disease of human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), we develop a new mechanistic model for gHAT infection that determines the full probability distribution of the gHAT infection using Kolmogorov forward equations. The methodology allows the analytical investigation of the probabilities of gHAT elimination in the spatially-connected villages of the Kwamouth and Mosango health zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and captures the uncertainty using exact methods. We predict that, if current active and passive screening continue at current levels, local elimination of infection will occur in 2029 for Mosango and after 2040 in Kwamouth, respectively. Our method provides a more realistic approach to scaling the probability of elimination of infection between single villages and much larger regions, and provides results comparable to established models without the requirement of detailed infection structure. The novel flexibility allows the interventions in the model to be implemented specific to each village, and this introduces the framework to consider the possible future strategies of test-and-treat or direct treatment of individuals living in villages where cases have been found, using a new drug.","Davis, C.

However, given the complexity of RNA splicing processes, and how proteins can be modified post-translationally, it is overly simplistic to assume that all peptides that map to a singular protein coding gene will demonstrate the same quantitative response. Accordingly, by assuming all peptides from a protein coding sequence are representative of the same protein we may be missing out on detecting important biological differences. To better account for the complexity of the proteome we need to think of new or better ways of handling peptide data.","Plubell, Deanna L.; Käll, Lukas; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo; Bramer, Lisa; Ives, Ashley; Kelleher, Neil L.; Smith, Lloyd M.; Montine, Thomas J.; Wu, Christine C.; MacCoss, Michael J.",bioRxiv,373,13

In fact, accumulating evidence indicates a global increase in the incidence of fatigue, brain fog and depression, including among non-infected, since the pandemic onset. Motivated by previous evidence linking those symptoms to neuroimmune activation in other pathological contexts, we hypothesized that subjects examined after the enforcement of lockdown/stay-at-home measures would demonstrate increased neuroinflammation. We performed simultaneous brain Positron Emission Tomography / Magnetic Resonance Imaging in healthy volunteers either before (n=57) or after (n=15) the 2020 Massachusetts lockdown, using [11C]PBR28, a radioligand for the glial marker 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). First, we compared [11C]PBR28 signal across pre- and post-lockdown cohorts. Then, we evaluated the link between neuroinflammatory signals and scores on a questionnaire assessing mental and physical impacts of the pandemic. Further, we investigated multivariate associations between the spatial pattern of [11C]PBR28 post-lockdown changes and constitutive brain gene expression in post-mortem brains (Allen Human Brain Atlas). Finally, in a subset (n=13 pre-lockdown; n=11 post-lockdown), we also used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify brain (thalamic) levels of myoinositol (mIns), another neuroinflammatory marker. Both [11C]PBR28 and mIns signals were overall stable pre-lockdown, but markedly elevated after lockdown, including within brain regions previously implicated in stress, depression and 'sickness behaviors'. Moreover, amongst the post-lockdown cohort, subjects endorsing higher symptom burden showed higher [11C]PBR28 PET signal compared to those reporting little/no symptoms. Finally, the post-lockdown [11C]PBR28 signal changes were spatially aligned with the constitutive expression of several genes highly expressed in glial/immune cells and/or involved in neuroimmune signaling. Our results suggest that pandemic-related stressors may have induced sterile neuroinflammation in healthy individuals that were not infected with SARS-CoV-2.

It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects a series of human tissues, including lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, etc. ACE2 has been identified as the primary receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. The relatively low expression level of this known receptor in the lungs, which is the predominantly infected organ in COVID-19, indicates that there may be some other co-receptors or alternative receptors of SARS-CoV-2 to work in coordination with ACE2. Here, we identified twenty-one candidate receptors of SARS-CoV-2, including ACE2-interactor proteins and SARS-CoV receptors. Then we investigated the protein expression levels of these twenty-one candidate receptors in different human tissues and found that five of which CAT, MME, L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, and AGTR2 were specifically expressed in SARS-CoV-2 affected tissues. Next, we performed molecular simulations of the above five candidate receptors with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and found that the binding affinities of CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN to S protein were even higher than ACE2. Interestingly, we also observed that CAT and AGTR2 bound to S protein in different regions with ACE2 conformationally, suggesting that these two proteins are likely capable of the co-receptors of ACE2. Conclusively, we considered that CAT, AGTR2, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were the potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, AGTR2 and DC-SIGN tend to be highly expressed in the lungs of smokers, which is consistent with clinical phenomena of COVID-19, and further confirmed our conclusion. Besides, we also predicted the binding hot spots for these putative protein-protein interactions, which would help develop drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Guo, Dongjie; Guo, Ruifang; Li, Zhaoyang; Zhang, Yuyang; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Aziz, Tursunjan; Zhang, Yang; Liu, Lijun",bioRxiv,373,16

Design: A retrospective study of publicly available country-level data. Setting: Fifty countries having the highest number of confirmed COVID--19 cases at the end of July 2021. Participants: Aggregated data including 182 085 182 COVID-19 cases confirmed in the selected fifty countries from the start of the epidemic to July 31, 2021. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The daily values of COVID-19 R and CFR measures were estimated using country-level data from the Our World in Data website. Results: The mean values of country-level moving averages of R and CFR went down from 1.114 and 5.51%, respectively, on July 31, 2020, to 1.059 and 2.35% on January 31, 2021, and to 1.010 and 2.17% by July 31, 2021. In parallel, the cross-country variance of R and CFR moving averages decreased from 0.015 and 0.19%, respectively, on July 31, 2020, to 0.004 and 0.02% on January 31, 2021, and stayed on a similar level by July 31, 2021. Conclusions: The continuous decrease in the country-level moving averages of R, down to the level of 1.0, accompanied by repeated outbreaks (""waves"") in various countries, may indicate that COVID-19 has reached its point of a stable endemic equilibrium. Only a prohibitively high level of herd immunity (about 70%) can stop the endemic by reaching a stable disease-free equilibrium. Also, the average percentage of the fully vaccinated population appears to be the only statistically significant factor associated with country-specific CFR, bringing it close to the level of seasonal flu (about 0.1%) after vaccinating more than half of a country's population. Thus, while the currently available vaccines prove to be effective in reducing mortality from the existing COVID-19 variants, they are unlikely to stop the spread of the virus in the foreseeable future. It is noteworthy that no statistically significant effects of government measures restricting the people's behavior (such as lockdowns) were found in the analyzed data.","Last, M.",,373,16

Suspected development of advanced biological weapons by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), despite its status as a party to both the BWC and other nonproliferation agreements, has emphasized the need for international efforts to keep biological weapons out of the hands of rogue nations and terrorist networks. Among the numerous weaponized cultures believed to be in development by the North Korean military are anthrax, botulism, cholera, plague and smallpox. With a steady decrease in resources and attention devoted to preparedness for biological attacks or outbreaks since 2001, the United States and its allies remain vulnerable to biological weapons in development by North Korea. An ongoing example of this danger is demonstrated by the international community’s struggle to respond to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. With United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540’s expiration in 2021, this paper aims to assess its effectiveness in preventing the proliferation of biological weapons by analyzing the legal requirements UNSCR 1540 imposes on UN member nations. Using North Korea’s biological weapons program as a case study, this paper will evaluate the successes and failures of UNSCR 1540’s legal mechanisms in controlling biological weapons development in North Korea in its penultimate year of validity. This paper will also examine the overlapping roles served by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), and UNSCR 1540, and how their administrative frameworks identify and respond to natural disease outbreaks and biological attacks. Finally, this paper will recommend actions the United Nations Security Council may take to more effectively pursue its mission of nonproliferation.

CHIKV is an enveloped virus belonging to the Togaviridae family and enters its host cell primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Upon internalization, the endocytic vesicle containing the virus particle moves through the cell and delivers the virus to early endosomes where membrane fusion is observed. Thereafter, the nucleocapsid dissociates and the viral RNA is translated into proteins. In this study, we examined the importance of the microtubule network during the early steps of infection and dissected the intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry. We observed two distinct CHIKV intracellular trafficking patterns prior to membrane hemifusion. Whereas half of the CHIKV virions remained static during cell entry and fused in the cell periphery, the other half showed fast-directed microtubule-dependent movement prior to delivery to Rab5-positive early endosomes and predominantly fused in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disruption of the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells. At these conditions, membrane hemifusion activity was not affected yet fusion was restricted to the cell periphery. Furthermore, follow-up experiments revealed that disruption of the microtubule network impairs the delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytosol. We therefore hypothesize that microtubules may direct the particle to a cellular location that is beneficial for establishing infection or aids in nucleocapsid uncoating. Author Summary Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus that is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Disease symptoms can include fever, rash, myalgia, and long-lasting debilitating joint pains. Unfortunately, there is currently no licensed vaccine or antiviral treatment available to combat CHIKV. Understanding the virus:host interactions during the replication cycle of the virus is crucial for the development of effective antiviral therapies. In this study we elucidated the trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles early in infection. During cell entry, CHIKV virions require an intact microtubule network for efficient delivery of the viral genome into the host cell thereby increasing the chance to productively infect a cell.","Hoornweg, Tabitha E.; Bouma, Ellen M.; van de Pol, Denise P.I.; Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela A.; Smit, Jolanda M.",bioRxiv,373,16

Minorities face particularly negative outcomes of the pandemic, and racial tensions after George Floyd's murder may have worsened effects. We examined group differences by race/ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES) in depressive symptoms and protective factors in parents of children with T1D in summer 2020. Methods: Participants were n=100 parents (98% mothers) of youth with T1D (60% female, M age=6.7±1.6 yrs, M T1D duration = 2.9±.5 yrs), who completed a behavioral RCT ≥6 months prior. In July/July 2020, parents selfreported on awareness of how to obtain housing/financial/food resources (Protective Factor Survey Concrete Support [PFS-CS] subscale) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression [CESD]). Race/ethnicity (66% non-Hispanic white, 12% non-Hispanic Black, 11% Hispanic, 11% other) and health insurance (33% public, 67% private) were reported at RCT enrollment. We ran ANOVAs and Pearson correlations to compare CES-D and PFS-CS by demographic groups. Results: PFS-CS scores differed significantly by race/ethnicity and insurance status, both p<.01. Hispanic (M=1.6±0.5) and non-Hispanic Black (M=1.6±0.6) parents had higher CS than non-Hispanic white parents (M = 1.3±0.3). Those with public insurance (M = 1.6±0.5) had higher CS than those with private insurance (M = 1.3±0.3). Higher CS correlated with lower CES-D, r = -.26, p = .05. CES-D did not differ across groups. Conclusion: Racially/ethnically diverse and lower SES parents of children with T1D reported more knowledge about how to access useful resources. This may have buffered against elevated mood symptoms during cooccurring major societal and public health stressors in 2020. Highlighting sources of support and resilience may be a useful strategy in strength-based interventions for parents of children with T1D.","Jones, J. N.; Carreon, S. A.; Rooney, K.; Wang, C.

Much has been developed on its potential to include groups marginalized by capitalism in new development schemes, but to date there has been no work regarding immigrants' participation specifically. This research aims to fill this gap. Purpose The article investigates the importance of the partnership between institutions in the host country and immigrants to their insertion in the Solidarity Economy Fairs in Florianopolis. It questions to what extent it has furthered income generation, the formation of social identity, and the construction of community ties. Methods and approach The approach is anchored in intervention-research, proposing a socio-analytical intervention (Aguiar & Rocha, 2007). To pursue qualitative research, an online form was distributed to participants at the Immigrant Fair. The form comprised semi-structured interviews, with the possibility of giving free answers. Findings The data analysis reveals the nuances of the life trajectory of recent immigrants in Brazil: people, mostly of Latin American origin, over 30 years of age, seeking economic insertion in another country. For them, the Solidarity Economy has offered a possibility for social and economic insertion in Brazil. The opportunity for marginalized populations to engage with the Solidarity Economy offers an effective tool against systemic competition. The Fair operates as an alternative to the insertion into the capitalist market for outsider groups, enabling new ways to conduct economic life within the capitalist economy. Policy implications Our findings suggest that the Fair has provided immigrants both the means to obtain a weekly (although unstable) financial income and their social integration-it requires interaction with other immigrants, state agents, tourists, and the local community. The social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized both outcomes. In order to consolidate solidarity ventures and immigrants' enterprises, there is an urgent need to implement a public policy regarding immigrants' social and economic rights in Santa Catarina State.","Annoni, D.; Silva, K.

To analyze the cutting force during power skiving, a geometric simulation of the power skiving process, particularly a visualization of the resulting machining shape and a prediction of the chip geometry generated during the cutting process, is important. In this study, we propose a novel method for precisely simulating the power skiving process using solid modeling. The resulting shape of power skiving is computed by repeatedly subtracting the swept volume of the cutting edge from a solid model of the workpiece. To realize a robust computation in a subtraction operation, a solid model with triple-dexel representation is used to represent the workpiece shape. To accelerate the operations, the parallel processing function of a graphics processing unit (GPU) is used. An experimental simulation system is implemented, and some computational experiments are conducted.","Inui, Masatomo; Huang, Yu; Onozuka, Hideaki; Umezu, Nobuyuki",Procedia Manufacturing,373,24

To analyze current evidence about etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COVID-19 associated myocarditis. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is possible in COVID-19 including inflammatory damage to the myocardium, which may last over several months and worsen the disease outcome. Mechanisms of inflammatory cardiac damage include direct damage by SARS-CoV-2, massive release of cytokines, dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system. All these factors can aggravate pre-existing overload of the right heart chambers in patients with multifocal pneumonia, thrombosis of coronary arteries and myocardial ischemia. Inflammation of the myocardium manifests with typical symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. It can be accompanied by heart failure with rapid decompensation, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome or even sudden death. Laboratory findings in COVID-19 associated myocarditis include high levels of CRP, BNP, NT-proBNP, and D-dimer. Transthoracic echocardiography allows for an assessment of the left ventricular dysfunction and diagnosis of a pericardial effusion. Heart MRI according to the Lake Louise Diagnostic Criteria is the most sensitive diagnostic method in acute myocarditis. Medical imaging is indicated only in cases when results obtained can potentially influence the patient management tactics and should be performed according to the shortest protocol due to high risks of virus transmission. Conclusions. ESC experts (2020) do not provide unanimous recommendations for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 associated myocarditis, considering a lack of the evidence base. Patient management is limited to adequate treatment of heart failure, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and prevention of thrombotic complications. Ongoing studies are aiming to evaluate potential place of glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulins, antibodies against IL-6 receptor, colchicine in the treatment of COVID-19.","Buheruk, V.

Method: This commentary explores the experiences of 4 pediatric psychology interns and their training director during the height of the pandemic with an emphasis on challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned relevant to internship training. Results: There were numerous challenges in adapting and completing training during the pandemic, such as the rapid transition to telehealth, loss of training opportunities, providing care to inpatient and high-risk patients, and increased personal stress and social isolation. Despite these challenges, there were unique opportunities that arose. Interns were given opportunities to learn a new modality of care (telehealth), expand their breadth of training, practice innovation, receive live supervision in unobtrusive ways, and actively support their medical colleagues. Conclusions: Looking toward the future of health care, interns will significantly benefit from the skills learned during this pandemic, particularly as skills in providing evidence-based care via telehealth will continue to benefit psychologists seeking to increase access to care for patients and families. Institutions providing pediatric psychology internship training may also benefit from incorporating these training opportunities and lessons learned into future internship training in order to best support interns' professional and personal needs.

Since 1954, the Soil Conservation Services (SCS) Curve Number (CN0.2) rainfall-runoff model has been widely used but reportedly produced inconsistent results in field studies worldwide. As such, this article presents methodology to reassess the validity of the model and perform model calibration with inferential statistics. A closed form equation was solved to narrow previous research gap with a derived 3D runoff difference model for type II error assessment. Under this study, the SCS runoff model is statistically insignificant (alpha = 0.01) without calibration. Curve Number CN0.2 = 72.58 for Peninsula Malaysia with a 99% confidence interval range of 67 to 76. Within these CN0.2 areas, SCS model underpredicts runoff amounts when the rainfall depth of a storm is &lt; 70 mm. Its overprediction tendency worsens in cases involving larger storm events. For areas of 1 km2, it underpredicted runoff amount the most (2.4 million liters) at CN0.2 = 67 and the rainfall depth of 55 mm while it nearly overpredicted runoff amount by 25 million liters when the storm depth reached 430 mm in Peninsula Malaysia. The SCS model must be validated with rainfall-runoff datasets prior to its adoption for runoff prediction in any part of the world. SCS practitioners are encouraged to adopt the general formulae from this article to derive assessment models and equations for their studies.","Ling, Lloyd Yusop Zulkifli Ling Joan Lucille",Mathematics,373,1

In contrast to other viral esterases, no activity was detectable with natural substrates containing 9-O-acetylated sialic acids. Furthermore, PV esterase was unable to remove influenza C virus receptors from human erythrocytes, indicating a substrate specificity different from HEs of influenza C virus and bovine coronavirus. Solid-phase binding assays revealed that purified PV was unable to bind to sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates like bovine submaxillary mucin, mouse alpha1 macroglobulin or bovine brain extract.

The present study evaluated the diagnostic value of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels for cases of severe pneumonia. A total of 862 children, hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections, were evaluated between September 2008 and February 2011; the serum levels of CRP were measured in all the children. Bacterial identification was performed, while polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the 12 respiratory viruses. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with independent [CRP, proportion of neutrophils (NEUT), body temperature, sputum production, age and dyspnea] and dependent (severe and mild pneumonia) variables for clinical diagnosis, which produced three new variables that represented an individual's predictive value: Pre-1, Pre-2 and Pre-3. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated using the new variables to assess their predictive value for severe pneumonia. Of the 862 patients, 108 individuals were diagnosed with severe pneumonia and 754 individuals had mild pneumonia. Increased levels of CRP were associated with severe pneumonia and bacterial infection (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that severe pneumonia was associated with the levels of CRP, body temperature, expectoration, age, NEUT and dyspnea (P<0.05). The ROC curve of the regression diagnostics model sequentially presented CRP, CRP and the other five correlative variables (NEUT + body temperature + sputum production + age + dyspnea) and the other five correlative variables used to diagnose severe pneumonia. The area under curve values were determined as 0.550 for Pre-1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.490-0.609], 0.897 for Pre-2 (95% CI, 0.861-0.932) and 0.893 for Pre-3 (95% CI, 0.855-0.931). The results revealed that the six correlative variables had improved accuracy in the diagnosis of severe pneumonia. The serum levels of CRP were strongly associated with bacterial infection and severe pneumonia. Therefore, the CRP level, along with other parameters, may be used as early indicators of severe pneumonia development. However, the efficiency of the CRP level alone to diagnose severe pneumonia was found to be limited.","Wu, Jianjun; Jin, Y U; Li, Hailong; Xie, Zhiping; Li, Jinsong; Ao, Yuanyun; Duan, Zhaojun",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,373,11

The organization and expression of the 19,296-nucleotide (nt) CTV genome resembles that of coronaviruses, with polyprotein processing, translational frameshifting, and multiple sgRNA formation, but phylogenetically the CTV polymerase, like polymerases of other closteroviruses, belongs to the Sindbis virus-like lineage of RNA virus polymerases. Both positive-strand RNA virus supergroups, coronaviruses and Sindbis-like viruses, utilize different mechanisms of transcription. To address the mechanism of CTV transcription, 5' termini for the two most abundant sgRNAs, 1.5 and 0.9 kb, respectively, were mapped by runoff reverse transcription. The two sgRNAs were demonstrated to have 48- and 38-nt 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs), respectively. The 5'-UTR for the 1.5-kb RNA was cloned, sequenced, and demonstrated to be colinear with the 48-nt genomic sequence upstream of the initiator codon of the respective open reading frame 10, i.e., to be of continuous template origin. The data obtained suggest that the sgRNA transcription of CTV is dissimilar from the coronavirus transcription and consistent with the transcriptional mechanism of other Sindbis-like viruses. Thus, the Sindbis virus-like mechanism of transcription of the positive-strand RNA genomes might be successfully utilized by the closterovirus genome of up to 19.3 kb with multiple sgRNAs.","Karasev, A V; Hilf, M E; Garnsey, S M; Dawson, W O",Journal of virology,373,16

The transmission route of SARS has been clarified, but the immunopathogenesis of SARS is unclear. In an age-matched case-control design, we studied immune parameters in 15 SARS patients who were previously healthy. Plasma was harvested for detection of virus load, cytokines, and nitrite/nitrate levels, and blood leukocytes were subjected to flow cytometric analysis of intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in different leukocytes. Patients with SARS had significantly higher IL-8 levels (p = 0.016) in early stage, and higher IL-2 levels (p = 0.039) in late stage than normal controls. Blood TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10, and nitrite/nitrate levels were not significantly elevated. In contrast, TGF-beta and PGE(2) levels were significantly elevated in SARS patients. Five of the 15 SARS patients had detectable coronaviruses in blood, but patients with detectable and undetectable viremia had no different profiles of immune mediators. Flow cytometric analysis of MAPKs activation by phospho-p38 and phospho-p44/42 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) expression showed that augmented p38 activation (p = 0.044) of CD14 monocytes associated with suppressed p38 activation (p = 0.033) of CD8 lymphocytes was found in SARS patients. These results suggest that regulation of TGF-beta and PGE(2) production and MAPKs activation in different leukocytes may be considered while developing therapeutics for the SARS treatment.","Lee, Chen-Hsiang; Chen, Rong-Fu; Liu, Jien-Wei; Yeh, Wen-Tien; Chang, Jen-Chieh; Liu, Po-Mai; Eng, Hock-Liew; Lin, Meng-Chih; Yang, Kuender D",Journal of immunology,373,28

Wound tissue damage upon removal of the foam may cause the reported pain. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P are neuropeptides that cause inflammation and signal pain and are known to be released when tissue trauma occurs. The aim of this controlled in vivo study was to compare the expression of CGRP and substance P in the wound bed in control wounds and following NPWT and foam or gauze dressing removal. Eight pigs with two wounds each were treated with open-pore structure polyurethane foam or AMD gauze and NPWT of 0 (control) or -80 mm Hg for 72 hours. Following removal of the wound filler, the expression of CGRP and substance P was measured, using arbitrary units, in sections of biopsies from the wound bed using immunofluorescence techniques. Substance P and CGRP were more abundant in the wound edge following the removal of foam than of gauze dressings and least abundant in control wounds. The immunofluorescence staining of the wound edge for CGRP was 52 ± 3 au after the removal of gauze and 97 ± 5 au after the removal of foam (P <0.001). For substance P, the staining was 55 ± 3 au after gauze removal and 95 ± 4 au after foam removal (P <0.001). CGRP and substance P staining was primarily located to nerves and leukocytes. The increase in CGRP and substance P immunofluorescence was especially prominent in the dermis but also was seen in subcutaneous and muscle tissue. Using gauze may be one way of reducing NPWT dressing change-related pain. New wound fillers designed to optimize granulation tissue formation and minimize pain issues presumably will be developed in the near future.","Malmsjö, Malin; Gustafsson, Lotta; Lindstedt, Sandra; Ingemansson, Richard",Ostomy/wound management,373,28

The causative agent was identified as a novel b-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was named COVID-19. Since the beginning of 2020, the infection has spread worldwide, which led the WHO to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern and to characterize the current situation as a pandemic. The transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days. Most cases are mild, but some patients develop severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress, septic shock and multi-organ failure. The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, myalgia and shortness of breath. Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found. Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3 %, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities. Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma.","Trojánek, Milan; Grebenyuk, Vyacheslav; Herrmannová, Kristýna; Nečas, Tomáš; Gregorová, Jana; Kucbel, Martin; Šín, Robin; Roháčová, Hana; Stejskal, František",Casopis lekaru ceskych,373,26

We present the rationale for the public health response to both incidents, and report results of contact tracing. Following a risk assessment, passengers seated two seats around the cases were prioritised for contact tracing and a proactive media approach was used to alert all passengers on the planes of their possible exposure in both incidents. In total, 64 United Kingdom (UK) residents were successfully contacted, 14 of whom were sat in the priority area two seats all around the case(s). Five passengers reported respiratory symptoms within 14 days of the flight, but all tested were negative for MERS-CoV. Details of non-UK residents were passed on to relevant World Health Organization International Health Regulation focal points for follow-up, and no further cases were reported back. Different approaches were used to manage contact tracing for each flight due to variations in the quality and timeliness of the passenger contact information provided by the airlines involved.

It sets out proposals for better preparedness to tackle the disease in future. BACKGROUND Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) started to strike Hong Kong in March 2003. A total of 1,755 SARS cases with 298 deaths were reported. Prior to the occurrence of the disease in Hong Kong, an intense outbreak of atypical pneumonia was reported in the nearby Guangdong Province in Mainland China. RESULTS There were three phases in the epidemic. The first phase in March 2003 involved a teaching hospital. The infection originated from a visiting professor from Guangdong, He developed SARS in Hong Kong and died in a Hong Kong hospital. The second phase in April was the spread of the infection from the hospital to the community. The third phase in May was the declining period which ended in June following the removal of Hong Kong from the list of infected areas by WHO. CONCLUSION Hong Kong was ill-prepared at the early stage of the epidemic. The epidemic produced not only health but also social, economic and humanitarian problems. The epidemic, however, created a strong sense of unity among all sectors of the population in the fight against the disease.","Lee, S H",Methods of information in medicine,373,25

METHODS Real-time teleconferences and live demonstrations with medical-quality videos, broadcast via the Digital Video Transport System, have been used to teach surgical techniques and other medical procedures across national borders. The Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) committee in August 2005 formally approved our proposal to establish a medical working group within APAN. The network was expanded by the launch of the Trans-Eurasia Information Network 2 in 2006. By the end of 2006, we had conducted 82 events, in 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The multi-station event has increased every year. RESULTS There have been no serious transmission problems or ethical conflicts so far. With these experiences and current achievements, we hope to extend this advanced network system to the entire Asia-Pacific. CONCLUSION This system is a promising and very useful tool for the standardization of medical system and procedures across national borders. Drawing upon these experiences and current achievements, we hope to extend this advanced network system to the entire Asia-Pacific region.","Nakashima, N; Shimizu, S; Okamura, K; Hahm, J S; Kim, Y W; Han, H S; Torata, N; Antoku, Y; Lee, Y S; Tanaka, M",Methods of information in medicine,373,20

This virus encodes spike (S) glycoproteins that are extraordinarily effective mediators of intercellular membrane fusion, unique in their ability to initiate fusion even without prior interaction with the primary MHV receptor, a murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM). In considering the possible role of this hyperactive membrane fusion activity in neurovirulence, we discovered that the growth of JHM in tissue culture selected for variants that had lost murine CEACAM-independent fusion activity. Among the collection of variants, mutations were identified in regions encoding both the receptor-binding (S1) and fusion-inducing (S2) subunits of the spike protein. Each mutation was separately introduced into cDNA encoding the prototype JHM spike, and the set of cDNAs was expressed using vaccinia virus vectors. The variant spikes were similar to that of JHM in their assembly into oligomers, their proteolysis into S1 and S2 cleavage products, their transport to cell surfaces, and their affinity for a soluble form of murine CEACAM. However, these tissue culture-adapted spikes were significantly stabilized as S1-S2 heteromers, and their entirely CEACAM-dependent fusion activity was delayed or reduced relative to prototype JHM spikes. The mutations that we have identified therefore point to regions of the S protein that specifically regulate the membrane fusion reaction. We suggest that cultured cells, unlike certain in vivo environments, select for S proteins with delayed, CEACAM-dependent fusion activities that may increase the likelihood of virus internalization prior to the irreversible uncoating process.","Krueger, D K; Kelly, S M; Lewicki, D N; Ruffolo, R; Gallagher, T M",Journal of virology,373,16

METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective study of 836 cases in Hubei. To avoid the collinearity among the indicators, principal component analysis (PCA) followed by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to obtain an overview of laboratory assessments. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were respectively used to explore risk factors associated with disease severity and mortality. Survival analysis was performed in patients with the most common comorbidities. RESULTS: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prealbumin were associated with disease severity in patients with or without comorbidities, indicated by both PCA/PLS-DA and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The mortality risk was associated with age, LDH, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lymphopenia in patients with comorbidities. CRP was a risk factor associated with short-term mortality in patients with hypertension, but not liver diseases; additionally, D-dimer was a risk factor for death in patients with liver diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Lactate dehydrogenase was a reliable predictor associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality in patients with different medical conditions. Laboratory biomarkers for mortality risk were not identical in patients with comorbidities, suggesting multiple pathophysiological mechanisms following COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Zaishu; Zhang, Furong; Hu, Weihua; Chen, Qijian; Li, Chang; Wu, Longlong; Zhang, Zhuheng; Li, Bin; Ye, Qifa; Mei, Jin; Yue, Jiang",J Clin Lab Anal,373,26

MANAGEMENT: Non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) are efficient mitigation strategies. The success of these NPIs is dependent on the approval and commitment of the population. The launch of a mass vaccination program in many countries in late December 2020 with mRNA vaccines, adenovirus-based vaccines, and inactivated virus vaccines has generated hope for the end of the pandemic. CURRENT ISSUES: The continuous appearance of new pathogenic viral strains and the ability of vaccines to prevent infection and transmission raise important concerns as we try to achieve community immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants. The need of a second and even third generation of vaccines has already been acknowledged by the WHO and governments. PERSPECTIVES: There is a critical and urgent need for a balanced and integrated strategy for the management of the COVID-19 outbreaks organized on three axes: (1) Prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, (2) Detection and early diagnosis of patients at risk of disease worsening, and (3) Anticipation of medical care (PDA).

Preliminarily, Bacillus atrophaeus were inoculated into different environments (dry, hydrated, and saliva) to imitate coughing and sneezing and serve as a ""worst-case"" regarding challenged PPE. The inactivation of the microbes by scCO2 sterilization with NovaKill or H2O2 sterilant was investigated as a function of exposure times ranging from 5 to 90 min with a goal of elucidating possible mechanisms. Also, human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 were inoculated on the respirator material, and viral activity was determined post-treatment. Moreover, we investigated the reprocessing ability of scCO2-based decontamination using wettability testing and surface mapping. Different inactivation mechanisms have been identified in scCO2 sanitization, such as membrane damage, germination defect, and dipicolinic acid leaks. Moreover, the viral sanitization results showed a complete inactivation of both coronavirus HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. We did not observe changes in PPE morphology, topographical structure, or material integrity, and in accordance with the WHO recommendation, maintained wettability post-processing.

More than six million people have been infected, and more than 360,000 of them have died. This is the worst catastrophe suffered by mankind in recent history. In the face of this severe disaster, people all over the world are frightened of the prospect of facing an outbreak or an annual recurrence. However, the development of a vaccine will help control the impact of COVID-19. Women in particular have been more seriously affected by the pandemic. Since the pressure and physical load they suffer are often greater than what men endure, women are more threatened by COVID-19. Though women have a poorer quality of life and work and face worse economic conditions, they also tend to have better physiological immunity than men, which can ease the effect of COVID-19. The early development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is an important issue that must take into consideration women's better immune response to the virus along with the technique of hormone regulation. Relevant research has been conducted on female-specific vaccines in the past, and women's issues were considered during those clinical trials to ensure that complications and antibody responses were positive and effective in women. National policies should also propose good strategies for women to be vaccinated. This could improve consciousness, give women a better vaccination experience, enhance their willingness to vaccinate, and protect them from COVID-19 infection.","Chang, Wen-Han",Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol,373,21

Therefore, alternative testing technologies must be considered and implemented on a large scale to continue prevention efforts. This review seeks to describe the benefits of utilizing at-home HIV testing technologies, traditionally deemed an alternative form of testing. Recent Findings: Utilizing at-home testing technology during the COVID-19 pandemic overcomes novel and previously identified barriers to HIV testing. Summary: Ensuring access to HIV testing is imperative to long-term prevention goals. With the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative in the USA targeting achievement by 2030, obstacles to HIV testing must be addressed to ensure its success. Implementing alternative testing technology more broadly allows for continued prevention efforts for HIV in light of COVID era restrictions.","Warmbrunn, Isabella; Green-Jones, Monique; Outlaw, Angulique Y",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,373,16

Depending on local conditions and order supply differences SARS-CoV-2 restrictions had a massive impact on medical care. To show the impact of plastic surgery on emergency surgery during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the amount of surgical emergencies in a single center plastic surgery division were evaluated. METHOD: The number of plastic surgery cases in a university hospital was evaluated during 16.03.2020 to 27.04.2020 and compared with previous years. RESULTS: Due to cancelling of elective surgery the number of cases dropped to 57,3â % of the caseload of previous years. There was no change in ratio of emergency (2020: 56,4â %; 2017-2019: 54,9â %) and urgent (2020: 44,6â %; 2017-2019: 45â %) surgery. No changes in regard to the etiology of trauma cause nor insurance status (occupational insurance/health insurance) were noted. CONCLUSION: Based on the data of this evaluation there is a clear relevance of Plastic Surgery in the setting of general medical care.

No vaccine to boost mucosal immunity, or as a therapeutic, has yet been developed to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we discover and characterize a cross-reactive human IgA monoclonal antibody, MAb362. MAb362 binds to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and competitively blocks ACE2 receptor binding, by overlapping the ACE2 structural binding epitope. Furthermore, MAb362 IgA neutralizes both pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in 293 cells expressing ACE2. When converted to secretory IgA, MAb326 also neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus while the IgG isotype shows no neutralization. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies, such as MAb362, may provide effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing mucosal immunity within the respiratory system, a potentially critical feature of an effective vaccine.","Ejemel, Monir; Li, Qi; Hou, Shurong; Schiller, Zachary A; Tree, Julia A; Wallace, Aaron; Amcheslavsky, Alla; Kurt Yilmaz, Nese; Buttigieg, Karen R; Elmore, Michael J; Godwin, Kerry; Coombes, Naomi; Toomey, Jacqueline R; Schneider, Ryan; Ramchetty, Anudeep S; Close, Brianna J; Chen, Da-Yuan; Conway, Hasahn L; Saeed, Mohsan; Ganesa, Chandrashekar; Carroll, Miles W; Cavacini, Lisa A; Klempner, Mark S; Schiffer, Celia A; Wang, Yang",Nat Commun,373,1

METHODS: US scans of the neck vasculature were collected to produce a dataset of 2439 images and their respective manual segmentations. Fourfold cross-validation was employed to train and evaluate Mask RCNN and U-Net models. The U-Net algorithm includes a post-processing step that selects the largest connected segmentation for each class. A Mask R-CNN-based vascular reconstruction pipeline was validated by performing a surface-to-surface distance comparison between US and CT reconstructions from the same patient. RESULTS: The average CA and IJV Dice scores produced by the Mask R-CNN across the evaluation data from all four sets were [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The average Dice scores produced by the post-processed U-Net were [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], for the CA and IJV, respectively. The reconstruction algorithm utilizing the Mask R-CNN was capable of producing accurate 3D reconstructions with majority of US reconstruction surface points being within 2 mm of the CT equivalent. CONCLUSIONS: On average, the Mask R-CNN produced more accurate vascular segmentations compared to U-Net. The Mask R-CNN models were used to produce 3D reconstructed vasculature with a similar accuracy to that of a manually segmented CT scan. This implementation of the Mask R-CNN network enables automatic analysis of the neck vasculature and facilitates 3D vascular reconstruction.","Groves, Leah A; VanBerlo, Blake; Veinberg, Natan; Alboog, Abdulrahman; Peters, Terry M; Chen, Elvis C S",,373,21

World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend using alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) for hand hygiene in healthcare settings to prevent HCAIs. Irrational use of ABHR will have undesirable consequences including wastage of products, exposure of healthcare providers to infections and emergence of microbial resistance to the alcohol in hand sanitizers. This study aimed to explore the perspective and experiences of compounding pharmacists on production and utilization of ABHR solution for coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) prevention in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study using in-depth interview of 13 key-informants serving as compounding pharmacists in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was conducted. The study participants were identified and selected by purposive sampling. All transcribed interviews were subjected to thematic analysis and transcripts were analyzed manually. FINDINGS: The compounding pharmacists in this study had a mean age of 30.6 (±3.1) years and nine of the thirteen participants were men. Ten participants believed that the compounding practice in their respective sites followed the principles of good compounding practice. More than half of the participants did not believe that ABHR products were used rationally in health facilities. They argued that users did not have enough awareness when and how to use sanitizers. Most of the interviewees reported that compounding personnel had no formal training on ABHR solution production. Study participants suggested incentive mechanisms and reimbursements for experts involved in the compounding of ABHR solutions. CONCLUSION: Three of the compounding pharmacists indicated that ABHR production in their setting lack compliance to good compounding practice due to inadequate compounding room, quality control tests, manpower and equipment. Despite this, most study participants preferred the in-house ABHR products than the commercially available ones. Thus, training, regular monitoring and follow-up of the hospital compounding services can further build staff confidence.","Baye, Assefa Mulu; Ababu, Andualem; Bayisa, Regasa; Abdella, Mahdi; Diriba, Edessa; Wale, Minyechel; Selam, Muluken Nigatu",PLoS One,373,26

Among the physicians constituting the study population, residents, attendings, and subspecialists from different fields were included. These physicians were working in the quarantine services, inpatient services, intensive care units, and polyclinics. A short and easy face-to-face survey, in which included questions on demographic information, medicolegal subjects, and questions from the Maslach Burnout Inventory, was used to collect data. While 58.2% of the physicians stated that they were extremely worried about malpractice in the pandemic period, 82.1% stated they needed training on medicolegal subjects, and 25.4% stated they were exposed to violence during work. Three sub-dimensions within the burnout inventory were compared with other parameters. The Cronbach alpha value was found highly reliable in the evaluation of the answers' internal consistency. The notable significance of burnout was interesting regarding physicians' anxiety on medicolegal issues and exposure to violence (p < 0.05).

The success of such interventions depends on the antibody potency in such plasma donations, but little information on the collection of potent units is currently available. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 8749 plasma units, collected from April until September 2020 from first-time U.S. COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors, were characterized for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by Abbott chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). The period between COVID-19 onset until donation and donor age, ethnicity, sex, and COVID-19 severity were evaluated against the obtained signal (index S/C). RESULTS: A marked decrease in mean index S/C was seen over the plasma collection period surveyed, which was significantly correlated to decreases in mean plasma donor age (p < .0001; R2 = .726) and percentage of donations obtained from COVID-19 convalescent patients who had been hospitalized (p = .001; R2 = .4426). The highest titer plasma units were obtained soon after convalescence from COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization, from advanced age donors, and from Black/African/Hispanic American versus White/Caucasian ethnicities, whereas there was no effect of donor sex on the values obtained with the Abbott CMIA. CONCLUSION: Since the onset of the pandemic, the average SARS-CoV-2 IgG values of first-time U.S. COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations have significantly dropped, mainly due to donations from progressively younger aged donors who tend to experience less severe COVID-19.","Karbiener, Michael; Farcet, Maria R; Ilk, Reinhard; Schreiner, Jessica; Lenart, James; Powers, Nicholas; Stewart, Joseph M; Tallman, Hema; Kreil, Thomas R",Transfusion,373,20

To this end, the handling of infectious medical waste has been particularly more vital than ever. Therefore, in this study, a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to formulate the sustainable multi-trip location-routing problem with time windows (MTLRP-TW) for medical waste management in the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives are to concurrently minimize the total traveling time, total violation from time windows/service priorities and total infection/environmental risk imposed on the population around disposal sites. Here, the time windows play a key role to define the priority of services for hospitals with a different range of risks. To deal with the uncertainty, a fuzzy chance-constrained programming approach is applied to the proposed model. A real case study is investigated in Sari city of Iran to test the performance and applicability of the proposed model. Accordingly, the optimal planning of vehicles is determined to be implemented by the municipality, which takes 19.733 h to complete the processes of collection, transportation and disposal. Finally, several sensitivity analyses are performed to examine the behavior of the objective functions against the changes of controllable parameters and evaluate optimal policies and suggest useful managerial insights under different conditions.","Tirkolaee, Erfan Babaee; Abbasian, Parvin; Weber, Gerhard-Wilhelm",Sci Total Environ,373,26

METHODS: We investigated the viral loads, therapies, clinical features, and immune responses in a 70-year patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 3 months. FINDINGS: The patient exhibited the highest prevalence of abnormal indices of clinical features and immune responses at the first admission, including fever (38.3 â), decreased lymphocytes (0.83 × 109/L) and serum potassium (3.1 mmol/L), as well as elevated serum creatinine (115 µmol/L), urea (8.6 mmol/L), and C-reactive protein (80 mg/L). By contrast, at the second and the third admission, these indices were all normal. Through three admissions, IL-2 increased from 0.14 pg/mL, 0.69 pg/mL, to 0.91 pg/mL, while IL-6 decreased from 11.78 pg/mL, 1.52 pg/mL, to 0.69 pg/mL, so did IL-10 from 5.13 pg/mL, 1.85 pg/mL, to 1.75 pg/mL. The steady declining trend was also found in TNF-&#945; (1.49, 1.15, and 0.85 pg/mL) and IFN-Î³ (0.64, 0.42, and 0.27 pg/mL). The threshold cycle values of RT-PCR were 26.1, 30.5, and 23.5 for ORFlab gene, and 26.2, 30.6, and 22.7 for N gene, showing the patient had higher viral loads at the first and the third admission than during the middle term of the disease. The patient also showed substantially improved acute exudative lesions on the chest CT scanning images. CONCLUSIONS: The patient displayed declining immune responses in spite of the viral shedding for 3 months. We inferred the declining immune responses might result from the segregation of the virus from the immune system.","Gao, Guosheng; Zhu, Zhe; Fan, Lingyan; Ye, Shuyuan; Huang, Zuoan; Shi, Qiaoyun; Sun, Yedan; Song, Qifa",Infection,373,26

Addressing this problem, in this work we propose an experimental method to analyze and compare VCSs. Our method is based on real-world experiments where the client-side is controlled, and focuses on VCS resource requirements and performance. We design and implement a tool to automatically conduct these real-world experiments, and use it to compare three platforms on the client side: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Jitsi.

Patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled and divided into seven groups according to the treatment option. Information including age, sex, and duration from illness onset to admission, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data at admission, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging obtained at admission and after a 5-day treatment cycle were assessed. The clinical symptoms and laboratory tests at discharge were also assessed. At admission, no significant differences were found among the groups, including the duration from illness onset to admission, clinical symptoms, and main laboratory results. No significant differences were found among the groups in terms of the proportion of patients with pneumonia resolution (P = .151) after treatment or the length of hospital stay (P = .116). At discharge, 7 of 184 (4%) patients had a mild cough while their other symptoms had disappeared, and the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function and with increased leukocytes, neutrophils or erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the 184 patients were close to those at admission.

SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread rapidly and became a global pandemic in early 2020. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is responsible for viral entry and binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells, making it a major target of the immune system ? particularly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that are induced by infection or vaccines. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membraned particles constitutively released by cells, including virally-infected cells. EVs and viruses enclosed within lipid membranes share some characteristics: they are small, sub-micron particles and they overlap in cellular biogenesis and egress routes. Given their shared characteristics, we hypothesized that EVs released from spike-expressing cells could carry spike and serve as decoys for anti-spike nAbs, promoting viral infection. Here, using mass spectrometry and nanoscale flow cytometry (NFC) approaches, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be incorporated into EVs. Furthermore, we show that spike-carrying EVs act as decoy targets for convalescent patient serum-derived nAbs, reducing their effectiveness in blocking viral entry. These findings have important implications for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and highlight the complex interplay between viruses, extracellular vesicles, and the immune system that occurs during viral infections.","Troyer, Zach Alhusaini Najwa Tabler Caroline O.; Sweet, Thomas de Carvalho Karina Inacio Ladislau Schlatzer Daniela M.; Carias, Lenore King Christopher L.; Matreyek, Kenneth Tilton John C.",Journal of Extracellular Vesicles,373,16

This paper introduces a variant of molecular dynamics-based simulated annealing that is useful for optimizing atomistic structures, and makes use of the heat capacity of the system, determined on the fly during optimization, to adaptively control the cooling rate. This adaptive cooling approach is demonstrated to be more computationally efficient than classical simulated annealing when applied to Lennard-Jones clusters. The increase in efficiency is approximately a factor of two for clusters with 25-40 atoms, and improves as the size of the system increases.","Karabin, Mariia; Stuart, Steven J",J Chem Phys,373,26

Low NO levels have been linked to increased arginase (Ar) activity as Ar competes with NOS for L-arginine. The inhibition of Ar activity can reverse EnD and (-)-epicatechin (Epi) inhibits myocardial Ar activity. In this study, through in silico modeling we demonstrate that Epi interacts with Ar similarly to its inhibitor Norvaline (Norv). Using in vitro and in vivo models of aging, we examined Epi and Norv-inhibition of Ar activity and its endothelium-protective effects. Bovine coronary artery endothelial cells (BCAEC) were treated with Norv (10 µM), Epi (1 µM) or the combination (Epi + Norv) for 48 h. Ar activity increased in aged BCAEC, with decreased NO generation. Treatment decreased Ar activity to levels seen in young cells. Epi and Epi + Norv decreased nitrosylated Ar levels by ~25% in aged cells with lower oxidative stress (~25%) (dihydroethidium) levels. In aged cells, Epi and Epi + Norv restored the eNOS monomer/dimer ratio, protein expression levels and NO production to those of young cells. Furthermore, using 18 month old rats 15 days of treatment with either Epi (1 mg/kg), Norv (10 mg/kg) or combo, decreased hypertension and improved aorta vasorelaxation to acetylcholine, blood NO levels and tetra/dihydribiopterin ratios in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells. In conclusion, results provide evidence that inhibiting Ar with Epi reverses aged-related loss of eNOS function and improves vascular function through the modulation of Ar and eNOS protein levels and activity.","Garate-Carrillo, Alejandra; Navarrete-Yañez, Viridiana; Ortiz-Vilchis, Pilar; Guevara, Gustavo; Castillo, Carmen; Mendoza-Lorenzo, Patricia; Ceballos, Guillermo; Ortiz-Flores, Miguel; Najera, Nayelli; Bustamante-Pozo, Moises Muratt; Rubio-Gayosso, Ivan; Villarreal, Francisco; Ramirez-Sanchez, Israel",Eur J Pharmacol,373,12

The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between the change in levels of perceived psychological stress and vocal symptoms among Israeli academic college professors required to shift to synchronous online teaching during the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online questionnaire was completed by 313 professors (156 men and 157 women) from 14 academic colleges in Israel at the end of the first week of online synchronous teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was assumed to be the most burdened and stressful week of the transition. Participants provided self-reports for the current levels of psychological stress and vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching, as well as general psychological stress and general vocal symptoms during previous periods of teaching. RESULTS: The results revealed higher levels of psychological stress but not vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching compared with previous periods of teaching. Psychological stress during the transition to online synchronous teaching was positively associated with vocal symptoms during this period but this association was moderated by general stress. Although there was a positive association between psychological stress and vocal symptoms for individuals who reported low levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching, this association was especially strong for individuals who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to examine vocal symptoms of professors in specific contexts that are potentially stressful. The psychological stress surrounding the transition to online synchronous teaching was associated with elevated levels of vocal symptoms especially for those who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. These results with professors accord with the notion that psychological stress may have a negative impact on the voice.","Besser, Avi; Lotem, Sari; Zeigler-Hill, Virgil",J. voice,373,16

As these measures took hold in Croatia, the Croatian Poison Control Centre started receiving phone calls from the general public and healthcare workers, which prompted us to investigate whether the risk of suspected/symptomatic poisonings with disinfectants and sanitisers really increased. To that end we compared their frequency and characteristics in the first half of 2019 and 2020. Cases of exposures to disinfectants doubled in the first half of 2020 (41 vs 21 cases in 2019), and exposure to sanitisers increased about nine times (46 vs 5 cases in 2019). In 2020, the most common ingredients of disinfectants and sanitisers involved in poisoning incidents were hypochlorite/glutaraldehyde, and ethanol/isopropyl alcohol, respectively. Exposures to disinfectants were recorded mostly in adults (56 %) as accidental (78 %) through ingestion or inhalation (86 %). Fortunately, most callers were asymptomatic (people called for advice because they were concerned), but nearly half reported mild gastrointestinal or respiratory irritation, and in one case severe symptoms were reported (gastrointestinal corrosive injury). Reports of exposure to hand sanitisers highlighted preschool children as the most vulnerable group. Accidental exposure through ingestion dominated, but, again, only mild symptoms (gastrointestinal or eye irritation) developed in one third of the cases. These preliminary findings, however limited, confirm that increased availability and use of disinfectants and sanitisers significantly increased the risk of poisoning, particularly in preschool children through accidental ingestion of hand sanitisers. We therefore believe that epidemiological recommendations for COVID-19 prevention should include warnings informing the general public of the risks of poisoning with surface and hand disinfectants in particular.","Babic, Zeljka; Turk, Rajka; Macan, Jelena",Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,373,16

However, studies examining outcomes of patients admitted to hospitals not in crisis are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristic and outcomes of all patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals not in crisis, and factors associated with mortality in this population. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis PARTICIPANTS: In total, 470 consecutive patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in one health system in Boston from January 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020. MAIN MEASURES: We collected clinical outcomes during hospitalization including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, receipt of mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors. We utilized multivariable logistic regression models to examine factors associated with mortality. KEY RESULTS: A total of 470 patients (median age 66 [range 23-98], 54.0% male) were included. The most common comorbidities were diabetes (38.5%, 181/470) and obesity (41.3%, 194/470). On admission, 41.9% (197/470) of patients were febrile and 60.6% (285/470) required supplemental oxygen. During hospitalization, 37.9% (178/470) were admitted to the ICU, 33.6% (158/470) received mechanical ventilation, 29.4% (138/470) received vasopressors, 16.4% (77/470) reported limitations on their desire for life-sustaining therapies such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 25.1% (118/470) died. Among those admitted to the ICU (N=178), the median number of days on the ventilator was 10 days (IQR 1-29), and 58.4% (104/178) were discharged alive. Older age (OR=1.04, P<0.001), male sex (OR=2.14, P=0.007), higher comorbidities (OR=1.20, P=0.001), higher lactate dehydrogenase on admission (2nd tertile: OR=4.07, P<0.001; 3rd tertile: OR=8.04, P<0.001), and the need for supplemental oxygen on admission (OR=2.17, P=0.014) were all associated with higher mortality.

R0 is used to determine the ability of a disease to spread within a given population. The reproduction number (R) represents the transmissibility of a disease. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to calculate the R0 of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in Sri Lanka and to describe the variation of R, with its implications to the prevention and control of the disease. METHODS: Data was obtained from daily situation reports of the Epidemiology Unit, Sri Lanka and a compartmental model was used to calculate the R0 using estimated model parameters. This value was corroborated by using two more methods, the exponential growth rate method and maximum likelihood method to obtain a better estimate for R0. The variation of R was illustrated using a Bayesian statistical inference-based method. RESULTS: The R0 calculated by the first model was 1.02 [confidence interval (CI) of 0.75-1.29] with a root mean squared error of 7.72. The exponential growth rate method and the maximum likelihood estimation method yielded an R0 of 0.93 (CI of 0.77-1.10) and a R0 of 1.23 (CI of 0.94-1.57) respectively. The variation of R ranged from 0.69 to 2.20. CONCLUSION: The estimated R0 for COVID-19 in Sri Lanka, calculated by three different methods, falls between 0.93 and 1.23, and the transmissibility R has reduced, indicating that measures implemented have achieved a good control of disease.","Dharmaratne, Samath; Sudaraka, Supun; Abeyagunawardena, Ishanya; Manchanayake, Kasun; Kothalawala, Mahen; Gunathunga, Wasantha",Virol J,373,26

Since May 2020, the National Public Health Laboratories of Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and South Sudan deployed these mobile laboratories to their respective borders, issuing a newly developed ""Electronic EAC COVID-19 Digital Certificate"" to SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative truck drivers, thus assuring regional trade. CONCLUSION: Considering the large financial damages of border closures, such a mobile laboratory network as demonstrated in East Africa is cost-effective, easy to implement and feasible.

Of the many recognized drug targets of SARS-CoV-2, the main protease is one of the most important target due to its function in viral replication. We conducted an in silico study with repurposing drugs of antibiotics class against virus protease and peptidase using AutoDock tool. The following significant binding energy interaction was observed with protease (PDB: 6LU7) like piperacillin -7.25; tobramycin -9.20 and doxorubicin (Doxo) -10.04 kcal/mol and with peptidase (PDB: 2GTB) piperacillin -7.08; tobramycin -8.54 and Doxo -9.89 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the interaction and stability behavior of the Doxo-protease and Doxo-peptidase complexes were analyzed for a 100-nanosecond (ns) time. Calculated RMSD values observed using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were found to be 0.15-0.25 nm, RMSF calculation per residues showed a value near 0.2 nm and Rg values remained approximately 2.25 nm. MM-PBSA analysis of total binding energy calculation of Doxo-protease and Doxo-peptidase complexes are found to be -148.692 and -105.367 kJ/mol, respectively. Moreover, amino acid residue ASP-197 showed the lowest contribution binding energy i.e. -18.1185 kJ/mol, and amino acid residue ASP-187 showed -17.0267 kJ/mol contribution energy. Thus, significant docking interaction and stable dynamicity of Doxo-protease complex with time was suggested that Doxo could be a choice to inhibit potentially the viral proteases that could prevent the entry inside the host cell to control the COVID-19 disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The recent circular economy (CE) practices have brought a new shape for the waste management industry, creating value from the generated waste. The shift to a CE represents one of the most significant challenges, particularly in sorting and classifying generated waste. Addressing these challenges would facilitate the recycling industry and helps in promoting remanufacturing. But in the COVID times, most of the generated waste is getting mixed with conventional waste types, especially in the global south. The pandemic has resulted in colossal infectious waste generation. Its handling became the most significant challenge raising fears and concerns over sorting and classifying. Hence, this study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based automated solution for sorting COVID related medical waste streams from other waste types and, at the same time, ensures data-driven decisions for recycling in the context of CE. Metal, paper, glass waste categories, including the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste from the pandemic, are considered.

However, effects of these interventions on epidemic dynamics are yet to be understood. Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections per day and effective reproduction number (Rt ) were estimated for 7 periods (Pre-lockdown, Lockdown Phases 1 to 4 and Unlock 1-2) according to nationally implemented interventions with phased relaxation. Adoption of these interventions was estimated using Google mobility data. Estimates at the national level and for 12 Indian states most affected by COVID-19 are presented. Daily case rates ranged from 0.03 to 285.60/10 million people across 7 discrete periods in India. From 18 May to 31 July 2020, the NCT of Delhi had the highest case rate (999/10 million people/day), whereas Madhya Pradesh had the lowest (49/10 million/day). Average Rt was 1.99 (95% CI 1.93-2.06) and 1.39 (95% CI 1.38-1.40) for the entirety of India during the period from 22 March 2020 to 17 May 2020 and from 18 May 2020 to 31 July 2020, respectively. Median mobility in India decreased in all contact domains during the period from 22 March 2020 to 17 May 2020, with the lowest being 21% in retail/recreation, except home which increased to 129% compared to the 100% baseline value. Median mobility in the 'Grocery and Pharmacy' returned to levels observed before 22 March 2020 in Unlock 1 and 2, and the enhanced mobility in the Pharmacy sector needs to be investigated. The Indian government imposed strict contact mitigation, followed by a phased relaxation, which slowed the spread of COVID-19 epidemic progression in India. The identified daily COVID-19 case rates and Rt will aid national and state governments in formulating ongoing COVID-19 containment plans.

This virus spread quickly throughout many countries in Asia and now Europe, Australia, North America, leading the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. Given the rapid spread of cases, the authors sought to provide analysis of patients with COVID-19, their clinical characteristics, and severity of disease. This was a retrospective review of Chinese medical records for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported to the National Health Commission between December 11, 2019 to January 29, 2020. Electronic medical records were used to record various clinical data including exposure risk, signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, and radiologic findings. Several researchers performed chart abstraction and disagreements were made by a third reviewer. If radiologic findings were included, these were reviewed by respiratory medicine attending physicians who interpreted the findings. Incubation periods of less than 1 day were excluded. Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius or higher. Patients were categorized into severe or nonsevere based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community acquired pneumonia. The primary composite endpoint was admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary outcomes included death rates from symptom onset until each component of the composite end-point. There were 7736 patients admitted at 552 sites during the study period and data were obtained on 1099 patients (14.2%). The majority were nonsevere disease (926, 84.3%). The median age was 47 years (IQR 35-58), 41.9% were female, and most were nonsmokers (85.4%). Any comorbidity was recorded in 23.7% of patients, with hypertension being the most common (15.0%). The majority of patients (72.3%) had recent contact with a Wuhan resident, although 25.9% had no reported exposure. The median incubation period was 4.0 days (IQR 2.0-7.0). Regarding symptoms, only 43.8% of patients had fever on presentation but 88.7% developed fever during hospitalization. Besides fever, the most common symptoms overall were cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.7%), and shortness of breath (18.7%). Chest radiograph findings were available for 274 patients, with the majority being abnormal (59.1%). Findings included bilateral patchy shadowing (36.5%), local patchy shadowing (28.1%), ground-glass opacity (20.1%), and interstitial abnormality (4.4%). Chest CT results were available on 975 patients. The majority (86.2%) were abnormal and consisted of ground-glass opacity (56.4%), bilateral patchy shadowing (51.8%), local patchy shadowing (41.9%), and interstitial abnormalities (14.7%). Laboratory testing was available on most, depending on the test, and showed a median white blood cell count of 4700/mm3 (IQR 3500-6000), elevated C-reactive protein (&gt;10mg/L in 60.7%), and normal procalcitonin (&lt;0.5ng/mL in 94.5%). Other notable laboratory abnormalities included elevated D-dimer (&gt; 0.5mg/L in 46.4%) and elevated LDH (&gt;250U/L in 41%). The most common complications were pneumonia (91.1%) followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (3.4%) and most common treatments were intravenous antibiotics (58.0%), oxygen therapy (41.3%), and oseltamivir (35.8%). Systemic glucocorticoids and immune globulin were less common therapies, and mechanical ventilation was needed in only 6.1%. At the conclusion of the study, 15 (1.4%) of patients had died and 55 (5.0%) had been discharged fro the hospital. The majority of the remaining patients were still hospitalized. Regarding the composite endpoint, there were 67 patients (6.1%) with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death, leading to a cumulative risk of 3.6%. This percentage increased if you were designated as severe disease; in this case 24.9% had the composite outcome, leading to a cumulative risk of 20.6%. The authors concluded that presenting symptoms and workup can be variable, with many patients being afebrile and having normal radiologic studies. Several limitations were noted including missing data for many on incubation periods. Additionally the majority of the patients were still hospitalized at the end of the study and therefore outcomes could not be provided for those patients. Comment: While this study provides helpful clinical information to assist emergency physicians in identifying potential COVID-19 patients, we must understand the limitations. Most significantly, this was only a very small portion of the overall sample size of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Additionally, be cautious in directly applying these results to patients in the United States as populations may differ.","Eastin, Carly; Eastin, Travis",J. Emerg. Med.,373,21

METHOD: A prospective, descriptive, online survey design was used to identify graduate nursing student stressors during the pandemic at one educational institution in the United States. Questions related to employment, COVID-19 exposure, institutional support, future graduate plans were summarized for the total sample and stratified by program (MS, DNP, PhD). Changes in a total stress score were evaluated pre and post onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 222 graduate nursing students completed the survey.

Most importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the risk of IPV is likely to differentially impact vulnerable populations, including minority women and those with long histories of victimization and mental health issues. This review paper explores the potential short- and long-term implications of COVID-19 on the risk of IPV, highlighting some of the most recent preliminary data. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, record levels of male unemployment, added stressors in the home, including the care and home schooling of children, and the social distancing measures required by the epidemiological response, may serve to undermine the decades of progress made in keeping women and children safe at home. Victim police reporting, help-seeking decisions, and social service utilization during the pandemic are likely to be impacted by stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for providing safety planning and self-care for victims and their children.","Kaukinen, Catherine",Am J Crim Justice,373,31

Analyzing the available literature, there is very scarce evidence regarding the use of MIS and robotics for treatment of pediatric surgical and urological pathologies during this pandemic. However, we found some useful information that we would like to share with other pediatric surgeons and urologists through this journal. Based upon the available data, we believe that surgery should only be performed in pediatric patients with emergent/urgent and oncological indications until resolution of the COVID-19 outbreak. Robotics and MIS may be safely performed in such selected children by adopting specific technical precautions such as prevention of aerosol dispersion using filters/suction or adapted systems and appropriate use of electrocautery and other sealing devices for reduction of surgical smoke, as reported in our recent experience. Another key point to manage this pandemic emergency is that all hospitals should provide health care professionals with adequate individual protections and perform universal screening in all patients undergoing surgery. Considering that this pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation with new information available daily, these data resulting from the analysis of literature focused on pediatric robotics and MIS may be further revised and updated.","Esposito, Ciro; Masieri, Lorenzo; Castagnetti, Marco; Crocetto, Felice; Escolino, Maria","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",373,27

Recent studies have used plasma D-dimer levels as a prognostic indicator for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The implications of abnormal levels are less clear for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a baseline elevation in plasma D-dimer levels. In the present study, we reviewed the occurrence of plasma D-dimer levels >5000 ng/mL and investigated the clinical significance of this finding before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Inpatient records for a 4-year period were screened for laboratory results of plasma D-dimer levels >5000 ng/mL. The patient data were reviewed for the clinical identifiers commonly associated with elevated plasma D-dimer levels, including VTE, cancer, sepsis, pneumonia, other infection, bleeding, and trauma. The patients were then categorized into groups stratified by the plasma D-dimer level to allow for comparisons between the various clinical diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 671 patients were included in the present study. VTE was the most common diagnosis for patients with a plasma D-dimer level >5000 ng/mL, followed by cancer and pneumonia. Multiple clinical diagnoses were present in 61% of the patients. No clear cause for the ultra-high plasma D-dimer level could be identified in 11.3% of the patients. Among the patients lacking a clinical diagnosis at discharge, mortality was 24% in the 5000- to 10,000-ng/mL group, 28.6% in the 10,000- to 15,000-ng/mL group, and 75% in the >15,000-ng/mL group. CONCLUSIONS: VTE, cancer, and pneumonia were frequently present when ultra-high plasma D-dimer levels were encountered, and mortality was high when the levels were >15,000 ng/mL. The results from our study from a pre-COVID-19 patient population suggest that ultra-high plasma D-dimer levels indicate the presence of severe underlying disease. This should be considered when using the plasma D-dimer level as a screening tool or prognostic indicator for COVID-19 infection.","Schafer, Kristin; Goldschmidt, Eric; Oostra, Drew; Fish, John; Russell, Todd; Lurie, Fedor",J.

COVID-19 vaccine willingness and the factors contributing to willingness in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. We administered an online survey from 1 December 2020 to 7 January 2021 to adults with MS to estimate COVID-19 vaccine willingness among adults with MS. Bivariate analysis with chi-square testing compared categorical variables associated with vaccine willingness. Results: Of 401 respondents, 70.1% were willing to receive an authorized COVID-19 vaccination if it was available to them, 22.7% were unsure, and 7.2% were unwilling. The most frequent concern for those unsure was vaccine safety. Vaccine willingness was associated with increased perceived personal risk of COVID-19 (chi2 = 45.4;p &lt; 0.0001), prior influenza vaccine acceptance (chi2 = 97.6;p &lt; 0.0001), higher educational level (chi2 = 50.2;p &lt; 0.0001), and if respondents discussed or planned to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with their neurologists (chi2 = 64.3;p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: While COVID-19 vaccination willingness is high among people with MS, nearly 30% were either unwilling or unsure about being vaccinated. Neurologists should be aware of patient-centered factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine willingness and address COVID-19 vaccine safety concerns in discussions with their vaccine-unsure MS patients.","Xiang, X.

The pollution level of six organophosphorus pesticides, three herbicides, and one bactericide in groundwater and the Wenyu River, and their fates in three sewage treatment plants (STPs) and a hospital were investigated in this study. The concentrations of the ten detected pesticides ranged from not detected (ND) to 323.44 ng L-1 in different water samples from Beijing; metalaxyl was detected to have the highest concentration (89.58 ng L-1), and the detection frequencies of atrazine and metalaxyl were 100%. The maximum concentrations of pesticides in the Wenyu River, STPs, and the hospital were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the groundwater. Good removal efficiencies by the treatment processes were observed for ametryn (100%), while the removal efficiencies for atrazine and omethoate were the lowest in the three STPs (- 9.6% and 12.67%, respectively). Finally, risk quotient (RQ) values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined for typical urban to assess the ecology and health effects. In the case of environmental toxicity, the highest RQ values (> 1) were obtained for dichlorvos and omethoate. In the case of health toxicity, the RQ values show that the pesticides found in groundwater pose no potential health risks to humans at current concentrations.","Zhang, Yaru; Qin, Pan; Lu, Shaoyong; Liu, Xianbin; Zhai, Jun; Xu, Jiamin; Wang, Yongqiang; Zhang, Guodong; Liu, Xiaohui; Wan, Zhengfen",,373,30

We study the implications of restricting the latter to four spacetime dimensions and give a direct link between its canonical form and the canonical form for the momentum amplituhedron. After removing the little group scaling dependence of the gauge theory, we find that we can compare the resulting reduced form with the pull-back of the associahedron form. In particular, the associahedron form is the sum over all helicity sectors of the reduced momentum amplituhedron forms. This relation highlights the common singularity structure of the respective amplitudes; in particular the factorization channels, corresponding to vanishing planar Mandelstam variables, are the same. Additionally, we also find a relation between these canonical forms directly on the kinematic space of the scalar theory when reduced to four spacetime dimensions by Gram determinant constraints. As a by-product of our work we provide a detailed analysis of the kinematic spaces relevant for the four-dimensional gauge and scalar theories, and provide direct links between them.","Damgaard, David; Ferro, Livia; Lukowski, Tomasz; Moerman, Robert",,373,20

We decompose the target construct, hate speech in our case, into multiple constituent components that are labeled as ordinal survey items. Those survey responses are transformed via IRT into a debiased, continuous outcome measure. Our method estimates the survey interpretation bias of the human labelers and eliminates that influence on the generated continuous measure. We further estimate the response quality of each labeler using faceted IRT, allowing responses from low-quality labelers to be removed. Our faceted Rasch scaling procedure integrates naturally with a multitask deep learning architecture for automated prediction on new data. The ratings on the theorized components of the target outcome are used as supervised, ordinal variables for the neural networks' internal concept learning. We test the use of an activation function (ordinal softmax) and loss function (ordinal cross-entropy) designed to exploit the structure of ordinal outcome variables. Our multitask architecture leads to a new form of model interpretation because each continuous prediction can be directly explained by the constituent components in the penultimate layer. We demonstrate this new method on a dataset of 50,000 social media comments sourced from YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit and labeled by 11,000 U.S.-based Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to measure a continuous spectrum from hate speech to counterspeech. We evaluate Universal Sentence Encoders, BERT, and RoBERTa as language representation models for the comment text, and compare our predictive accuracy to Google Jigsaw's Perspective API models, showing significant improvement over this standard benchmark.","Kennedy, Chris J.; Bacon, Geoff; Sahn, Alexander; Vacano, Claudia von",,373,15

Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are major innate leukocytes that orchestrate protective immunity to viral lung infections. However, a dysregulated cytokine response can promote excessive infiltration and robust pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages, leading to fatal disease. Following virus infection, the beneficial or deleterious role of infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages is determined largely by their ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A majority of studies use the total number of infiltrating cells and their activation status as measures to demonstrate their role during an infection. Consequently, the ability of neutrophils and Inflammatory Monocyte Macrophages (IMMs) to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and its correlation with the disease severity, is not well defined. In this chapter, we report useful markers to identify lung infiltrating innate immune cells and define their activation status.

In this regard, the study aimed to identify both faculty’s and students’ perceptions of online learning, utilizing two surveys one distributed to 50 faculty members and another 280 students were selected randomly to explore the effectiveness, challenges, and advantages of online education in Jordan. The analysis showed that the common online platforms in Jordan were Zoom, Microsoft Teams offering online interactive classes, and WhatsApp in communication with students outside the class. The study found that both faculty and students agreed that online education is useful during the current pandemic. At the same time, its efficacy is less effective than face-to-face learning and teaching. Faculty and students indicated that online learning challenges lie in adapting to online education, especially for deaf and hard of hearing students, lack of interaction and motivation, technical and Internet issues, data privacy, and security. They also agreed on the advantages of online learning. The benefits were mainly self-learning, low costs, convenience, and flexibility.

Combining HCQ with the antibacterial moxifloxacin or the anti-malarial halofantrine (HAL) increased the degree of human ventricular action potential duration prolongation at some or all concentrations investigated, and was predicted to increase risk compared to HCQ alone. The combination of HCQ/HAL was predicted to be the riskiest for the free C &lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values investigated, whereas azithromycin administered individually was predicted to pose the lowest risk. Our simulation approach highlights that the torsadogenic potentials of HCQ, CQ and other QT-prolonging anti-infectives used in COVID-19 prevention and treatment increase with concentration and in combination with other QT-prolonging drugs.","Whittaker, D.

After the landslide victory of pro-democratic candidates in the District Council grassroots election in November 2019, the opposition devised a plan to win a majority in the September 2020 Legislative Council election, though the Council had been institutionally biased towards establishment candidates in the past. The persistence of the demonstrations and the prospect of an opposition-controlled legislative body aroused Beijing's fear of losing control of Hong Kong as it had Taiwan. In response, Beijing imposed its National Security Law on Hong Kong in July 2020, threatening to stifle the remaining freedom and autonomy of the region. The authorities also delayed the Legislative Council election for a year. This heavy-handed crackdown on Hong Kong threw the opposition into disarray. The protest movement also fizzled out. But in light of other cases of autonomy or independence-seeking movements in other parts of China and around the world, the resistance in Hong Kong will certainly persist in the long run. Comparing Hong Kong with those cases, I project that the form of resistance in Hong Kong going forward will be shaped by the disposition of major world powers toward this resistance as much as by Beijing's approach to Hong Kong.","Ho-fung, Hung",The SAIS Review of International Affairs,373,24

A standardized procedure analogous to algorithms for mass casualty incidents (MCI) is lacking. METHODS: Based on a case report and the literature, the authors present a management strategy for infectious MCI during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and distinguish it from traumatic MCI deployment tactics. RESULTS: This management strategy can be divided into three phases, beginning with the acute emergency response including triage, stabilization of critical patients, and transport of patients requiring hospitalization. Phase 2 involves securing the facility's operational readiness, or housing residents elsewhere in case staff are infected or quarantined to a relevant degree. Phase 3 marks the return to regular operations. DISCUSSION: Phase 1 is based on usual MCI principles, phase 2 on hospital crisis management. Avoiding evacuation of residents to relieve hospitals is an important operational objective. The lack of mission and training experience with such situations, the limited applicability of established triage algorithms, and the need to coordinate a large number of participants pose challenges. CONCLUSION: This strategic model offers a practical, holistic approach to the management of infectious mass casualty scenarios in nursing facilities.","Schreiber, Wolfgang; Wolf, Philipp; Bigalke, Nicole; Bigalke, Marc U; Graf, Bernhard M; Dittmar, Michael S",Med.

A járvánnyal szembeni védekezés során mindennapossá vált a maszkhasználat, amely jelentos kihívást jelent a hétköznapi kommunikációs helyzetekben. Az egészségügy bizonyos területein korábban is jelen volt ez a probléma, azonban a most általános érvényu, folyamatos maszkviselés és védoruha-használat szimbolikus és gyakorlati értelemben is akadályként jelenik meg az orvos és a páciens között, ami több szinten nehezíti a hatékony kapcsolatteremtést és kommunikációt.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(23): 897-904. Summary. In the fight against the epidemic, the use of masks has become commonplace, which is a significant challenge in everyday communication situations. This problem has been present in some areas of healthcare in the past, but today's universal use of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) is both a symbolic and practical barrier between doctor and patient, making it difficult to establish an effective communication and connectivity on several levels. Therefore, it has become necessary to develop unified communication protocols that help building a relationship of trust in healthcare so that emotional availability of providers and safe physical distance are achieved simultaneously. The aim of our study is to summarize the effects of mask wearing and PPE usage on the physician-patient communication and also the trust and empathy processes that emerge within the relationship through the review of the current literature. We would also like to draw attention to the effects on healthcare staff. Our goal is also to formulate recommendations, taking into account domestic and international experience, that can be used to improve the communication of healthcare professionals, and through that, the satisfaction of the most important actors in care, patients and caregivers.

We demonstrate the features of trend-based regulation, as well as hybrid regulation, which is a combination of the trend- and level-based approaches. The modeling capabilities are demonstrated on a small toy model, showcasing different functionalities. Real-world capabilities are demonstrated on a larger network model of food insecurity in the Ethiopian region Oromia. Adding trend-based regulation to models results in increased modeling flexibility, and hybrid regulation improves qualitative dynamic behavior prediction.

RATIONALE: Prioritising both critical care initiation and continuation is paramount to save the greatest number of lives. It enables to allocate scarce resources in priority to those with the highest probability of benefiting from them. It is fully ethical provided it relies on objective and widely shared criteria, thus preventing arbitrary decisions and guaranteeing equity. Prioritisation seeks to fairly allocate treatments, maximise saved lives, gain indirect life benefits from prioritising exposed healthcare and similar workers, give priority to those most penalised as a last resort, and apply similar prioritisation schemes to all patients. PRIORITISATION STRATEGY: Prioritisation schemes and their criteria are adjusted to the level of resource scarcity: strain (level A) or saturation (level B). Prioritisation yields a four level priority for initiation or continuation of critical care: P1-high priority, P2-intermediate priority, P3-not needed, P4-not appropriate. Prioritisation schemes take into account the patient's wishes, clinical frailty, pre-existing chronic condition, along with severity and evolution of acute condition. Initial priority level must be reassessed, at least after 48h once missing decision elements are available, at the typical turning point in the disease's natural history (ICU days 7 to 10 for COVID-19), and each time resource scarcity levels change. For treatments to be withheld or withdrawn, a collegial decision-making process and information of patient and/or next of kin are paramount.

Pandemic has also induced changes in our perceptions of safety in public spaces, necessitating the adoption of social distancing and more widespread use of online platforms for purchasing and communication. While the pandemic might be a catalyst for the adoption of contactless technologies, some restaurateurs remain hesitant to invest in service robots because they are not convinced of the return on investment and the potential value service robots can deliver to their customers. Therefore, this study aims to explore customer value perceptions of service robots and their impact on customers’ attitudes and behaviors toward robotic restaurants. Findings yielded by a survey of 445 potential diners in Taiwan show that customers’ willingness to use and to pay more for robotic restaurants are determined by their attitudes toward robots, which are influenced by functional, conditional, epistemic, emotional, co-creation, and social values. Our survey results also reveal that the importance of conditional value is amplified by crisis-specific antecedents, namely the need for physical distancing and mysophobia. These findings have implications for restaurant pricing policies and can be considered by restaurant managers when formulating strategies aimed at sustaining their business in these challenging times.

Evidence of how this health crisis affected common conditions like blood pressure (BP) control is uncertain. METHODS: We used longitudinal BP data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial to examine variations in home BP monitored via a smartphone-based application (app) in a total of 7394 elderly patients with hypertension aged 60 to 80 years stratified by their location in Wuhan (n=283) compared with other provinces of China (n=7111). Change in morning systolic BP (SBP) was analyzed for 5 30-day phases during the pandemic, including preepidemic (October 21 to November 20, 2019), incubation (November 21 to December 20, 2019), developing (December 21, 2019 to January 20, 2020), outbreak (January 21 to February 20, 2020), and plateau (February 21 to March 21, 2020). RESULTS: Compared with non-Wuhan areas of China, average morning SBP (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index) in Wuhan patients was significantly higher during the epidemic growth phases, which returned to normal at the plateau. Between-group differences in &#916;SBP were +2.5, +3.0, and +2.1 mm Hg at the incubation, developing, and outbreak phases of COVID-19 (P<0.001), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed a similar trend in trajectory pattern of SBP in both the intensive and standard BP control groups of the trial. Patients in Wuhan also had an increased regimen change in antihypertensive drugs during the outbreak compared with non-Wuhan patients. Expectedly, Wuhan patients were more likely to check their BP via the app, while doctors were less likely to monitor the app for BP control during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a short-term increase in morning SBP among elderly patients with hypertension in Wuhan but not other parts of China. Further study will be needed to understand if these findings extended to other parts of the world substantially affected by the virus. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was conducted between June 17 and July 13, 2020, addressed to families of people with DS. RESULTS: A total of 116 responses were collected, from families of children (n = 86; 74%) and adults (30; 26%) with DS. The majority (106; 91%) were shielded at the family home during lockdown. Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were reported in 22 (19%) individuals. Only four individuals with symptoms had a PCR swab test, none of which was positive. Only one symptomatic person had antibody testing (but not swab testing), which was positive. One person had repeatedly positive swab tests whilst in hospital for renal failure, but had no typical symptoms of COVID-19. In 50% of people with DS who developed possible or probable COVID-19 symptoms, seizure worsening was reported, in terms of increased seizure frequency or duration or both. Medical attention was required in 9/22 (41%), all of whom were children. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of people with DS, we observed an infection rate, determined by compatible symptoms, of 19%, with no deaths and benign outcome in most cases despite the underlying complex epilepsy although children often required medical attention. Early adoption of preventative measures, including testing of symptomatic individuals, regular surveillance for people living in residential care facilities, and shielding of individuals with comorbidities increasing the risk of severe outcome, may limit the impact of COVID-19.","Balestrini, Simona; Wilson, Galia; Eldred, Claire; Evans, Helen; Sisodiya, Sanjay M",Acta Neurol Scand,373,16

However, recent studies have called the idea of a processing pipeline with fixed contributions to motion perception from each area into doubt. Instead, the role that each area plays appears to depend on properties of the stimulus as well as perceptual history. We propose to test this hypothesis in human subjects by comparing motion perception of two commonly used stimulus types: drifting sinusoidal gratings (DSGs) and random dot patterns (RDPs). To avoid potential biases in our approach we are pre-registering our study. We will compare the effects of size and contrast levels on the perception of the direction of motion for DSGs and RDPs. In addition, based on intriguing results in a pilot study, we will also explore the effects of a post-stimulus mask. Our approach will offer valuable insights into how motion is processed by the visual system and guide further behavioral and neurophysiological research.","Wild, Benedict; Treue, Stefan",PLoS One,373,33

The need for robust infectious disease surveillance to detect emerging pathogens along with common human pathogens has been highlighted by the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The African Network for Improved Diagnostics, Epidemiology and Management of Common Infectious Agents (ANDEMIA) is a sentinel surveillance study on the aetiology and clinical characteristics of ARI, GI and AFDUC in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: ANDEMIA includes 12 urban and rural health care facilities in four African countries (Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of South Africa). It was piloted in 2018 in Côte d'Ivoire and the initial phase will run from 2019 to 2021. Case definitions for ARI, GI and AFDUC were established, as well as syndrome-specific sampling algorithms including the collection of blood, naso- and oropharyngeal swabs and stool. Samples are tested using comprehensive diagnostic protocols, ranging from classic bacteriology and antimicrobial resistance screening to multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems and High Throughput Sequencing. In March 2020, PCR testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and analysis of full genomic information was included in the study. Standardised questionnaires collect relevant clinical, demographic, socio-economic and behavioural data for epidemiologic analyses. Controls are enrolled over a 12-month period for a nested case-control study. Data will be assessed descriptively and aetiologies will be evaluated using a latent class analysis among cases. Among cases and controls, an integrated analytic approach using logistic regression and Bayesian estimation will be employed to improve the assessment of aetiology and associated risk factors. DISCUSSION: ANDEMIA aims to expand our understanding of ARI, GI and AFDUC aetiologies in sub-Saharan Africa using a comprehensive laboratory diagnostics strategy. It will foster early detection of emerging threats and continued monitoring of important common pathogens. The network collaboration will be strengthened and site diagnostic capacities will be reinforced to improve quality management and patient care.","Schubert, Grit; Achi, Vincent; Ahuka, Steve; Belarbi, Essia; Bourhaima, Ouattara; Eckmanns, Tim; Johnstone, Siobhan; Kabore, Firmin; Kra, Ouffoue; Mendes, Adriano; Ouedraogo, Abdoul-Salam; Poda, Armel; Some, Arsène Satouro; Tomczyk, Sara; Couacy-Hymann, Emmanuel; Kayembe, Jean-Marie; Meda, Nicolas; Muyembe Tamfum, Jean-Jacques; Ouangraoua, Soumeya; Page, Nicola; Venter, Marietjie; Leendertz, Fabian H; Akoua-Koffi, Chantal",BMC Infect Dis,373,24

The objective of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of six immunoassays to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: three lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), one ELISA and two chemiluminescence assays (CLIAs). METHODS: We evaluated three LFAs (Alltest, One Step and SeroFlash), one ELISA (Dia.Pro) and two CLIAs (Elecsys and COV2T). To assess the specificity, 60 pre-pandemic sera were used. To evaluate the sensitivity, we used 80 serum samples from patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Agreement between techniques was evaluated using the kappa score (k). RESULTS: All immunoassays showed a specificity of 100 % except for SeroFlash (96.7 %). Overall sensitivity was 61.3 %, 73.8 %, 67.5 %, 85.9 %, 88.0 % and 92.0 % for Alltest, One Step, SeroFlash, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T, respectively. Sensitivity increased throughout the first two weeks from the onset of symptoms, reaching sensitivities over 85 % from 14 days for all LFAs, being One Step the most sensitive (97.6 %), followed by SeroFlash (95.1 %). Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T showed sensitivities over 97 % from 14 days, being 100 % for COV2T. One Step showed the best agreement results among LFAs, showing excellent agreement with Dia.Pro (agreement = 94.2 %, k = 0.884), COV2T (99.1 %, k = 0.981) and Elecsys (97.3 %, k = 0.943). Dia.Pro, COV2T and Elecsys also showed excellent agreement between them. CONCLUSIONS: One Step, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T obtained the best diagnostic performance results. All these techniques showed a specificity of 100 % and sensitivities over 97 % from 14 days after the onset of symptoms, as well as excellent levels of agreement.","Pérez-García, Felipe; Pérez-Tanoira, Ramón; Iglesias, María Esther; Romanyk, Juan; Arroyo, Teresa; Gómez-Herruz, Peña; González, Rosa; Lapeña García, Sara; Cuadros-González, Juan",J Virol Methods,373,1

Thus, vaccination seems the best hope of the current situation to control COVID-19 epidemics. In this work, the dynamic model of COVID-19 epidemic is developed when the quarantine factor and the antiviral factor are established as free variables. Moreover, the impulsive populations are comprehended for traveling and migrating of individuals. The proposed dynamics with impulsive distractions are employed to generate the online data. Thereafter, the equivalent model is developed by using only the daily data of symptomatic infectious individuals and the optimal vaccination policy is derived by utilizing the closed-loop control topology. The theoretical framework of the proposed schemes validates the reduction of symptomatic infectious individuals by using fewer doses of vaccines comparing with the scheduling vaccination.","Treesatayapun, C.",Biomedical signal processing and control,373,24

The development of the COVID-19 epidemic in China could be used as a reference for the other countries' control strategy. Methods: We used a classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to forecast the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in China by nowcasting. The linear regression analyses were employed to predict the COVID-19 epidemic's inflexion point. Finally, we used a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to simulate the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in China throughout 2020. Results: Our nowcasts show that the COVID-19 transmission rate started to slow down on January 30. The linear regression analyses further show that the inflexion point of this epidemic would arrive between February 17 and 18. The final SEIR model simulation forecasted that the COVID-19 epidemic would probably infect about 82,000 people and last throughout 2020 in China. We also applied our method to USA's and global COVID-19 data and the nowcasts show that the development of COVID-19 pandemic is not optimistic in the rest of 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic's scale in China is much smaller than the previous estimations. After implemented strict control and prevention measures, such as city lockdown, it took a week to slow down the COVID-19 transmission and about four weeks to really mitigate the COVID-19 prevalence in China.","Zhang, Y.

An increasing number of thromboembolic events are being reported almost on a daily basis, and the medical community has struggled to predict and mitigate this risk. We aimed to review available literature on the risk and management of COVID-19 related venous thromboembolism (VTE), and provide evidence-based guidance to manage these events. METHODS: A literature review of VTE complications in patients with COVID-19 was performed, in addition to a summary of the societal guidelines and present pathways implemented at our institution for the management of both in- and outpatient COVID-19 related VTE. RESULTS: While a significant VTE risk has been confirmed in patients with COVID-19, literature addressing best ways to mitigate this risk is lacking. Furthermore, there has been very limited guidance provided by societal guidelines to help prevent and manage VTE associated with the COVID-19 infection. In light of the available data, we advise that all patients admitted with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 receive pharmacological prophylaxis if bleeding risk is acceptable. For patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from the emergency department or hospital, we suggest extended thromboprophylaxis (up to 39 days) as long as bleeding risk is low. CONCLUSION: We believe that this literature summary along with our center recommendations and algorithms provide valuable guidance to providers caring for patients with COVID-19 related VTE.

Multiple explanations have been put forth, including unequal quality/access to health care, higher proportion of pre-existing health conditions, multigenerational household composition, and disproportionate representation in telecommute-unfriendly occupations. However, these hypotheses have been rarely tested. OBJECTIVE We examine age-stratified patterns of Hispanic COVID-19 mortality vis-à-vis patterns of exposure to evaluate the multiple posited hypotheses. METHODS We use a combination of public and restricted data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and leverage national and subnational race- and age-stratified COVID-19 mortality and case burdens/advantages to evaluate the workplace vulnerability hypothesis. We also use individual-level information on prior health conditions and mortality from the case data to assess whether observed patterns are consistent with the other hypotheses. RESULTS Our results indicate that the disproportionate burdens for both COVID-19 case and mortality for the Hispanic population are largest among the working-age groups, supporting the hypothesis that workplace exposure plays a critical role in heightening vulnerability to COVID-19 mortality. We find little evidence to support the hypotheses regarding multigenerational household composition, pre-existing health conditions, or unequal quality/access to health care. CONCLUSION Our findings point to the key roles played by age structure and differential exposure in contributing to the disproportionately severe impact of COVID-19 on the Hispanic population. CONTRIBUTION We contribute evidence to explain the driving factors in the observed excess COVID-19 mortality burden among Hispanics. Our findings underscore the importance of focusing on more robust workplace protections, particularly for working-age minority populations. © 2021. D. Phuong Do & Reanne Frank.","Do, D.

METHODS: Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. RESULTS: In total, 21% (n = 10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the overall mortality rate was 13% (n = 6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p < 0.001) upon admission than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p = 2.6 × 10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p = 0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements; whereas, the concentrations in survivors were stable. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p = 0.02).

In such a context, further concerns have been raised about the relationship between wealth accumulation and improvement of economic well-being, mainly through consumption. The issue becomes even more important when considering the challenges facing China in recent years, which can be characterized by a mix of increasingly leveraged households, escalating housing price, sluggish consumption, slowing economic expansion, trade frictions with the United States, and the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic difficulties. With that background in mind, this paper first provides international evidence on the relationship between household consumption and wealth, especially in the form of houses. Drawing on a panel of aggregate data for fourteen countries including China, we find that household consumption positively responds to changes in housing wealth, and this link is further affected by different levels of government spending and financial development. We next relate the international evidence to the case of China, with the focus on some recent policy issues over housing regulations and consumption promotion. Importantly, as the evidence and underlying theories suggest, housing wealth-consumption association does not follow a simplistic pattern, and thus, multiple policy measures could and should be undertaken rather than merely curbing speculative activities in real estate exchanges and associated financial business.","Li, Cheng Zhang Ying",China Economic Review,373,24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is less frequent and less severe in children than in adults. This study analyzed the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection among all children aged <18 years in the Apulia region of southern Italy and the characteristics of the infected children. Clinical and demographic data were collected through the national platform for COVID-19 surveillance. Of the 166 infected children in the Apulia region, 104 (62.6%) were asymptomatic, 37 (22.3%) had mild infections, 22 (13.3%) had moderate infections, and 3 (1.8%) had severe infections. Only ten children (6.0%) were hospitalized, but none required intensive care support and none died. SARS-CoV-2 infection was transmitted mainly from parents or relatives to children. Because of school closure during the lockdown, infection was unlikely to have been transmitted among children. It is unclear whether school reopening would enhance virus spread, leading the Italian government to develop guidelines for safe school reopening. The actual role of children in virus transmission remains unclear. A sensitive surveillance system, prompt identification of cases, testing, and contact tracing will be key to reducing the further spread of infection.","Loconsole, Daniela; Caselli, Desirèe; Centrone, Francesca; Morcavallo, Caterina; Campanella, Silvia; Aricò, Maurizio; Chironna, Maria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),373,30

Lung injury causes systemic inflammation, which disrupts gut barrier integrity, increasing the permeability to gut microbes and their products. This exacerbates inflammation, resulting in positive feedback. We aimed to test whether severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with markers of disrupted gut permeability. We applied a multi-omic systems biology approach to analyze plasma samples from COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. We investigated the potential links between plasma markers of gut barrier integrity, microbial translocation, systemic inflammation, metabolome, lipidome, and glycome, and COVID-19 severity. We found that severe COVID-19 is associated with high levels of markers of tight junction permeability and translocation of bacterial and fungal products into the blood. These markers of disrupted intestinal barrier integrity and microbial translocation correlate strongly with higher levels of markers of systemic inflammation and immune activation, lower levels of markers of intestinal function, disrupted plasma metabolome and glycome, and higher mortality rate.

A link to the online self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 1,969 participants through social media platforms and the authors' email networks. Four false statements-informed by results from a pilot study-were included in the survey. The participants' responses were classified as ""Agree,"" ""Neutral,"" and ""Disagree."" A multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Among those who responded to the survey, 19.3% believed that COVID-19 was designed to reduce world population, 22.2% thought the ability to hold your breath for 10 seconds meant that you do not have COVID-19, 27.8% believed drinking hot water flushes down the virus, and 13.9% thought that COVID-19 had little effect on Blacks compared with Whites. An average of 33.7% were unsure whether the 4 false statements were true. Multivariate analysis revealed that those who thought COVID-19 was unlikely to continue in their countries reported higher odds of believing in these 4 false statements.

We adapted a SARS stigma scale that was developed using the Berger HIV scale for use as a COVID-19 stigma scale and evaluated its psychometric properties among Egyptian physicians. METHODS: We administered the 17-item SARS stigma scale in an anonymous online questionnaire among 509 Egyptian physicians recruited via convenience sampling during a cross-sectional study in June 2020. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on half of the sample. Confirmatory factor analysis of the resulting model was done using structural equation modeling on the other half. Scale reliability was examined using Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency. Convergent construct validity was assessed using regression models to examine the association between the adapted COVID-19 stigma scale and relevant factors. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded 16 items (E16-COVID19-S) that supported a three-factor structure: personalized stigma (8 items); concerns of disclosure and public attitudes (5 items); and negative experiences (3 items). Cronbach's &#945; was 0.909 for the total scale and 0.907, 0.663, and 0.789 for the three subscales. E16-COVID19-S was confirmed to have good model fit (comparative fit index = 0.964; root mean squared error of approximation = 0.056). E16-COVID19-S was independently associated with physicians' younger age, lower qualification, working in an isolation hospital, and self-stigma, whether the scale was treated as categorical or continuous. CONCLUSIONS: E16-COVID19-S exhibited good internal consistency and construct validity among this sample of Egyptian physicians. These adequate psychometric properties make the E16-COVID19-S scale appropriate for use by researchers and practitioners.","Mostafa, Aya; Mostafa, Nayera S; Ismail, Nashwa",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),373,24

Additionally, it has been challenging for the Brazilian shores that were recently (2019/2020) affected by the most extensive oil spill in the tropical oceans. Monitoring programs and studies about the economic, social and ecological consequences of the oil disaster were being carried out when the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic was declared, which has heavily affected Brazil. For Brazilian seagrasses conservation, this scenario is especially challenging. An estimated area of +325â¯km2 seagrass meadows was affected by the 2019 oil spill. However, this area is undoubtedly underestimated since seagrasses have not yet been adequately mapped along the 9000â¯km-long Brazilian coast. In addition to scientific budget cuts, the flexibilization of public and environmental policies in recent years and absence of systematic field surveys due to COVID-19 has increased the underestimation of affected seagrass areas and ecosystem service losses due to the oil spill. Efforts to understand and solve the oil spill crisis were forced to stop (or slow down) due to COVID-19 and the economic crisis, leaving ecosystems and society without answers or conditions to identify the source(s) that was/were responsible for this spill, mitigate the damage to poor communities, promote adequate impact assessment or restoration plans, or properly monitor the environment. Our results highlight that pandemic and large-scale environmental disasters may have had a synergistic effect on the economy (e.g., artisanal fisheries and tourism), public health and ecology, mainly due to government inaction, social inequality and poorly studied tropical ecosystems. The results of this study also demonstrate the need to analyze the short- and long-term impacts of the combined effects (oil spill + COVID-19) on the recovery of the economy and coastal ecosystems.","Magalhães, Karine Matos; Barros, Kcrishna Vilanova de Souza; Lima, Maria Cecília Santana de; Rocha-Barreira, Cristina de Almeida; Rosa Filho, José Souto; Soares, Marcelo de Oliveira",Sci Total Environ,373,24

Therefore, monitoring and oversight of the population mental health during crises such as a panedmic is an immediate priority. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing research works and findings in relation to the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, articles that have focused on stress and anxiety prevalence among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases, without a lower time limit and until May 2020. In order to perform a meta-analysis of the collected studies, the random effects model was used, and the heterogeneity of studies was investigated using the I2 index. Moreover. data analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. RESULTS: The prevalence of stress in 5 studies with a total sample size of 9074 is obtained as 29.6% (95% confidence limit: 24.3-35.4), the prevalence of anxiety in 17 studies with a sample size of 63,439 as 31.9% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-36.7), and the prevalence of depression in 14 studies with a sample size of 44,531 people as 33.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-40.6).

Still, such exploration is challenging as there is a need for visualizations that are tailored for the purpose. RESULTS: The OmicLoupe software was developed to facilitate visual data exploration and provides more than 15 interactive cross-dataset visualizations for omics data. It expands visualizations to multiple datasets for quality control, statistical comparisons and overlap and correlation analyses, while allowing for rapid inspection and downloading of selected features. The usage of OmicLoupe is demonstrated in three different studies, where it allowed for detection of both technical data limitations and biological trends across different omic layers. An example is an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on two previously published studies, where OmicLoupe facilitated the identification of gene products with consistent expression changes across datasets at both the transcript and protein levels.

Related measures, such as limits on social gatherings, business closures, or lockdowns, are expected to considerably reduce the individual opportunities to move outside the home. As physical activity (PA) and sport participation significantly contribute to health, this study has two objectives. The objectives of this study are to assess changes in PA and well-being since the coronavirus outbreak in affected countries. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of digital home-based exercise programs on PA as well as physical and mental health outcomes. Method: A multinational network trial will be conducted with three planned phases (A, B, and C). Part A consists of administering a structured survey. It investigates changes in PA levels and health during the coronavirus outbreak and measures the preferences of the participants regarding online training programs. Part B is a two-armed randomized-controlled trial. Participants assigned to the intervention group (IG) will complete a digital 4-week home exercise training (live streaming via internet) guided by the survey results on content and time of program. The control group (CG) will not receive the program. Part C is 4-week access of both CG and IG to a digital archive of pre-recorded workouts from Part B. Similar to Part A, questionnaires will be used in both Part B and C to estimate the effects of exercise on measures of mental and physical health. Results and Discussion: The ASAP project will provide valuable insights into the importance of PA during a global pandemic. Our initial survey is the first to determine how governmental confinement measures impact bodily and mental well-being. Based on the results, the intervention studies will be unique to address health problems potentially arising from losses in PA. If proven effective, the newly developed telehealth programs could become a significant and easy-to-distribute factor in combating PA decreases. Results of the study may hence guide policy makers on methods to maintain PA and health when being forced to restrict public life.

More than 9000 healthcare workers have also been infected by 2019-nCoV. Prior to the present pandemic of COVID-19, there have been multiple large-scale epidemics and pandemics of other viral respiratory infections, such as seasonal flu, Spanish flu (H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and others. Dental professionals are at an increased risk for contracting these viruses from dental patients, as dental practice involves face-to-face communication with the patients and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids. Dental education can play an important role in the training of dentists, helping them to adopt adequate knowledge and attitudes related to infection control measures. The current dental curriculum does not cover infection control adequately, especially from airborne pathogens. Infection control education needs to be included in the dental curriculum itself, and students should be trained adequately to protect them and prevent the infection from disseminating even before they see their first patient.","Ghai, Suhani",J Dent Educ,373,10

Despite various studies conducted by researchers and doctors, no treatment has been developed until now, therefore self-protection and isolation are strongly recommended to stop the spread of the virus. The elderly population and people with chronic diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer are categorized as risk groups, however, we suggest that people with hemoglobinopathies or porphyria can be described as risk groups as well. Current in silico studies have revealed that the COVID-19 virus can attack heme and hemoglobin metabolisms which are responsible for the oxygen transport to the tissues, iron metabolism, elevated levels of oxidative stress, and tissue damage. Data of the in silico study have been supported with the biochemistry and hemogram results of the COVID-19 patients, for instance hemoglobin levels decreased and serum ferritin and C-reactive protein levels increased. Indicated biochemistry biomarkers are tightly associated with inflammation, iron overload, and oxidative stress. In conclusion, since people with hemoglobinopathies or porphyria have already impaired heme and hemoglobin metabolism, COVID-19 infection can enhance the adverse effects of impaired hemoglobin metabolism and accelerate the progression of severe symptoms in patients with hemoglobinopathies or porphyria compared to the normal individuals. Thus those people can be considered as a risk group and extra precautions should be applied for them to protect them.","Aydemir, Duygu; Ulusu, Nuriye Nuray",Transfus Apher Sci,373,19

New studies have described the production and dissemination of sprays during simulated dental procedures, but findings lack generalizability beyond their measurements setting. This study aims to describe the fundamental mechanisms associated with spray production from rotary dental instrumentation with particular focus on what are currently considered high-risk components-namely, the production of small droplets that may remain suspended in the room environment for extended periods and the dispersal of high-velocity droplets resulting in formites at distant surfaces. Procedural sprays were parametrically studied with variables including rotation speed, burr-to-tooth contact, and coolant premisting modified and visualized using high-speed imaging and broadband or monochromatic laser light-sheet illumination. Droplet velocities were estimated and probability density maps for all laser illuminated sprays generated. The impact of varying the coolant parameters on heating during instrumentation was considered. Complex structured sprays were produced by water-cooled rotary instruments, which, in the worst case of an air turbine, included droplet projection speeds in excess of 12 m/s and the formation of millions of small droplets that may remain suspended. Elimination of premisting (mixing of coolant water and air prior to burr contact) resulted in a significant reduction in small droplets, but radial atomization may still occur and is modified by burr-to-tooth contact. Spatial probability distribution mapping identified a threshold for rotation speeds for radial atomization between 80,000 and 100,000 rpm. In this operatory mode, cutting efficiency is reduced but sufficient coolant effectiveness appears to be maintained. Multiple mechanisms for atomization of fluids from rotatory instrumentation exist, but parameters can be controlled to modify key spray characteristics during the current crisis.","Sergis, A; Wade, W G; Gallagher, J E; Morrell, A P; Patel, S; Dickinson, C M; Nizarali, N; Whaites, E; Johnson, J; Addison, O; Hardalupas, Y",J Dent Res,373,9

It is unknown if these patients should be considered a vulnerable group in healthcare delivery and healthcare recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the following question: In which hospitalised patients with proven COVID-19 and with underlying CVD and cardiovascular risk factors should doctors be alert to a poor outcome? Relevant outcome measures were mortality and intensive care unit admission. Medline and Embase databases were searched using relevant search terms until 9 June 2020. After systematic analysis, 8 studies were included. RESULTS: Based on the literature search, there was insufficient evidence that CVD and cardiovascular risk factors are significant predictors of mortality and poor outcome in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Due to differences in methodology, the level of evidence of all studies was graded 'very low' according to the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. It is expected that in the near future, two multinational and multicentre European registries (CAPACITY-COVID and LEOSS) will offer more insight into outcome in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: This literature review demonstrated there was insufficient evidence to identify CVD and cardiovascular risk factors as important predictors of poor outcome in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. However, patients with CVD and cardiovascular risk factors remain vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks. As such, governmental and public health COVID-19 recommendations for vulnerable groups apply to these patients.","Jewbali, L S D; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Belfroid, E; Jansen, C W; Asselbergs, F W; Siebelink, H J",Neth Heart J,373,20

METHODS: We conducted a randomized crossover mannequin-based simulation study to compare airway management with and without the aerosol box. Thirty-five anesthesiology participants and three critical care participants with more than 50 intubations with videolaryngoscopes were recruited. There were four airway simulations with and without the aerosol box (normal, pharyngeal swelling, cervical spine rigidity, and tongue edema). Each participant intubated the mannequin in eight consecutive simulations. The primary outcome of the study was time to intubation. Secondary outcomes included intubation attempts, optimization maneuvers, and personal protective equipment breaches. RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation [SD]) time to intubation overall with the box was 30.9 (23.0) sec, while the time to intubation without the box was 25.1 (12.2) sec (mean difference, 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.9 to 14.5). For the normal airway scenario, the mean (SD) time to intubation was 18.6 (3.5) sec for no box and 20.4 (3.3) sec for box (mean difference, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.2 to 3.4). During difficult airway scenarios only, the time to intubation was 34.4 (25.6) sec with the aerosol box and 27.3 (13.2) sec without the aerosol box (mean difference, 7.1; 95% CI, -2.5 to 16.7). There were more intubation attempts, personal protective equipment breaches, and optimization maneuvers during use of the aerosol box. CONCLUSIONS: In this mannequin-based simulation study, the use of the aerosol box increased the time to intubation in some contexts but not others. Further studies in a clinical setting should be conducted to make appropriate modifications to the aerosol box to fully elicit its efficacy and safety prior to implementation in airway guidelines for managing patients with COVID-19.","Fong, Sunny; Li, Elliott; Violato, Efrem; Reid, Andrew; Gu, Yuqi",Can. j. anaesth,373,16

BACKGROUND: Working on the front lines of COVID-19 has brought unprecedented psychological stress on pre-examination and triage nurses. Nurse-patient communication ability and the level of self-efficacy are both significant for nurses' psychosomatic health and work input. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding nurse-patient communication and self-efficacy and specific psychological intervention effects. DESIGN: Cross-sectional research fulfilling the completed checklist of items that should be included in reports of cross-sectional studies (Appendix S1). METHODS: Nurses (n = 41) in the first layer of pre-examination and triage were engaged in a Balint group activity twice a week for two weeks. They were assessed with the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) pre- and postintervention, and a nurse-patient communication survey form was developed for further postintervention evaluation. The sample was recruited from a class A third-grade hospital in Sichuan, China. RESULTS: Most of the subjects reported improvement in nurse-patient communication, increased cooperation between patients and their families, and a decreased missed examination rate after the intervention. Moreover, the total mean score of the GSES of nurses after the intervention was increased, but the difference was not statistically significant. The scores of all items in the GSES were improved, and the scores increase for item 4 (I am confident that I can effectively deal with any unexpected event) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a short-term Balint group activity can improve the communication ability and self-efficacy level of front-line nurses to some extent. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This information may provide some theoretical support for the development of early psychological interventions during major epidemic situations.","Yang, Chenghui; Zhou, Bo; Wang, Jinyu; Pan, Shuya",J. clin. nurs,373,4

Recent Findings: Although the literature is increasing exponentially, most clinical trials have been preliminary, thus lacking robust evidence to support many of the drugs discussed here. The main exception is remdesivir, for which several trials have been published supporting its use for patients with severe COVID-19. No solid organ transplant-specific data on remdesivir or other antiviral therapies have been published so far. Summary: While further studies are urgently needed, in particular those specific to solid organ transplant recipients, the evidence so far only supports the use of remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19.","Laracy, Justin C; Verna, Elizabeth C; Pereira, Marcus R",Curr Transplant Rep,373,22

The prioritisation of high value cancer interventions must be embedded in the agenda for the pandemic response, ensuring that no inconsistency or discrepancy emerge in the health planning processes.The aim of this work is to organise health interventions for breast cancer management and research in a tiered framework (high, medium, low value), formulating a scheme of prioritisation per clinical cogency and intrinsic value or magnitude of benefit. The public health tools and schemes for priority setting in oncology have been used as models, aspiring to capture clinical urgency, value in healthcare, community goals and fairness, while respecting the principles of benevolence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice.We discuss the priority health interventions across the cancer continuum, giving a perspective on the role and meaning to maintain some services (undeferrable) while temporarily abrogate some others (deferrable). Considerations for implementation and the essential link to pre-existing health services, especially primary healthcare, are addressed, outlining a framework for the development of effective and functional services, such as telemedicine.The discussion covers the theme of health systems strategising, and why oncology care, in particular breast cancer care, should be maintained in parallel to pandemic control measures, providing a pragmatic clinical model within the broader context of public healthcare schemes.","de Azambuja, Evandro; Trapani, Dario; Loibl, Sibylle; Delaloge, Suzette; Senkus, Elzbieta; Criscitiello, Carmen; Poortman, Philip; Gnant, Michael; Di Cosimo, Serena; Cortes, Javier; Cardoso, Fatima; Paluch-Shimon, Shani; Curigliano, Giuseppe",,373,15

Nevertheless, the global burden of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. Acute respiratory tract infections, for example, were responsible for approximately 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune system is well-established. A wealth of mechanistic and clinical data show that vitamins, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid play important and complementary roles in supporting the immune system. Inadequate intake and status of these nutrients are widespread, leading to a decrease in resistance to infections and as a consequence an increase in disease burden. Against this background the following conclusions are made: (1) supplementation with the above micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and low-cost strategy to help support optimal immune function; (2) supplementation above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), but within recommended upper safety limits, for specific nutrients such as vitamins C and D is warranted; and (3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutritional strategies in their recommendations to improve public health.","Calder, Philip C; Carr, Anitra C; Gombart, Adrian F; Eggersdorfer, Manfred",Nutrients,373,16

In this study, we collected rectal swabs from a total of 1,498 cattle, sheep and goats. BCoV detection was based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Sanger sequencing of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region for postive samples were done and nucleotide sequences were compared with homologous sequences from the GenBank. RESULTS: The study reports a BCoV prevalence of 0.3%, consisting of 4 positive cases; 3 goats and 1 cattle. Less than 10% of all the animals sampled showed clinical signs such as diarrhea and respiratory distress except for high temperature which occurred in > 1000 of the animals. However, none of the 4 BCoV positive animals manifested any clinical signs of the infection at the time of sample collection. Bayesian majority-rule cladogram comparing partial and full length BCoV RdRp genes obtained in the study to data from the GenBank revealed that the sequences obtained from this study formed one large monophyletic group with those from different species and countries. The goat sequences were similar to each other and clustered within the same clade. No major variations were thus observed between our isolates and those from elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Given that Ghana predominantly practices the extensive and semi-intensive systems of animal rearing, our study highlights the potential for spillover of BCoV to small ruminants in settings with mixed husbandry and limited separation between species.","Burimuah, Vitus; Sylverken, Augustina; Owusu, Michael; El-Duah, Philip; Yeboah, Richmond; Lamptey, Jones; Frimpong, Yaw Oppong; Agbenyega, Olivia; Folitse, Raphael; Emikpe, Ben; Tasiame, William; Owiredu, Eddie-Williams; Oppong, Samuel; Antwi, Christopher; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Drosten, Christian",BMC Vet Res,373,16

Though US hospitals face intensifying pressure to lower their cost, including proposals to extend Medicare payment rates to all admissions, the transferability of Indian hospitals' cost advantages to US peers remains unclear. METHODS: Using time-driven activity-based costing methods, we estimate the average cost of personnel and space for an elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at two American hospitals and one Indian hospital (NH). All three hospitals are Joint Commission accredited and have reputations for use of modern performance management methods. Our case study applies several analytic steps to distinguish transferable from non-transferable sources of NH's cost savings. RESULTS: After removing non-transferable sources of efficiency, NH's residual cost advantage primarily rests on shifting tasks to less-credentialed and/or less-experienced personnel who are supervised by highly-skilled personnel when perceived risk of complications is low. NH's high annual CABG volume facilitates such supervised work ""downshifting."" The study is subject to limitations inherent in case studies, does not account for the younger age of NH's patients, or capture savings attributable to NH's negligible frequency of re-admission or post-acute care facility placement. CONCLUSIONS: Most transferable bases for a modern Indian hospital's cost advantage would require more flexible American states' hospital and health professional licensing regulations, greater family participation in inpatient care, and stronger support by hospital executives and clinicians for substantially lowering the cost of care via regionalization of complex surgeries and weekend use of costly operating rooms.","Erhun, F; Kaplan, R S; Narayanan, V G; Brayton, K; Kalani, M; Mazza, M C; Nguyen, C; Platchek, T; Mistry, B; Mann, R; Kazi, D; Pinnock, C; Schulman, K A; Xue, J; Ballard, D; Mack, M; James, B; Poulsen, G; Punnen, J; Shetty, D; Milstein, A",Am Heart J,373,6

The proposed system consists of two deep-learning-based models: a quality assessment module that automates predictions of image quality, and a diagnosis assistance module that determines the likelihood-of-anomaly in ultrasound images of sufficient quality. Our two-stage strategy uses a novelty detection algorithm to address the lack of control cases available for training the quality assessment classifier. The diagnosis assistance module can then be trained with data that are deemed of sufficient quality, guaranteed by the closed-loop feedback mechanism from the quality assessment module. Using more than 25,000 ultrasound images from 37 COVID-19-positive patients scanned at two hospitals, plus 12 control cases, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the proposed machine learning approach. We report an accuracy of 86% when classifying between sufficient and insufficient quality images by the quality assessment module. For data of sufficient quality - as determined by the quality assessment module - the mean classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting COVID-19-positive cases were 0.95, 0.91, and 0.97, respectively, across five holdout test data sets unseen during the training of any networks within the proposed system.

Recent reports, however, raise concern for a new hyperinflammatory entity in a subset of pediatric COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We report a fatal case of confirmed COVID-19 with hyperinflammatory features concerning for both multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and primary COVID-19. RESULTS: This case highlights the ambiguity in distinguishing between these two entities in a subset of pediatric patients with COVID-19-related disease and the rapid decompensation these patients may experience. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate clinical suspicion is necessary for both acute disease and MIS-C. SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests obtained early in the diagnostic process may help to narrow down the differential but does not distinguish between acute COVID-19 and MIS-C. Better understanding of the hyperinflammatory changes associated with MIS-C and acute COVID-19 in children will help delineate the roles for therapies, particularly if there is a hybrid phenotype occurring in adolescents.","Beaudry, Jeanette T; Dietrick, Barbara; Lammert, Dawn B; Constas, Alexander; McCaw, Julia; Hammond, John; Buendia, Matthew; Stein, Julie E; Pekosz, Andrew; Schuette, Jennifer; Mostafa, Heba H; Hooper, Jody E; Bernier, Meghan; Agwu, Allison; Feldman, Leonard S",Pediatr Infect Dis J,373,20

Case reports of donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 infection are emerging. Few studies on treatment of COVID-19 among SOT recipients are available, and therefore, general recommendations are similar to the general population. Vaccine efficacy in the SOT population is uncertain. SUMMARY: COVID-19 remains a significant threat to SOT recipients and studies on treatment and prevention specific to this population are urgently needed.

Benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 infection have been proposed and clinical trials are underway. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, typically used for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, have been considered for off-label use in several countries. In the literature, there are reports of ototoxic effects of the drugs causing damage to the inner ear structures, which then result in hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or imbalance. This mini-review represents a summary of the findings from a systematic search regarding ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the published literature. The characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss and/or tinnitus after chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment can be temporary but reports of persistent auditory and vestibular dysfunction exist. These are not frequent, but the impact can be substantial. Additionally, abnormal cochleovestibular development in the newborn was also reported after chloroquine treatment in pregnant women. The suggested dose of chloroquine for COVID-19 infection is considerably higher than the usual dosage for malaria treatment; therefore, it is plausible that the ototoxic effects will be greater. There are potential implications from this review for survivors of COVID-19 treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Patient reports of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance should be noted. Those with troublesome hearing loss, tinnitus and/or imbalance are encouraged to be referred for hearing evaluation and interventions once they are stable. Clinical trials of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should also consider including audiological monitoring in the protocol.","Prayuenyong, Pattarawadee; Kasbekar, Anand V.; Baguley, David M.",Front.

Inflation adjusted food cost and the cost of nutrients were obtained from the Center for Nutrition Promotion and Policy food cost database. Cost and nutrient profiles for What We Eat in America food categories were compared to whole eggs. Of the 15 main food groups examined, whole eggs ranked third for lowest cost per 100 g (excluding beverages), such that eggs cost 0.35 USD per 100 g, with dairy and grains representing the first and second most cost-efficient foods, at 0.23 USD and 0.27 USD per 100 g, respectively. In children and adults, eggs represented a cost-efficient food for protein delivery, such that eggs provided nearly 2.7% and 3.7% of all protein in the diet, respectively, at a cost of about 0.03 USD per g of protein. Eggs contributed 3.8% and 6.0% of all vitamin A in the diet of children and adults, at a cost of approximately 0.002 USD and 0.003 USD per RAE mcg of vitamin A, respectively. In children 2-18 years-old, nearly 12% of all choline in the diet is delivered from eggs, at a cost of approximately 0.002 USD per mg of choline. Similarly, in adults 19-years-old+, eggs provide nearly 15% of all dietary choline in the diet, at a cost of approximately 0.002 USD per mg of choline.

Since neutrophils are the major component of innate immunity, we hypothesize that the quantum of activated neutrophils in the blood may predict an adverse outcome. DESIGN: In a retrospective study of 300 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, we analyzed the impact of neutrophil activation (NEUT-RI), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the established clinical risk factors of age, diabetes, obesity and hypertension on the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Significant predictors of the need for mechanical ventilation were NEUT-RI (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.22, P < 0.001), diabetes (OR = 2.56, P = 0.00846) and obesity (OR = 6.55, P < 0.001).

The interaction between spike surface viral protein (Sgp) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor is essential to understand the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and pathogenicity. Currently, no drugs are available to treat the infection caused by this coronavirus and the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy to control SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigated the in silico interaction of AMPs with viral structural proteins and host cell receptors. We screened the antimicrobial peptide database (APD3) and selected 15 peptides based on their physicochemical and antiviral properties. The interactions of AMPs with Sgp and ACE2 were performed by docking analysis. The results revealed that two amphibian AMPs, caerin 1.6 and caerin 1.10, had the highest affinity for Sgp proteins while interaction with the ACE2 receptor was reduced. The effective AMPs interacted particularly with Arg995 located in the S2 subunits of Sgp, which is key subunit that plays an essential role in viral fusion and entry into the host cell through ACE2. Given these computational findings, new potentially effective AMPs with antiviral properties for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, but they need experimental validation for their therapeutic effectiveness.","Liscano, Yamil; Oñate-Garzón, Jose; Ocampo-Ibáñez, Iván Darío",Molecules (Basel),373,1

The degree of hypercoagulability appears to correlate with outcomes; however, optimal criteria to assess for the highest-risk patients for thrombotic events remain unclear; we hypothesized that deranged thromboelastography measurements of coagulation would correlate with thromboembolic events. STUDY DESIGN: Patients admitted to an ICU with COVID-19 diagnoses who had thromboelastography analyses performed were studied. Conventional coagulation assays, d-dimer levels, and viscoelastic measurements were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new-onset renal failure. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Derangements in coagulation laboratory values, including elevated d-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time, were confirmed; viscoelastic measurements showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis of clot at 30 minutes. A complete lack of lysis of clot at 30 minutes was seen in 57% of patients and predicted venous thromboembolic events with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.742 (p = 0.021). A d-dimer cutoff of 2,600 ng/mL predicted need for dialysis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.779 (p = 0.005). Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a d-dimer > 2,600 ng/mL had a venous thromboembolic event rate of 50% compared with 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p = 0.008), and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared with 14% (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated d-dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown.","Wright, Franklin L; Vogler, Thomas O; Moore, Ernest E; Moore, Hunter B; Wohlauer, Max V; Urban, Shane; Nydam, Trevor L; Moore, Peter K; McIntyre, Robert C",J Am Coll Surg,373,21

Throughout the world with a large number of people being affected by covid 19, the need for the ventilators has risen. However, there is disproportionate ratio of demand versus supply of ventilators due to the menace caused by Covid 19 which has become unmanageable. This paper describes the design of the low cost portable mechanical bag valve mask compressor which could serve as a preliminary ventilator for the patients needing ventilator support in COVID 19. This prototype ventilator delivers breaths by compressing a conventional bag-valve mask (BVM) with a motor, eliminating the need for a human operator for the BVM. It is driven by a wind shield wiper electric motor powered by a 12 V battery. Additionally it can be used to deliver oxygen through either Laryngeal mask or compact face masks or nasopharyngeal airways where intubation is awaited in early breathlessness. Future additions for our prototype ventilator will include a controllable inspiration to expiration time ratio, a pressure relief valve, PEEP capabilities and an LCD screen. With a prototyping cost of only $150, the concept of BVM compressor is a low-cost, low-power portable ventilator technology that will provide essential ventilator features at a fraction of the cost of existing technology.","Khan, Mubarak Muhamed; Parab, Sapna Ramkrishna",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,373,26

Our research has estimated that nationally, at least 30–50 million migrants lost their jobs in late March, far more than the local urban workers. An online survey also indicates that the rural-hukou population have borne the brunt of the outbreak. More than 90% rural-hukou migrant workers could not find work as of late February, compared to 42% for urban-hukou migrant workers. Those who are less educated and low skilled have also a higher rate of unemployment. At the same time, there is a serious mismatch between workers covered by the social safety net and those who really need it. Both across the Chinese population at large and within the migrant population itself, the pandemic has exacerbated the preexisting inequalities along the household registration system line. We call for a more substantive reform of the system so that migrant workers can be integrated into the national social safety net and be protected in the next crisis.","Che, Lei; Du, Haifeng; Chan, Kam Wing",Eurasian Geogr.

Several prognostic factors have been identified in the studies from Asian, European or American countries. This is the first national Lebanese study assessing the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 mortality in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: This is an observational study that included all chronic hemodialysis patients in Lebanon who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 31st March to 1st November 2020. Data on demographics, comorbidities, admission to hospital and outcome were collected retrospectively from the patients' medical records. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: A total of 231 patients were included. Mean age was 61.46 ± 13.99 years with a sex ratio of 128 males to 103 females. Around half of the patients were diabetics, 79.2% presented with fever. A total of 115 patients were admitted to the hospital, 59% of them within the first day of diagnosis. Hypoxia was the major reason for hospitalization. Death rate was 23.8% after a median duration of 6 (IQR, 2 to 10) days. Adjusted regression analysis showed a higher risk for death among older patients (odds ratio = 1.038; 95% confidence interval: 1.013, 1.065), patients with heart failure (odds ratio = 4.42; 95% confidence interval: 2.06, 9.49), coronary artery disease (odds ratio = 3.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.69, 6.30), multimorbidities (odds ratio = 1.593; 95% confidence interval: 1.247, 2.036), fever (odds ratio = 6.66; 95% confidence interval: 1.94, 27.81), CRP above 100 mg/L (odds ratio = 4.76; 95% confidence interval: 1.48, 15.30), and pneumonia (odds ratio = 19.18; 95% confidence interval: 6.47, 56.83). CONCLUSIONS: This national study identified older age, coronary artery disease, heart failure, multimorbidities, fever and pneumonia as risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19 on chronic hemodialysis.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias detected by the electrocardiogram and their relationships with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed and Google were searched for studies that reported on cardiac arrhythmias and/or examined the relationship between arrhythmias and adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty studies with 12,713 participants were included in the systematic review, and 28 studies (n = 12,499) in the meta-analysis. The mean age was 61.3 ± 16.8 years; 39.3% were female. In 25 studies with 7578 patients, the overall prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias was 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4%-12.3%). The most common arrhythmias documented during hospitalization were supraventricular arrhythmias (6.2%, 95% CI: 4.4%-8.1%) followed by ventricular arrhythmias (2.5%, 95% CI: 1.8%-3.1%). The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was higher among critically ill patients (relative risk [RR]: 12.1, 95% CI: 8.5-17.3) and among non-survivors (RR: 3.8, 95%, CI: 1.7-8.7). Eight studies reported changes in the QT interval. The prevalence of QTc > 500 ms was 12.3% (95% CI: 6.9%-17.8%). ST-segment deviation was reported in eight studies, with a pooled estimate of 8.7% (95% CI: 7.3% to 10.0%).

Utilising qualitative interview data from a larger COVID-19 study, this paper provides insights into influences on and the enactment of national COVID-19 testing strategies for health care workers (HCWs) in English NHS settings during wave one of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-August 2020). Through the findings we aim to inform learning about COVID-19 testing policies and practices; and to inform future pandemic diagnostic preparedness. METHODS: A remote qualitative, semi-structured longitudinal interview method was employed with a purposive snowball sample of senior scientific advisors to the UK Government on COVID-19, and HCWs employed in NHS primary and secondary health care settings in England. Twenty-four interviews from 13 participants were selected from the larger project dataset using a key term search, as not all of the transcripts contained references to testing. Framework analysis was informed by the non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability of patient-facing health and care technologies implementation framework (NASSS) and by normalisation process theory (NPT). RESULTS: Our account highlights tensions between the communication and implementation of national testing developments; scientific advisor and HCW perceptions about infectiousness; and uncertainties about the responsibility for testing and its implications at the local level. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration must be given to the implications of mass NHS staff testing, including the accuracy of information communicated to HCWs; how HCWs interpret, manage, and act on testing guidance; and the influence these have on health care organisations and services.","Martindale, Anne-Marie; Pilbeam, Caitlin; Mableson, Hayley; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah; Atkinson, Paul; Borek, Aleksandra; Lant, Suzannah; Gobat, Nina; Solomon, Tom; Sheard, Sally",BMC Public Health,373,24

Understanding the progression and current impact of the pandemic is fundamental to planning, management and mitigation of future impact on the population. Surveillance is the core function of any public health system, and a multi-component surveillance system for COVID-19 is essential to understand the burden across the different strata of any health system and the population. Many countries and public health bodies utilise 'syndromic surveillance' (using real-time, often non-specific symptom/preliminary diagnosis information collected during routine healthcare provision) to supplement public health surveillance programmes. The current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a series of unprecedented challenges to syndromic surveillance including: the impact of media reporting during early stages of the pandemic; changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour resulting from government guidance on social distancing and accessing healthcare services; and changes in clinical coding and patient management systems. These have impacted on the presentation of syndromic outputs, with changes in denominators creating challenges for the interpretation of surveillance data. Monitoring changes in healthcare utilisation is key to interpreting COVID-19 surveillance data, which can then be used to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the population. Syndromic surveillance systems have had to adapt to encompass these changes, whilst also innovating by taking opportunities to work with data providers to establish new data feeds and develop new COVID-19 indicators. These developments are supporting the current public health response to COVID-19, and will also be instrumental in the continued and future fight against the disease.","Elliot, Alex J; Harcourt, Sally E; Hughes, Helen E; Loveridge, Paul; Morbey, Roger A; Smith, Sue; Soriano, Ana; Bains, Amardeep; Smith, Gillian E; Edeghere, Obaghe; Oliver, Isabel",Epidemiol Infect,373,1

Compliance with IPC measures has critical implications for HCWs safety, patient protection and the care environment. AIMS: To discuss the body of available literature regarding HCWs' knowledge of IPC and highlight potential factors that may influence compliance to IPC precautions. DESIGN: A systematic review. A protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis [PRISMA] statement. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Proquest, Wiley online library, Medline, and Nature) were searched from 1 January 2006 to 31 January 2021 in the English language using the following keywords alone or in combination: knowledge, awareness, healthcare workers, infection, compliance, comply, control, prevention, factors. 3417 papers were identified and 30 papers were included in the review. RESULTS: Overall, the level of HCW knowledge of IPC appears to be adequate, good, and/or high concerning standard precautions, hand hygiene, and care pertaining to urinary catheters. Acceptable levels of knowledge were also detected in regards to IPC measures for specific diseases including TB, MRSA, MERS-CoV, COVID-19 and Ebola. However, gaps were identified in several HCWs' knowledge concerning occupational vaccinations, the modes of transmission of infectious diseases, and the risk of infection from needle stick and sharps injuries. Several factors for noncompliance surrounding IPC guidelines are discussed, as are recommendations for improving adherence to those guidelines.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of combining point-of-care molecular viral test and serum procalcitonin (PCT) level for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department (ED). Design: A prospective twin-center cohort study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2018. Setting and Participants: Older adult patients who presented to the ED with SARIs received a rapid molecular test for 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. Measures: To evaluate the clinical impact, we compared the outcomes of SARI patients between the experimental cohort and a propensity score–matched historical cohort. The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes included duration of intravenous antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Results: A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P = .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P &lt; .001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P &lt; .001). Conclusions and Implications: Combining rapid viral surveillance and PCT test is a useful strategy for early detection of potential viral epidemics and antibiotic stewardship. Clustered viral respiratory infections in a nursing home is common. Patients transferred from nursing homes to ED may benefit from this approach.","Lee, Chien-Chang; Chang, Julia Chia-Yu; Mao, Xiao-Wei; Hsu, Wan-Ting; Chen, Shey-Ying; Chen, Yee-Chun; How, Chorng-Kuang",J.

The challenge of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of rapid and effective methods to identify viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 on-demand. Existing gold standard nucleic acid-based approaches require enzymatic amplification to achieve clinically relevant levels of sensitivity and are not typically used outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we report reagent-free viral sensing that directly reads out the presence of viral particles in 5 minutes using only a sensor-modified electrode chip. The approach relies on a class of electrode-tethered sensors bearing an analyte-binding antibody displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker that also features a tethered redox probe. When a positive potential is applied, the sensor is transported to the electrode surface. Using chronoamperometry, the presence of viral particles and proteins can be detected as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag on the sensor. This report is the first virus-detecting assay that uses the kinetic response of a probe/virus complex to analyze the complexation state of the antibody. We demonstrate the performance of this sensing approach as a means to detect, within 5 min, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated spike protein in test samples and in unprocessed patient saliva.","Yousefi, Hanie; Mahmud, Alam; Chang, Dingran; Das, Jagotamoy; Gomis, Surath; Chen, Jenise B; Wang, Hansen; Been, Terek; Yip, Lily; Coomes, Eric; Li, Zhijie; Mubareka, Samira; McGeer, Allison; Christie, Natasha; Gray-Owen, Scott; Cochrane, Alan; Rini, James M; Sargent, Edward H; Kelley, Shana O",J Am Chem Soc,373,7

In order to protect healthcare staff adequately is necessary that we establish whether aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) increase the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Where we do not have evidence relating to SARS-CoV-2, guidelines for safely conducting these procedures should consider what risk procedures would have of transmitting related pathogens. Currently there is very little evidence detailing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with any specific procedures.

Hesitancy, that is, provides a paradigm through which such regrettably delayed responses to hydromet hazards might be better understood and effectively addressed. Without exaggeration, just about every hydromet event provides an example of how hesitancy hinders individual, community, and national government risk-reducing preventive and mitigative responses to forecasts of foreseeable, relatively near-term climate, water, or weather hazards. Reasons for such hesitancy (for vaccine and forecast use alike) include—among others—lack of trust in the science, lack of confidence in government, and persistent concern about the uncertainties that surround forecasting—both meteorological and public health. As such, a better understanding of the causes that lead to individual and group hesitancy can better inform hydromet forecasters and affected communities about ways in which beneficial actions in response to timely forecasts are often delayed. This better understanding will facilitate, where necessary, targeted interventions to enhance the societal value of forecasting by reducing this long-observed challenge of “forecast hesitancy.” First, this article focuses on incidents of “vaccine hesitancy” that, for various reasons, people around the world are even now experiencing with regard to several now-available, and confirmed efficacious, Covid-19 vaccines. Reports of such incidents of indecisiveness first increased dramatically over the first few months of 2021, despite the strong scientific confidence that vaccination would significantly lower personal risk of contracting as well as spreading the virus. After, the notion of forecast hesitancy with regard to hydrometeorological hazards is discussed.","Glantz, Michael H.; Pierce, Gregory E.",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,373,16

METHODS: Case-control study performed at a university hospital from February 26 to May 26, 2020. Cases were defined as patients with COVID-19 who developed hospital-acquired infections. For each case, two controls were selected among patients without infections. Cases and controls were matched obeying three criteria in a hierarchical sequence: length of hospital stay up until the first infection; comorbidity; and need for Intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of exposures with being a case. RESULTS: A total of 71 cases and 142 controls were included. Independent predictors for acquiring a hospital infection were chronic liver disease [odds ratio (OR) 16.56, 95% CI 1.87-146.5, p = 0.012], morbid obesity (OR 6.11, 95% CI 1.06-35.4, p = 0.043), current or past smoking (OR 4.15, 95% CI 1.45-11.88, p = 0.008), exposure to hydroxychloroquine (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.041-1, p = 0.053), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 61.5, 95% CI 11.08-341, p &#8804; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory response modifiers had no influence on acquisition of nosocomial infections in admitted patients with COVID-19.

Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.Key Pointsâ¢ Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.â¢ Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.â¢ Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice.","Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Zimba, Olena",Clin Rheumatol,373,1

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of its emergence, adaptability in siliciclastic-dominated margins and demise, especially in southern South China Sea (SCS), are largely speculative and remains enigmatic along with a scarcity of constraints on paleoclimatic and palaeoceanographic conditions. Here we show, through newly acquired high-resolution geophysical data and accurate stratigraphic records based on strontium isotopic dating, the evolution of these platforms from ~15.5-9.5 Ma is initially tied to tectonics and eustasy, and ultimately, after ~9.5 Ma, to changes in the global climate patterns and consequent palaeoceanographic conditions. Our results demonstrate at least two paleodeltas that provided favourable substratum of elevated sand bars, which conditioning the emergence of the buildups that inadvertently mirrored the underlying strata. We show unprecedented evidences for ocean current fluctuations linked to the intensification of the Asian summer monsoon winds resulting in the formation of drifts and moats, which extirpated the platforms through sediment removal and starvation. This work highlights the imperative role of palaeoceanography in creating favourable niches for reefal development that can be applicable to carbonate platforms elsewhere.","Mathew, Manoj; Makhankova, Adelya; Menier, David; Sautter, Benjamin; Betzler, Christian; Pierson, Bernard",Sci Rep,373,10

We present the first case report of a calcific pancreatitis associated with not only PHPT but a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 52 years old woman suffering from mellitus diabetes consulting the emergency rooms for acute pancreatitis with hyperlipasemia and hypercalcemia whom final imaging discovered a pituitary gland adenoma, a left surrenal adenoma, and a parathyroid adenoma, and for the pancreas it reveiled an acute mild pancreatitis with a background of calcifications, no gallstones, no bone or renal abnormalities; and the parathyroidectomy was performed following the minimally invasive selective technique. DISCUSSION: Calcemia levels testing routinely performed help discover hyperparathyroidism. The associations of chronic pancreatic inflammation to hyperparathyroidism needs to be studied, even if hypercalcemia is prooven to be a risk factor of pancreatitis; the mechanism behind this association is brievely described. parathyroidectomy is the definitive cure for hyperparathyroidism, the technique advances has shown effective localization of the responsible adenoma and the intraoperative testing of parathormon levels after resection decreasing is a very reliable extemporaneous sign for the success of the procedure. CONCLUSION: The endocrine system is synchronized; meaning the injury of one gland should start the search for others. In our case, the first main lead should not have been the acute pancreatitis but her diabetes.

0 05) Results: Nineteen participants were recruited and randomized to immediate (n=10) and delayed (n=9) exercise program delivery One participant dropped out of the immediate delivery and three participants in the delayed delivery group were unable to participate in the follow-up testing due to COVID-19-related restrictions Fifteen participant were included in the analysis Nine participants (6 women, 3 men;age 27 6±3 2 years;height 170 2±9 6 cm;weight 86 5±17 7 kg;body mass index 30 1±7 2) completed the 8-week intervention and 6 participants (3 women, 3 men;age 25 7±2 2 years;height 176 1±8 3 cm;weight 82 2±11 2 kg;body mass index 26 5±2 3) in the delayed group served as controls Scores for the KOOS subscales are presented in Table 1 The median change in symptoms from baseline to 8-week follow-up was -3 6 (range -10 7 to 3 6) in the immediate and -1 8 (range -3 6 to 3 6) in the delayed group There was no statistically significant difference (p=0 22, Z= -1 33) in the change in the symptom score between those completing the intervention and the delayed group over the 8-week period The change in the KOOS Symptom subscale for each participant is presented in Figure 1 Conclusions: There were no differences found between groups when comparing change in knee-related symptoms in individuals 3-15 following an intra-articular knee injury after an 8-week exercise intervention, compared to those waiting for the intervention Some individuals reported more knee-related symptoms after the intervention, even though the exercises were adapted for individual needs and pain was monitored It is important to bear in mind that the change in the KOOS symptoms score in both groups is less than the Minimal Detectable Change that previous studies have reported to be 5 to 8 5 points in populations with knee injury It is possible that the increased focus on the knee during the study leads to decreased scores in knee-related symptoms at follow-up It should also be taken into consideration that it is possible that the 8-week intervention is too short to elicit positive changes in knee-related symptoms In the future, the impact of an exercise intervention on knee-related symptoms will be explored in a larger group to allow for more robust analysis in which potentially confounding factors can be considered (e g , time since injury, sex) [Formula presented] [Formula presented]","Räisänen, A.

This project encouraged registered nurses to quickly identify and isolate potentially infectious patients in the emergency room, to prevent exposures to airborne and droplet transmitted communicable diseases, including meningitis, tuberculosis, and measles. METHODS: This pre- and postintervention model implemented a quasi-experimental designed project in the emergency room (ER). The Centers for Disease Control's empiric transmission-based isolation precautions were implemented to prevent occupational health exposures. Eighty registered nurses (RN's) received education on the new intervention. The assumption of this project was, the new process will decrease occupational health exposures. RESULTS: Eight ER RNs reported an occupational health exposure, preintervention in quarter 2 of 2019, compared to zero occupational health exposures, postintervention in quarter 3 of 2019. A &#967;² independence test was used to determine if the categorical variables of the capstone intervention and disease exposure were related in the same RN population. An association between the capstone intervention and disease exposure was observed, X2 (1)â¯=â¯8.421, Pâ¯=â¯.004, indicating the result is statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The preventing respiratory infectious disease exposures project effectively reduced occupational health exposures to airborne and droplet transmitted diseases in the emergency room by 100%. These results should encourage Infection Preventionists to adapt the Centers for Disease Control's empiric transmission isolation precautions in their emergency rooms and urgent cares to prevent airborne and droplet transmitted disease exposures.","Cole, Jennifer; Gambone, James; Barnard, Emily",Am. j. infect. control,373,29

MethodsWe searched Pubmed, European PMC, Medline and Embase for case series and cohort studies that included all CYP admitted to hospital with [≥]30 CYP with SARS-CoV-2 or [≥]5 CYP with PIMS-TS or MIS-C. Eligible studies contained 1) details of age, sex, ethnicity or co-morbidities, and 2) an outcome which included admission to critical care, mechanical invasive ventilation, cardiovascular support, or death. Studies reporting outcomes in more restricted grouping of co-morbidities were eligible for narrative review. Authors of eligible studies were approached for individual patient data (IPD). We used random effects meta-analyses for aggregate study-level data and multilevel mixed effect models for IPD data to examine risk factors (age, sex, comorbidities) associated with admission to critical care and death. Data shown are odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Findings81 studies were included, 57 in the meta-analysis (of which 22 provided IPD) and 26 in the narrative synthesis. Most studies had an element of bias in their design or reporting. Sex was not associated with critical care or death. Compared with CYP aged 1-4 years, infants had increased odds of admission to critical care (OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.40-1.90)) and death (OR 2.08 (1.57-2.86)). Odds of death were increased amongst CYP over 10 years (10-14 years OR 2.15 (1.54-2.98); >14 years OR 2.15 (1.61-2.88)). Number of comorbid conditions was associated with increased odds of admission to critical care and death for COVID-19 in a dose-related fashion. For critical care admission odds ratios were: 1 comorbidity 1.49 (1.45-1.53); 2 comorbidities 2.58 (2.41-2.75); [≥]3 comorbidities 2.97 (2.04-4.32), and for death: 1 comorbidity 2.15 (1.98-2.34); 2 comorbidities 4.63 (4.54-4.74); [≥]3 co-morbidities 4.98 (3.78-6.65). Odds of admission to critical care were increased for all co-morbidities apart from asthma (0.92 (0.91-0.94)) and malignancy (0.85 (0.17-4.21)) with an increased odds of death in all co-morbidities considered apart from asthma. Neurological and cardiac comorbidities were associated with the greatest increase in odds of severe disease or death. Obesity increased the odds of severe disease and death independently of other comorbidities. InterpretationHospitalised CYP at greatest vulnerability of severe disease or death from SARS-CoV-2 infection are infants, teenagers, those with cardiac or neurological conditions, or 2 or more comorbid conditions, and those who are obese. These groups should be considered higher priority for vaccination and for protective shielding when appropriate. Whilst odds ratios were high, the absolute increase in risk for most comorbidities was small compared to children without underlying conditions. FundingRH is in receipt of a funded fellowship from Kidney Research UK. JW is in receipt of a Medical Research Council Fellowship. Putting Research Into ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe risk factors for severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults has been extensively studied and reported, with good evidence that increasing age, non-white ethnicity, male gender and co-morbidities increase the risk. SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and young people (CYP) infrequently results in hospital admission and very rarely causes severe disease and death, making it difficult to discern the impact of a range of potential risk factors for severe disease in the many small to moderate sized published studies. More recent larger publications have aimed to address this question in specific populations but the global experience has not been described. We searched Pubmed, European PMC, Medline and Embase from the 1st January 2020 to 21st May 2021 for case series and cohort studies that included all CYP admitted to hospital with 30 children with reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or 5 CYP defined as having PIMS-TS or MIS-C. 57 studies met the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to use individual patient data to compare the odds and risk of critical care admission and death in CYP with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS. We find that the odds of severe disease in hospitalised children is increased in those with multiple co-morbidities, cardiac and neurological co-morbidities and those who are obese. However, the additional risk compared to children without co-morbidity is small. Implications of all the available evidenceSevere COVID-19 and PIMS-TS, whilst rare, can occur in CYP. We have identified pre-existing risk factors for severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 and recommend that those with co-orbidities which place them in the highest risk groups are prioritised for vaccination.","Harwood, Rachel; Yan, Helen; Camara, Nish Talawila Da; Smith, Clare; Ward, Joseph; Tudur-Smith, Catrin; Linney, Michael; Clark, Matthew; Whittaker, Elizabeth; Saatci, Defne; Davis, Peter J; Luyt, Karen; Draper, Elizabeth S; Kenny, Simon; Fraser, Lorna K; Viner, Russell M",,373,1

Our study based on administrative databases of the Emilia-Romagna region demonstrates a 17% excess of out-of-hospital cardiac deaths in the first 2020 semester with a peak of +62% on April. The excess of cardiac deaths may be explained by the indirect consequences of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include a dramatic reduction of hospital admissions during the pandemic, particularly for acute coronary syndromes; an increase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests; a reduction of outpatient clinic activities and cardiac procedures; long-term cardiovascular effects of COVID-19; and unfavorable cardiac effects of the lockdown imposed by the spread of COVID-19 infection.

We sought to determine the test positivity rate of close contacts of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in schools during the first half-term of the 2020/2021 academic year. METHODS: National-level data from the schools' testing pathway were interrogated to determine the positivity rate of close contacts of cases of COVID-19 in Irish primary, postprimary and special schools during the first half-term of 2020/2021 academic year. The positivity rates among adult and child close contacts were compared and the proportion of national cases of COVID-19 who were aged 4-18 years during the observation period was calculated to assess whether this proportion increased after schools reopened. RESULTS: Of all, 15,533 adult and child close contacts were tested for COVID-19 through the schools' testing pathway during the first half-term of the 2020/2021 academic year. Three hundred and ninety-nine close contacts tested positive, indicating a positivity rate of 2.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.3-2.8%). The positivity rates of child and adult close contacts were similarly low (2.6% vs 2.7%, P = 0.7). The proportion of all national cases of COVID-19 who were aged 4-18 years did not increase during the first half-term of the 2020/2021 school year. CONCLUSIONS: The low positivity rate of close contacts of cases of COVID-19 in schools indicate that transmission of COVID-19 in Irish schools during the first half-term of the 2020/2021 academic year was low. These findings support policies to keep schools open during the pandemic.","White, P; Ceannt, R; Kennedy, E; O039,; Sullivan, M B; Ward, M; Collins, A",Public Health,373,16

The etiology of kidney injury appears to be tubular, mainly due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the key joint receptor for SARS-CoV-2; however, cases with glomerular implication have also been documented. The multifactorial origin of this renal involvement could include virus-mediated injury, cytokine storm, angiotensin II pathway activation, complement dysregulation, hyper-coagulation, and microangiopathy. We present the renal histological findings from a patient who developed acute kidney injury and de novo nephrotic syndrome, highly suggestive of acute IgA-dominant infection-associated glomerulonephritis (IgA-DIAGN) after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evidenced by the presence of this virus detected in the renal tissue of the patient via immunohistochemistry assay. In summary, we document the first case of IgA-DIAGN associated to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a super antigen driving the development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome as well as cytokine storm in patients affected by COVID-19, reaching the glomerulus and leading to the development of this novel IgA-DIAGN.","Pérez, Aurora; Torregrosa, Isidro; D039,; Marco, Luis; Juan, Isabel; Terradez, Liria; Solís, Miguel Ángel; Moncho, Francesc; Carda-Batalla, Carmen; Forner, María J; Gorriz, Jose Luis",Viruses,373,32

We aimed to assess the prevalence, spectrum, severity, and significance of digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. FINDINGS: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death.

It is largely unknown whether lncRNA would deregulate in SARS-CoV-2 infection, causing ongoing pandemic COVID-19. To identify, if lncRNA was deregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we analyzed in silico the data in GSE147507. It was revealed that expression of 20 lncRNA like MALAT1, NEAT1 was increased and 4 lncRNA like PART1, TP53TG1 was decreased in at least two independent cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2. Expression of NEAT1 was also increased in lungs tissue of COVID-19 patients. The deregulated lncRNA could interact with more than 2800 genes/proteins and 422 microRNAs as revealed from the database that catalogs experimentally determined interactions. Analysis with the interacting gene/protein partners of deregulated lncRNAs revealed that these genes/proteins were associated with many pathways related to viral infection, inflammation and immune functions. To find out whether these lncRNAs could be regulated by STATs and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), we used ChIPBase v2.0 that catalogs experimentally determined binding from ChIP-seq data. It was revealed that any one of the transcription factors IRF1, IRF4, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5A had experimentally determined binding at regions within -5kb to +1kb of the deregulated lncRNAs in at least 2 independent cell lines/conditions. Our analysis revealed that several lncRNAs could be regulated by IRF1, IRF4 STAT1 and STAT3 in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and lncRNAs might be involved in antiviral response. However, these in silico observations are necessary to be validated experimentally.","Sayantan, Laha Chinmay Saha Susmita Dutta Madhurima Basu Raghunath Chatterjee Sujoy Ghosh Bhattacharyya N.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the coronavirus pandemic (risk of infection by virus together with associated measures taken to combat it), and the occurrence of a wide range of psychosomatic symptoms and to explore if there is any factor that plays a role in this association. We collected data from a sample of Czech adults (n = 1431) and measured the occurrence of nine health complaints, respondents' experience during the pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics. The results showed associations between the coronavirus pandemic and increased psychosomatic symptoms and negative emotions. We further found higher risks of increased health complaints in younger people and women. It is also possible that there is higher risk of increased health complaints for respondents with secondary school education, students, and highly spiritual people, but this relationship has to be further investigated. In contrast, respondents with their highest achieved education level being secondary school graduation had a lower risk of increased frequency of stomach-ache. We also found that more negative emotions could increase the frequency of health complaints. Our findings suggest that the coronavirus pandemic and associated government measures could have a significant influence on the prevalence of health complaints and emotional state.","Zidkova, Radka; Malinakova, Klara; van Dijk, Jitse P; Tavel, Peter",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),373,26

This study analyzes the complete outbreak data from Wuhan, assesses the impact of these public health interventions, and estimates the asymptomatic, undetected and total cases for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. METHODS: By taking different stages of the outbreak into account, we developed a time-dependent compartmental model to describe the dynamics of disease transmission and case detection and reporting. Model coefficients were parameterized by using the reported cases and following key events and escalated control strategies. Then the model was used to calibrate the complete outbreak data by using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method. Finally we used the model to estimate asymptomatic and undetected cases and approximate the overall antibody prevalence level. RESULTS: We found that the transmission rate between Jan 24 and Feb 1, 2020, was twice as large as that before the lockdown on Jan 23 and 67.6% (95% CI [0.584,0.759]) of detectable infections occurred during this period. Based on the reported estimates that around 20% of infections were asymptomatic and their transmission ability was about 70% of symptomatic ones, we estimated that there were about 14,448 asymptomatic and undetected cases (95% CI [12,364,23,254]), which yields an estimate of a total of 64,454 infected cases (95% CI [62,370,73,260]), and the overall antibody prevalence level in the population of Wuhan was 0.745% (95% CI [0.693%,0.814%]) by March 31, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was achieved via the enforcement of a combination of multiple NPIs: the lockdown on Jan 23, the stay-at-home order on Feb 2, the massive isolation of all symptomatic individuals via newly constructed special shelter hospitals on Feb 6, and the large scale screening process on Feb 18. Our results indicate that the population in Wuhan is far away from establishing herd immunity and provide insights for other affected countries and regions in designing control strategies and planing vaccination programs.","Huo, Xi; Chen, Jing; Ruan, Shigui",BMC Infect Dis,373,7

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest challenge for pancreatic surgeons is the difficulty in providing oncological care. In this review article, from the standpoint of surgeons, we explain the concept of triaging of patients with pancreatic tumors under the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actual impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of patients with pancreatic tumors. The most vital points in selecting the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic are (1) Oncologists need to tailor the treatment plan based on the COVID-19 phase, tumor malignant potential, and patients’ comorbidities;and (2) Optimal treatment for pancreatic cancer should be planned according to the condition of each patient and tumor resectability based on national comprehensive cancer network resectability criteria. To choose the best therapeutic approach for patients with pancreatic tumors during this pandemic, we need to tailor the treatment plan based on elective surgery acuity scale (ESAS).

'Lockdown' included closure of dental practices. Both the virus itself and the various Government responses have had a profound impact on the work, home and social lives of the entire population and are likely to impact the oral health of many people. These oral health effects can be attributed to those caused directly by the virus and those caused indirectly through the subsequent societal response. Direct effects of COVID-19 on oral health include ageusia (an official symptom of COVID-19) and case reports of vesiculobullous lesions and necrotising periodontal disease (Patel and Woolley 2020). The ageusia associated with COVID-19 is transient and reports of other oral manifestations are based on low-grade and disputed evidence.

Stages of the disease course have been defined by viral burden, lung pathology, and progression through phases of the immune response. Immunological factors including inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storm have been associated with severe disease and death. Many immunomodulatory therapies for COVID-19 are currently being investigated, and preliminary results support the premise of targeting the immune response. However, because suppressing immune mechanisms could also impact the clearance of the virus in the early stages of infection, therapeutic success is likely to depend on timing with respect to the disease course. Azithromycin is an immunomodulatory drug that has been shown to have antiviral effects and potential benefit in patients with COVID-19. Multiple immunomodulatory effects have been defined for azithromycin which could provide efficacy during the late stages of the disease, including inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inhibition of neutrophil influx, induction of regulatory functions of macrophages, and alterations in autophagy. Here we review the published evidence of these mechanisms along with the current clinical use of azithromycin as an immunomodulatory therapeutic. We then discuss the potential impact of azithromycin on the immune response to COVID-19, as well as caution against immunosuppressive and off-target effects including cardiotoxicity in these patients. While azithromycin has the potential to contribute efficacy, its impact on the COVID-19 immune response requires additional characterization so as to better define its role in individualized therapy.","Venditto, Vincent J; Haydar, Dalia; Abdel-Latif, Ahmed; Gensel, John C; Anstead, Michael I; Pitts, Michelle G; Creameans, Jarrod; Kopper, Timothy J; Peng, Chi; Feola, David J",Front Immunol,373,20

However, it remains unclear how the quality of corridors influences the dispersal process, and how it interacts with corridor length and width. Here we investigate these factors using a small-scale laboratory system where we track the dispersal of the model organism Collembola Folsomia candida. Using this system, we study the effects of corridor length, width, and quality on the probability of dispersal, net movement, body size of dispersers, and the rate of change in population size after colonization. We show that corridor quality positively affected dispersal probability, net movement, and the rate of change in population size in colonised patches. Moreover, corridor quality significantly affected the size of dispersers, with only larger individuals dispersing through poor quality corridors. The length and width of corridors affected both the rate at which populations increased in colonised patches and the net number of individuals which dispersed, suggesting that these physical properties may be important in maintaining the flow of individuals in space. Our results thus suggest that corridor quality can have an important role in determining not only the probability of dispersal occurs but also the phenotypes of the individuals which disperse, with concomitant effects on the net movement of individuals and the rate of change in population size in the colonised patches.","Li, Dongbo; Clements, Christopher F; Shan, Isobel L G; Memmott, Jane",Oecologia,373,26

Further, doing so will provide a baseline for investigation of the long-term effects of these public health measures upon behaviours and perceptions, and facilitate future follow-up study. OBJECTIVES: To determine how the onset of coronavirus (COVID-19), and associated 'lockdown', affected RT behaviours, in addition to motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue, in those who regularly performed RT prior to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study using online surveys in multiple languages (English, Danish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Slovakian, Swedish, and Japanese) distributed across social media platforms and through authors' professional and personal networks. Adults (n = 5389; median age = 31 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 25, 38]), previously engaged in RT prior to lockdown (median prior RT experience = 7 years [IQR = 4, 12]) participated. Outcomes were self-reported RT behaviours including: continuation of RT during lockdown, location of RT, purchase of specific equipment for RT, method of training, full-body or split routine, types of training, repetition ranges, exercise number, set volumes (per exercise and muscle group), weekly frequency of training, perception of effort, whether training was planned/recorded, time of day, and training goals. Secondary outcomes included motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue RT. RESULTS: A majority of individuals (82.8%) maintained participation in RT during-lockdown. Marginal probabilities from generalised linear models and generalised estimating equations for RT behaviours were largely similar from pre- to during-lockdown. There was reduced probability of training in privately owned gyms (~ 59% to ~ 7%) and increased probability of training at home (~ 18% to ~ 89%); greater probability of training using a full-body routine (~ 38% to ~ 51%); reduced probability of resistance machines (~ 66% to ~ 13%) and free weight use (~ 96% to ~ 81%), and increased probability of bodyweight training (~ 62% to ~ 82%); reduced probability of moderate repetition ranges (~ 62-82% to ~ 55-66%) and greater probability of higher repetition ranges (~ 27% to ~ 49%); and moderate reduction in the perception of effort experienced during-training (r = 0.31). Further, individuals were slightly less likely to plan or record training during lockdown and many changed their training goals. Additionally, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and likelihood of continuing current training were all lower during-lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Those engaged in RT prior to lockdown these behaviours with only slight adaptations in both location and types of training performed. However, people employed less effort, had lower motivation, and perceived training as less effective and enjoyable, reporting their likelihood of continuing current training was similar or lower than pre-lockdown. These results have implications for strategies to maintain engagement in positive health behaviours such as RT during-restrictive pandemic-related public health measures.

Acupuncture-moxibustion could produce the local and systemic anti-inflammatory effect on COVID-19 through the activation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Compared with humoral anti-inflammatory pathway, the neuronal anti-inflammatory pathway has earlier initiation, rapider action, and more localization, which play a more important role in the initial stage of inflammatory response. This may be an important basis for acupuncture-moxibustion intervention in the early stage of COVID-19. In addition to cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, acupuncture-moxibustion may also play an anti-inflammatory role in activating sympathetic nerve, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and other neural anti-inflammatory pathways. How acupuncture-moxibustion play its role in stimulating the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve in different periods of inflammatory response, and whether the effect is based on the selection of acupoints and the methods of stimulation, will be the research direction of the transformation from basic research to clinical research for acupuncture-moxibustion.","He, Wei; Shi, Xiao-Shuang; Zhang, Zhi-Yun; Su, Yang-Shuai; Wan, Hong-Ye; Wang, Yi; Yu, Xiao-Chun; Zhu, Bing; Jing, Xiang-Hong",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu,373,10

After completing the online course, the final scores and evaluation results were compared among different groups of interns, and their preference to distinct contents of the course was analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program (version 22.0).Results: Our online course received consistent positive recognition from the interns. Ninety-nine percent of the interns recommended incorporating the online course into the conventional offline training program after the pandemic. There was no significant difference between interns from different programs concerning the final scores and course evaluation. A smaller learning group size (<15 students) could achieve a better teaching effect than a larger group size (p < 0.05). The interns preferred interactive discussions, and course contents that they can get practice and feedback from, rather than video watching and didactic lectures.Conclusions: The online neurology intern training course based on SPOC and blending learning mode is worthy of popularization in a large student base. The teaching effect of an online intern training program may be improved by limiting the group size to less than 15 students and encouraging more interactive discussion, more practice and feedback.","He, Miao; Tang, Xiang-Qi; Zhang, Hai-Nan; Luo, Ying-Ying; Tang, Zhen-Chu; Gao, Shu-Guang",Med Educ Online,373,1

The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis. Method: This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news articles and other reliable data sources. Results: Most countries’ digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individual’s location databases, code scanning and individual’s online reporting. Public responses of mistrust about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalized solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices. Solutions: The proposed predictive, preventive and personalized solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearable device data, mobile apps data and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (Internet of Things). Conclusion: Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalization of human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared, and lessons have not been learned from previous cases of pandemics. We present a summary of predictive, preventive and personalized digital methods that could be deployed fast to help with the COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Radanliev, Petar; De Roure, David; Walton, Rob; Van Kleek, Max; Montalvo, Rafael Mantilla; Santos, Omar; Maddox, La’Treall; Cannady, Stacy",EPMA J.,373,21

Moreover, the incidence of potentially fatal conditions such as acute type A aortic dissection seems to have decreased since the pandemic began, whereas the number of cases of chronic ascending aortic dissections dramatically increased. We present two patients whose management has been affected by the exceptional sanitary situation we are dealing with. Case report: A 70-year-old man with chest pain and an aortic regurgitation murmur had his cardiac workup delayed (4 months) because of sanitary restrictions. He was then diagnosed with chronic type A aortic dissection and underwent urgent replacement of ascending aorta and aortic root. The delay in surgical treatment made the intervention technically challenging because the ascending aorta grew up to 80 mm inducing strong adhesions and chronic inflammation. The second case report concerns a 68-year-old woman with right lower-limb pain who was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. However, a CT scan to exclude a pulmonary embolism could not be realized until 5 months later because of sanitary restrictions. When she eventually got the CT scan, it fortuitously showed a chronic dissection of the ascending aorta. She underwent urgent surgery, and the intervention was challenging because of adhesions and severe inflammation. Conclusion: Delayed treatment due to sanitary restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the management of potentially life-threatening conditions including type A aortic dissection. We should remain careful to avoid COVID-19 also hitting patients who are not infected with the virus.","Lyon, A.; Gunga, Z.; Niclauss, L.; Rancati, V.; Tozzi, P.",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,373,0

The transformation of chain structure and chemical composition of masks as well as the decreased mechanical strength of masks after UV weathering were observed. The melt-blown cloth in the middle layer of masks was found to be particularly sensitive to UV irradiation. A single weathered mask can release more than 1.5 million microplastics to the aqueous environment. The physical abrasion caused by sand further exacerbated the release of microplastic particles from masks, with more than 16 million particles released from just one weathered mask in the presence of sand. The study results indicate that shorelines are not only the main receptor of discarded masks from oceans and lands, but also play host to further transformation of masks to plastic particles.","Wang, Zheng; An, Chunjiang; Chen, Xiujuan; Lee, Kenneth; Zhang, Baiyu; Feng, Qi",J Hazard Mater,373,24

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of this measure on the health and comfort of university students and the role that the characteristics of the home may have played. It is essential to differentiate between the terms comfort and health both from the medical and architectural perspectives, as there are differences between the two concepts that are, nonetheless, shared by both disciplines. An online survey was fulfilled by 188 medicine and architecture undergraduate students at the University of Seville, Spain. In terms of health, 89% suffered neuropsychiatric disorders (56% anxiety and 49% depression), 38% gained weight and 59% reported alcohol consumption. In relation to comfort, the majority rated their home positively, comfortable in terms of room temperature and noise at night, and they had a good relationship with cohabitants. However, those who did not have a balcony or terrace would have liked to have open spaces They would have also liked to increase the size of their bedroom, where they spent most of their time and where they studied. A built-up environment gave them a sense of being imprisoned, while those who enjoyed open spaces found a sense of peace. The absence of open spaces in the house, the environment and the impossibility of making the most frequently used spaces more flexible may have had negative impacts on the health and comfort of university students during confinement.","Millán-Jiménez, Antonio; Herrera-Limones, Rafael; López-Escamilla, Álvaro; López-Rubio, Emma; Torres-García, Miguel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),373,16

Antiviral and immunomodulatory agents have been proposed as potential treatments. Azithromycin exhibits both properties and therefore may play a role. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of azithromycin in viral infections, with emphasis on COVID-19. A literature search of PUBMED was conducted on May 30th and updated on July 28th. EXPERT OPINION: Azithromycin presents in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and could act in different points of the viral cycle. Its immunomodulatory properties include the ability to downregulate cytokine production, maintain epithelial cell integrity or prevent lung fibrosis. Azithromycin use was associated with a reduction in mortality and ventilation days in other viral infections. These properties could be beneficial throughout the COVID-19. However, the evidence of its use is scarce and of low quality. Azithromycin has been assessed in retrospective observational studies mainly in combination with hydroxychloroquine, which has shown to provide no benefit. This macrolide presents a well-known safety profile. Upcoming clinical trials will determine the role of azithromycin in the COVID-19 (including the stage of the disease where it offers the greatest benefits and the effect of its combination with other drugs).","Echeverría-Esnal, Daniel; Martin-Ontiyuelo, Clara; Navarrete-Rouco, María Eugenia; De-Antonio Cuscó, Marta; Ferrández, Olivia; Horcajada, Juan Pablo; Grau, Santiago",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,373,16

However, predictive factors for the outcomes remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: Attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This is a single-center, retrospective study. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital. The gathered data of discharged and deteriorated patients were compared. RESULTS: Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged and 18 patients were deteriorated. The lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) was lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00-5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 (35.72 pg/mL [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/mL [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/mL [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/mL [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with discharged patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8-342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6-776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1-261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6-2017.6]) were the independent risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.

Functional impairments in multiple organs have been reported in COVID-19 including lungs, heart, kidney, liver, brain and vascular system. Patients with metabolic-associated preconditions such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes are susceptible to experience severe symptoms. The recent emerging evidence of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 suggests that vasculopathy appears to be an independent risk factor promoting disease severity and mortality of affected patients. We have recently found that the decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterols (LDL-c) correlate with disease severity in COVID-19 patients, indicating pathological interactions between dyslipidemia and vasculopothy in COVID-19 patients. However, this clinical manifestation has been unintentionally underestimated by physicians and scientific communities. As metabolic-associated morbidities are generally accompanied with endothelial cell (EC) dysfunctions, these pre-existing conditions may make ECs more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 attack. In this mini-review, we summarize the metabolic and vascular manifestations of COVID-19 with an emphasis on the association between changes in LDL-c levels and the development of severe symptoms as well as the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the synergistic effect of LDL-c and SARS-CoV-2 on EC injuries and vasculopathy.","Cao, Xiaoling; Yin, Rong; Albrecht, Helmut; Fan, Daping; Tan, Wenbin",Am. j. physiol. endocrinol. metab,373,31

Studies often attribute this problem to the maximum likelihood training objective, and propose alternative approaches by using stochastic decoding methods or altering the training objective. However, there is still a lack of consistent evaluation metrics to directly compare the efficacy of these solutions. In this work, we study different evaluation metrics that have been proposed to evaluate quality, diversity and consistency of machine-generated text. From there, we propose a practical pipeline to evaluate language models in open-ended generation task, and research on how to improve the model's performance in all dimensions by leveraging different auxiliary training objectives.","Nguyen, An",,373,1

Major advances have led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of 7 HER2-targeted therapies for the treatment of early-stage and/or advanced-stage disease. Although oncologic outcomes continue to improve, most patients with advanced HER2-positive BC ultimately die of their disease because of primary or acquired resistance to therapy, and patients with HER2-positive early BC who have residual invasive disease after preoperative systemic therapy are at a higher risk of distant recurrence and death. The concept of treatment de-escalation and escalation is increasingly important to optimally tailor therapy for patients with HER2-positive BC and is a major focus of the current review. Research efforts in this regard are discussed as well as updates regarding the evolving standard of care in the (neo)adjuvant and metastatic settings, including the use of novel combination therapies. The authors also briefly discuss ongoing challenges in the management of HER2-positive BC (eg, intrinsic vs acquired drug resistance, the identification of predictive biomarkers, the integration of imaging techniques to guide clinical practice), and the treatment of HER2-positive brain metastases. Research aimed at superseding these challenges will be imperative to ensure continued progress in the management of HER2-positive BC going forward.","Choong, Grace M; Cullen, Grace D; O039,; Sullivan, Ciara C",CA cancer j. clin,373,16

Ordinary least squares regression models were used for the analysis. It was found that 64.8% of UN member states had a leader that tweeted about COVID-19. Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of followers during the pandemic compared to months prior was noted. Since March, the pandemic has been a dominant topic on Twitter. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest percentage increase in gaining Twitter followers was experienced by politicians who frequently tweeted and those who had a lower ratio of the number of followers to internet users.

The aim of this study is to estimate the effectiveness Covid 19 vaccines in preventing the new and severe SARS CoV-2 infections. MethodsWe did this retrospective cross-sectional study among the 4765 patients consecutive adult inpatients admitted in the Covid 19 wards of a tertiary care hospital from May 1,2021 to July 7, 2021 during the second wave of Covid 19 pandemic. Information on basic demographic variables, RT PCR status, vaccination status, outcome and clinical severity of illness were obtained from the electronic hospital patient records. Results, and Interpretation & conclusionsType of vaccine and number of doses of vaccines didnt have any protective effect against new SARS CoV-2 infection. Covid 19 patients vaccinated with at least one dose had 75 % less risk of requiring oxygen (OR 0.25 CI: 0.15 to 0.44) and 60 % less risk of ICU admission (OR 0.4 CI: 0.2 to 0.6) and it was statistically significant. Only 31 % of fully vaccinated Covid 19 positive patients had oxygen requirement (90% less risk) and 15% of the fully vaccinated patients had needed ICU admission (90% less risk). ConclusionVaccination didnt protect against SARS Cov-2 infection however significant protection was documented against severe SARS Cov-2 infection. Vaccination coverage should be increased urgently in order to halt the impending wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.","ruban, A.charles pon; Mohamed, Aazmi; Kalyanaraman, Shantaraman",,373,30

This study compared the results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and a Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs a Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in thymine and adenine homopolymeric regions than the R9, at the expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions. The LSK had a larger yield than the RBK, and provided longer reads than the RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99 vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome. The results from this study suggest that the LSK preparation library provided longer DNA fragments which contributed to a better assembly of the SARS-CoV-2, despite an impaired detection of variants in a R10 flow cell. Nanopore sequencing could be used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. KEY POINTS: â¢ Sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genome is of great importance for the pandemic surveillance. â¢ Nanopore offers a low cost and accurate method to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genome. â¢ Ligation sequencing is preferred rather than the rapid kit using transposases.","González-Recio, Oscar; Gutiérrez-Rivas, Mónica; Peiró-Pastor, Ramón; Aguilera-Sepúlveda, Pilar; Cano-Gómez, Cristina; Jiménez-Clavero, Miguel Ángel; Fernández-Pinero, Jovita",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,373,25

The COVID-19 pandemic may also impose difficulties in managing AIS patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), as well as concerns for the safety of health care providers. This international global survey aims to gather and summarize information from tertiary care stroke centers on periprocedural pathways and endovascular management of AIS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey-based research questionnaire was sent to 259 tertiary care stroke centers with neurointerventional facilities worldwide. RESULTS: We received 114 responses (response rate: 44%) from 25 different countries across all 5 continents. The number of AIS patients and EVT cases were reported to have decreased during the pandemic. Most participants reported conducting COVID-19 testing before (49%) or after the procedure (31%); 20% of centers did not test at all. Only 16% of participating centers reported using a negative pressure room for the thrombectomy procedure. Strikingly, 50% of participating centers reported no changes in the anesthetic management of AIS patients undergoing EVT during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This global survey provides information on the challenges in managing AIS patients undergoing EVT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its findings can be used to improve patient outcomes and the safety of the health care team worldwide.","Chowdhury, Tumul; Rizk, Abanoub A; Daniels, Abigail H; Al Azazi, Emad; Sharma, Deepak; Venkatraghavan, Lashmi",J Neurosurg Anesthesiol,373,16

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bariatric Surgery globally. METHODS: We conducted a global online survey of bariatric surgeons between 16/04/20 - 15/05/20. The survey was endorsed by five national bariatric surgery societies and circulated amongst their memberships. Authors also shared the link through their personal networks, email groups, and social media. RESULTS: 703 respondents from 77 countries completed the survey. Respondents reported a drop in elective bariatric activity from a median (IQR) of 130 (60-250) procedures in 2019 to a median of 0 (0-2) between16/03/2020 and 15/04/2020 during the pandemic. The corresponding figures for emergency activity were 5 (2-10) and 0 (0-1) respectively. 441 (63%) respondents did not perform any bariatric procedures during this time period. Surgeons reported outcomes of 61 elective bariatric surgical procedures during the pandemic with 13 (21%) needing ventilation and 2 (3.3%) deaths. Of the 13 emergency bariatric procedures reported, 5 (38%) needed ventilation and 4 (31%) died. 90 (13%) surgeons reported having had to perform a bariatric surgical or endoscopic procedure without adequate Personal Protective Equipment.

This principle is even more forceful in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, where we have scarce resources which can only be allocated to a part of the patients. However, the standard consequentialist version of this principle can be challenging particularly when we have to reallocate a resource that has already been given to a patient. Methodology: Engaging in thought experiments, conceptual analysis, providing counterexamples, and appealing to moral intuitions, we challenge the standard consequentialist version of the maximization principle and make a case for adopting an alternative deontological version. Discussion: In certain cases, the standard consequentialist version of the maximization principle is shown to yield intuitively immoral results. The deontological version of this principle is preferable because it can retain the merits of the standard consequentialist version without falling prey to its problems. Conclusion: Compared to the standard consequentialist version, the deontological version of the maximization principle can better guide the ethical decisions of the health community, even in cases where we face a scarcity of resources.","Afroogh, Saleh Kazemi Alireza Seyedkazemi Amin","Ethics, Medicine and Public Health",373,16

In comparison with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS, the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is lower but the transmissibility is higher. Immune dysregulation is the most common feature of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 that leads to hyperinflammation. Micronutrients such as zinc are essential for normal immune function. According to the assessment of WHO, approximately one-third of the world's society suffer from zinc deficiency. Low plasma levels of zinc are associated with abnormal immune system functions such as impaired chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and phagocytosis, dysregulated intracellular killing, overexpression of the inflammatory cytokines, lymphopenia, decreased antibody production, and sensitivity to microbes especially viral respiratory infections. Zinc exerts numerous direct and indirect effects against a wide variety of viral species particularly RNA viruses. The use of zinc and a combination of zinc-pyrithione at low concentrations impede SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Accordingly, zinc can inhibit the elongation step of RNA transcription. Furthermore, zinc might improve antiviral immunity by up-regulation of IFN&#945; through JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway in leukocytes. On the other hand, zinc supplementation might ameliorate tissue damage caused by mechanical ventilation in critical COVID-19 patients. Finally, zinc might be used in combination with antiviral medications for the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current review article, we review and discuss the immunobiological roles and antiviral properties as well as the therapeutic application of zinc in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses infections.","Asl, Sima Heydarzadeh; Nikfarjam, Sepideh; Majidi Zolbanin, Naime; Nassiri, Reza; Jafari, Reza",Int Immunopharmacol,373,24

Here, we report a simple and high-speed method for image retrieval based on our demonstration of a pseudo-linearity between the input and output light intensity distributions of multimode fibers. We studied the impact of several key parameters to image retrieval, including image pixel count, fiber core diameter and numerical aperture. We further demonstrated with experiments and numerical simulations that a wide variety of input binary and gray scale images could be faithfully retrieved from the corresponding output speckle patterns.

Twenty New Zealand White rabbits were divided into two groups as follows: (A) a control group where an ischemic lesion was produced by coagulation of the middle cerebral artery and (B) a brain protected group where mild hypothermia was provided during 80 to 100 minutes after the same ischemic lesion. The brains slices were stained with 2,3,5-Triphenyletrazolium (TTC). The sections were photographed with a digital camera and the infarct volume was measured through a computer program. Results: The average of infarct volume was 70.53 mm³ in the control group. In the protected group, the average of infarct volume was 41,30 mm³ only in five animals. Five animals of this group did not demonstrate macroscopically and microscopically infarct area.

Of the 13 patients, three had elevated troponin I and evidence of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (cases 4, 5, and 11), while six had elevated troponin I without evidence of severe CAD (cases 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and four had no clinical or pathological evidence of CAD. Of note, cases 7 and 9 had significantly elevated troponin I levels (8.84 ng/mL and 4.94 ng/mL, respectively). Several cases showed focal degenerative change or damage of cardiomyocytes. However, none of the cases had evidence of lymphocytic myocarditis. Conclusion. Although we observed elevated biomarkers of heart failure in some cases, it was not a consistent finding and did not correlate with evidence of myocarditis. The elevated biomarkers may reflect non-ischemic heart damage as a consequence of COVID-19 infection.","Ricks, E.; Wahed, A.; Dasgupta, A.; Buja, L.

METHODS: Patients recovering from Covid-19 pneumonia who presented to our department with any or all of the following complaints: pain, watering, redness and decreased vision were identified. All relevant data were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Three patients with endogenous endophthalmitis were identified. All patients had been treated for Covid-19 pneumonia and had received Remdesivir and systemic steroids therefor; 2/3 received tocilizumab. All patients received vitreous biopsy, vitrectomy and intraocular antibiotic injection. Patient 1 demonstrated K.pneumoniae in blood culture, K.pneumoniae and E.coli in urine culture, and K.pneumoniae in vitreous fluid, while patients 2 and 3 demonstrated S.maltophilia and Methicillin Resistant S.Aureus in the blood and nasopharyngeal culture respectively. Correspondingly, the same organism was cultured from vitreous in patients 2 and 3. The visual acuity at last follow up in patients 1-3 was 20/100, 20/80 and 20/40 respectively. The probable source of infection was identified in each as renal calculi, dental caries and the pharynx respectively. Real time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the presence of SARS CoV-2 in the vitreous fluid of patient 1.

Our objective was to identify, from international literature, the most common symptoms met in older adults infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This systematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE from December 1, 2019 to April 13, 2020. The analysis of methodological quality used a method dedicated to case series and case reports. Out of 260 articles initially identified, only two studies were finally included in the qualitative analysis. The mean age was relatively low, between 71 and 74 years on average. The symptoms of COVID-19 were as follows: fever, dry cough, dyspnea, asthenia, anorexia, chest tightness, diarrhea, and to a lesser extent myalgia, pharyngitis, nausea, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain and finally vomiting. Lymphopenia was found in the complete blood count. In conclusion, this systematic review of the international literature reveals a lack of data about the semiology of COVID-19 in older adults, especially in the frail oldest-old ones who commonly define the geriatric population. The national survey conducted by the French Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology will help fill this semiological gap.","Sacco, Guillaume; Brière, Olivier; Asfar, Marine; Guérin, Olivier; Berrut, Gilles; Annweiler, Cédric",Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil,373,16

A pandemic at the large-scale like COVID-19 places extraordinary demands on the world's health systems, dramatically devastates vulnerable populations, and critically threatens the global communities in an unprecedented way. While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention. The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis. The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.

The number of cancelled surgical procedures owing to Covid-19, and the reintroduction of surgical acivirt, was modelled. METHODS: This was a modelling study using Hospital Episode Statistics data (2014-2019). Surgical procedures were grouped into four urgency classes. Expected numbers of surgical procedures performed between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021 were modelled. Procedure deficit was estimated using conservative assumptions and the gradual reintroduction of elective surgery from the 1 June 2020. Costs were calculated using NHS reference costs and are reported as millions or billions of euros. Estimates are reported with 95 per cent confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 4 547 534 (95 per cent c.i. 3 318 195 to 6 250 771) patients with a pooled mean age of 53.5 years were expected to undergo surgery between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021. By 31 May 2020, 749 247 (513 564 to 1 077 448) surgical procedures had been cancelled. Assuming that elective surgery is reintroduced gradually, 2 328 193 (1 483 834 - 3 450 043) patients will be awaiting surgery by 28 February 2021. The cost of delayed procedures is 5.3 (3.1 to 8.0) billion. Safe delivery of surgery during the pandemic will require substantial extra resources costing 526.8 (449.3 to 633.9) million. CONCLUSION: As a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, provision of elective surgery will be delayed and associated with increased healthcare costs.","Fowler, A J; Dobbs, T D; Wan, Y I; Laloo, R; Hui, S; Nepogodiev, D; Bhangu, A; Whitaker, I S; Pearse, R M; Abbott, T E F",Br J Surg,373,26

Patients at highest risk of COVID-19 complications are older; are immunosuppressed; and have diabetes, cancer, or cardiopulmonary disease, with multiple comorbidities associated with worse outcomes. Physicians must weigh the patient's risk of COVID-19 complications in the event of exposure against the risk of worse oncologic outcomes from delaying cancer therapy. Herein, the authors have summarized current data regarding the risk of COVID-19 complications and mortality based on age and comorbidities and have reviewed the literature assessing how treatment delays affect oncologic outcomes. They also have provided multidisciplinary recommendations regarding the timing of local therapy for early-stage skin cancers during this pandemic with input from experts at 11 different institutions. For patients with Merkel cell carcinoma, the authors recommend prioritizing treatment, but a short delay can be considered for patients with favorable T1 disease who are at higher risk of COVID-19 complications. For patients with melanoma, the authors recommend delaying the treatment of patients with T0 to T1 disease for 3 months if there is no macroscopic residual disease at the time of biopsy. Treatment of tumors &#8805;T2 can be delayed for 3 months if the biopsy margins are negative. For patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, those with Brigham and Women's Hospital T1 to T2a disease can have their treatment delayed for 2 to 3 months unless there is rapid growth, symptomatic lesions, or the patient is immunocompromised. The treatment of tumors &#8805;T2b should be prioritized, but a 1-month to 2-month delay is unlikely to worsen disease-specific mortality. For patients with squamous cell carcinoma in situ and basal cell carcinoma, treatment can be deferred for 3 months unless the individual is highly symptomatic.","Baumann, Brian C; MacArthur, Kelly M; Brewer, Jerry D; Mendenhall, William M; Barker, Christopher A; Etzkorn, Jeremy R; Jellinek, Nathaniel J; Scott, Jeffrey F; Gay, Hiram A; Baumann, John C; Manian, Farrin A; Devlin, Phillip M; Michalski, Jeff M; Lee, Nancy Y; Thorstad, Wade L; Wilson, Lynn D; Perez, Carlos A; Miller, Christopher J",Cancer,373,1

However, there is limited information on risk factors and interventions that improve the primary prevention and management of T2DM in rural areas. To synthesize current knowledge on T2DM in rural areas and to guide healthcare providers and policy makers, we reviewed five scientific databases and the grey literature over the last decade (2010-2020). We described classification systems for rurality and the T2DM burden based on rurality and region (West, South, Midwest, and Northeast). We highlighted risk factors for T2DM in rural compared to urban areas, and summarized interventions to screen and manage T2DM based on opportunistic screening, T2DM self-management, community-based initiatives, as well as interventions targeting comorbidities and T2DM. Several studies identified the co-existence of T2DM and depression/psychological symptoms, which could reduce adherence to non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management of T2DM. We highlighted the role of technology in education and counselling of patients with geographic and financial barriers to accessing care, which is exacerbated by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease-19 pandemic. We identified knowledge gaps and next steps in improving T2DM care in rural areas.

However, defining the transcriptomic signatures of disease is challenging because logistic, technical, and cost factors limit the size and representativeness of samples in clinical studies. These limitations lead to a poor performance of signatures when applied to new datasets. Although the study focuses on infection, the central hypothesis of the work is the generalization of sets of signatures across diseases. We use a machine learning approach to identify common elements in datasets and then test empirically whether they are informative about a second dataset from a disease or process distinct from the original dataset. We identify sets of genes, which we name transfer signatures, that are predictive across diverse datasets and/or species (e.g., rhesus to humans). We demonstrate the usefulness of transfer signatures in two use cases: the progression of latent to active tuberculosis and the severity of COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 infection. This indicates that transfer signatures can be deployed in settings that lack disease-specific biomarkers. The broad significance of our work lies in the concept that a small set of archetypal human immunophenotypes, captured by transfer signatures, can explain a larger set of responses to diverse diseases.","di Iulio, Julia; Bartha, Istvan; Spreafico, Roberto; Virgin, Herbert W; Telenti, Amalio",Proc.

Acral lesions on hands and feet, closely resembling chilblains, have been reported in association with COVID-19, which are nonspecific. These acro-ischemic painful lesions have been described mainly in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic pediatric COVID-19 positive patients, without a precise patho-genetic mechanism.COVID-19-induced chilblains may portend an indolent course and a good outcome. In young patients, the IFN-1 response induces microangiopathic changes and produces a chilblain lupus erythematosus-like eruption with vasculitic neuro-pathic pain features. Objectives: This paper presented a case series of pediatric patients with COVID-19-related skin lesions and neuropathic-like pain. Methods: Clinical outcomes were collected from 11 patients diagnosed with painful erythematous skin lesions with neuropathic-like pain and positive IgG for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results: It is a mildly symptomatic condition not related to severe pain rates, and it is treated with paracetamol due to the transitory nature of the problem, which provides good results. Conclusions: A particular point of interest is skin lesion manifestation as a further indirect sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to the initial manifestation of chilblains in pauci-symptomatic pediatric patients, they need to be immediately tested and isolated. Chilblains can be considered a clinical clue to suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection and help in early diagnosis, patient triage, and infection control.","Papa, A.; Salzano, A. M.; Di Dato, M. T.; Bianco, G.

METHODS: PET-CT utilization between 1 January 2020 and 15 June 2020 at a tertiary academic center was assessed using change-point-detection (CPD) analysis. COVID-19 epidemiologic trend was obtained from Connecticut Department of Public Health records. Demographic and oncologic data were gathered from electronic medical records and PET-CT scans by four reviewers in consensus. RESULTS: A total of 1685 cases were reviewed. CPD analysis identified five distinct phases of PET-CT utilization during COVID-19, with a sharp decline and a gradual recovery. There was a 62.5% decline in case volumes at the nadir. These changes correlated with COVID-19 epidemiologic changes in the state of Connecticut, with a negative correlation between COVID-19 cases and PET-CT utilization (&#964; = -0.54; P value < 0.001). Statistically significant differences in age, race, cancer type and current and prior scan positivity were observed in these five phases. A greater percentage of young patients and minorities were scanned during the pandemic relative to baseline. PET/CT scanning was less impacted for hematologic malignancies than for solid cancers, with less profound decline and better recovery. DISCUSSION: PET-CT cancer imaging was vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic at our institution. Epidemiologic, demographic and oncologic factors affected PET-CT utilization.","Adin, Mehmet Emin; Uazeno, Haruka; Isufi, Edvin; Pang, Yulei; Zucconi, William; Saperstein, Lawrence; Pucar, Darko",Nucl. med. commun,373,1

Its inflammatory characteristics are incompletely understood.Objectives: To define the cytokine profile of COVID-19 and to identify evidence of immunometabolic alterations in those with severe illness.Methods: Levels of IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and sTNFR1 (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) were assessed in plasma from healthy volunteers, hospitalized but stable patients with COVID-19 (COVIDstable patients), patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission (COVIDICU patients), and patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU support (CAPICU patients). Immunometabolic markers were measured in circulating neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19. The acute phase response of AAT (alpha-1 antitrypsin) to COVID-19 was also evaluated.Measurements and Main Results: IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, and sTNFR1 were all increased in patients with COVID-19. COVIDICU patients could be clearly differentiated from COVIDstable patients, and demonstrated higher levels of IL-1ß, IL-6, and sTNFR1 but lower IL-10 than CAPICU patients. COVID-19 neutrophils displayed altered immunometabolism, with increased cytosolic PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), phosphorylated PKM2, HIF-1&#945; (hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945;), and lactate. The production and sialylation of AAT increased in COVID-19, but this antiinflammatory response was overwhelmed in severe illness, with the IL-6:AAT ratio markedly higher in patients requiring ICU admission (P < 0.0001). In critically unwell patients with COVID-19, increases in IL-6:AAT predicted prolonged ICU stay and mortality, whereas improvement in IL-6:AAT was associated with clinical resolution (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: The COVID-19 cytokinemia is distinct from that of other types of pneumonia, leading to organ failure and ICU need. Neutrophils undergo immunometabolic reprogramming in severe COVID-19 illness. Cytokine ratios may predict outcomes in this population.","McElvaney, Oliver J; McEvoy, Natalie L; McElvaney, Oisín F; Carroll, Tomás P; Murphy, Mark P; Dunlea, Danielle M; Ní Choileáin, Orna; Clarke, Jennifer; O039,; Connor, Eoin; Hogan, Grace; Ryan, Daniel; Sulaiman, Imran; Gunaratnam, Cedric; Branagan, Peter; Brien, Michael E; Morgan, Ross K; Costello, Richard W; Hurley, Killian; Walsh, Seán; de Barra, Eoghan; McNally, Cora; McConkey, Samuel; Boland, Fiona; Galvin, Sinead; Kiernan, Fiona; Rourke, James; Dwyer, Rory; Power, Michael; Geoghegan, Pierce; Larkin, Caroline; Leary, Ruth Aoibheann; Freeman, James; Gaffney, Alan; Marsh, Brian; Curley, Gerard F; McElvaney, Noel G",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,373,6

Also acute appendicitis decreased. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the change in volume and clinical presentation of patients with acute appendicitis during pandemic and the variation in treatment. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients admitted in 11 Italian hospital for acute appendicitis during the lockdown period (March-April 2020) compared with the same period of the previous 2 years (2018-2019). The number and the rate of complicated and non-complicated acute appendicitis were recorded and compared between the two study periods; non-operative vs operative treatment and negative appendectomy rate were also recorded. RESULTS: The study included 532 patients, 112 in the study period and 420 in the control period; Hospital admission for acute appendicitis dropped by 46% (OR 0.516 95% CI 0.411-0.648 p < 0.001) during the 2020 lockdown. The number of complicated acute appendicitis did not change (- 18%, OR 0.763 95% CI 0.517-1.124 p = 0.1719), whereas the number of non-complicated acute appendicitis significantly decreased (- 56%, OR 0.424 95% CI 0.319-0.564 p < 0.001). Non-operative treatment rate remained similar (12.1% vs. 11.6% p = 0.434). The negative appendectomy rate also significantly decreased (6.1% vs. 17.3%, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a significant reduction of both admissions for non-complicated acute appendicitis and negative appendectomy rate during the pandemic period.

Even with our growing understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of music, the answer to this question remains unclear. One method for conceiving possible representations is to use artificial neural networks, which can provide biologically plausible models of cognition. One could train networks to solve musical problems, and then study how these networks encode musical properties. However, researchers rarely examine network structure in detail because networks are difficult to interpret, and because many assume that networks capture informal or subsymbolic properties. Here we report very high correlations between network connection weights and discrete Fourier phase spaces used to represent musical sets. This is remarkable because there is no clear mathematical relationship between network learning rules and discrete Fourier analysis. That networks discover Fourier phase spaces indicates that these spaces have an important role to play outside of formal music theory.

The main routes of transmission are reported to be person-to-person, by respiratory droplets and to a lesser degree, by fomites. Concerns have been raised on the possibility of transmission via food and food packaging and whether the virus poses a risk to food safety. The current contribution provides an exposé of updated literature and reports applicable to various components of food safety and its linkage to SARS-CoV-2. The article focuses on SARS-CoV-2 survival in food, on food contact materials and food packaging, and its categorization as a foodborne vs. respiratory virus, the possibility of fecal-oral transmission and the likelihood of infection via the gastro-intestinal system. The survival and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in food through thermal and non-thermal inactivation methods as well as the survival and inactivation on inanimate surfaces and effective disinfection of food contact surfaces, are discussed. Ultimately, the article endeavors to add to the body of knowledge pertaining to the role of SARS-CoV-2 in food safety and thereby contribute to an agile and robust fraternity that is equipped to absorb and weather the ongoing effects of the pandemic on the food sector.","Anelich, Lucia E C M; Lues, Ryk; Farber, Jeffrey M; Parreira, Valeria R",Front Nutr,373,26

We argue the enormous benefit Africa derived from globalization, especially, during the COVID-19 pandemic makes it imperative for the African Union to rethink its globalization strategy, as well as mitigate African economies from the vulnerability of the pandemic. We argue that the characteristics of African economies such as the dominance of low-skilled labour force, informally employed workers that do not have the option of working remotely, digital divide due to poor internet penetration, urban and rural structures that promotes the spread of a virus, and breakdown of critical global supply chain may have accounted for the problem.

In e-cigarettes, tobacco combustion is replaced by e-liquid heating, leading some manufacturers to propose that e-cigarettes have less harmful respiratory effects than tobacco consumption. Other innovative features such as the adjustment of nicotine content and the choice of pleasant flavours have won over many users. Nevertheless, the safety of e-cigarette consumption and its potential as a smoking cessation method remain controversial due to limited evidence. Moreover, it has been reported that the heating process itself can lead to the formation of new decomposition compounds of questionable toxicity. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have been performed to better understand the impact of these new inhalable compounds on human health. Results of toxicological analyses suggest that e-cigarettes can be safer than conventional cigarettes, although harmful effects from short-term e-cigarette use have been described.

Few studies have explored the risk factors for the recovery time of patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to explore risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in a hospital in Wuhan by March 30, 2020, were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data from COVID-19 patients on hospital admission were extracted and were compared between the two groups, defined as short- and long-term hospitalization, respectively according to the median hospitalization time. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were performed to identify risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Results: A total of 125 discharged patients with COVID-19 were reviewed, including 123 general patients and two severe patients. The median hospitalization time was 13.0 days (IQR 10.0–17.0). Among them, 66 patients were discharged &lt;14 days (short-term group) and 59 patients were discharged ≥14 days (long-term group). Compared with the short-term group, patients in the long-term group had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (P = 0.000), troponin I (P = 0.002), myoglobin (P = 0.037), aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.005), lactic dehydrogenase (P = 0.000), prothrombin time (P = 0.030), fibrinogen (P = 0.000), and D-dimer (P = 0.006), but had significantly lower levels of lymphocyte count (P = 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.017), albumin (P = 0.001), and calcium (P = 0.000). Additionally, the incidences of hypocalcemia (P = 0.001), hyponatremia (P = 0.021), hypochloremia (P = 0.019), and bilateral pneumonia (P = 0.000) in the long-term group were significantly higher than those in the short-term group. Multivariable regression showed that hypocalcemia (P = 0.007, OR 3.313, 95% CI 1.392–7.886), hypochloremia (P = 0.029, OR 2.663, 95% CI 1.104–6.621), and bilateral pneumonia (P = 0.009, OR 5.907, 95% CI 1.073–32.521) were independent risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, a ROC curve where the area under the ROC was 0.766 for retained variables is presented. Conclusions: Hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and bilateral pneumonia on hospital admission were independent risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.

In this work it was aimed to assess ventilation conditions (carbon dioxide, CO2) and suspended particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10 and UFP) levels in 19 classrooms - including preschool, primary and secondary education - located in the metropolitan area of Ciudad Real, Central-Southern Spain, during the school's reopening (from September 30th until October 27th, 2020) after about 7 months of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. The classrooms that presented the worst indoor environmental conditions, according to the highest peak of concentration obtained, were particularly explored to identify the possible influencing factors and respective opportunities for improvement. Briefly, findings suggested that although ventilation promoted through opening windows and doors according to official recommendations is guaranteeing adequate ventilation conditions in most of the studied classrooms, thus minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission, a total of 5 (26%) surveyed classrooms were found to exceed the recommended CO2 concentration limit value (700 ppm). In general, preschool rooms were the educational environments that registered better ventilation conditions, while secondary classrooms exhibited the highest peak and average CO2 concentrations. In turn, for PM2.5, PM10 and UFP, the concentrations assessed in preschools were, on average about 2-fold greater than the levels obtained in both primary and secondary classrooms. In fact, the indoor PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations substantially exceeded the recommended limits of 8hr-exposure, established by WHO, in 63% and 32% of the surveyed classrooms, respectively. Overall, it is expected that the findings presented in this study will assist the establishment of evidence-based measures (namely based on ensuring proper ventilation rates and air filtration) to mitigate preventable environmental harm in public school buildings, mainly at local and national levels.","Villanueva, Florentina; Notario, Alberto; Cabañas, Beatriz; Martín, Pilar; Salgado, Sagrario; Gabriel, Marta Fonseca",Environ Res,373,22

Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. Methods: Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. Results: We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27*10e -4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69*10e -4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. Conclusions: In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers. Our findings evidence the difficulty of establishing reliable predictive models for the episodic and rapidly evolving incidence of infections such as has characterized the SARS CoV2 pandemic.","de la Matta, M; Delgado-Sánchez, J M; Gutiérrez, G M; López Romero, J L; Del Mar Martínez Gómez, M; Domínguez Blanco, A",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,373,20

In this context, the objectives of the current work were to 1) measure the ability of a triage-based management strategy to limit patient admission and 2) evaluate the success rate of both on-site and remote emergency management regarding symptom relief and pain control over a 1-mo period. We included all patients contacting the dental medicine department for an emergency consultation during the lockdown, between April 1 and April 30, 2020 (N = 570). Following a telephone consultation and based on preestablished admission guidelines, a decision was made at baseline (T0) to either admit the patient for treatment or perform remote management by providing advice and/or drug prescription. Patients were then followed up systematically at 1 wk and 1 mo. Management failure was defined as the need for emergency admission for patients managed remotely since T0 and for new emergency admission for those admitted at T0. The global follow-up rate of patients with a complete data set was 91.4% (N = 521). Of included patients, 49.3% could be managed without admission for emergency reasons for 1 mo. The proportion of successful management was 71.8% and 90.2% at 1 mo for remote and on-site management, respectively. To conclude, the proposed triage-based emergency management strategy with systematic follow-up was a good compromise between limiting patient admission and ensuring effective symptom relief and pain control. The strategy can be useful in situations where regulation of the emergency patient flow is required.","Beauquis, J; Petit, A E; Michaux, V; Sagué, V; Henrard, S; Leprince, J G",J Dent Res,373,16

These models can estimate the value of skills for skill-based compensation systems. They can be used by employers to determine how much to compensate different combinations of skills and by employees to estimate what they should be paid. Finally, governments can use the models to support the development and analysis of labor policies. We collect and integrate official U.S. Government data on 35 general job skills with the annual wage data for over 900 standard occupations. The skills data is then used as inputs to train an artificial intelligence (Al) neural network (NN) models. The resulting NN models train to above 70 percent accuracy in predicting annual wage levels based on the combination and levels of 35 different skills. This research makes use of authoritative U.S. Government data in new ways that can be used to better understand the connections between general skills and their relationships to wages.

A value framework was constructed via document reviews and stakeholder consultations. Probability of Success (PoS) data was obtained for 16 platform projects through expert assessments and stakeholder portfolio preferences via a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). The structure of preferences and the uncertainties in project PoS suggested a non-linear, stochastic value maximization problem. A simulation-optimization algorithm was employed, identifying optimal portfolios under different budget constraints. Stochastic dominance of the optimization solution was tested via mean-variance and mean-Gini statistics, and its robustness via rank probability analysis in a Monte Carlo simulation. Project PoS estimates were low and substantially overlapping. The DCE identified decreasing rates of return to investing in single platform types. Optimal portfolio solutions reflected this non-linearity of platform preferences along an efficiency frontier and diverged from a model simply ranking projects by PoS-to-Cost, despite significant revisions to project PoS estimates during the review process in relation to the conduct of the DCE. Large confidence intervals associated with optimization solutions suggested significant uncertainty in portfolio valuations. Mean-variance and Mean-Gini tests suggested optimal portfolios with higher expected values were also accompanied by higher risks of not achieving those values despite stochastic dominance of the optimal portfolio solution under the decision maker's budget constraint. This portfolio was also the highest ranked portfolio in the simulation; though having only a 54% probability of being preferred to the second-ranked portfolio. The analysis illustrates how optimization modelling can help health R&D decision makers identify optimal portfolios in the face of significant decision uncertainty involving portfolio trade-offs. However, in light of such extreme uncertainty, further due diligence and ongoing updating of performance is needed on highly risky projects as well as data on decision makers' portfolio risk attitude before PDA can conclude about optimal and robust solutions.","Gouglas, Dimitrios; Marsh, Kevin",PLoS One,373,18

Objectives: To explore the early clinical and computed tomography (CT) characteristics of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients to improve the diagnostic level of this contagious respiratory disease. Methods: An analysis retrospectively was implemented on the radiological features and clinical characteristics of 12 patients with COVID-19 who had undergone chest CT scanning in the designated hospital from Jan 23, 2020, to Feb 18, 2020. The clinical data on general information, epidemiological, cardinal symptoms, blood test, and CT imaging characteristics were obtained. Results: According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into two groups: mild (2 cases), and ordinary type (10 cases). The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were fever (9/12) and cough (8/12) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. The blood test of the patients showed that most of the white blood cell count was normal (10/12), decreased lymphocyte count (6/12), and increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (5/12). In the early stage of COVID-19, the chest CT images showed patchy mixed ground-glass opacity (GGO) (8/12), mainly distributed in the periphery and posterior part of both lungs. The internal density of image lesion area was uneven, and lesions primarily manifested as ""crazy-paving pattern"" (8/12), with grid-like, interlobular septal thickening, thickened bronchovascular bundle and air bronchus sign and multiple fibrosis. A few cases showed pulmonary atelectasis (1/12), bilateral pleural effusion (1/12), no mediastinal or bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia. The chest CT images may be helpful for the early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia.","Xia, Xianwu; Sheng, Liang; Yang, Tiejun; Zhang, Guobing; Ding, Li; Shen, Jianmin; Feng, Jihong",Iran.

Queensland has only had 1,067 cases as of June 30, 2020, of which 78% have been overseas acquired. Australia and Queensland acted early to address COVID-19 by putting in place a range of strategies including travel bans (international and domestic), isolation measures, testing regimes, advice to business, economic support, and research funding. Agriculture was designated an essential business and as such has continued operating throughout the pandemic. They have however had to develop and implement COVID plans to keep workers safe. To help agricultural business establish plans information was developed by Safe Work Australia, National Farmers Federation and the Queensland Department of Workplace Health and Safety. Workforce issues were identified early, particularly seasonal workers (those who travel from their usual place of residence to another place to work). The Queensland Government enacted a directive about how seasonal workers were to be managed and also developed a guide specifically for horticulture to help manage their COVID-19 response. We provide two case studies demonstrating how agriculture has responded to COVID-19. Agriculture has successfully, in Queensland, adapted quickly to the changing work conditions due to COVID-19. This is due to all levels of government coming together with industry to find solutions. Some changes have had wider benefits such as improved sanitation, better communication and a greater recognition of seasonal worker needs.

We aimed to evaluate the change in body weight and metabolic control in type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic healthy subjects during the prolonged lockdown period. METHODS: Diabetic (n = 85), and age-and sex-matched non-diabetic subjects (n = 55) were included in this prospective study. Body mass index and metabolic parameters were compared between before and 6th months of lockdown. Changes in values were evaluated using the difference before and after lockdown. RESULTS: Age (54.81 ± 10.53 vs. 52.61 ± 4.88 years), gender (female, 68.2% vs. 56.4%) and, BMI (33.44 ± 6.48 vs. 31.63 ± 3.57 kg/m2) were similar between groups (p > 0.05). Before and after lockdown, BMI increased both in non-diabetic (0.54 ± 0.95 kg) and diabetic groups (1.91 ± 5.48 kg) (p > 0.05). Increase in HbA1c was more in diabetic than in non-diabetic groups (0.71 ± 1.35 vs. 0.02 ± 0.19%, p = 0.002). Glucose, LDL-C, and TG increased in diabetic (39.69 ± 74.69, 7.60 ± 34.33, and 58.21 ± 133.54 mg/dl, p < 0.05) whereas non significantly decreased in non-diabetic group (-0.51 ± 4.40, -3.52 ± 14.53, and -6.47 ± 41.77 mg/dl, respectively. After adjusting BMI, increase in blood glucose (p = 0.021), HbA1c (p = 0.018), and TG (p = 0.041) levels were more in diabetic than non-diabetic group. Duration of diabetes was an independent predictor of the change in HbA1c (OR: 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8, p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Body weight gain was observed in type 2 diabetic patients and healthy subjects.

Social distancing is the most effective preventive measure to reduce the risk of infection. Nonetheless, the necessity to frequently reach the dialysis center and the inherent social gathering both impede social distancing and also self-quarantine for infected individuals. A baseline hyperinflammatory state driven by factors such as the retention of uremic toxins afflicts these patients. Concomitantly, a condition of relative immunosuppression is also attributed to similar factors. The use of high-flux (HF) dialyzers for HD is the standard of care. However, with HF membranes, the removal of large middle molecules is scant. Medium cutoff (MCO) dialyzers are a new class of membranes that allow substantial removal of large middle molecules with negligible albumin losses. Recent trials confirmed long-term safety and long-term sustained reduction in the concentration of large uremic toxins with MCO dialyzers. Herein, we discuss the rationale for applying MCO membranes in COVID-19 patients and its possible immunoadjuvant effects that could mitigate the burden of COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients. We also discuss the direct cytopathic effect of the virus on renal tissue and extracorporeal blood purification techniques that can prevent kidney damage or reduce acute kidney injury progression.","Ronco, Claudio; Reis, Thiago; Cozzolino, Mario",Nephron,373,24

The characteristics of multicentric lesions has been poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for multicentric lesions, including specific HPV genotypes. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed involving patients histologically diagnosed with multicentric lesions between January 2018 and October 2019. Controls were patients histologically diagnosed with single cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and admitted during the same period. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to assess the risk factors for multicentric lesions. RESULTS: Of 307 patients with multicentric lesions, the median age was 50 years (interquartile range: 43-55.5), and they were older than patients with single CIN (median age: 43 years, interquartile range: 36-50). In the multicentric lesion group, the proportions of cytologic abnormalities, HPV positivity, and multiple HPV infections were 68.9, 97.0, and 36.5%, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, menopause, a history of malignant tumors beyond the lower genital tract and multiple HPV infections were associated with the incidence of multicentric lesions (Odd ratio (OR) = 3.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24-4.41; OR = 9.58, 95% CI 1.02-89.84; OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.10). The common HPV genotypes were HPV16, HPV53, HPV58, HPV52, HPV51, HPV56 and HPV18 in patients with multicentric lesions. The proportion of HPV16 infection was higher in high-grade lesions group than that in low-grade lesions group (OR = 2.54, 95% CI 1.34-4.83). The OR for multicentric lesions, adjusted for menopause, smoking, gravidity, parity, a history of malignant tumor beyond the lower genital tract and multiple HPV infection, was 1.97 (95% CI 1.04-3.75) in patients with HPV51 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Multicentric lesions were associated with menopause, a history of malignant tumors and multiple HPV infections. HPV16 was the most common genotype, especially in high grade multicentric lesions and HPV51 infection was found to be a risk factor for detecting multicentric lesions.","Zhang, Jing; Liu, Guangcong; Cui, Xiaoli; Yu, Huihui; Wang, Danbo",BMC Infect Dis,373,32

Nevertheless, in the light of existing literature, the effectiveness of conventional coagulation on microplastics removal is insufficient. Hence, enhanced coagulation is worth being explored. This study investigated the improving performance of anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA), and activated silicic acid (ASA) when using poly­aluminum chloride (PAC) to remove polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics. The experimental results showed that ASA had the highest removal efficiency (54.70%) under conventional dosage, while PAM achieved the best removal effect (91.45%) at high dosage. Mechanism of coagulation was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the results illustrated that when only PAC existed or the dosage of coagulant aids was low, double layer compression was the main principle. The increase of coagulant aids dosage improved the effect of adsorption and sweep flocculation significantly. Moreover, jar tests carried in different conditions demonstrated that the current coagulation systems were highly adaptable.","Zhang, Yujian; Zhou, Guanyu; Yue, Jiapeng; Xing, Xinyi; Yang, Zhiwei; Wang, Xinyu; Wang, Qingguo; Zhang, Jing",Sci Total Environ,373,1

To overcome the challenges facing conventional cancer therapies, newly developed methods are being investigated. Significant levels of specificity, remarkable accumulation at the tumor site, limited side effects, and minimal off-target effects enable the newly synthesized nanoparticles (NPs) to become the preferred drug delivery method in anticancer therapeutic approaches. According to the literature, CD73 has a pivotal role in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, CD73 has attracted considerable attention among scientists to target this molecule. Accordingly, FDA approved CDK inhibitors such as Dinaciclib that blocks CDK1, 2, 5, and 9, and exhibits significant anticancer activity. So in this study, we intended to simultaneously suppress CD73 and CDKs in cancer cells by using the folic acid (FA)-conjugated chitosan-lactate (CL) NPs loaded with anti-CD73 siRNA and Dinaciclib to control tumor progression and metastasis. The results showed that NPs could effectively transfect cancer cells in a FA receptor-dependent manner leading to suppression of proliferation, survival, migration, and metastatic potential. Moreover, the treatment of tumor-bearing mice with this combination strategy robustly inhibited tumor growth and enhanced survival time in mice. These findings imply the high potential of FA-CL NPs loaded with anti-CD73 siRNA and Dinaciclib for use in cancer treatment shortly.","Hallaj, Shahin; Asl, Sima Heydarzadeh; Alian, Fatemeh; Farshid, Sajjad; Eshaghi, Farzaneh Sadat; Namdar, Afshin; Atyabi, Fatemeh; Masjedi, Ali; Hallaj, Tooba; Ghorbani, Anahita; Ghalamfarsa, Ghasem; Sojoodi, Mozhdeh; Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad",Life Sci,373,15

However, the profile of psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 patients has been understudied. We performed a meta-analysis of studies assessing psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS patients and survivors by using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), an instrument covering a wide spectrum of psychiatric symptoms. Studies reporting SCL-90-R subscale scores among patients with and survivors of COVID-19 and SARS were retrieved from major English and Chinese literature databases. Patients' pooled SCL-90-R subscale scores were compared to the Chinese normative SCL-90-R data, and Cohen's d values were calculated to indicate the severity of psychiatric symptoms. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The search yielded 25 Chinese studies with 1675 acute COVID-19 and 964 acute SARS patients, 30 COVID-19 and 552 SARS survivors during very early recovery (up to 1 month since discharge), 291 SARS survivors during early recovery (1-6 months after discharge), and 48 SARS survivors during late recovery (12 months after discharge). None of the included studies were rated as good quality. The ten SCL-90-R-defined psychiatric symptoms, which were of medium-to-severe severity (d = 0.68-3.01), were all exhibited in acute COVID-19 patients, and the severity of these symptoms decreased to mild-to-medium during very early recovery (d = 0.17-0.73). SARS patients presented eight psychiatric symptoms with mild-to-severe severity during the acute stage (d =0.43-1.88), and thereafter, the severity of symptoms decreased over the follow-up period. However, somatization (d = 0.30) and anxiety (d = 0.28) remained at mild levels during late recovery. A wide variety of severe psychiatric symptoms have been reported by acute COVID-19 patients, and these symptoms, despite decreasing in severity, persist in very early recovery. The changing trajectory observed with SARS suggests that psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 may persist for a long time after discharge, and therefore, periodic monitoring of psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial support, and psychiatric treatment (when necessary) may be necessary for COVID-19 patients from the acute to convalescent stages.","Xie, Qin; Liu, Xiao-Bo; Xu, Yan-Min; Zhong, Bao-Liang",Transl Psychiatry,373,30

Specifically, viruses learned to usurp liquidâliquid phase separation (LLPS), a newly exploited mechanism, used by the cell to concentrate enzymes to accelerate and confine a wide variety of cellular processes. LLPS gives rise to actual membraneless organelles (MLOs), which do not only increase reaction rates, but also act as a filter to select molecules to be retained or to be excluded from the liquid droplet. This is exactly what seems to happen with the condensation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to favor the packaging of intact viral genomes, excluding viral subgenomic or host cellular RNAs. Another older pandemic virus, HIV-1, also takes advantage of LLPS in the host cell during the viral cycle. Recent discoveries highlighted that HIV-1 RNA genome condensates in nuclear MLOs accompanied by specific host and viral proteins, breaking the dogma of retroviruses that limited viral synthesis exclusively to the cytoplasmic compartment. Intriguing fundamental properties of viral/host LLPS remain still unclear. Future studies will contribute to deeply understanding the role of pathogen-induced MLOs in the epidemic invasion of pandemic viruses.","Scoca, Viviana; Di Nunzio, Francesca",J. mol. cell biol.

While SARS-CoV-2 genes and hence its codons are presumably well optimized for mammalian protein translation, they have not been sequence optimized for nuclear expression. The cDNA of the Spike protein harbors over a hundred predicted splice sites and produces mostly aberrant mRNA transcripts when expressed in the nucleus. While different codon optimization strategies increase the proportion of full-length mRNA, they do not directly address the underlying splicing issue with commonly detected cryptic splicing events hindering the full expression potential. Similar splicing characteristics were also observed in other transgenes. By inserting multiple short introns throughout different transgenes, significant improvement in expression was achieved, including >7-fold increase for Spike transgene. Provision of a more natural genomic landscape offers a novel way to achieve multi-fold improvement in transgene expression.","Tomberg, Kärt; Antunes, Liliana; Pan, YangYang; Hepkema, Jacob; Garyfallos, Dimitrios A; Mahfouz, Ahmed; Bradley, Allan",,373,10

DESIGN: Partly cross-sectional, partly longitudinal study. SUBJECTS: Patients' who had amputation of a limb due to long-standing, therapy-resistant CRPS-I, at the University Medical Centre Groningen, The Netherlands, between May 2000 and September 2015 (n = 53) were invited to participate. METHODS: Participants were interviewed in a semi-structured way regarding mobility, pain, recurrence of CRPS-I, quality of life, and prosthesis use. Those who reported recurrence of CRPS-I underwent physical examination. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (median age at time of amputation, 41.0 years; 40 women) participated. Longitudinal evaluation was possible in 17 participants. Thirty-seven participants (77%) reported an important improvement in mobility (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 63-87%). An important reduction in pain was reported by 35 participants (73%; 95% CI 59-83%). CRPS-I recurred in 4 of 47 participants (9%; 95% CI 3-20%), once in the residual limb and 3 times in another limb. Of the 35 participants fitted with a lower limb prosthesis, 24 were still using the prosthesis. Longitudinal evaluation showed no significant deteriorations. CONCLUSION: Amputation can be considered as a treatment for patients with long-standing, therapy-resistant CRPS-I. Amputation can increase mobility and reduce pain, thereby improving the quality of patients' lives. However, approximately one-quarter of participants reported deteriorations in intimacy and self-confidence after the amputation.","Geertzen, Jan H B; Scheper, Jelmer; Schrier, Ernst; Dijkstra, Pieter U",J. rehabil. med,373,5

Such feelings may have been increased by social distancing measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to investigate the effect of loneliness, social contact, and parent relationships on adolescent mental health during lockdown in the UK. Young people aged 11-16 years (n = 894) completed measures of loneliness, social contact, parent-adolescent relationships, and mental health difficulties during the first 11 weeks of lockdown and one-month later (n = 443). We examined cross-sectional associations and longitudinal relationships between loneliness, social contact, and parent relationships and subsequent mental health. Adolescents who reported higher loneliness had significantly higher symptoms of mental health difficulties during lockdown. We found that adolescents who had closer relationships with their parents reported significantly less severe symptoms of mental health difficulties and lower levels of loneliness. We also found that adolescents who spent more time texting others reported higher symptoms of mental health difficulties. Our hypothesis that loneliness would predict poorer mental health one month later was not supported. Time spent texting others at baseline was significantly associated with higher hyperactivity at follow-up, and closeness to parents was significantly associated with lower psychological distress at follow-up. We conclude that while loneliness was associated with greater mental health difficulties at baseline, it did not predict increased mental health difficulties one month later. Moreover, existing mental health problems significantly predicted later increase, thereby highlighting the importance of continuing support for vulnerable people.","Cooper, Kate; Hards, Emily; Moltrecht, Bettina; Reynolds, Shirley; Shum, Adrienne; McElroy, Eoin; Loades, Maria",J Affect Disord,373,24

This article reviewed the literature on IBRs, focussing on past policies and interventions, general characteristics, infrastructure and service access to inform an analysis of potential health risks from the existing literature to guide future research and policy-making. Research followed a qualitative approach to review IBR literature dating after 2004. Relevant publications were identified from bibliographic databases using Boolean search logic and by reviewing citations in and later citations of these publications. Relevant secondary sources were also included. The review evidenced that IBRs have received increasing policy, but limited research attention, and that health hazards have been particularly neglected. Although issues such as shared water and sanitation, inappropriate waste disposal, poor hygiene practices, high densities and poor quality structures have been referenced extensively - alluding to risks and health concerns - few studies have focussed directly on health, risk and vulnerability. The risk analysis completed based on the literature made potential risks explicit, exemplified by references to specific conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and the coronavirus pandemic, demonstrating pathogenic pathways, contamination and transmission risks conducive to poor health, infection and potential disaster. The review captured and updated the contemporary literature on IBRs, with the subsequent analysis providing a platform for future empirical research on health, infrastructure and IBRs to address potential risks towards positive change in future policies.","Lategan, Louis G; Erasmus, Shayne; Zietsman, Markus; Cilliers, Elizelle J; Wolf, Mario; Springer, Christian A",Jamba,373,16

While serious vaccine damage as a scientific fact is real yet statistically highly uncommon, emerging social and technological forces have amplified perceptions of risk for ""probable vaccine damage"", making it a widely shared intersubjective reality. METHODS: Using the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample interviewed in March 2019, we documented perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief configurations regarding vaccine effectiveness, safety, and usefulness, through exploratory cluster analysis. RESULTS: The public beliefs in significant vaccine risks are frequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider that vaccines are not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe that vaccines can overload or weaken the immune system and that they can cause the disease against which they protect, and almost one-half believe that vaccines can cause serious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: hesitant, confident, and trade-off clusters. The hesitant type (approx. 11% of EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the perception that vaccines are rather ineffective, affected by risks of probable vaccine damage, not well-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59%) is defined by beliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and the trade-off type (approx. 29%) combines beliefs that vaccines are effective, well-tested and useful, with perceptions of probable vaccine damage. The vaccine-confident and the trade-off types have similar vaccination histories, indicating the significant role of other factors besides beliefs in inducing behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of varying public beliefs in significant vaccine risks and the presence of a trade-off type of vaccination assessment indicate the social normality of beliefs in probable vaccine damage. Communication campaigns should take into account the social normality of the perceived risk of ""probable vaccine damage"" across various social types, and patterns of concomitant trust and mistrust in vaccination.","Vulpe, Simona-Nicoleta; Rughinis, Cosima",Vaccine,373,15

There is a need to assess their test performance relative to one another. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of a high complexity laboratory-developed rRT-PCR EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene with other tests: the Atila isothermal amplification assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), the Altona E and spike (S) multiplex, real-time RT-PCR, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N1 and N2 rRT-PCRs. STUDY DESIGN: A diagnostic comparison study was performed by testing nasopharyngeal samples from persons under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Assay performance was assessed by percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Positive percent agreement with the SHC EUA reference assay was 82.8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 65.0 to 92.9) for Atila, 86.7 % (95 % CI 69.7 to 95.3) for the Altona E and S targets, and 86.7 % (95 % CI 69.7 to 95.3) and 90.0 % (95 % CI 73.6 to 97.3), for the CDC N1 and N2 targets, respectively. All assays demonstrated 100 % negative percent agreement. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.86 to 0.92, indicating excellent agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Performance was comparable among the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification methods tested, with a limited number of discrepancies observed in specimens with low viral loads.","Bulterys, Philip L; Garamani, Natasha; Stevens, Bryan; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, ChunHong; Hogan, Catherine A; Zehnder, James; Pinsky, Benjamin A",J Clin Virol,373,24

The recent case of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust v MX, FX and X ([2020] EWHC 1958 (Fam), [21]-[23] and [58]) has highlighted the importance of patient/family representation at clinical ethics committee meetings. The court viewed these meetings as making decisions about such treatment. We argue that this misunderstands the role of ethics support, with treatment decisions remaining with the clinical team and those providing their consent. The considered review by clinical ethics committees of the moral issues surrounding complex treatment decisions is not a matter of determining a single ethical course of action. In this article, we consider current legal understandings of clinical ethics committees, explore current concepts of ethics support and suggest how they may evolve, considering the various mechanisms of the inclusion of patients and their representatives in ethics meetings which is not standard in the UK.","Brierley, Joe; Archard, David; Cave, Emma",J. med. ethics,373,1

METHODS: The study was conducted in 359 cognitively impaired patients who met the pathological criteria for AD (NIA-Reagan intermediate or high). The mean age at onset was 69.5 ± 8.8 years (range 37-95) and the mean duration of the symptoms was 10.5 ± 4.2 years. The association between symptoms duration and HS and TDP-43 was examined with logistic regression analyses controlling for age at death, atherosclerosis in the Circle of Willis (CW), cerebral infarcts, gender, baseline Mini Mental State Examination scores, APOE-4 allele, and presence of Lewy bodies (LB). RESULTS: HS was present in 18% (n = 64) and TDP-43 in 51.5% (n = 185) of the patients. HS and TDP-43 were more frequent in patients whose symptoms lasted more than 10 years. LBs were present in 72% of the patients with HS and in 64% of the patients with TDP-43. Age at onset was not associated with TDP-43 or HS. HS was associated with duration of symptoms and LB, TDP-43, and atherosclerosis in the CW. TDP-43 was associated with duration of symptoms, LB, and HS. INTERPRETATION: HS and TDP-43 are present in early and late onset AD. However, their presence is mainly driven by the duration of symptoms and the presence of LB. This suggests that HS and TDP-43 are part of the later neuropathological changes in AD.","Lopez, Oscar L; Kofler, Julia; Chang, YueFang; Berman, Sarah B; Becker, James T; Sweet, Robert A; Nadkarni, Neelesh; Patira, Riddhi; Kamboh, M Ilyas; Cohen, Ann D; Snitz, Beth E; Kuller, Lewis H; Klunk, William E",,373,24

At each intervention round, the administrator has only access -- simultaneous for the former, sequential for the latter -- to a fraction of the network nodes. This sequential aspect in the decision process offers a completely new perspective to the dynamic DP control, making this work the first to cast the dynamic control problem as a series of sequential selection problems. Through in-depth SIS epidemic simulations we compare the performance of our multi-round approach with other resource allocation strategies and several sequential selection algorithms on both generated, and real-data networks. The results provide evidence about the efficiency and applicability of the proposed framework for real-life problems.","Fekom, Mathilde; Vayatis, Nicolas; Kalogeratos, Argyris",,373,26

Research indicates that pretreatment psychological variables including patients' perceptions of their susceptibility to nausea, expectancies of treatment-related nausea and nausea history (i.e., motion sickness, morning sickness and baseline levels of nausea) may aid in predicting nausea severity during chemotherapy. However, this research is dated and limited in quantity. We investigated whether psychological variables could improve prediction of nausea severity to inform interventions targeting chemotherapy-induced nausea. METHODS: In this secondary analysis, a subgroup of women receiving chemotherapy (for the first time) for breast cancer completed pretreatment measures: perceived nausea susceptibility, nausea expectancies, nausea history and baseline nausea. They rated subsequent nausea severity across 4-days, during treatment and posttreatment in a self-report diary. Structural Equation Modelling was used to explore associations. RESULTS: Across the women (N = 481), perceived nausea susceptibility predicted subsequent nausea severity (ß = 0.16), but nausea expectancies did not (ß = 0.05). Nausea history variables demonstrated small-moderate associations with perceived susceptibility (ß = 0.21-0.32) and negligible-small associations with nausea expectancies (ß = 0.07-0.14). CONCLUSION: Perceived nausea susceptibility appears to capture patients' nausea history, to a degree, and is related to nausea severity during treatment. This is an important variable to include in pretreatment prediction of patients at risk of severe nausea.","Devlin, Elise J; Whitford, Hayley S; Peoples, Anita R; Morrow, Gary R; Katragadda, Sreedhar; Giguere, Jeffrey K; Naqvi, Bilal; Roscoe, Joseph",Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),373,6

However, it is known that petrochemical industries emit air pollutants, which have been related to different negative effects on mental health. In addition, many people around the world are being exposed to highly stressful situations deriving from the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns adopted by national and regional governments. The present study aims to analyse the possible differential effects on various psychological outcomes (stress, anxiety, depression and emotional regulation strategies) stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown experienced by individuals living near an important petrochemical complex and subjects living in other areas, nonexposed to the characteristic environmental pollutants emitted by these kinds of complex. The sample consisted of 1607 subjects who answered an ad hoc questionnaire on lockdown conditions, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The results indicate that people living closer to petrochemical complexes reported greater risk perception [K = 73.42, p < 0.001, with a medium size effect (Î·2 = 0.061)]. However, no significant relationship between psychological variables and proximity to the focus was detected when comparing people living near to or far away from a chemical/petrochemical complex. Regarding the adverse psychological effects of the first lockdown due to COVID-19 on the general population in Catalonia, we can conclude that the conditions included in this survey were mainly related to changes in the participants' impulsivity levels, with different total impulsivity scores being obtained if they had minors in their care (p<0.001), if they had lost their jobs, if they were working (p<0.001), if they were not telecommuting (p<0.001), if they went out to work (p<0.001) or if they established routines (p = 0.009). However, we can also be fairly certain that the economic effects are going to be worse than those initially detected in this study. More research will be necessary to corroborate our results.","Vicens, Paloma; Heredia, Luis; Bustamante, Edgar; Pérez, Yolanda; Domingo, José L; Torrente, Margarita",PLoS One,373,16

However, soon it became clear that long term predictions were extremely challenging to address. Moreover, it is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the evolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modeling of pandemic dynamics and a consistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed to describe the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the instantaneous reproductive ratio. We then introduce and use entropy-based metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and temporal evolution of a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of the outbreak is modeled by the master equation of a nonlinear Markov process for a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical interpretation. We also provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for calibration. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the system entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and transparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model. Applying the model to the Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19 data-sets, we discover a significant difference in the absolute change of entropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the instantaneous reproductive ratio.","Wang, Ziqi; Broccardo, Marco; Mignan, Arnaud; Sornette, Didier",,373,33

Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the association of mandatory mask-wearing policies with behaviors associated with the transmission of COVID-19. Objective: To assess the association of mask wearing with face-touching behavior among the general population in public areas. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used videos recorded in public transportation stations, streets, and parks among the general population in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe (ie, England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy), and the US to analyze mask-wearing and face-touching behavior in public areas. Videos before the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded from January 2018 to October 2019, and those during the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded during February 2020 to March 2020 in China, Japan, and South Korea and during March 2020 in Western Europe and the US. Individuals who clearly displayed their face and face-touching behavior were included, and those whose behaviors were influenced by filming or public events were excluded. Exposures: Mandatory mask-wearing policies enacted at various time points in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe, and the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of individuals wearing masks and incidence of face touching. Results: This study included 4699 individuals before the COVID-19 pandemic and 2887 individuals during the pandemic. During the periods studied, mask wearing increased in all regions except the US, from 20 of 1745 individuals (1.1%) to 1090 of 1097 individuals (99.4%) in mainland China (P < .001), 44 of 1422 individuals (3.1%) to 346 of 893 individuals (38.7%) in Japan (P < .001), 6 of 717 individuals (0.8%) to 277 of 324 individuals (85.5% ) in South Korea (P < .001), 1 of 546 individuals (0.2%) to 6 of 379 individuals (1.6%) in Western Europe (P = .02), and 1 of 269 individuals (0.4%) to 4 of 194 individuals (2.1%) in the US (P = .17). Surgical masks were predominant in China (989 masks [89.1%]), and fabric masks were predominant in the other regions (Japan: 371 masks [95.1%]; South Korea: 240 masks [84.8%]; Western Europe: 6 masks [85.7%]; US: 5 masks [100%]). Face-touching behaviors decreased from before COVID-19 to during COVID-19 among individuals in China (72 incidences of 1745 observations [4.1%] to 12 incidences of 1097 observations [1.1%]; P < .001), South Korea (80 incidences of 717 observations [11.2%] to 7 incidences of 324 observations [2.2%]; P < .001), and Europe (62 incidences of 546 observations [11.4%] to 23 incidences of 379 observations [6.1%]; P = .01). Logistic regression found that mask wearing was associated with a reduction in face touching in China (odds ratio [OR], 3.91; 95% CI, 2.11-7.24) and South Korea (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 2.69-16.69) and of touching the nose, mouth, and eyes (China: OR, 8.60; 95% CI, 2.65-27.86; South Korea: OR, 29.27; 95% CI, 1.79-478.22). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that mandatory mask-wearing policies were associated with increased mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mask wearing was associated with reduced face-touching behavior, especially touching of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which may prevent contact transmission of COVID-19 among the general population in public areas.","Chen, Yong-Jian; Qin, Gang; Chen, Jie; Xu, Jian-Liang; Feng, Ding-Yun; Wu, Xiang-Yuan; Li, Xing",JAMA Netw Open,373,16

This study evaluates the effect of the shelter-in-place (SIP) mandate on glycemic metrics in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in Northern California, United States. METHODS: CGM and insulin pump metrics in youth 3-21 years old with T1D at an academic pediatric diabetes center were analyzed retrospectively. Data 2-4 months before (distant pre-SIP), 1 month before (immediate pre-SIP), 1 month after (immediate post-SIP), and 2-4 months after (distant post-SIP) the SIP mandate were compared using paired t-tests, linear regression, and longitudinal analysis using a mixed effects model. RESULTS: Participants (n=85) had reduced mean glucose (-10.3 ± 4.4 mg/dl, p = 0.009), standard deviation (SD) (-5.0 ± 1.3 mg/dl, p=0.003), glucose management indicator (GMI) (-0.2 ± 0.03%, p=0.004) and time above range (TAR) > 250 mg/dl (-3.5 ± 1.7%, p = 0.01), and increased time in range (TIR) (+4.7 ± 1.7%, p = 0.0025) between the distant pre-SIP and distant post-SIP periods. Relationships were maintained using a mixed effects model, when controlling for other demographic variables. There was improvement in SD, TAR 180-250 mg/dl, and TIR for participants with private insurance, but changes in the opposite direction for participants with public insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in CGM metrics in youth with T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that diabetes management can be maintained in the face of sudden changes to daily living. Youth with public insurance deserve more attention in research and clinical practice.","Abdulhussein, Fatema; Chesser, Hannah; Boscardin, W John; Wong, Jenise C; Gitelman, Stephen",Diabetes technol. ther,373,1

OBJECTIVES: To examine longitudinal trends in hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions across a tertiary care healthcare system. METHODS: We tracked acute cardiovascular hospitalizations between January 1st, 2019 and March 31st, 2020. We estimated daily hospitalization rates using negative binomial models. Temporal trends in hospitalization rates were compared across the first 3 months of 2020, with the first 3 months of 2019 as a reference. RESULTS: From January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, 6,083 patients experienced 7,187 hospitalizations for primary acute cardiovascular reasons. There was 43.4% (27.4% to 56.0%) fewer estimated daily hospitalizations in March 2020 as compared with March 2019 (P<0.001). The daily rate of hospitalizations did not change throughout 2019 (-0.01% per day [-0.04% to +0.02%], P=0.50), January 2020 (-0.5% per day [-1.6% to +0.5%], P=0.31), or February 2020 (+0.7% per day [-0.6% to +2.0%], P=0.27). There was significant daily decline in hospitalizations in March 2020 (-5.9% per day [-7.6% to -4.3%], P<0.001). Length of stay was shorter (4.8 [2.4,8.3] days vs. 6.0 [3.1,9.6] days; P=0.003) and in-hospital mortality was not significantly different (6.2% vs. 4.4%; P=0.30) in March 2020 compared with March 2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a marked decline in acute cardiovascular hospitalizations and patients who were admitted had shorter lengths of stay. These data substantiate concerns that acute care of cardiovascular conditions may be delayed, deferred, or abbreviated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bhatt, Ankeet S; Moscone, Alea; McElrath, Erin E; Varshney, Anubodh S; Claggett, Brian L; Bhatt, Deepak L; Januzzi, James L; Butler, Javed; Adler, Dale S; Solomon, Scott D; Vaduganathan, Muthiah",J.

In the field of aesthetic surgery, the self-imposed moratorium for all aesthetic surgery procedures recommended by most international scientific societies has been adopted by many surgeons worldwide and resulted in a huge socioeconomic impact for most private practices and clinics. An important question still unanswered in most countries is when and how should elective/aesthetic procedures be scheduled again and what kind of organizational changes are necessary to protect patients and healthcare workers when clinics and practices reopen. Defining manageable, evidence-based protocols for testing, surgical/procedural risk mitigation and clinical flow management/contamination management will be paramount for the safety of non-urgent surgical procedures. METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed research for all available publications on COVID-19 and surgery and COVID-19 and anesthesia. Articles and referenced literature describing possible procedural impact factors leading to exacerbation of the clinical evolution of COVID-19-positive patients were identified to perform risk stratification for elective surgery. Based on these impact factors, considerations for patient selection, choice of procedural complexity, duration of procedure, type of anesthesia, etc., are discussed in this article and translated into algorithms for surgical/anesthesia risk management and clinical management. Current recommendations and published protocols on contamination control, avoidance of cross-contamination and procedural patient flow are reviewed. A COVID-19 testing guideline protocol for patients planning to undergo elective aesthetic surgery is presented and recommendations are made regarding adaptation of current patient information/informed consent forms and patient health questionnaires. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 crisis has led to unprecedented challenges in the acute management of the crisis, and the wave only recently seems to flatten out in some countries. The adaptation of surgical and procedural steps for a risk-minimizing management of potential COVID-19-positive patients seeking to undergo elective aesthetic procedures in the wake of that wave will present the next big challenge for the aesthetic surgery community. We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients. New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed. We believe that only the continuous development and broad implementation of guidelines like the ones proposed in this paper will allow an early reintegration of all aesthetic procedures into the scope of surgical care currently performed and to prepare the elective surgical specialties better for a possible second wave of the pandemic.

We took this opportunity to create a virtual activity for a biochemistry course for undergraduate nursing students at Milwaukee School of Engineering. It is well understood that prolonged exposure to sunlight is one of the major causes of skin cancer due to mutations in the keratinocyte DNA. Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in the US. UV-B radiation in the region of 290-320 nm is absorbed by skin cells resulting in mutated DNA which can lead to cancer. We developed the virtual activity with a dual purpose in mind. First, the activity would enhance their learning experience about DNA mutations using a 3D-printed model showing the biochemical DNA damage which could lead to skin cancer. Second, the activity could increase general awareness among students about the dangers of UVB-radiation exposure and protection strategies by directly testing everyday products such as sunscreens. We randomly picked nine commercially available sunscreens with various SPF values and tested their ability to protect from UVB radiation. Testing for protection from UVB radiation was performed using an in-house created customized chamber equipped with a UVB light source emitting a single wavelength at 310 nm. A thin, even layer of sunscreen was applied on a thin clear plastic wrap and exposed to UVB light. The sunscreens? ability to block UVB radiation was quantitated compared to a control sample with no sunscreen.Further, using a 3D model of a DNA segment created by 3D printing at the Center for Biomolecular Modeling, we explained molecular-level changes. We created a two-part video. Part I narrates details of the sunscreen protection experiment. Part II explains the molecular details of DNA damage using 3D-printed model including (i) location of a broken A-T hydrogen bond (ii) location ofa T-T dimer and discussion of possible impact of the change in the DNA structure and (iii) explaining the formation of a ?kink? in the DNA strand as a result of the T-T photoproduct. The video will be accompanied by a student survey questionnaire on Canvas LMS. The goal of this study is to quantitatively test students? understanding of this biochemistry topic before and after watching the virtual activity. Further, it is our hope that the activity will also increase general awareness among nursing students about the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation exposure.","Paliwal, Vipin Nickel Anne-Marie Masoud Nazieh",The FASEB Journal,373,16

It has been described as the most severe global health disaster of modern times by the United Nations. No doubt such a major crisis influences what citizens think of different policies, and how they become politically active, not to mention, the forceful emotional experiences that the Covid-19 pandemic brings. This study evaluates how emotions affect support for policies related to restricting the spread of the virus and economic assistance, and how emotions affect intentions to engage politically. In an experiment (N = 1,072), we manipulated emotional reactions to threat by highlighting different aspects of the pandemic. Our findings show that different experimental treatments elicit different emotions, and that fear, anxiety, and anger are all related to policy support and political action intentions, but in different ways. Fear and anger predict support for restrictive policies to limit the spread of the virus, while anxiety predicts support for economic policies. Anger and anxiety, but not fear, increase intentions to engage politically. Hence, we find support for a mechanism where different aspects of the Covid-19 crisis evoke different emotional reactions, which in turn affects policy support and political actions differently.","Renström, Emma A.; Bäck, Hanna",Journal of Applied Social Psychology,373,1

Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a tool for surveillance and mitigation of potential viral outbreaks, circumventing biases introduced by clinical patient testing. Due to the situation urgency, protocols followed for isolating viral RNA from sewage were not adapted for such sample matrices. In parallel to their implementation for fast collection of data to sustain surveillance and mitigation decisions, molecular protocols need to be harmonized to deliver accurate, reproducible, and comparable analytical outputs. Here we studied analytical variabilities linked to viral RNA isolation methods from sewage. Three different influent wastewater volumes were used to assess the effect of filtered volumes (50, 100 or 500 mL) for capturing viral particles. Three different concentration strategies were tested by electronegative membranes, polyethersulfone membranes, and anion-exchange diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns. To compare the number of viral particles, different RNA isolation methods (column-based vs. magnetic beads) were compared. The effect of extra RNA purification steps and different RT-qPCR strategies (one step vs. two-step) were also evaluated. Results showed that the combination of 500 mL filtration volume through electronegative membranes and without multiple RNA purification steps (using column-based RNA purification) using two-step RT-qPCR avoided false negatives when basal viral load in sewage are present and yielded more consistent results during the surveillance done during the second-wave in Delft (The Hague area, The Netherlands). By paving the way for standardization of methods for the sampling, concentration and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses from sewage, these findings can help water and health surveillance authorities to use and trust results coming from wastewater based epidemiology studies in order to anticipate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

These functions are affected by the presence of beta-Amyloid (Aß) deposits, hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently demonstrated that exchanging functionally altered endogenous microglia with peripheral myeloid cells did not change Aß-burden in a mouse model mimicking aspects of AD at baseline, and only mildly reduced Aß plaques upon stimulation. To better characterize these different myeloid cell populations, we used long-term in vivo 2-photon microscopy to compare morphology and basic functional parameters of brain populating peripherally-derived myeloid cells and endogenous microglia. While peripherally-derived myeloid cells exhibited increased process movement in the non-diseased brain, the Aß rich environment in an AD-like mouse model, which induced an alteration of surveillance functions in endogenous microglia, also restricted functional characteristics and response to CNS injury of newly recruited peripherally-derived myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the Aß rich brain environment alters the functional characteristics of endogenous microglia as well as newly recruited peripheral myeloid cells, which has implications for the role of myeloid cells in disease and the utilization of these cells in Alzheimer's disease therapy.","Drost, Natalia; Houtman, Judith; Cseresnyés, Zoltán; Niesner, Raluca; Rinnenthal, Jan-Leo; Miller, Kelly R; Prokop, Stefan; Heppner, Frank L",Sci Rep,373,0

However, few models developed from single cohorts can perform consistently well at population level where diverse prognoses exist (such as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic). This study aims at tackling this challenge by synergising prediction models from the literature using ensemble learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we selected and reimplemented seven prediction models for COVID-19, which were derived from diverse cohorts and used different implementation techniques. A novel ensemble learning framework was proposed to synergise them for realising personalised predictions for individual patients. Four diverse international cohorts (2 from the UK and 2 from China; total N=5,394) were used to validate all eight models on discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Results showed that individual prediction models could perform well on some cohorts while poorly on others. Conversely, the ensemble model achieved the best performances consistently on all metrics quantifying discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. Performance disparities were observed in cohorts from the two countries: all models achieved better performances on the China cohorts. DISCUSSION: When individual models were learned from complementary cohorts, the synergised model will have the potential to achieve synergised performances. Results indicate that blood parameters and physiological measurements might have better predictive powers when collected early, which remains to be confirmed by further studies.

Cases of liver damage or dysfunction (mainly characterized by moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels) have been reported among patients with COVID-19. However, it is currently uncertain whether the COVID-19 related liver damage/dysfunction is due mainly to the viral infection by itself or other coexisting conditions, such as the use of potentially hepatotoxic medications and the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 are typical of older age and/or present with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. This is also the same profile for those at increased risk for unrecognized underlying liver disease, especially nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This could make them more susceptible to liver injury from the virus, medications used in supportive management, or hypoxia. So the aim of this review was to illustrate the clinical implications of COVID-19 on the liver in healthy and diseased states as well as the implications of common liver disorders on the outcome of COVID-19.","Amin, Mona",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,373,6

An abrupt ending of lockdown can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore, carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.","Kumar, Spandan; Sharma, Bhanu; Singh, Vikram",,373,17

Here, we model the risk of in-room airborne disease transmission via expiratory particle emission versus the average loudness of vocalization and for variable room ventilation rates. The model indicates that a 6-decibel reduction in average vocalization intensity yields a reduction in aerosol transmission probability equivalent to doubling the room ventilation rate.

Method: A 25-year-old male student was admitted to the emergency department with an acute bilateral visual loss and headaches, nausea, and cold sweats. A complete clinical and ophthalmologic examination was performed. Results: On ophthalmic examination, visual acuity (VA) was light perception in the right eye (RE) and no light perception in the left eye (LE). Pupillary examinations demonstrated dilated, non-reactive pupils. An arterial blood gas analysis showed systemic metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.23 and Gap anion elevated. Consequently, these results were enough to provide a substantial suspicion of methanol toxicity and start the treatment. 72 hours after, he confessed that he had been inhaling methanol-based solvent for eight years. Conclusions: Methanol-induced toxicity can cause a non-reversible toxic optic neuropathy. Blood acidemia with Gap anion elevated and a suspicious fundus ophthalmic examination allows a fast diagnosis. A quick treatment based on dialysis, intravenous ethanol, sodium bicarbonate, vitamin B12, and intravenous methylprednisolone slows the secondary intoxication damages.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, good visibility was commonplace and there exist many such accounts by reputable Orientalists such as Henry Colebrooke and Sir William Jones. These sightings invite two questions. Is a line of sight to the peak even possible from the location? Is the location close enough and the intensity of visible light sufficient for the peak to be seen? The present work explores both these aspects in the context of the Himalayan peaks. The effects of the curvature of the Earth and refraction on the perceived heights of several mountains in the eastern Himalayas are considered. The effects of Rayleigh scattering by the atmosphere on the visibility of these peaks are also considered as an extension of the work done by Weisskopf. Some historically significant details and a possible inaccuracy in an account by Sir William Jones are discussed. The approach is pedagogical and is not specialized to the eastern Himalayas, so it can be applied readily to other locations, for example, the Andes in South America.","Singh, Vijay A.; Singh, Arnav",American Journal of Physics,373,1

Limited studies have reported on family members' experiences and support needs. AIM: To explore the experiences and support needs of family members of ventilated COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: Exploratory, qualitative design, using in-depth individual telephone interviews, and analyzed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Ten family members of adult COVID-19 patients in the ICU. RESULT: Seven key themes represented family members' experiences: (a) reactions to the COVID-19 diagnosis, (b) COVID-19 as a destabilizing force on the family unit, (c) COVID-19's effects on bereavement outcomes, (d) desperately seeking information, (e) family member needs, (f) conflicting feelings about video calls, and (g) appreciation of care. Family members' feelings about the patient's diagnosis and how the virus was contracted exacerbated their stress and anxiety. They struggled to feel informed about care that they could not witness and had difficulty understanding information. Family members reported that video calls were unhelpful. While these experiences made them question the quality of care, they expressed their appreciation of the frontline healthcare providers taking care of their loved ones. CONCLUSION: The stress and uncertainty of family members of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were influenced by their inability to feel connected to the patient and informed about care. Healthcare providers should assess each individual family's burden and preferences, and this should include establishing structured, timely, and consistent communication regarding patient care during the pandemic including early referral to palliative care.","Chen, Chiahui; Wittenberg, Elaine; Sullivan, Suzanne S; Lorenz, Rebecca A; Chang, Yu-Ping",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,373,29

Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this experimental and cross-sectional study consisted of 52 people working in the communication sector. Data were collected using a questionnaire and the state anxiety inventory. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, variance analysis, Kruskal–Wallis, Mann–Whitney U and Tukey’s test. Findings: While the state anxiety scores of the workers working in the communication sector were 47.94 ± 4.90 before the training, they were found to be 43.98 ± 5.20 after the training. Research limitations/implications: As in every study, this study has some limitations. Although a homogeneous sample is tried to be formed since it only covers this group, it should be considered that there is a limitation in terms of generalizability. In addition, the fact that the knowledge score is not measured and the relationship between the knowledge score and the anxiety score is not evaluated should be considered as a limitation. Finally, it is also a limitation that the questionnaire form, which includes measurement tools, is applied online. It is thought that measuring errors can be minimized if questionnaires are applied face to face. Practical implications: The results of the study showed that the training given to the workers in the communication sector contributed positively to the reduction of anxiety levels. It is important to provide training and support to those with high anxiety levels. After providing effective protection for nurses/midwives under pandemic conditions and preventing their uncertainties, they can contribute to the reduction of anxiety levels by providing training to individuals who serve the society. It is recommended to plan health trainings for the anxiety of other sector workers serving the society and to focus on these groups. Thus, the effective protection of individuals and their service quality will increase and their anxiety may decrease. Originality/value: Informative support from nurses/midwives can make it easier to control anxiety arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are important in order to draw attention to the anxiety of other sector workers serving the society and the importance of informative roles of nurses. In order to reduce the anxiety levels of workers in different sectors, it is recommended to conduct more supportive training activities and to draw attention to the workers serving the society. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ucuk, S.; Yildirim, G.",Health Education,373,3

Although the early studies in China have illustrated that the representative symptoms of COVID-19 include (dry) cough, fever, headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal discomfort, dyspnea, and muscle pain, there is increasing evidence to suggest that olfactory and taste disorder are related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we conduct this study to review the present literature about the correlation between anosmia or dysgeusia and COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search in 2020 of the electronic journal databases, mainly PubMed or Web of Science, was performed using the keywords COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with hyposmia, anosmia, dysgeusia, olfactory disorder, or olfactory dysfunction. The country, study period, case number, inpatient or outpatient medical visit, evaluation method (subjective complaints of dysfunction or objective evaluation), and occurrence rate of olfactory or gustatory function were reviewed. RESULTS: Many studies reported that the recoverable olfactory or gustatory dysfunction may play an important role as the early clinical symptom of COVID-19. It is associated with better prognosis, although further investigation and validation should be carried out. CONCLUSION: Studies have shown that smell and taste disturbances may represent an early symptom of COVID-19 and healthcare professionals must be very vigilant when managing patients with these symptoms.

METHODS: This retrospective, observational, single-center-study recruited patients with a suspect of COVID-19 data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. RESULTS: A total of 566 patients with suspect COVID-19 infection were enrolled (280 were COVID-19+). The COVID-19 population was characterized with bilateral-pneumonia, a lower count of neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte, a lower neutrophil to lymphocyte-ratio (NLR). Lower of platelet count, d-dimer, troponin I, and serum calcium were in COVID-19 patients. The occurrence of COVID-19 diagnosis increased, independently of other variables, with pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.60; p < .001), neutrophil below normal range (OR: 4.15; p < .05), lactate dehydrogenase (OR: 2.09; p < .01) and sodium above normal range (OR: 2.34; p < .01). In patients with possible respiratory acute affections we found a higher neutrophil, higher monocyte, a higher NLR and a more elevation in d-dimer. In the Sepsis group showed higher level of white blood cell, C-reactive protein, d-dimer, and procalcitonin.

People with diabetes are generally more susceptible to infection as a result of altered immunity. People with diabetes have a worse prognosis from COVID-19 and there is evidence to suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may directly affect pancreatic function precipitating hyperglycaemic crises.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a potential threat to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Patients with the worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include older adults, polymorbid individuals, and malnourished people in general. The purpose of this review is to provide concise guidance for the nutritional management of individuals with COVID-19 based on the current literature and focused on those in the non-ICU setting or with an older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on mortality. RECENT FINDINGS: Prolonged hospital stays are reported to be required for individuals with COVID-19, and longer acute setting stays may directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, which may lead to poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Nutritional therapy is among the mainstay of therapeutic principles and one of the core contents of comprehensive treatment measures. The current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented.

Doxycycline, with its pleiotropic effects, including anti-viral activity, has been proposed as a therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and about twenty clinical trials have started since the beginning of the pandemic. To gain information on the activity of doxycycline against SARS-CoV-2 infection and clarify some of the conflicting clinical data published, we designed in vitro binding tests and infection studies with a pseudotyped virus expressing the spike protein, as well as a clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain. Doxycycline inhibited the transduction of the pseudotyped virus in Vero E6 and HEK-293 T cells stably expressing human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Although this conclusion is apparently disappointing, it is paradigmatic of an experimental approach aimed at developing an integrated multidisciplinary platform. To avoid wasting precious time and resources we believe very stringent experimental criteria are needed in the preclinical phase, including infectious studies with SARS-CoV-2 in the platform before moving on to [failed] clinical trials. Author SummaryThe pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created a completely unusual situation in rapidly searching for compounds able to interfere with the biological processes exploited by the virus. This new scenario has substantially changed the timing of drug development which has also resulted in the generation of controversial results, proving that the transition from computational screening to the clinical application requires great caution and careful studies. It is therefore necessary to establish new paradigms for evaluating the efficacy of a potential active molecule. We set up a preclinical platform aimed at identifying molecules active against SARS-CoV-2 infection developing a multidisciplinary approach based on very stringent experimental criteria, comprising in-silico studies, in vitro binding tests and infection studies with pseudovirus expressing the spike protein as well as clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains. We focused our attention on doxycycline which has been suggested as potential therapeutic candidate for treating COVID-19 and is currently employed in about twenty clinical trials. Doxycycline resulted effective in inhibiting the transduction of pseudovirus but it did not affect the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The results obtained underline the need to define more stringent and controlled pharmacological approaches before wasting precious time and resources with clinical trials.","Diomede, Luisa; Baroni, Sara; Luigi, Ada De; Piotti, Arianna; Lucchetti, Jacopo; Fracasso, Claudia; Russo, Luca; Bonaldo, Valerio; Panini, Nicolò; Filippini, Federica; Fiordaliso, Fabio; Corbelli, Alessandro; Beeg, Marten; Pizzato, Massimo; Caccuri, Francesca; Gobbi, Marco; Biasini, Emiliano; Caruso, Arnaldo; Salmona, Mario",,373,32

Available diagnostic tools lack sensitivity and specificity toward identifying macular (MAC) PKDL patients, due to low parasite load in patients' sample. Confirmatory test like punch biopsy are invasive and painful. Considering the rural nature of this disease and the prevailing situation of diagnostic scenario, PKDL patients mostly remains unattended from receiving proper medical care. They in turn act as ""mobile parasite reservoir,"" responsible for VL transmission among healthy individuals (HI). This study aims to identify PKDL disease specific glycated protein biomarkers, utilizing the powerful LC-MS/MS technology, which is the tool of choice to efficiently identify and quantify disease specific protein biomarkers. These identified PKDL disease specific novel glycoproteins could be developed in future as immunochromatographic based assay for efficient case detection. Methodology: Previously our lab had identified importance of glycated (Circulating Immune Complexes) CICs, among PKDL patients. This study aims to further characterize disease specific glycated protein biomarkers, among MAC PKDL patients for both diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of the disease. LC-MS/MS based comparative spectral count analysis of MAC PKDL to polymorphic (POLY) PKDL, HI, and Cured (CR) individuals were performed. Proteins level alterations among all study groups were confirmed by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbant Assay (ELISA). Results: Among MAC PKDL patients 43, 60, 90 proteins were altered compared to POLY PKDL, HI, and CR groups, respectively. Filtering for the most significant proteins, Plasminogen (PLG) and Vitronectin (VTN) were identified which promisingly identified MAC PKDL cases. Active surveillance results from endemic districts of West Bengal revealed drastic rise of MAC PKDL cases, alarming the urgency for field adaptive efficient biomarker. Conclusion: This current study aims to establish PLG and VTN as novel diagnostic and prognostic protein biomarker for MAC and POLY PKDL cases management.","Jaiswal, Priyank; Ghosh, Manab; Patra, Goutam; Saha, Bibhuti; Mukhopadhyay, Sumi",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,373,20

METHOD: We analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets of human embryos for the known canonical and non-canonical receptors and spike protein cleavage enzymes for multiple coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E, and hCoV-NL63. We also analyzed the expression of host genes involved in viral replication, host proteins involved in viral endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), genes of host proteins that physically interact with proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and the host genes essential for coronavirus infectivity. RESULTS: Of the known receptors of SARS viruses, ACE2, BSG, GOLGA7, and ZDHHC5 were expressed in different proportions in the zygote, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocysts including the trophectoderm. The MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, and hCoV-229E receptor, ANPEP, were expressed mainly from the compact morula to the blastocyst stages. Transcripts of the MERS-CoV alternate receptor LGALS1 were detected in most cells at all stages of development. TMPRSS2 transcripts were detected in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm, while transcripts of the endosomal proteases CTSL, CTSB, and FURIN were expressed in most cells at all stages of development. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast and trophectoderm cells. The embryonic cells expressed genes involved in ESCRT, viral replication, SARS-CoV-2 interactions, and coronavirus infectivity. The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells were enriched in genes associated with lipid metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. CONCLUSION: Preimplantation and implantation stage human embryos could be permissive to multiple hCoVs.","Colaco, S; Chhabria, K; Singh, D; Bhide, A; Singh, N; Singh, A; Husein, A; Mishra, A; Sharma, R; Ashary, N; Modi, D",J Assist Reprod Genet,373,16
438599,438599,438599,Anesthetic outcomes in pediatric patients with COVID-19: A matched cohort study,17.435532,8.752484,2021,"BACKGROUND: In Switzerland, details of current anaesthesia practice are unknown. However, they are urgently needed to manage anaesthesia drug supply in times of drug shortages due to the pandemic. METHODS: We surveyed all Swiss anaesthesia institutions in April 2020 to determine their annual anaesthesia activity. Together with a detailed analysis on anaesthetic drug use of a large, representative Swiss anaesthesia index institution, calculations and projections for the annual need of anaesthetics in Switzerland were made. Only those drugs have been analysed that are either being used very frequently or that have been classified critical with regard to their supply by the pharmacy of the index institution or the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. RESULTS: The response rate to our questionnaire was 98%. Out of the present 188 Swiss anaesthesia institutions, 185 responded. In Switzerland, the annual number of anaesthesias was 1'071'054 (12'445 per 100'000 inhabitants) with a mean anaesthesia time of 2.03 hours. Teaching hospitals (n = 54) performed more than half (n = 572'231) and non-teaching hospitals (n = 103) provided almost half of all anaesthesias (n = 412'531). Thereby, private hospitals conducted a total of 290'690 anaesthesias. Finally, office-based anaesthesia institutions with mainly outpatients (n = 31) administered 86'292 anaesthesias. Regarding type of anaesthesia provided, two thirds were general anaesthesias (42% total intravenous, 17% inhalation, 8% combined), 20% regional and 12% monitored anaesthesia care. Projecting for example the annual need for propofol in anaesthesia, Switzerland requires 48'573 L of propofol 1% which corresponds to 5'644 L propofol 1% per 100'000 inhabitants every year. CONCLUSIONS: To actively manage anaesthesia drug supply in the context of the current pandemic, it is mandatory to have a detailed understanding of the number and types of anaesthesias provided. On this basis, the Swiss annual consumption of anaesthetics could be projected and the replenishment organized.","Hofer, Christoph Karl; Wendel Garcia, Pedro David; Heim, Christof; Ganter, Michael Thomas",PLoS One,373,12

The approach has been tested by predicting the number of contaminated persons for the next week after fitting the inputs data collected within 7 or 15 days using standard least &#967;2-fit method. Encouraged by this first test, we study systematically during 67 days, 1-2 weeks new data and predict the contaminated persons for the coming week. We find that the first month data are well described by a linear or quadratic polynomial with an increase of about (4-5) infected persons per day. Pursuing the analysis, one note that data until 46 days favours a cubic polynomial behaviour which signals an eventual near future stronger growth as confirmed by the new data on the 48th day. We complete the analysis until 67 days and find that the data until 77 days confirm the cubic polynomial behaviour which is a remarkable feature of the pandemic spread in Madagascar. We expect that these results will be useful for some new model buildings. A comparison with some other SI-like models predictions is done. These results for infected persons may also be interpreted as the lowest values of the real cases due to the insufficient number of samples (about 12,907 for 27 million habitants on 05/06/20). The data analysis of the absolute number of cured persons until 67 days shows an approximate linear behaviour with about 3 cured persons per day. However, the number of percentage number of cured persons decreases above 42-46 days indicating the limits of the hospital equipment and care to face the 2nd phase of the pandemic for the 67th first days. Some comments on the social, economical and political impacts of COVID-19 and confinement for Madagascar and, in general, for Worldwide are shortly discussed.","Narison, Stephan",Infect Genet Evol,373,26

The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition and may facilitate future research.","Conzelmann, Carina; Gilg, Andrea; Groß, Rüdiger; Schütz, Desiree; Preising, Nico; Ständker, Ludger; Jahrsdörfer, Bernd; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Stamminger, Thomas; Stenger, Steffen; Münch, Jan; Müller, Janis A",Antiviral Res,373,30

The study proposes a rationale for sports perspectives during current epidemic situation and provides practical guidance for safe training practices. Materials and methods. 162 athletes of different age participated in an anonymous survey. The main sections of the survey included aspects of athletes' competence and consciousness regarding the safety of the training process during COVID-19 pandemic. Results. It was found that although 100% of adolescent participants were informed about the negative effects of training load on physical health when suffering from cold-related diseases, meanwhile 49% continued training and competitive activities. Moreover, 20.4% of athletes did not follow the announced restrictive measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. At the moment of the survey, 9.3% did not wear a mask and 11.6% did not use hand antiseptic. Conclusion. Athletes are in high risk during pandemic not only because of their thoughtlessness but also due to neglecting healthcare recommendations, as well as refusing to stop training and competitive activities despite of symptoms of virus disease.","Mekhdieva, K.

Persistent clinical symptoms following resolution of initial infection, termed long COVID, are also hugely variable, but association with immunological changes has not been described. We investigate changing immunological parameters in convalescent COVID-19 and interrogate their potential relationships with persistent symptoms. Methods: We performed paired immunophenotyping at initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescence (n=40, median 68 days) and validated findings in 71 further patients at median 101 days convalescence. Results were compared to 40 pre-pandemic controls. Fatigue and exercise tolerance were assessed as cardinal features of long COVID using the Chalder Fatigue Scale and 6-minute-walk test. The relationships between these clinical outcomes and convalescent immunological results were investigated. Results: We identify persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes, effector CD8+, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and reduced naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 68 days, with activated CD8+ T cells remaining increased at 101 days. Patients >60 years also demonstrate reduced naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expanded activated CD4+ T cells at 101 days. Ill-health, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance were common in this cohort. These symptoms were not associated with immune cell populations or circulating inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: We demonstrate myeloid recovery but persistent T cell abnormalities in convalescent COVID-19 patients more than three months after initial infection. These changes are more marked with age and are independent of ongoing subjective ill-health, fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance.","Townsend, Liam; Dyer, Adam H; Naughton, Aifric; Kiersey, Rachel; Holden, Dean; Gardiner, Mary; Dowds, Joanne; O039,; Brien, Kate; Bannan, Ciaran; Nadarajan, Parthiban; Dunne, Jean; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Fallon, Padraic G; Bergin, Colm; Farrelly, Cliona; Cheallaigh, Cliona Ni; Bourke, Nollaig M; Conlon, Niall",Front Immunol,373,29

This article describes our approach to teaching, observations, and experience. This case study examines three factors: Firstly, the impact of distance education on overall assessments of students. Using descriptive statistics, the results of student evaluations were compared from the overall assessments for the last six academic years. It was found that distance learning does not affect excellent students and eliminates the number of students who do not pass. Secondly, the participation of students during online lessons, and thirdly, the use of electronic materials. The questionnaire survey and the data from the learning management system Moodle were used to examine the second and third factors. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the questionnaire survey data (frequencies, percentages and averages).

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic in Spain has pushed boundaries in health systems and, especially, for health professionals. Analysis of resilience as an individual resource and it is essential to understand the mechanisms that make staff react unfavourably to stressors caused by the pandemic. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed. PARTICIPANTS: Health professionals supervised by the nursing department, including registered nurses, health care assistants, health technicians, final year nurse student nurses, foreign nurses, and other nurse-related health workers. METHODS: The study complies with the STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies. An online survey was administered to all health professionals supervised by the nursing department between 6 and 27 May 2020. The survey included the ER-14 Resilience Scale, the widely-used PHQ-9 depression scale, the Spanish version of the Nursing Stress Scale, and an ad-hoc questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic and occupational variables. RESULTS: A total of 686 participants answered the survey. Resilience was high or very high in health professionals, with an inverse correlation with stress and depression scores. Personal on fixed shifts showed better resilience. The most stressed health professionals were full-time registered nurses, followed by health care assistants. Up to 25% of nursing professionals had depression. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high degree of resilience among nurse professionals despite the overwhelming nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Relevant signs of depression and stress were detected among participants. Occupational factors heavily influenced nurses' resilience, stress and depression. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING & HEALTH POLICY: Government policy shifts are needed in Spain to improve nurses' workforce conditions, enhance the ratio of nurses to patient numbers, and avoid workforce losses. Maintaining the resilience of health professionals would assist in improving their health and their capacity to possible future emergency situations.","Manzanares, Isabel; Sevilla Guerra, Sonia; Lombraña Mencía, María; Acar-Denizli, Nihan; Miranda Salmerón, Josep; Martinez Estalella, Gemma",Int. nurs. rev,373,12

We consider a large database on patients being treated at dialysis facilities in the United States, and the problem of identifying facilities with outcomes that are better than or worse than expected. Analyses of such data have been commonly based on random or fixed facility effects, which have shortcomings that can lead to unfair assessments. A primary issue is that they do not appropriately account for variation between providers that is outside the providers' control due, for example, to unobserved patient characteristics that vary between providers. In this article, we propose a smoothed empirical null approach that accounts for the total variation and adapts to different provider sizes. The linear model provides an illustration that extends easily to other non-linear models for survival or binary outcomes, for example. The empirical null method is generalized to allow for some variation being due to quality of care. These methods are examined with numerical simulations and applied to the monitoring of survival in the dialysis facility data.","Xia, Lu; He, Kevin; Li, Yanming; Kalbfleisch, John",Biostatistics,373,30

It is not known whether sex hormones contribute to this predisposition. Objective: To investigate the association of concentrations of serum testosterone, estradiol, and insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1, concentrations of which are regulated by sex hormone signaling) with COVID-19 severity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was conducted using serum samples collected from consecutive patients who presented from March through May 2020 to the Barnes Jewish Hospital in St Louis, Missouri, with COVID-19 (diagnosed using nasopharyngeal swabs). Exposures: Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were measured at the time of presentation (ie, day 0) and at days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after admission (if the patient remained hospitalized). Main Outcomes and Measures: Baseline hormone concentrations were compared among patients who had severe COVID-19 vs those with milder COVID-19 illness. RNA sequencing was performed on circulating mononuclear cells to understand the mechanistic association of altered circulating hormone concentrations with cellular signaling pathways. Results: Among 152 patients (90 [59.2%] men; 62 [40.8%] women; mean [SD] age, 63 [16] years), 143 patients (94.1%) were hospitalized. Among 66 men with severe COVID-19, median [interquartile range] testosterone concentrations were lower at day 0 (53 [18 to 114] ng/dL vs 151 [95 to 217] ng/dL; P = .01) and day 3 (19 [6 to 68] ng/dL vs 111 [49 to 274] ng/dL; P = .006) compared with 24 men with milder disease. Testosterone concentrations were inversely associated with concentrations of interleukin 6 (ß = -0.43; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.17; P < .001), C-reactive protein (ß = -0.38; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.16; P = .004), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (ß = -0.29; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.06; P = .02), hepatocyte growth factor (ß = -0.46; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.25; P < .001), and interferon Î³-inducible protein 10 (ß = -0.32; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.10; P = .007). Estradiol and IGF-1 concentrations were not associated with COVID-19 severity in men. Testosterone, estradiol, and IGF-1 concentrations were similar in women with and without severe COVID-19. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulated hormone signaling pathways in CD14+CD16- (ie, classical) monocytes and CD14-CD16+ (ie, nonclassical) monocytes in male patients with COVID-19 who needed intensive care unit treatment vs those who did not. Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center cohort study of patients with COVID-19, lower testosterone concentrations during hospitalization were associated with increased disease severity and inflammation in men. Hormone signaling pathways in monocytes did not parallel serum hormone concentrations, and further investigation is required to understand their pathophysiologic association with COVID-19.","Dhindsa, Sandeep; Zhang, Nan; McPhaul, Michael J; Wu, Zengru; Ghoshal, Amit K; Erlich, Emma C; Mani, Kartik; Randolph, Gwendalyn J; Edwards, John R; Mudd, Philip A; Diwan, Abhinav",JAMA Netw Open,373,1

METHODS: We conducted a systematic research of the literature, collecting data regarding the evidence on tumor degeneration from AWE after CS. Moreover, we reported a case of clear cell borderline tumor (CCBT) originating from AWE. RESULTS: We included data of 37 patients with diagnosis of CCC. The average time between the last CS and the diagnosis of CCC was around 15 years. Overall, 26.0% and 73.9% patients received exclusive local abdominal resection of the lesion and additional surgery, respectively. Lymph nodes involvement was detected in 26.0 % patients and adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 52.0 % cases. During follow-up period, 15.2% patients died of disease, 32.6% had no evidence of disease, and 17.4% recurred. We diagnosed a CCBT arose in a patients with AWE and a personal history of several surgical procedures for endometriosis, a CS and a subsequent transverse laparotomy. We performed an open bilateral ovariectomy and a large excision of the endometriotic abdominal lesion. CONCLUSION: Tumor degeneration from AWE seems to be a real occurrence with an increasing number of events. Considering the lack of risk factors and diagnostic instruments for tumor degeneration, the removal of AWE localization could be advisable, even though there was long average time between the trigger surgery and the tumor finding.","Ferrari, Federico; Valenti, Gaetano; Forte, Sara; Ardighieri, Laura; Iraci Sareri, Marco; Barra, Fabio; Sartori, Enrico; Odicino, Franco",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,373,16

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has resulted in unparalleled requirements for RNA extraction kits and enzymes required for virus detection, leading to global shortages. This has necessitated the exploration of alternative diagnostic options to alleviate supply chain issues.Aim. To establish and validate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT- LAMP) assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs.Methodology. We used a commercial RT-LAMP mastermix from OptiGene in combination with a primer set designed to detect the CDC N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene. A single-tube, single-step fluorescence assay was implemented whereby 1 µl of universal transport medium (UTM) directly from a nasopharyngeal swab could be used as template, bypassing the requirement for RNA purification. Amplification and detection could be conducted in any thermocycler capable of holding 65 °C for 30 min and measure fluorescence in the FAM channel at 1 min intervals.Results. Assay evaluation by assessment of 157 clinical specimens previously screened by E-gene RT-qPCR revealed assay sensitivity and specificity of 87 and 100%, respectively. Results were fast, with an average time-to-positive (Tp) for 93 clinical samples of 14 min (sd±7 min). Using dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into UTM, we also evaluated assay performance against FDA guidelines for implementation of emergency-use diagnostics and established a limit-of-detection of 54 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50 per ml (TCID50 ml-1), with satisfactory assay sensitivity and specificity. A comparison of 20 clinical specimens between four laboratories showed excellent interlaboratory concordance; performing equally well on three different, commonly used thermocyclers, pointing to the robustness of the assay.Conclusion. With a simplified workflow, The N1 gene Single Tube Optigene LAMP assay (N1-STOP-LAMP) is a powerful, scalable option for specific and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and an additional resource in the diagnostic armamentarium against COVID-19.","Lee, Jean Y H; Best, Nickala; McAuley, Julie; Porter, Jessica L; Seemann, Torsten; Schultz, Mark B; Sait, Michelle; Orlando, Nicole; Mercoulia, Karolina; Ballard, Susan A; Druce, Julian; Tran, Thomas; Catton, Mike G; Pryor, Melinda J; Cui, Huanhuan L; Luttick, Angela; McDonald, Sean; Greenhalgh, Arran; Kwong, Jason C; Sherry, Norelle L; Graham, Maryza; Hoang, Tuyet; Herisse, Marion; Pidot, Sacha J; Williamson, Deborah A; Howden, Benjamin P; Monk, Ian R; Stinear, Timothy P",J Med Microbiol,373,20

The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent skin microvascular reactivity in patients with critical COVID-19. METHODS: Twelve patients with COVID-19 treated with non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. We investigated skin microvascular reactivity on two separate days during hospitalization (study day 1 and 2) and at least three months after disease onset (study day 3). Twelve controls with no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection during 2020 were also examined. Skin perfusion was investigated through Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) before and after iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to determine the endothelial-dependent and the endothelial-independent vasodilation, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with critical COVID-19 had higher basal skin perfusion and reduced responses to endothelial-dependent (ACh, pâ=â0.002) and endothelial-independent (SNP, pâ=â0.01) vasodilator drugs on study day 1. In addition, the ACh/SNP ratio was significantly reduced in patients (0.50â±â0.36 versus 0.91â±â0.49 in controls, pâ=â0.02). Three months after disease onset, surviving patients tended to have reduced ACh-mediated vasodilation compared to controls (pâ=â0.08). CONCLUSIONS: This small-sized pilot study demonstrates that critical COVID-19 infection is associated with microvascular impairment and, in particular, a markedly reduced endothelial function. Our results also suggest that microvascular function may not be fully recovered three months after disease onset.","Tehrani, Sara; Gille-Johnson, Patrik",Shock (Augusta Ga.),373,26

METHODS: As part of a larger, chronic disease-focused, and ongoing longitudinal study designed to explore Ontario adults' health and wellness-related behaviors during the pandemic, participants completed an online survey that included demographic information and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI consists of 19 items, one of which is open-ended, designed to assess an individual's quantity, quality, and patterns of sleep on seven domains (ie, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month). Summative content analysis was used to analyze responses to the open-ended question regarding participants' sleep disturbances. RESULTS: This study included 2192 individuals, 85% of whom slept 6+ hours/night. The mean global PSQI score was 7.57, out of a possible 21 (SD = 4.09). The self-reported sleep disturbances of largest concern were: (1) general fear/anxiety/worry (n = 203); (2) children (n = 167); (3) mind wandering/overthinking (n = 118); (4) pain/injury (n = 78); (5) partner (n = 78); and (6) fear/anxiety/stress related to COVID-19 (n = 74). CONCLUSION: The global PSQI score was indicative of poor sleep quality, and Ontario adults experienced a number of sleep disturbances during early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among frail persons, cancer patients are at high risk of death from COVID-19. METHODS: The French prospective cohort ONCOVID-19 enrolled patients with solid or haematological tumour, receiving anticancer treatment and presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. COVID-19 was confirmed through detectable SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR (repeated twice if negative first) and/or specific CT-scan. The study aims to assess the 28-day mortality rate after the first COVID test. RESULTS: From March 1st to May 21st 2020, 23 French cancer centres and hospitals enrolled 1230 cancer patients with suspicion of COVID-19, including 1162 (94.5%) matching the inclusion criteria. We identified 425 (36.6%) COVID-19 positive patients including 155 (13.3%) diagnosed with CT-scan only, while 737 (63.4%) patients were COVID-19 negative. Death at day-28 occurred in 116/425 (27.8%) COVID-19 positive patients, and in 118/737 (16.3%) COVID-19 negative patients (p < 0·0001).

To date, no specific drugs are available against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) appear to be a promising cell therapy owing to their potent modulatory effects on reducing and healing inflammation-induced lung and other tissue injuries. The present pilot study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential and safety of MSCs isolated from healthy cord tissues in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Twelve patients with COVID-19 treated with MSCs plus conventional therapy and 13 treated with conventional therapy alone (control) were included. The efficacy of MSC infusion was evaluated by changes in oxygenation index, clinical chemistry and hematology tests, immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, and pulmonary computerized tomography (CT) imaging. The safety of MSC infusion was evaluated based on the occurrence of allergic reactions and serious adverse events. RESULTS: The MSC-treated group demonstrated significantly improved oxygenation index. The area of pulmonary inflammation decreased significantly, and the CT number in the inflammatory area tended to be restored. Decreased IgM levels were also observed after MSC therapy. Laboratory biomarker levels at baseline and after therapy showed no significant changes in either the MSC-treated or control group. CONCLUSION: Intravenous infusion of MSCs in patients with COVID-19 was effective and well tolerated.

The questionnaire included 12 items finalized to evaluate general features of the women and 6 items specifically correlated to their attitudes towards the SARS-COV-2 vaccination. Chi square (&#967;2) or Fisher exact tests were used to compare group differences of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Naples Federico II (ref. no. 409/2020), and University of Rome Tor Vergata Ospedale Cristo Re (ref. #Ost4-2020). RESULTS: Most of the included women did not agree to eventually receive SARS-COV-2 vaccine during pregnancy (40, 28.2% vs 102, 71.8%). Being pregnant was considered a determinant factor to refuse the vaccine prophylaxis (99, 69.7% vs 43, 30.3%; &#967;2= 24.187, p<0.001), even if a very large percentage declared to be generally in favor of vaccines (128, 90.1% vs 14, 9.9%; &#967;2= 6.091, p=0.014) and most of them confirmed they received or would receive other recommended vaccines during pregnancy (75, 52.8% vs 67, 47.2%; &#967;2= 10.996, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Urgent data are needed on safety, efficacy and toxicology of SARS-COV-2 vaccines during pregnancy to modify this trend and to help obstetricians during the counselling. Furthermore, pregnant women should be included in future vaccine development trials to not incur again in such uncertainty.","Carbone, Luigi; Mappa, Ilenia; Sirico, Angelo; Girolamo, Raffaella Di; Saccone, Gabriele; Mascio, Daniele Di; Donadono, Vera; Cuomo, Lara; Gabrielli, Olimpia; Migliorini, Sonia; Luviso, Maria; D039,; antonio, Francesco; Rizzo, Giuseppe; Maruotti, Giuseppe Maria",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,373,16

However, anion exchange resins employed for the removal of negatively charged target molecules including bilirubin may also deplete these anticoagulants due to their negative charge. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adsorption of citrate by anion exchange resins and the impact on extracorporeal Ca2+ concentrations. METHODS: Liver support treatments were simulated in vitro. Citrate and Ca2+ concentrations were measured pre and post albumin filter as well as pre and post adsorbents. In addition, batch experiments were performed to quantify citrate adsorption. RESULTS: Pre albumin filter target Ca2+ concentrations were reached well with only minor deviations. Citrate was adsorbed by anion exchange resins, resulting in a higher Ca2+ concentration downstream of the adsorbent cartridges during the first hour of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The anion exchange resin depletes citrate, leading to an increased Ca2+ concentration in the extracorporeal circuit, which may cause an increased risk of clotting during the first hour of treatment. An increase of citrate infusion during the first hour of treatment should therefore be considered to compensate for the adsorption of citrate.","Strobl, Karin; Harm, Stephan; Fichtinger, Ute; Schildböck, Claudia; Hartmann, Jens",Int J Artif Organs,373,9

Here, we examine how the methanol extract of Barringtonia augusta (B. augusta) can suppress the activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling pathway and study the activities of Ba-ME in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and an LPS-induced peritonitis mouse model. Non-toxic concentrations of Ba-ME downregulated the mRNA expression of cytokines, such as cyclooxygenase and chemokine ligand 12, in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Transfection experiments with the AP-1-Luc construct, HEK293T cells, and luciferase assays were used to assess whether Ba-ME suppressed the AP-1 functional activation. A Western blot assay confirmed that C-Jun N-terminal kinase is a direct pharmacological target of Ba-ME action. The anti-inflammatory effect of Ba-ME, which functions by ß-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) inhibition, was confirmed by using an overexpression strategy and a cellular thermal shift assay. In vivo experiments in a mouse model of LPS-induced peritonitis showed the anti-inflammatory effect of Ba-ME on LPS-stimulated macrophages and acute inflammatory mouse models.

This could trigger endothelial dysfunction, pyroptosis, and thrombosis, which are the vascular changes, commonly referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) endotheliopathy. Thus, this study aimed to identify tissue biomarkers associated with endothelial activation/dysfunction and the pyroptosis pathway in the lung samples of patients with COVID-19 and to compare them to pandemic influenza A virus H1N1 subtype 2009 and control cases. Approach and Results: Postmortem lung samples (COVID-19 group =6 cases; H1N1 group =10 cases, and control group =11 cases) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the following monoclonal primary antibodies: anti-IL (interleukin)-6, anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-&#945;, anti-ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and anticaspase-1. From the result, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, ICAM-1, and caspase-1 showed higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group than in the H1N1 and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and suggested the participation of the pyroptosis pathway in the pulmonary samples. These conditions might lead to systemic thrombotic events that could impair the clinical staff's efforts to avoid fatal outcomes. One of the health professionals' goals should be to identify the high risk of thrombosis patients early to block endotheliopathy and its consequences.","Nagashima, Seigo; Mendes, Monalisa Castilho; Camargo Martins, Ana Paula; Borges, Nícolas Henrique; Godoy, Thiago Mateus; Miggiolaro, Anna Flavia Ribeiro Dos Santos; da Silva Dezidério, Felipe; Machado-Souza, Cleber; de Noronha, Lucia",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,373,1

We use a unique panel survey of a representative sample households in Addis Ababa to study both food security and food consumption during the pandemic. In contrast to some other countries in the region, Ethiopia never went into a full lockdown severely restricting movement. Despite subjective income measures suggesting a large proportion of households have been exposed to job loss or reduced incomes, we find that relative to a survey conducted in August and September of 2019, food consumption and household dietary diversity are largely unchanged or slightly increased by August 2020. We find some changes in the composition of food consumption, but they are not related to shocks found in previous phone surveys conducted with the same households. The results therefore suggest the types of subjective questions about income typically being asked in COVID-19 phone surveys may not appropriately reflect the magnitude of such shocks. They also imply, at least indirectly, that in the aggregate food value chains have been resilient to the shock associated with the pandemic.","Hirvonen, Kalle; de Brauw, Alan; Abate, Gashaw T",American journal of agricultural economics,373,29

Second, the behaviour of these models is visually analysed by plotting CAMs for individual networks and determining classification performance with AUCROC curves. Thirdly, stacked ensembles techniques are imparted to provide higher generalisation on combining the fine-tuned models, in which six ensemble neural networks are designed by combining the existing fine-tuned networks. Implying these stacked ensembles provides a great generalization to the models.

Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early disease identification. This study aimed to assess how frailty affects presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in older adults. Methods Observational study of two distinct cohorts: (i) Hospitalised patients aged 65 and over;unscheduled admission to a large London teaching hospital between March 1st, 2020-May 5th, 2020;COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab (n = 322);(ii) Community-based adults aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study mobile application between March 24th (application launch)-May 8th, 2020;self-report or report-by-proxy data;reported test-positive for COVID-19 (n = 535). Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples of both cohorts to determine associations between frailty and symptoms of COVID-19 including delirium, fever and cough. Results Hospital cohort: there was a significantly higher prevalence of delirium amongst the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Of those presenting with delirium, 10/53 (18.9%) presented with delirium as the only documented symptom. Community-based cohort: there was a significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in the frail sample, and also of fatigue and shortness of breath. Of those reporting probable delirium, 28/84 (33%) did not report fever or cough. Conclusions This study demonstrates a higher prevalence of delirium as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection in older adults with frailty compared to their age-matched non-frail counterparts. Clinicians should suspect COVID-19 in frail older adults presenting with delirium. Early detection facilitates infection control measures to mitigate against catastrophic spread and preventable hospitalisations and deaths amongst this population. Our findings emphasise the need for systematic frailty assessment for all acutely ill older patients in both hospital and community settings, as well as systematic evaluation of any change in mental status.","Penfold, R.

The aim of this study was to describe women's experiences and perspectives in attending a Healthy Pregnancy Service designed to optimise healthy lifestyle and support recommended gestational weight gain for women with obesity. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed methods study design utilised two questionnaires (completed in early and late pregnancy) to quantify feelings, motivation and satisfaction with the service, followed by semi-structured interviews that explored barriers and enablers of behaviour change. Data were analysed separately and then interpreted together. RESULTS: Overall, 49 women attending the service completed either questionnaire 1, 2 or both and were included in the analysis. Fourteen women were interviewed. Prior to pregnancy, many women had gained weight and attempted to lose weight independently, and reported they were highly motivated to achieve a healthy lifestyle. During pregnancy, diet changes were reported as easier to make and sustain than exercise changes. Satisfaction with the service was high. Key factors identified in qualitative analysis were: service support enabled change; motivation to change behaviour, social support, barriers to making change (intrinsic, extrinsic and clinic-related), post-partum lifestyle and needs. On integration of data, qualitative and quantitative findings aligned. CONCLUSIONS: The Healthy Pregnancy service was valued by women. Barriers and enablers to the delivery of an integrated model of maternity care that supported healthy lifestyle and recommended gestational weight gain were identified.

Since its origin in China in December 2019, there is compelling evidence that novel SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible virus, and it is associated to a broad clinical spectrum going from subclinical presentation to severe respiratory distress and multiorgan failure. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cellular receptor that allows it to infect different host cells and likely disrupts renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system homeostasis. Particularly, a considerable incidence of many renal abnormalities associated to COVID-19 has been reported, including proteinuria, hematuria, and acute kidney injury. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, which could contribute to the development of the aforementioned renal abnormalities. In this review, we discuss the biological aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, how understanding current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection may partly explain the involvement of the kidneys in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and what questions have arisen and remain to be explored.","Martinez-Rojas, Miguel Angel; Vega-Vega, Olynka; Bobadilla, Norma A",Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,373,1

Among 5811 respondents, most of whom were Italian, living in Northern Italy, and with a wealthy household economy, 8.3% reported that their families were at risk of FI before the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 and, alarmingly, this percentage increased to 16.2% after the pandemic began, with households from Southern Italy being more at risk. Moreover, 27.3% of the parents reported that their children were eating more; an increase in ""junk food"" consumption was also found; 31.8% of the respondents declared an increase in children's weight; weight loss prevailed among adolescents.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 8,291 outpatients aged 18-85 years, in 18 hospitals and health centers across Vietnam from 14th February to May 31, 2020. We collected the data regarding participant's characteristics, UHC, HB, PB, depression, and anxiety. Results: People with UHC had higher odds of depression (OR = 2.11; p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR = 2.86; p < 0.001) than those without UHC. The odds of depression and anxiety were significantly higher for those with UHC and S-COVID-19-S (p < 0.001); and were significantly lower for those had UHC and interacted with ""unchanged/more"" physical activity (p < 0.001), or ""unchanged/more"" drinking (p < 0.001 for only anxiety), or ""unchanged/healthier"" eating (p < 0.001), and high PB score (p < 0.001), as compared to those without UHC and without S-COVID-19-S, ""never/stopped/less"" physical activity, drinking, ""less healthy"" eating, and low PB score, respectively.

We ascertained IgG levels across a single US metropolitan site, Chicago, from June 2020 through December 2020.METHODSParticipants (n = 7935) were recruited through electronic advertising and received materials for a self-sampled dried-blood spot assay through the mail or a minimal contact in-person method. IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was measured using an established highly sensitive and highly specific assay.RESULTSOverall seroprevalence was 17.9%, with no significant difference between method of contact. Only 2.5% of participants reported having had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on virus detection, consistent with a 7-fold greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 measured by serology than that detected by viral testing. The range of IgG level observed in seropositive participants from this community survey overlapped with the range of IgG levels associated with COVID-19 cases having a documented positive PCR test. From a subset of those who participated in repeat testing, half of seropositive individuals retained detectable antibodies for 3 to 4 months.CONCLUSIONQuantitative IgG measurements with a highly specific and sensitive assay indicated more widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than observed by viral testing. The range of IgG concentrations produced from these asymptomatic exposures was similar to IgG levels occurring after documented nonhospitalized COVID-19, which were considerably lower than those produced from hospitalized COVID-19 cases. The differing ranges of IgG response, coupled with the rate of decay of antibodies, may influence response to subsequent viral exposure and vaccine.FundingNational Science Foundation grant 2035114, NIH grant 3UL1TR001422-06S4, NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences grants UL1 TR001422 and UL1 TR002389, Dixon Family Foundation, Northwestern University Cancer Center (NIH grant P30 CA060553), and Walder Foundation's Chicago Coronavirus Assessment Network.","Demonbreun, Alexis R; McDade, Thomas W; Pesce, Lorenzo; Vaught, Lauren A; Reiser, Nina L; Bogdanovic, Elena; Velez, Matthew P; Hsieh, Ryan R; Simons, Lacy M; Saber, Rana; Ryan, Daniel T; Ison, Michael G; Hultquist, Judd F; Wilkins, John T; D039,; Aquila, Richard T; Mustanski, Brian; McNally, Elizabeth M",JCI insight,373,27

Many machine learning-based classifiers use electromyography (EMG) signals as input features, but they often misclassify gestures performed in different situational contexts (changing arm position, reapplication of electrodes, etc.) or with different effort levels due to changing signal properties. Here, we describe a learning and classification algorithm based on hyperdimensional (HD) computing that, unlike traditional machine learning algorithms, enables computationally efficient updates to incrementally incorporate new data and adapt to changing contexts. EMG signal encoding for both training and classification is performed using the same set of simple operations on 10,000-element random hypervectors enabling updates on the fly. Through human experiments using a custom EMG acquisition system, we demonstrate 88.87% classification accuracy on 13 individual finger flexion and extension gestures. Using simple model updates, we preserve this accuracy with less than 5.48% degradation when expanding to 21 commonly used gestures or when subject to changing situational contexts. We also show that the same methods for updating models can be used to account for variations resulting from the effort level with which a gesture is performed.","Moin, Ali; Zhou, Andy; Benatti, Simone; Rahimi, Abbas; Alexandrov, George; Menon, Alisha; Tamakloe, Senam; Ting, Jonathan; Yamamoto, Natasha; Khan, Yasser; Burghardt, Fred; Arias, Ana C.; Benini, Luca; Rabaey, Jan M.",,373,21

It has been demonstrated that audiomotor interaction can be generated following training, but whether such audiomotor interaction can be induced by auditory imagery training remains unknown. The present study aims at determining whether auditory mental imagery could induce a multimodal association with postural control. We examined static postural control in the presence of a frequency-modulated sound in three groups of participants, prior to and following a short period of training designed to create an association between auditory mental imagery of sounds and postural swaying. Results suggest that mental imagery impacted performance, as a significant decrease in postural control was observed in the experimental group following mental imagery training. Results of the control groups confirmed that the effect of mental imagery was not due to response bias, but to a significant multimodal interaction following training. These findings are in accordance with previous studies suggesting that mental imagery stimuli can interact with perceptual stimuli of a different sensory modality and lead to multisensory integration. The results also confirm that audiomotor interaction can be generated a mental imagery training. However, the full extent of mental imagery influence on multimodal interaction remains to be determined.","Nooristani, M; Moïn-Darbari, K; Pagé, S; Bacon, B A; Champoux, F",Exp. brain res,373,32

Evidence so far has documented a heightened risk of mortality to people with chronic conditions. There is a dearth of evidence regarding chronic disease patients' intention and practice on the preventive measures. This study tried to fill this gap by assessing the intention to practice and practice on personal preventive measures (PPMs) among adults with chronic conditions. Materials and Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Ethiopia among 806 adults with chronic conditions by employing a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS software version 25. Binary logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with intention and practice. Level of statistical significance was declared at a P-value of less than 0.05. Results: The study showed that 52% (95% CI=47.61-54.80) and 76.3% (95% CI=73.36-79.24) of adults with chronic conditions were intending to practice and had ever practiced the personal preventive measures. Participants' subjective norm (SN) (AOR=4.94; 95% CI=3.49-6.96) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) (AOR=4.13; 95% CI=2.69-6.34) were the factors associated with their intention. Good knowledge and a positive attitude were found to be significant factors associated with the participants' actual practice of the PPMs among other independent factors. Conclusion: Around half of the participants were intending to practice PPMs, and three-quarters had good practice on the PPMs against COVID-19. Interventions targeted to improve intention and practice on the PPMs need to take into account improving knowledge and attitude, and build positive subjective norms and heighten the confidence to control the preventive behaviors.","Andarge, Eshetu; Fikadu, Teshale; Temesgen, Rodas; Shegaze, Mulugeta; Feleke, Tesfaye; Haile, Firehiwot; Endashaw, Gisila; Boti, Negussie; Bekele, Alemayehu; Glagn, Mustefa",J Multidiscip Healthc,373,7

It has been suggested that this abrupt lockdown of populations will foster addiction-related habits such as caloric/salty food intake, screen use, and substance use. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the global changes and factors of increase in addiction-related habits during the early COVID-19 containment phase in France. METHODS: A web-based survey was provided from day 8 to day 13 of the containment and was completed by 11,391 participants. The questions explored sociodemographic features, psychiatric/addiction history, material conditions of lockdown, general stress, mental well-being, and reported changes in several addiction-related behaviors. Global changes were described and factors of increase were explored using population-weighted and adjusted logistic regression models, providing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Overall, the respondents reported more increases in addiction-related habits than decreases, specifically 28.4% (caloric/salty food intake), 64.6% (screen use), 35.6% (tobacco use), 24.8% (alcohol use), and 31.2% (cannabis use). Reduced well-being scores and increased stress scores were general factors of increase in addiction-related habits (P<.001 for all habits). Factors of increase in caloric/salty food intake (n=10,771) were female gender (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.77), age less than 29 years (P<.001), having a partner (aOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), being locked down in a more confined space (per 1 square meter/person decrease: aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), being locked down alone (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49), and reporting current (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62-2.31) or past (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.47) psychiatric treatment. Factors of increase in screen use (n=11,267) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.21-1.43), age less than 29 years (P<.001), having no partner (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32), being employed (P<.001), intermediate/high education level (P<.001), being locked down with no access to an outdoor space (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29), being locked down alone (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32), living in an urban environment (P<.01), and not working (P<.001). Factors of increase in tobacco use (n=2787) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55), having no partner (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.59), intermediate/low education level (P<.01), and still working in the workplace (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17-1.86). Factors of increase in alcohol use (n=7108) were age 30-49 years (P<.05), a high level of education (P<.001), and current psychiatric treatment (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.88). The only significant factor of increase in cannabis use (n=620) was intermediate/low level of education (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The early phase of COVID-19 containment in France led to widespread increases in addiction-related habits in the general population. Reduced well-being and increased stress were universal factors of increase. More specific factors were associated with increases in each of the explored habits.","Rolland, Benjamin; Haesebaert, Frédéric; Zante, Elodie; Benyamina, Amine; Haesebaert, Julie; Franck, Nicolas",JMIR Public Health Surveill,373,24

The commonly used contact-tracing-based estimation of incubation distribution is highly influenced by the individuals' judgment on the possible date of exposure, and might lead to significant errors. On the other hand, interval censoring-based methods are able to utilize a much larger set of traveling data but may encounter biased sampling problems. The distribution of generation time is usually approximated by observed serial intervals. However, it may result in a biased estimation of generation time, especially when the disease is infectious during incubation. In this paper, the theory from renewal process is partially adopted by considering the incubation period as the interarrival time, and the duration between departure from Wuhan and onset of symptoms as the mixture of forward time and interarrival time with censored intervals. In addition, a consistent estimator for the distribution of generation time based on incubation period and serial interval is proposed for incubation-infectious diseases. A real case application to the current outbreak of COVID-19 is implemented. We find that the incubation period has a median of 8.50 days (95% confidence interval [CI] [7.22; 9.15]). The basic reproduction number in the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak based on the proposed generation time estimation is estimated to be 2.96 (95% CI [2.15; 3.86]).","Deng, Yuhao; You, Chong; Liu, Yukun; Qin, Jing; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",Biometrics,373,16

METHODS: This retrospective and the single-center study were done at the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, Hunan, China. We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha. Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed until February 26th, 2020. RESULTS: By February 19, 2020, nine pediatric patients were identified as having 2019-nCoV infection in Changsha. Six children had a family exposure and could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days. The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms. Two of the enrolled patients showed small ground-glass opacity of chest computed tomography scan. As of February 26, six patients had a negative RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged. The median time from exposure to a negative RT-PCR was 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children were not typical and showed a less aggressive clinical course than teenage and adult patients.

The overall safety, and histopathology of the IVM-spray application site tissues, were assessed. The IVM concentration profiles measured in plasma and respiratory tract tissues after the nasal spray were compared with those achieved after the oral administration. Animals tolerated well the nasal spray formulation. No local/systemic adverse events were observed.

The nasal/oral IVM concentration ratios in nasopharyngeal and lung tissues markedly increased by repeating (12 h apart) the spray application. The fast attainment of high and persistent IVM concentrations in nasopharyngeal tissue is the main advantage of the nasal over the oral route.

Protein levels in tumour tissues and LC cells were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In vitro, cell proliferation, colony formation assays, cell death and autophagy were detected. A nude mouse xenograft model was established through the injection of Tu212 cells. We found that GLUT1 was highly expressed and negatively associated with autophagy-related proteins in LC and that curcumin suppressed radiation-mediated GLUT1 overexpression in Tu212 cells. Treatment with curcumin, GLUT1 siRNA, or the combination of the two promoted autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy using 6-amino-3-methypourine (3-MA) promoted apoptosis after irradiation or treatment of cells with curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA. 3-MA inhibited curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA-mediated non-apoptotic programmed cell death. The combination of curcumin, GLUT1 siRNA and 3-MA provided the strongest sensitization in vivo. We also found that autophagy induction after curcumin or GLUT1 siRNA treatment implicated in the AMP-activated protein kinase-mTOR-serine/threonine-protein kinase-Beclin1 signalling pathway. Irradiation primarily caused apoptosis, and when combined with curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA treatment, the increased radiosensitivity of LC occurred through the concurrent induction of apoptosis and autophagy.","Dai, Li-Bo; Zhong, Jiang-Tao; Shen, Li-Fang; Zhou, Shui-Hong; Lu, Zhong-Jie; Bao, Yang-Yang; Fan, Jun",J. cell. mol. med,373,16

Herein, we synthesized an ortho ester-linked deoxycholic acid dimer (DCA-OE), which could effectively self-assemble with doxorubicin (DOX) to form stable nanoparticles (DCA-OE/DOX NPs) by a single emulsion method. DCA-based nanoparticles had a desirable size (â¼200â¯nm), morphology (spherical shape), and high drug encapsulation (drug loading content of â¼18.0 %, drug loading efficiency of â¼77.6 %). DCA-OE could improve the stability and solubility of DOX in physiological environment, while pH-sensitive ortho ester linkage endowed the ability to release DOX quickly in cancer cells. In vitro cytotoxicity and apoptosis verified drug-loaded dimer nanoparticles had similar toxicity with free DOX. Besides, these particles could efficiently accumulate and penetrate into human liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) multicellular spheroids, thus resulting in enhanced antitumor effect. In vivo tests further exhibited that DCA-OE/DOX NPs had lower systemic toxicity and higher tumor inhibition effect, and its tumor inhibition rate was 84.1 %, which was far more than free DOX (49.3 %). Therefore, the strategy to link functional small molecules with ortho ester has great potentials in specific delivery of anticancer drugs.","Xu, Jiaxi; Fang, Qin; Yang, Longshun; Gao, Jialu; Xue, Yanbing; Wang, Xin; Tang, Rupei",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,373,14

In HIV-1 infection cases, assessing the efficacy of treatment interventions that are superimposed on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has benefited tremendously from the development of sensitive HIV-1 DNA and RNA quantitation assays. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of Rhesus macaques is similar in many key aspects to human HIV-1 infection and consequently this non-human primate (NHP) model has and continues to prove instrumental in evaluating HIV prevention, treatment and eradication approaches. Cell and tissue associated HIV-1 viral nucleic acids have been found to serve as useful predictors of disease outcome and indicators of treatment efficacy, highlighting the value of and the need for sensitive detection of viruses in cells/tissues from infected individuals or animal models. However, viral nucleic acid detection and quantitation in such sample sources can often be complicated by high nucleic acid input (that is required to detect ultralow level viruses in, for example, cure research) or inhibitors, leading to reduced detection sensitivity and under-quantification, and confounded result interpretation. Here, we present a step-by-step procedure to quantitatively recover cell/tissue associated viral DNA and RNA, using SIV-infected Rhesus macaque cells and tissues as model systems, and subsequently quantify the viral DNA and RNA with an ultrasensitive SIV droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay and reverse transcription ddPCR (RT-ddPCR) assay, respectively, on the Raindance ddPCR platform.

METHODS: Questionnaire survey was conducted from 2020-02-10 to 2020-02-20, with the combination form of convenience sampling and ""Link-tracking related sampling"". We designed the questionnaires, forwarded them to individuals or WeChat group chats, and had the participants fill out the questionnaires on mobile phones, to evaluate their healthcare seeking time and intention, as well as their sense of trust towards online consultation when they had ocular discomforts or trauma. RESULTS: Totally 458 males (51.3%) and 435 females (48.7%) responded and a total of 893 questionnaires were included. Our data shows that 26.5%, 33.3%, and 40.2% of the respondents respectively from low, medium and high risk area chose online consultation during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the hospital visiting rates were 45.1%, 30.3%, 24.6% in corresponding area. We also demonstrated that gender, age, education level, regional economic development, and the region-level risk classifications have impacts on the consultation methods of the population. Compared to females (39.3%), more males (60.7%) intended to accept online medicine, and the participants from highly developed area preferentially chose virtual medical advisory service (68.2%),while the hospital visiting rates of less developed area (65.2%) was much higher than that in developed area (34.8%). Interestingly, geographic risk level had dramatic influence on the participants' sense of trust towards online consultation. CONCLUSION: Virtual online consultations were more favorable among Chinese population during COVID-19 outbreak, and were potential to facilitate clinician-patient communication. However, a balance should be achieved between online consultations and face-to-face communication, to avoid human-to-human coronavirus transmission, and to resolve patients' problems.","Feng, Hua; Cai, Li; Zhang, Yi; Wu, Yue-Ming; Jiang, Shu",Intern.

Following infection, the early expressed viral protein NSP1 binds the ribosome, represseses translation and induces mRNA degradation, while the host elicits anti-viral response. The mechanisms enabling viral mRNAs to escape this multifaceted repression remain obscure. Here we show that expression of NSP1 leads to destabilization of multi-exon cellular mRNAs, while intron-less transcripts, such as viral mRNAs and anti-viral interferon genes, remain relatively stable. We identified a conserved and precisely located cap-proximal RNA element devoid of guanosines that confers resistance to NSP1-meidated translation inhibition. Importantly, the primary sequence rather than the secondary structure is critical for protection. We further show that the genomic 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits an IRES-like activity and promotes expression of NSP1 in an eIF4E-independent and Torin-1 resistant manner. Upon expression, NSP1 enhances cap-independent translation. However, the sub-genomic 5UTRs are highly sensitive to eIF4E availability, rendering viral propagation partially sensitive to Torin-1. The combined NSP1-mediated degradation of spliced mRNAs and translation inhibition of single-exon genes, along with the unique features present in the viral 5UTRs, ensure robust expression of viral mRNAs. These features can be exploited as potential therapeutic targets.","Slobodin, Boris; Sehrawat, Urmila; Lev, Anastasia; Ogran, Ariel; Fraticelli, Davide; Hayat, Daniel; Zuckerman, Binyamin; Ulitsky, Igor; Ben-Shmuel, Amir; Levy, Haim; Bar-David, Elad; Dikstein, Rivka",,373,10

We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs during the initial 10 days of testing (March 10-19, 2020). During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria. We present the data overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During the 10-day study period, the combined census of the study EDs was 2157 patient encounters. A total of 283 tests were ordered in the ED. The majority of patients were 18-64 years of age, male, non-Hispanic white, had an Emergency Severity Index score of three, did not have a fever, and were discharged from the ED. A total of 29 (10.2%) tested positive. Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%). All other criteria were reported in 5.51-43.0% of persons being tested. Having contact with a person under investigation was significantly more common in those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative (63% vs 24.5%, respectively). The majority of patients in both results groups had at least two qualifying criteria for testing (75.2%). CONCLUSION: In this review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs in the first 10 days of testing, we found that 10.2% of those tested were identified as positive.

SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor to invade human cells. Thus, ACE2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study is to investigate the ACE2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We compared ACE2 expression levels across 31 normal human tissues between males and females and between younger (ages &#8804; 49 years) and older (ages > 49 years) persons using two-sided Student's t test. We also investigated the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune signatures in various tissues using Pearson's correlation test. RESULTS: ACE2 expression levels were the highest in the small intestine, testis, kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue, and were the lowest in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscle. ACE2 showed medium expression levels in the lungs, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland. ACE2 was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older persons in any tissue. In the skin, digestive system, brain, and blood vessels, ACE2 expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females. In the thyroid and lungs, ACE2 expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females, respectively, and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs and infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally. The different host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may partially explain why males and females, young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity. This study provides new insights into the role of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Li, Meng-Yuan; Li, Lin; Zhang, Yue; Wang, Xiao-Sheng",Infect Dis Poverty,373,26

METHODOLOGY: The study involved 60 prellingually deaf patients aged 10 to 23 years with oral speech skills. To assess the quality of the CI processor tuning, in addition to traditional methods, a special battery of psychoacoustic tests was used. The first block of tests assessed the perception of the basic characteristics of sound signals (duration, temporal structure, spectrum, timbre) and was used to assess the initial setting. The second block of tests, intended for patients with experience using CI, included tasks to distinguish acoustically similar and dynamically changing signals, etc. RESULTS: At the end of the initial CI setup session, patients with short signal perception problems were identified. Adjusting the frequency of electrical stimulation in patients has increased their ability to distinguish between sounds. During the second tuning session of the CI processor, 6 months later, a group of patients with difficulties in perceiving acoustic information in the low-frequency range was identified - distinguishing melodic intervals, changing the pitch of sounds, highlighting the voice of the target speaker. The «problem¼ patients underwent additional correction of the CI processor setting and the corresponding auditory training, which improved the test performance and subjective perception of sounds. CONCLUSION: The use of psychoacoustic tests expands the possibilities of fine tuning the CI processor, taking into account the individual characteristics of the patient's auditory perception at different stages of CI use, especially in «problem¼ patients.","Koroleva, I V; Ogorodnikova, E A; Levin, S V; Pak, S P; Kusovkov, V E; Yanov, Y K",Vestn Otorinolaringol,373,24

Further, technological, organisational, legal and regulatory, individual, financial, and cultural aspects were identified as the major barriers to the successful implementation of telemedicine in SSA. A list of recommendations was produced for each telemedicine barrier. CONCLUSION: Our review shows current trends in telemedicine application, as well as highlighting critical barriers for consideration by healthcare decision makers. This review offers a number of recommendations to support wider implementation and sustainable usage of telemedicine in SSA.","Dodoo, Joana Eva; Al-Samarraie, Hosam; Alzahrani, Ahmed Ibrahim",Int J Med Inform,373,16

Methods: Seven COVID-19 patients admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical Collage were enrolled. All patients underwent initial and follow-up chest HRCT. The main CT features and semi-quantitative score which represent disease severity among different clinical types were evaluated. Result: On initial CT, the main abnormalities observed in common and severe cases respectively were pure ground glass opacities (GGOs) and patchy consolidation surrounded by GGOs. Critical cases had multiple consolidation surrounded by wide range of GGOs distributed in the whole lung fields. The scope and density score in common (4.5 and 5), severe (9.5 and 9.5) and critical (19 and 12) cases were increased by gradient. On follow-up CT, common and severe types manifested as decreasing density of lesion, absorbed consolidation and GGOs. Critical cases showed progression of the disease. The extent and progression scores in common and severe patients were significantly decreased, while the range score of patients with critical disease reached the highest points, accompanied with an increase in the density score. Conclusion: CT scanning can accurately assess the severity of COVID-19, and help to monitor disease transformation during follow-up among different clinical conditions.","Jiang, Yuting; Guo, Dandan; Li, Chunping; Chen, Tianwu; Li, Rui",,373,5

It remains unknown about small area-based spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: We obtained county-based counts of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the United States from January 22 to May 13, 2020 (N=1,386,050). We characterized the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through detecting weekly hotspots of newly confirmed cases using Spatial and Space-Time Scan Statistics and quantifying the trends of incidence of COVID-19 by county characteristics using the Joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: Along with the national plateau reached in early April, COVID-19 incidence significantly decreased in the Northeast (estimated weekly percentage changes [EWPC]: -16.6%), but remained increasing in the Midwest, South and West Regions (EWPCs: 13.2%, 5.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Higher risks of clustering and incidence of COVID-19 were consistently observed in metropolitan vs rural counties, counties closest to core airports, most populous counties, and counties with highest proportion of racial/ethnic minority counties. However, geographic differences in the incidence have shrunk since early April, driven by a significant decrease in the incidence in these counties (EWPC range: -2.0% - -4.2%) and a consistent increase in other areas (EWPC range: 1.5% - 20.3%). CONCLUSIONS: To substantially decrease the nationwide incidence of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures should be continuously implemented, especially in geographic areas with increasing risks, including rural areas. Spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of COVID-19 should be considered in decision-making on the timeline of re-opening for states and localities.","Wang, Yun; Liu, Ying; Struthers, James; Lian, Min",Clin. infect. dis,373,21

The angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) has been identified as the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. As such, it is now receiving renewed attention as a potential target for anti-viral therapeutics. We review the physiological functions of ACE2 in the cardiovascular system and the lungs, and how the activation of ACE2/MAS/G protein coupled receptor contributes in reducing acute injury and inhibiting fibrogenesis of the lungs and protecting the cardiovascular system. In this perspective, we predominantly focus on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on ACE2 and dysregulation of the protective effect of ACE2/MAS/G protein pathway vs. the deleterious effect of Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone. We discuss the potential effect of invasion of SARS-CoV-2 on the function of ACE2 and the loss of the protective effect of the ACE2/MAS pathway in alveolar epithelial cells and how this may amplify systemic deleterious effect of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAS) in the host. Furthermore, we speculate the potential of exploiting the modulation of ACE2/MAS pathway as a natural protection of lung injury by modulation of ACE2/MAS axis or by developing targeted drugs to inhibit proteases required for viral entry.","Samavati, Lobelia; Uhal, Bruce D",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,373,24

Adolescence and early adulthood are peak times for the onset of mental health difficulties. Exposure to a pandemic during this vulnerable developmental period places young people at significant risk of negative psychological experiences. The objective of this research was to summarise existing evidence on the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of 12-25-year-olds. METHODS: A rapid review of the published peer-reviewed literature, published between 1985 and 2020, using PsycINFO (Proquest) and Medline (Proquest) was conducted. Narrative synthesis was used across studies to identify key themes and concepts. RESULTS: This review found 3,359 papers, which was reduced to 12 papers for data extraction. Results regarding the prevalence of psychological difficulties in youth were mixed, with some studies finding this group experience heightened distress during an infectious disease outbreak, and others finding no age differences or higher distress among adults. Gender, coping, self-reported physical health and adoption of precautionary measures appear to play a role in moderating the psychological impact of an infectious disease outbreak. Most studies were conducted after the peak of an epidemic/pandemic or in the recovery period. CONCLUSIONS: More longitudinal research with young people, particularly adolescents in the general population, before and during the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak is needed to obtain a clear understanding of how best to support young people during these events.","O039,; Reilly, Aileen; Tibbs, Maria; Booth, Ailbhe; Doyle, Elizabeth; McKeague, Beth; Moore, Jeff",Ir J Psychol Med,373,6

CPS is considered one of the few systems of Parliament in application compared to other parliamentary systems and was often used by countries in times of crises experienced by them in an attempt to overcome those crises, given that this system limits the power of actual decision-making to the legislative authority. CPS can be distinguished from other parliamentary political systems both presidential and parliamentary through several things, the most prominent of which is based on the idea of the relationship between its powers being included in favor of the legislative authority, and not on the basis of cooperation as is the case in the parliamentary system, or on the basis of complete separation as it is the situation in the presidential system. The results indicated that the success of the implementation of the council system depends on the nature of the ruling system that will be adopted and the philosophy that is based on it, in addition to the necessity of a high degree of political awareness.

BC emissions declined 70% (eastern China) and 48% (northern China) compared to the first half of January. In northern China, under the stagnant conditions of the first week of the lockdown, the observed BC concentrations rose unexpectedly (29%) even though the BC emissions fell. The emissions declined substantially thereafter until a week after the lockdown ended. On the contrary, in eastern China, BC emissions dropped sharply in the first week and recovered synchronously with the end of the lockdown.","Jia, Mengwei Evangeliou Nikolaos Eckhardt Sabine Huang Xin Gao Jian Ding Aijun Stohl Andreas",Geophysical Research Letters,373,1

Further, COVID-19 pandemic-associated ARDS is now a major cause of mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of ALI is explained by injury to both the vascular endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. The disruption of the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers occurs in response to both systemic and local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies that evaluate the association of genetic polymorphisms with disease risk did not yield many potential therapeutic targets to treat and revert lung injury. This failure is probably due in part to the phenotypic complexity of ALI/ARDS, and genetic predisposition may be obscured by the multiple environmental and behavioral risk factors. In the last decade, new research has uncovered novel epigenetic mechanisms that control ALI/ARDS pathogenesis, including histone modifications and DNA methylation. Enzyme inhibitors such as DNMTi and HDACi may offer new alternative strategies to prevent or reverse the vascular damage that occurs during lung injury. This review will focus on the latest findings on the molecular mechanisms of vascular damage in ALI/ARDS, the genetic factors that might contribute to the susceptibility for developing this disease, and the epigenetic changes observed in humans, as well as in experimental models of ALI/ADRS.","Bossardi Ramos, Ramon; Adam, Alejandro Pablo",Adv Exp Med Biol,373,16

Motivating adolescents to adhere to measures such as social distancing can be challenging, since adolescents are relatively more affected by them, while experiencing virtually no personal health benefit. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to impact the social environment of adolescents in schools, as some media sources have reported bullying and stigmatisation of students with an Asian appearance. This study aims to explore the experiences of adolescents regarding their Health-Protective Behaviour (HPB), as well as the prevalence and expression of stigma towards ethnic minorities within the context of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a cross-sectional mixed-methods study, including two independent online questionnaires. An adapted version of the ""HPB"" questionnaire (n = 528) and the ""Measure of Disease-Related Stigma (MDRS)"" questionnaire (n = 380), were administered to Dutch adolescents of 10-16 years old, attending primary or secondary school. Furthermore, 15 interviews were held with eight male and seven female adolescents. All data collection took place between March 17 and April 20, 2020. Results show that adolescents perceive COVID-19 as a threat to other peoples' health, rather than their own, and report adherence to public health measures in the interest of older and more vulnerable members of their community. We found no convincing evidence for widespread misinformation or stigmatising of certain ethnic groups among adolescents related to COVID-19 during this study. Participants acknowledged such behaviour happened in the early stages of the pandemic, before this study was initiated. Adolescents are a vital group for public health researchers to engage with during a pandemic, even when reaching them can be challenging.","Preusting, L C; Raadsen, M P; Abourashed, A; Voeten, H A C M; Wagener, M N; de Wit, E; van Gorp, E C M; Doornekamp, L",PLoS One,373,1

The COVID19 outbreak represents a true accelerator of digital evolution in medical communication and education. During the pandemic the European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) offered a bundle of free updates about COVID19 management in children through a series of webinars for members and non members alike.The success of this initiative promotes the emerging importance of social media channels and online platforms for the #PedsICU community. METHODS: ESPNIC collected anagraphics and relevant data related to the participants and speakers including specialty, institution and country (written consents were obtained). A short evaluation form was also submitted to the attendees. RESULTS: 10 webinars were realized with more than 10 hours of discussion, driven by 41 international speakers from 3 continents. More than 1500 attendees participated in this initiative from more than 40 countries live and some 500 has watched the recordings later on. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID19 pandemic webinars were considered as a cheap and reliable way to diffuse information dealing with the management and the epidemiology of the children all over the world. This platformtool allowed attendees from all over the world to join this educational activity and share rapidly important information for daily practice.","Zanin, A.; Gyorgyi, Z.; Sperotto, F.; Medina, A.; Kneyber, M.",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,373,10

This fast-tracked paper (published quickly) from China on COVID-19 is written by dermatologists at the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan. Dermatology clinic staff may be at risk because protective equipment is not routinely available, and skin lesions might possibly transmit the virus indirectly. These authors suggest preventive measures based on experience in this and previous coronavirus outbreaks. Online consultation for non-urgent patients reduces the numbers of patients attending clinics. Nurse-led triage, to identify patients with possible COVID-19, at the entrances of hospital and skin clinics directs patients with a cough or fever to a specific COVID-19 area and a dermatologist is consulted if the fever might be related to skin disease. Clinic staff wear N95 masks and observe hand hygiene during consultations. Patients are admitted to a ward only if routine blood tests and chest CT scans exclude COVID-19. Triage will not detect patients who are showing no symptoms but who are developing the disease, so the hospital should provide an on-call expert team to discuss inpatients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 and refer them to radiology, respiratory or intensive care colleagues as required. Confirmed cases are managed following local policies. Skin disorders in COVID-19 inpatients can usually be managed remotely using photographs, email and teleconferencing. If necessary a multidisciplinary team (a team of medical staff from different specialties) can meet in the clean area of the isolation ward. If the dermatologist must see the patient, all records should be provided in advance to minimise exposure time. With these precautions, as of 20th February 2020 no infected patients were detected in the Wuhan Dermatology Department. This is a summary of the study: Emergency management for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for the dermatology department.","Tao, J; Song, Z; Yang, L; Huang, C; Feng, A; Man, X",Br J Dermatol,373,20

Under current circumstances, medical organizations encountered difficulties in organizing quarantine, purchasing disinfecting drugs, personal protective equipment and additional medical equipment, the need to introduce an emergency mode of work for employees, so there was a need to review and develop new rules for the work of medical workers during a coronavirus pandemic. Medicine is one of the progressive fields of scientific and entrepreneurial activity, making high demands on medical workers. Therefore, continuous training of doctors and medical personnel is caused by vital necessity, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the legislative level provides for the re-profiling of doctors of other specialties and the involvement of teachers and general medical organizations in the fight against coronavirus infection. In the face of the threat of the spread of coronavirus infection, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, it was decided to transfer educational institutions to distance learning using educational technologies, which also requires great efforts on the part of doctors, as medical specialists need not only a large amount of theoretical knowledge , but also a sufficient number of practical skills. The article presents statistical and analytical data, the results of surveys of Russian doctors, expert estimates that allow us to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of educational programs and courses for the professional retraining of doctors in the context of a coronavirus pandemic.","Shkrumyak, A R; Kaminina, N N; Aksenova, E I",Probl Sotsialnoi Gig Zdravookhranenniiai Istor Med,373,12

This mixed-methods study aimed (1) to analyse describe the self-perceived health and protective measures linked to COVID-19 of homeless people in one of the largest and poorest cities in France, and (2) to assess which skills and resources they used to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The quantitative survey addressed these questions among a sample of 995 homeless people living either on the streets, in homeless shelters or in squats/slums, whereas the qualitative survey was constructed from 14 homeless interviewees. Both data collections were carried out between June and July 2020. Results showed that COVID-19 infection was clearly perceived by homeless people as a risk, but the experience of being homeless placed this risk among several others. Different practices of protection were observed according to the type of living place. Lockdown of the general population severely impacted the survival systems of the populations furthest from housing, with alarming rates of people without access to water or food. 77% of homeless participants reported that they encountered significant financial difficulties. All interviewees were particularly attentive to their health, with awareness and even a familiarity with the risks of infectious diseases long before the pandemic. Using a capability framework, our study showed a predominant lack of external health-related resources for homeless people, while internal health-related resources were more developed than expected. None of the places and lifestyles studied was favourable to health: collective shelters due to a greater restriction of people's choices, slums and street life due to a greater lack of basic resources.","Allaria, Camille Loubière Sandrine Mosnier Emilie Monfardini Elisa Auquier Pascal Tinland Aurelie",SSM - Population Health,373,24

This study aims to investigate the impact of three pre-COVID-19 interventions and of the COVID-19 UK-epidemic and the first UK national lockdown on overcrowding within University College London Hospital Emergency Department (UCLH ED). The three interventions: target the influx of patients at ED (A), reduce the pressure on in-patients' beds (B) and improve ED processes to improve the flow of patents out from ED (C). METHODS: We collected overcrowding metrics (daily attendances, the proportion of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (four-hours target) and the reduction in overall waiting time) during 01/04/2017-31/05/2020. We then performed three different analyses, considering three different timeframes. The first analysis used data 01/04/2017-31/12-2019 to calculate changes over a period of 6 months before and after the start of interventions A-C. The second and third analyses focused on evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, comparing the first 10 months in 2020 and 2019, and of the first national lockdown (23/03/2020-31/05/2020). RESULTS: Pre-COVID-19 all interventions led to small reductions in waiting time (17%, p < 0.001 for A and C; an 9%, p = 0.322 for B) but also to a small decrease in the number of patients leaving within 4 h of arrival (6.6,7.4,6.2% respectively A-C,p < 0.001). In presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance and waiting time were reduced (40% and 8%; p < 0.001), and the number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival was increased (6%,p < 0.001). During the first lockdown, there was 65% reduction in attendance, 22% reduction in waiting time and 8% increase in number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (p < 0.001). Crucially, when the lockdown was lifted, there was an increase (6.5%,p < 0.001) in the percentage of people leaving within 4 h, together with a larger (12.5%,p < 0.001) decrease in waiting time. This occurred despite the increase of 49.6%(p < 0.001) in attendance after lockdown ended. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed results pre-COVID-19 (significant improvements in waiting time with some interventions but not improvement in the four-hours target), may be due to indirect impacts of these interventions, where increasing pressure on one part of the ED system affected other parts. This underlines the need for multifaceted interventions and a system-wide approach to improve the pathway of flow through the ED system is necessary. During 2020 and in presence of the COVID-19 epidemic, a shift in public behaviour with anxiety over attending hospitals and higher use of virtual consultations, led to notable drop in UCLH ED attendance and consequential curbing of overcrowding. Importantly, once the lockdown was lifted, although there was an increase in arrivals at UCLH ED, overcrowding metrics were reduced. Thus, the combination of shifted public behaviour and the restructuring changes during COVID-19 epidemic, maybe be able to curb future ED overcrowding, but longer timeframe analysis is required to confirm this.","Panovska-Griffiths, J; Ross, J; Elkhodair, S; Baxter-Derrington, C; Laing, C; Raine, R",BMC Emerg Med,373,1

As a result, this study can assist governments in prioritizing control measures when tackling possible future waves of the pandemic and future pandemics of a similar nature. Materials and methods Following a comprehensive review of the relevant literature and media articles, extraction of the cluster data of eight countries was performed by way of hand searching of reputable databases. The following data was extracted and arranged in an accessible online sheet: The total number of clusters and cases for each cluster type, the total number of cases in the country, date and source of the data collection. The cluster types were divided into 10 main types, with subcategories for specified types. Each country had 2 members assigned for data validation and review. Results Among the eight included countries, we have found 3905 clusters and a total number of 1907974 patients. Indoor settings (mass accommodation and residential facilities) comprised the highest number of both number of clusters (3313/3905) and infected patients (1836870/1907974), while the outdoor ones comprised 592 clusters and 71104 patients. Mass accommodation was associated with the highest number of cases in 5 of the 8 countries. Social events and residential settings were responsible for the highest number of cases in South Korea and Malaysia, respectively. In the USA, workplace facilities have reported 165 clusters of infection including 122 food production facilities.

Along with their traditional relevance in helminth immunity and allergy, eosinophils have been progressively attributed important roles in a number of homeostatic and pathologic situations. This review aims at summarizing available evidence about eosinophils functions in homeostasis, infections, allergic and autoimmune disorders, and solid and hematological cancers.Their structural and biological features have been described, along with their physiological behavior. This includes their chemokines, cytokines, granular contents, and extracellular traps. Besides, pathogenic- and eosinophilic-mediated disorders have also been addressed, with the aim of highlighting their role in Th2-driven inflammation. In allergy, eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. They are also fundamentally involved in autoimmune disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In infections, eosinophils are involved in protection not only from parasites but also from fungi, viruses, and bacteria. In solid cancers, local eosinophilic infiltration is variably associated with an improved or worsened prognosis, depending on the histotype. In hematologic neoplasms, eosinophilia can be the consequence of a dysregulated cytokine production or the result of mutations affecting the myeloid lineage.Recent experimental evidence was thoroughly reviewed, with findings which elicit a complex role for eosinophils, in a tight balance between host defense and tissue damage. Eventually, emerging evidence about eosinophils in COVID-19 infection was also discussed.","Folci, Marco; Ramponi, Giacomo; Arcari, Ivan; Zumbo, Aurora; Brunetta, Enrico",Adv. exp. med. biol,373,4

Genetic instability, such as chromosomal instability, is associated with the tumorigenesis of LSCC. Copy number variations (CNVs) have been demonstrated to contribute to the genetic diversity of tumor pathogenesis. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has emerged as a high-throughput genomic technology that facilitates the aggregation of high-resolution data of cancer-associated genomic imbalances. In the present study, a total of 38 primary supraglottic LSCC cases were analyzed by high-resolution array-based CGH (aCGH) to improve the understanding of the genetic alterations in LSCC. Additionally, integration with bioinformatic analysis of microarray expression profiling data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database provided a fundamental method for the identification of putative target genes. Genomic CNVs were detected in all cases. The size of net genomic imbalances per case ranged between a loss of 682.3 Mb (~24% of the genome) and a gain of 1,958.6 Mb (~69% of the genome). Recurrent gains included 2pter-q22.1, 3q26.1-qter, 5pter-p12, 7p22.3p14.1, 8p12p11.22, 8q24.13q24.3, 11q13.2q13.4, 12pter-p12.2, 18pter-p11.31 and 20p13p12.1, whereas recurrent losses included 3pter-p21.32, 4q28.1-q35.2, 5q13.2-qter, 9pter-p21.3 and monosomy 13. Gains of 3q26.1-qter were associated with tumor stage, poor differentiation and smoking history. Additionally, through integration with bioinformatic analysis of data from the GEO database, putative target oncogenes, including sex-determining region Y-box 2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1, fragile X-related gene 1, disheveled segment polarity protein 3, defective n cullin neddylation 1 domain containing 1, insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 and CCDC26 long non-coding RNA, and tumor suppressor genes, such as CUB and sushi multiple domains 1, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, protocadherin 20, serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 5 and Nei like DNA glycosylase 3, were identified in supraglottic LSCC. Supraglottic LSCC is a genetically complex tumor type and aCGH was demonstrated to be effective in the determination of molecular profiles with higher resolution. The present results enable the identification of putative target oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene mapping in supraglottic LSCC.","Li, Dongjie; Wang, Xianfu; Lu, Shunfei; Wang, Ping; Wang, Xin; Yin, Wanzhong; Zhu, Wei; Li, Shibo",Oncol Lett,373,10

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the viral spike protein have potential to both prevent and treat COVID-19, and reduce the risk of severe disease and death. Here, we describe AZD7442, a combination of two mAbs, AZD8895 (tixagevimab) and AZD1061 (cilgavimab), that simultaneously bind to distinct non-overlapping epitopes on the spike protein receptor binding domain to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Initially isolated from individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the two mAbs were designed to extend their half-lives and abrogate effector functions. The AZD7442 mAbs individually prevent the spike protein from binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, blocking virus cell entry. Together, these two mAbs create a higher barrier to viral escape and a wider breadth of coverage, neutralizing all known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prophylactic AZD7442 administration prevented infection, while therapeutic administration accelerated virus clearance from lung. In an ongoing Phase I study in healthy participants (NCT04507256), 300 mg intramuscular AZD7442 provided SARS-CoV-2 serum geometric mean neutralizing titers >10-fold above those of convalescent sera for [≥]3 months, which remained 3-fold above those of convalescent sera 9 months post-AZD7442 administration. Approximately 1-2% of serum AZD7442 levels were detected in nasal mucosa, a site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Extrapolation of the time course of serum AZD7442 concentrations suggests AZD7442 may provide up to 12 months of protection and benefit individuals at high-risk of COVID-19.","Loo, Yueh-Ming; McTamney, Patrick M; Arends, Rosalinda H; Gasser, Robert A; Abram, Michael E; Aksyuk, Anastasia; Diallo, Seme; Flores, Daniel J; Kelly, Elizabeth J; Ren, Kuishu; Roque, Richard; Rosenthal, Kim; Streicher, Katie; Tuffy, Kevin M; Bond, Nicholas J; Cornwell, Owen; Bouquet, Jerome; Cheng, Lily I; Dunyak, James; Huang, Yue; Rosenbaum, Anton I; Andersen, Hanne; Carnahan, Robert H; Crowe, James E; Kuehne, Ana I; Herbert, Andrew S; Dye, John M; Bright, Helen; Kallewaard, Nicole L; Pangalos, Menelas N; Esser, Mark T",,373,10

However, a gender vision of health begs the question: Why are pregnant women not considered a risk group for COVID-19? The answer is clear: historically, most community scientific studies have not considered female gender, or pregnancy as a state, to be a focus of special interest or effort. Unfortunately, this bias seems to be maintained in the COVID-19 epidemic: most current guidelines for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy apply the same standard criteria as for the general population. This pandemic is an opportunity to begin redressing this historic gender bias against pregnant women, and to achieve this, we recommend two actions that are easy to implement, and would have a large impact. First, routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women with clinical or epidemiological suspicion, regardless of gestational age or the clinical severity. Second, routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women at admission for delivery. These actions are essential to understand the true impact of COVID-19 throughout pregnancy, and will improve how we manage many aspects of pre- and postnatal care. It is the scientific community's responsibility to guide, even to anticipate, the recommendations of our respective governments' health policies.

The new COVID-19 pandemic has caused acute respiratory distress syndrome in many patients, which poses a risk of super-infections including Candida strains causing oral candidiasis as well as invasive fungal infections. The aim of the study was to examine the association between COVID-19 and oral and general candidiasis. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The i2b2 data repository platform was used to analyze the interrelations between COVID-19, oral candidiasis, and total candidiasis in a hospital population. ICD diagnoses codes were used to generate queries on total numbers and demographic data on COVID-19, oral candidasis, total candidasis, and COVID-19 with each form of candidasis. RESULTS: From the 889 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 106 (12%) were diagnosed with candidiasis at large and 14 (1.6%) had oral candidiasis. The odds ratio (OR) for COVID-19 in the presence of oral candidiasis was 2.01 (95% CI 1.1870 to 3.4143, P = .094) and the OR for COVID-19 in the presence of candidiasis was 3.73 (95% CI 3.0419 to 4.5847, P < .0001 ). African American were disproportionally affected and comprised about 40% of the COVID-19/candidiasis groups. CONCLUSIONS: Total candidiasis was significantly associated with increased risk for COVID-19, whereas oral candidiasis showed an insignificant trend. The dental practitioner should be aware of the importance of unexplained oral and systemic candidiasis as a potential harbinger of T and B cell immunosuppression associated with viral in-fections.

Here, we present an efficient, competitive serological assay that can simultaneously determine an individual's seroreactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and determine the proportion of anti-Spike antibodies that block interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. In this approach based on the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), we present natively folded viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing antigens via avidin-biotin interactions. Sera are then competed with soluble ACE2-Fc, or with a higher-affinity variant thereof, to determine the proportion of ACE2 blocking anti-RBD antibodies. Assessment of sera from 144 SARS-CoV-2 patients ultimately revealed that a remarkably consistent and high proportion of antibodies in the anti-RBD pool targeted the epitope responsible for ACE2 engagement (83% ± 11%; 50% to 107% signal inhibition in our largest cohort), further underscoring the importance of tailoring vaccines to promote the development of such antibodies.IMPORTANCE With the emergence and continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and of the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an urgent need for improved understanding of how the body mounts an immune response to the virus. Here, we developed a competitive SARS-CoV-2 serological assay that can simultaneously determine whether an individual has developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and measure the proportion of these antibodies that block interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) required for viral entry. Using this assay and 144 SARS-CoV-2 patient serum samples, we found that a majority of anti-RBD antibodies compete for ACE2 binding. These results not only highlight the need to design vaccines to generate such blocking antibodies but also demonstrate the utility of this assay to rapidly screen patient sera for potentially neutralizing antibodies.","Byrnes, James R; Zhou, Xin X; Lui, Irene; Elledge, Susanna K; Glasgow, Jeff E; Lim, Shion A; Loudermilk, Rita P; Chiu, Charles Y; Wang, Taia T; Wilson, Michael R; Leung, Kevin K; Wells, James A",MSphere,373,12

METHODS: An online population-based survey was distributed via social media over an 8-week period from April 13, 2020, to June 8, 2020. RESULTS: Data were derived from 2,222 adults (57% female; 40% racial/ethnic minorities).

METHODS: We searched databases including Embase, Medline, medRxiv and Google Scholar up to 26 August 2020 for studies describing COVID-19 outcomes in PLWH and conducted a meta-analysis of higher quality studies. RESULTS: We identified 1908 studies and included 19 in the review. In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality [hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62-2.34] compared with people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalized cohorts (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI: 1.12-2.27) and studies of PLWH across all settings (hazard ratio 2.08, 95% CI: 1.69-2.56).

This study aims to analyze the fit of a school trolley (0.89 m height from the top to the bottom of the handle) for children with different heights based on kinematic variables and the rate of perceived effort (RPE). A 3D motion capture system was used to analyze the kinematics of the thorax and hip during walking without load and when pulling a trolley loaded with 15% of the child's body weight (BW). The RPE was recorded at the end of each trial. The height of the subjects was clustered using Ward´s hierarchical cluster, and two groups were identified: Group 1: 120-139.9 cm; and Group 2: 140-160 cm. No differences were found between groups in the kinematics or RPE. In conclusion, a standard school trolley fits well to children with heights from 120-160 cm.Practitioner Summary: No studies have determined the suitability of school trolleys for children of different heights. This study aims to analyze the fit of a school trolley for children with different heights based on the kinematics and rate of perceived effort. The major finding is that a standard school trolley fits children with heights from 120 to 160 cm well and that the height of the school trolley was between 59% and 68% of the children's heights.","Orantes-Gonzalez, E; Heredia-Jimenez, J",Ergonomics,373,22

METHODS: A retrospective single center observational study of admitted patients (n = 421) age greater than 60 and a positive COVID-19 test. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine if presenting with AMS was associated with adverse outcomes. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of mortality (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.57), intubation (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09-2.12) and AKI (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.13-1.78) in patients that presented with AMS. CONCLUSIONS: During a global pandemic, prognostic indicators are vital to help guide the clinical course of patients, reduce healthcare cost, and preserve life.

METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive, mechanically ventilated COVID-19-ARDS patients were compared to two historical ARDS sub-populations 1:1 matched for PaO2/FiO2 or for compliance of the respiratory system. Gas exchange, hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were recorded at 5 and 15 cmH2O PEEP. CT scan variables were measured at 5 cmH2O PEEP. RESULTS: Anthropometric characteristics were similar in COVID-19-ARDS, PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS. The PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS populations (both with PaO2/FiO2 106 ± 59 mmHg) had different respiratory system compliances (Crs) (39 ± 11 vs 49.9 ± 15.4 ml/cmH2O, p = 0.03). The Compliance-matched-ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS had similar Crs (50.1 ± 15.7 and 49.9 ± 15.4 ml/cmH2O, respectively) but significantly lower PaO2/FiO2 for the same Crs (160 ± 62 vs 106.5 ± 59.6 mmHg, p < 0.001). The three populations had similar lung weights but COVID-19-ARDS had significantly higher lung gas volume (PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS 930 ± 644 ml, COVID-19-ARDS 1670 ± 791 ml and Compliance-matched-ARDS 1301 ± 627 ml, p < 0.05). The venous admixture was significantly related to the non-aerated tissue in PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS (p < 0.001) but unrelated in COVID-19-ARDS (p = 0.75), suggesting that hypoxemia was not only due to the extent of non-aerated tissue. Increasing PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH2O improved oxygenation in all groups. However, while lung mechanics and dead space improved in PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS, suggesting recruitment as primary mechanism, they remained unmodified or worsened in COVID-19-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS, suggesting lower recruitment potential and/or blood flow redistribution. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-ARDS is a subset of ARDS characterized overall by higher compliance and lung gas volume for a given PaO2/FiO2, at least when considered within the timeframe of our study.","Chiumello, Davide; Busana, Mattia; Coppola, Silvia; Romitti, Federica; Formenti, Paolo; Bonifazi, Matteo; Pozzi, Tommaso; Palumbo, Maria Michela; Cressoni, Massimo; Herrmann, Peter; Meissner, Konrad; Quintel, Michael; Camporota, Luigi; Marini, John J; Gattinoni, Luciano",Intensive Care Med,373,1

The current immunity level $\hat i$ in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number $R_0$), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on $R_0$, $\hat i$ and the overall effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures $p_{Min}$ needed to prevent a future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level $\hat i$ plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different $R_0$ and $\hat i$ it is shown that regions with lower $R_0$ and low $\hat i$ may now need higher preventive measures ($p_{Min}$) compared with other regions having higher $R_0$ but also higher $\hat i$, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity.","Britton, Tom; Trapman, Pieter; Ball, Frank",,373,16

Data analysis assists such organisations in providing information that could help in decision-making processes. For this purpose, both national and regional health authorities provided health data for further processing and analysis. Shared data must comply with existing data protection and privacy regulations. Therefore, a robust de-identification procedure must be used, and a re-identification risk analysis should also be performed. De-identified data embodies state-of-the-art approaches in Data Protection by Design and Default because it requires the protection of direct and indirect identifiers (not just direct). This article highlights the importance of assessing re-identification risk before data disclosure by analysing a data set of individuals infected by Covid-19 that was made available for research purposes. We stress that it is highly important to make this data available for research purposes and that this process should be based on the state of the art methods in Data Protection by Design and by Default. Our main goal is to consider different re-identification risk analysis scenarios since the information on the intruder side is unknown. Our conclusions show that there is a risk of identity disclosure for all of the studied scenarios. For one, in particular, we proceed to an example of a re-identification attack. The outcome of such an attack reveals that it is possible to identify individuals with no much effort.","Carvalho, Tânia; Faria, Pedro; Antunes, Luís; Moniz, Nuno",PLoS One,373,16

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey assessing organization-level, team-level, and clinician-level inpatient workforce adaptations. PARTICIPANTS: Hospital medicine leadership at 27 academic medical centers in the USA. KEY RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 36 centers responded to the survey (75%). Widespread practices included frequent staffing reassessment, organization-level changes such as geographic cohorting and redeployment of non-hospitalists, and exempting high-risk healthcare workers from direct care of patients with COVID-19. Several practices were implemented but discontinued, such as reduction of non-essential services, indicating that they were less sustainable for large centers. CONCLUSION: These findings provide guidance for inpatient leaders seeking to identify sustainable practices for COVID-19 inpatient workforce planning.","Linker, Anne S; Kulkarni, Shradha A; Astik, Gopi J; Keniston, Angela; Sakumoto, Matthew; Eid, Shaker M; Burden, Marisha; Leykum, Luci K",J. gen. intern. med,373,16

This novel virus acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. Because of this, it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 hACE2 interaction. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict whether these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages, at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor ACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different betacoronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat SARS-related coronaviruses to infect human cells.","Armijos-Jaramillo, Vinicio; Yeager, Justin; Muslin, Claire; Perez-Castillo, Yunierkis",,373,16

METHODS: A retrospective study of patients with rCDI who underwent FMT from May 26, 2020, to September 30, 2020, with stool from well-screened donors with health and infectious screening and a newly implemented strategy for COVID-19 screening with every 2-week bookend testing with stool quarantine. Patients were followed up for development of rCDI and COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 57 patients who underwent FMT for rCDI, 29 were tested for COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 22 via serology. All results were negative, except for 1 positive serology. Donor testing every 2 weeks for COVID-19 via serology and nasopharyngeal swab PCR was negative, except for 2 donors at 1 center who were excluded. Three patients had rCDI after FMT, and 1 underwent repeat FMT. One patient developed respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and tested negative via nasopharyngeal PCR. Eleven patients who underwent COVID-19 testing for elective procedures or hospitalizations tested negative. No SARS-CoV-2 transmission was noted. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate donor screening, FMT can be performed safely for rCDI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of a validated stool assay for SARS-CoV-2 will simplify this process further.","Khanna, Sahil; Tande, Aaron; Rubin, David T.; Khoruts, Alexander; Kahn, Stacy A.; Pardi, Darrell S.",Mayo Clin Proc,373,16

Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases (N=74,477) and deaths (N=2319), and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths.

Thirty-five (97.22%) samples were positive for human SaV genome in quantitative RT-PCR assay; 33 (91.67%) samples were positive in nested RT-PCR assay on partial capsid VP1 sequence and all amplicons were further analyzed separately by NGS. Among those, ten genotypes belonging to the genogroups of GI, GII, GIV, and GV were identified by NGS, including 4 major genotypes (GI.2, GI.1, GV.1 and GI.3) and 6 uncommon genotypes (GII.5, GII.1, GII.NA1, GII.3, GI.6 and GIV.1). A temporal switch of predominant genotype was observed from GI.2 to GI.1 around June 2019. Local and foreign sequences clustered together in some branches according to phylogenetic analysis, indicating frequent transmission of various lineages in different regions of the world. Environmental surveillance provides a comprehensive picture of human SaV in China. NGS-based environmental surveillance improves our knowledge on human SaV circulating in communities greatly and should be encouraged as a sensitive surveillance tool.

Even people not directly affected by the virus itself were impacted in their physical and/or mental health, as well as in their financial security, by governmental lockdown measures. We investigated whether the combination of these events had changed people's appraisal of social scenes by testing 241 participants recruited mainly in Italy, Austria, and Germany in an online, preregistered study conducted about 50 days after the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. Images depicting individuals alone, in small groups (up to four people), and in large groups (more than seven people) were rated in terms of valence, arousal, and perceived physical distance. Pre-pandemic normative ratings were obtained from a validated database (OASIS). Several self-report measures were also taken, and condensed into four factors through factor analysis. All images were rated as more arousing compared to the pre-pandemic period, and the greater the decrease in real-life physical interactions reported by participants, the higher the ratings of arousal. As expected, only images depicting large gatherings of people were rated less positively during, compared to before, the pandemic. These ratings of valence were, however, moderated by a factor that included participants' number of days in isolation, relationship closeness, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Higher scores on this factor were associated with more positive ratings of images of individuals alone and in small groups, suggesting an increased appreciation of safer social situations, such as intimate and small-group contacts. The same factor was inversely related to the perceived physical distance between individuals in images of small and large groups, suggesting an impact of lockdown measures and contagion-related worries on the representation of interpersonal space. These findings point to rapid and compelling psychological and social consequences of the lockdown measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on the perception of social groups. Further studies should assess the long-term impact of such events as typical everyday life is restored.","Massaccesi, Claudia; Chiappini, Emilio; Paracampo, Riccardo; Korb, Sebastian",Front Psychol,373,18

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this intervention on clinical outcome. METHODS: In this mono-centric, controlled, before-after study, all consecutive adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to ICU from March 13th to April 20th 2020 were included. A thromboprophylaxis protocol, including augmented LMWH dosing, individually tailored with anti-Xa measurements and twice-weekly ultrasonography screening for DVT, was implemented on March 31th 2020. Primary endpoint is one-month mortality. Secondary outcomes include two-week and three-week mortality, the incidence of VTE, acute kidney injury and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Multiple regression modelling was used to correct for differences between the two groups. RESULTS: 46 patients were included in the before group, 26 patients in the after group. One month mortality decreased from 39.13% to 3.85% (p < 0.001). After correction for confounding variables, one-month mortality was significantly higher in the before group (p = 0.02, OR 8.86 (1.46, 53.75)). The cumulative incidence of VTE and CRRT was respectively 41% and 30.4% in the before group and dropped to 15% (p = 0.03) and 3.8% (p = 0.01), respectively. After correction for confounding variables, risk of VTE (p = 0.03, 6.01 (1.13, 32.12)) and CRRT (p = 0.02, OR 19.21 (1.44, 255.86)) remained significantly higher in the before group. CONCLUSION: Mortality, cumulative risk of VTE and need for CRRT may be significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients by implementation of a more aggressive thromboprophylaxis protocol. Future research should focus on confirmation of these results in a randomized design and on uncovering the mechanisms underlying these observations.

The regulations and their application suggest an intertemporal benchmark to judge excessive pricing, deviating from previous practice. Intertemporal comparisons assume a structural shift during COVID‐19 that changes competitive conditions, related to changes in consumer behaviour. Such comparisons must also account for demand and cost changes. While the COVID‐19 regulations allow for cost‐based price increases, demand‐based increases are not explicitly accounted for, suggesting that the regulations are framed more generally as price‐gouging regulations. The differences between price‐gouging and excessive‐pricing benchmarks depends on the type of disaster‐period demand shock. They are similar following a transitory demand spike, provided sufficient time is allowed for dynamic price behaviour, but differ markedly when demand is elevated for the duration of the disaster period. Applying simple cost‐based comparisons in recently concluded cases against smaller retailers are consistent with excessive pricing, given the presence of a demand spike. To the extent that these involve persistently higher demand, cases against wholesalers and larger retailers will be more complicated, as such demand must be reflected in competitive prices.","Boshoff, Willem H.",S Afr J Econ,373,1

An early-stage detection of COVID-19 is crucial for the containment of the pandemic it has caused. In this study, a transfer learning–based COVID-19 screening technique is proposed. The motivation of this study is to design an automated system that can assist medical staff especially in areas where trained staff are outnumbered. The study investigates the potential of transfer learning–based models for automatically diagnosing diseases like COVID-19 to assist the medical force, especially in times of an outbreak. In the proposed work, a deep learning model, i.e., truncated VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group from Oxford) is implemented to screen COVID-19 CT scans. The VGG16 architecture is fine-tuned and used to extract features from CT scan images. Further principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection. For the final classification, four different classifiers, namely deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential ELM, and bagging ensemble with support vector machine (SVM) are compared. The best performing classifier bagging ensemble with SVM within 385 ms achieved an accuracy of 95.7%, the precision of 95.8%, area under curve (AUC) of 0.958, and an F1 score of 95.3% on 208 test images. The results obtained on diverse datasets prove the superiority and robustness of the proposed work. A pre-processing technique has also been proposed for radiological data.

Unfortunately, IL-12's remarkable antitumor efficacy in preclinical models has yet to be replicated in humans. Early clinical trials in the mid-1990's showed that systemic delivery of IL-12 incurred dose-limiting toxicities. Nevertheless, IL-12's pleiotropic activity, i.e., its ability to engage multiple effector mechanisms and reverse tumor-induced immunosuppression, continues to entice cancer researchers. The development of strategies which maximize IL-12 delivery to the tumor microenvironment while minimizing systemic exposure are of increasing interest. Diverse IL-12 delivery systems, from immunocytokine fusions to polymeric nanoparticles, have demonstrated robust antitumor immunity with reduced adverse events in preclinical studies. Several localized IL-12 delivery approaches have recently reached the clinical stage with several more at the precipice of translation. Taken together, localized delivery systems are supporting an IL-12 renaissance which may finally allow this potent cytokine to fulfill its considerable clinical potential. This review begins with a brief historical account of cytokine monotherapies and describes how IL-12 went from promising new cure to ostracized black sheep following multiple on-study deaths. The bulk of this comprehensive review focuses on developments in diverse localized delivery strategies for IL-12-based cancer immunotherapies. Advantages and limitations of different delivery technologies are highlighted. Finally, perspectives on how IL-12-based immunotherapies may be utilized for widespread clinical application in the very near future are offered.","Nguyen, Khue G.; Vrabel, Maura R.; Mantooth, Siena M.; Hopkins, Jared J.; Wagner, Ethan S.; Gabaldon, Taylor A.; Zaharoff, David A.",Front Immunol,373,16

Estudios realizados con infecciones experimentales hablan que al menos en ciertas condiciones esta infección puede extenderse al tracto respiratorio inferior, al mismo tiempo que el virus puede actuar sobre el epitelio respiratorio. Experimentos in vitro con células del sistema inmune y del tracto respiratorio inferior sugieren mecanismos de actuación directamente ligados a la producción de citocinas proinflamatorias. Existen evidencias tanto in vivo como in vitro que muestran que los rinovirus pueden estimular a las células epiteliales bronquiales para que produzcan citocinas y quimocinas proinflamatorias. Al mismo tiempo pueden estimular el sistema nervioso colinérgico y no colinérgico, incrementan la producción de ICAM-1, y pueden dar lugar a respuestas de los linfocitos T inespecíficas o a replicación de los mismos en directa relación con la infección vírica.Por otra parte se ha comprobado una mayor producción de cistenil leucotrienos en las secreciones de los pacientes afectos de broncospasmo La infección experimental con rinovirus conduce a un aumento de la sintomatología clínica y de la hiperreactividad bronquial esta última asociada a un aumento de eosinófilos y de proteína catiónica en esputo.

Studies carried out with experimental infections report that at least in certain conditions, this infection may spread to the lower respiratory tract as the virus acts on the respiratory epithelium. In vitro experiments with cells from the immune system and lower respiratory tract suggest that the mechanisms of action are directly linked to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both in vivo and in vitro evidence shows that rhinoviruses may stimulate bronchial epithelial cells to produce cytokines and pro-inflammatory chemokines. They may also stimulate the cholinergic and non-cholinergic nervous system, increasing the production of ICAM-1 and may give rise to a T-lymphocyte non-specific response or to T-lymphocyte replication in direct relation with viral infection. In addition, greater production of cysteinyl leukotrienes has been observed in the secretions of patients with bronchospasm Experimental infection with Rhinovirus increases clinical symptomatology and bronchial hyperreactivity. The latter is associated with increased eosinophils and cationic proteins in sputum The above findings suggest that multiple cellular pathways are involved in the induction of exacerbations of asthma induced by the virus. In addition, the possible stimulating role of exposure to allergens in sensitized patients would also increase allergic inflammation Because of the limited therapeutic efficacy of steroids in reducing exacerbations, new treatment strategies based on greater insight into the physiopathology of the role of viruses in asthma are needed","Boquete, M.; Carballada, F.",Allergologia et Immunopathologia,373,20

It is theorized that ACE inhibitors (ACE‐Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 by upregulating ACE‐2 expression, but ACE‐I/ARB discontinuation is associated with clinical deterioration. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ACE‐I and ARB use is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), macrovascular thrombosis and in‐hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective, single‐centre study of 558 hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID‐19 admitted from 1 March to 30 April 2020, followed up until 24 May 2020. AKI and macrovascular thrombosis were primary end‐points, and in‐hospital mortality was a secondary end‐point. RESULTS: AKI occurred in 126 (23.1%) patients, 34 (6.1%) developed macrovascular thrombi, and 200 (35.9%) died. Overlap propensity score‐weighted analysis showed no significant effect of ACE‐I/ARB use on the risk of occurrence of the specified end‐points. On exploratory analysis, severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases odds of macrovascular thrombi (OR: 8.237, 95% CI: 1.689–40.181, P = 0.009). The risk of AKI increased with advancing age (OR: 1.028, 95% CI: 1.011–1.044, P = 0.001) and diabetes (OR: 1.675, 95% CI: 1.065–2.633, P = 0.025). Immunosuppression was associated with lower risk of AKI (OR: 0.160, 95% CI: 0.029–0.886, P = 0.036). Advancing age, dependence on care, male gender and eGFR < 60 mL min(−1)/1.73 m(2) increased odds of in‐hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: We did not identify an association between ACE‐I/ARB use and AKI, macrovascular thrombi or mortality. This supports the recommendations of the European and American Societies of Cardiology that ACE‐Is and ARBs should not be discontinued during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Tetlow, S.; Segiet‐Swiecicka, A.; O’Sullivan, R.; O’Halloran, S.; Kalb, K.; Brathwaite‐Shirley, C.; Alger, L.; Ankuli, A.; Baig, M.S.; Catmur, F.; Chan, T.; Dudley, D.; Fisher, J.; Iqbal, M.U.; Puczynska, J.; Wilkins, R.; Bygate, R.; Roberts, P.",J Intern Med,373,20

We tested the impact of providing community support, training, and clinical packages of varied intensity on depression screening and management for heavy drinking patients in Latin American primary healthcare. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quasi-experimental study involving 58 primary healthcare units in Colombia, Mexico and Peru randomized to receive: (1) usual care (control); (2) training using a brief clinical package; (3) community support plus training using a brief clinical package; (4) community support plus training using a standard clinical package. Outcomes were proportion of: (1) heavy drinking patients screened for depression; (2) screen-positive patients receiving appropriate support; (3) all consulting patients screened for depression, irrespective of drinking status. RESULTS: 550/615 identified heavy drinkers were screened for depression (89.4%). 147/230 patients screening positive for depression received appropriate support (64%). Amongst identified heavy drinkers, adjusting for country, sex, age and provider profession, provision of community support and training had no impact on depression activity rates. Intensity of clinical package also did not affect delivery rates, with comparable performance for brief and standard versions. However, amongst all consulting patients, training providers resulted in significantly higher rates of alcohol measurement and in turn higher depression screening rates; 2.7 times higher compared to those not trained. CONCLUSIONS: Training using a brief clinical package increased depression screening rates in Latin American primary healthcare.

Furthermore, ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Clarification of ACE2-related mechanisms is crucial for the understanding of COVID-19 and other oxidative stress and inflammation-related processes. In rat and monkey brain, we discovered that the intracellular ACE2 and its products Ang 1–7 and alamandine are highly concentrated in the mitochondria and bind to a new mitochondrial Mas-related receptor MrgE (MrgE) to produce nitric oxide. We found MrgE expressed in neurons and glia of rodents and primates in the substantia nigra and different brain regions. In the mitochondria, ACE2 and MrgE expressions decreased and NOX4 increased with aging. This new ACE2/MrgE/NO axis may play a major role in mitochondrial regulation of oxidative stress in neurons, and possibly other cells. Therefore, dysregulation of the mitochondrial ACE2/MrgE/NO axis may play a major role in neurodegenerative processes of dopaminergic neurons, where mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a crucial role. Since ACE2 binds SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the mitochondrial ACE2/MrgE/NO axis may also play a role in SARS-CoV-2 cellular effects.","Valenzuela, Rita; Rodriguez-Perez, Ana I.; Costa-Besada, Maria A.; Rivas-Santisteban, Rafael; Garrido-Gil, Pablo; Lopez-Lopez, Andrea; Navarro, Gemma; Lanciego, Jose L.; Franco, Rafael; Labandeira-Garcia, Jose L.",Redox Biol,373,26

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a HIPAA-compliant application that allows physicians to call patients from their personal cell phones is associated with an increase in physician productivity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a 100% sample of Medicare claims and longitudinal physician-level data to examine whether physician use of a smartphone application that enables physician-patient phone calls is associated with changes in Medicare patient volume and services. We compared early adopters of the application, 31,577 physicians providing Part B services who initiated use of the application between January 2014 and December 2017, with later adopters, 22,988 physicians who initiated use between January 2018 and July 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Physician productivity was measured as total Medicare Part B beneficiaries, total Part B services provided, the number of Part B beneficiaries with any evaluation and management (E&M) service, the total number of E&M services provided, and the average number of E&M services provided per beneficiary. KEY RESULTS: Following application use, there was a 0.52 increase (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.85) in the monthly number of Part B beneficiaries seen. This difference translates to a 0.8% increase in Part B beneficiaries. Similar increases were observed for the number of unique beneficiaries for which the physician provided E&M services—a 0.50 increase (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.73) or 1.2%. There was a 0.43 increase (95% CI: 0.07 to 0.78) in monthly E&M services (0.7% increase). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians who used a freely available smartphone application modestly increased their total Medicare beneficiary volume and total number of E&M services provided, suggesting potential improvements in physician productivity.

Despite safeguards to resume elective procedures, patients remain apprehensive of contracting COVID-19 during hospitalization and recovery. We investigated symptomatic COVID-19 infection in patients undergoing operating-room procedures during the spring 2020 outbreak in Fairfield County, CT, a heavily affected New York Metropolitan area. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 419 operating-room patients in Danbury and Norwalk Hospitals between 3/16/20 and 5/19/20. COVID-19 infection was assessed through test results or documented well-being within 2 weeks postdischarge. Variables studied were procedure classification, length of stay, and discharge disposition. Postprocedural COVID-19 infection was analyzed using binomial tests comparing rates to state-mandated infection data. RESULTS: Six patients developed COVID-19 after 212 urgent-elective and 207 emergent procedures. Overall postprocedural infection risk was equivalent to community infection risk (P > .05). No infections occurred in 1–2 day stays or urgent-elective procedures with discharge home (both P < .05). Discharges home reduced the risk to one-sixth of community spread (P = .03). Risk of infection doubled in hospitalizations > 5 days (P = .05) and quadrupled in discharges to extended care facilities (P = .01). DISCUSSION: Operating-room procedures did not increase the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection during an outbreak. Urgent-elective and emergent procedures during further outbreaks appear safe when anticipating short stays with discharges home. When anticipating prolonged hospitalization or discharges to facilities, appropriate delay of urgent-elective procedures may minimize risk of infection.","Manuia, Emi P.; Ostapenko, Alexander; Liechty, Shawn T.; Kleiner, Daniel E.",JSLS,373,26

The replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus (PanAd3-RSV) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA-RSV) vaccines were shown to be safe and immunogenic in young healthy adults. Here we report an extension to this first-in-man vaccine trial to include healthy older adults aged 60–75 years. Methods We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of MVA-RSV given by intra-muscular (IM) injection (n = 6), two doses of IM PanAd3-RSV given 4-weeks apart (n = 6), IM PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (n = 6), intra-nasal (IN) spray of PanAd3-RSV prime and IM MVA-RSV boost 8-weeks later (n = 6), or no vaccine (n = 6). Safety measures included all adverse events within one week of vaccination and blood monitoring. Immunogenicity measures included serum antibody responses (RSV- and PanAd3-neutralising antibody titres measured by plaque-reduction neutralisation and SEAP assays, respectively), peripheral B-cell immune responses (frequencies of F-specific IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells and memory B-cells by ex vivo and cultured dual-colour ELISpot assays respectively), and peripheral RSV-specific T-cell immune responses (frequencies of IFNγ-producing T-cells by ex vivo ELISpot and CD4+/CD8+/Tfh-like cell frequencies by ICS/FACS assay). Results The vaccines were safe and well tolerated. Compared with each individual baseline immunity the mean fold-changes in serum RSV-neutralising antibody, appearance and magnitude of F-specific IgG and IgA ASCs and expansion of CD4+/CD8+ IFNγ-producing T-cells in peripheral circulation were comparable to the results seen from younger healthy adults who received the same vaccine combination and dose. There were little/no IgA memory B-cell responses in younger and older adults. Expansion of IFNγ-producing T-cells was most marked in older adults following IM prime, with balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. The RSV-specific immune responses to vaccination did not appear to be attenuated in the presence of PanAd3 (vector) neutralising antibody. Conclusions PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV was safe and immunogenic in older adults and the parallel induction of RSV-specific humoral and cellular immunity merits further assessment in providing protection from severe disease.","Green, Christopher A.; Sande, Charles J.; Scarselli, Elisa; Capone, Stefania; Vitelli, Alessandra; Nicosia, Alfredo; Silva-Reyes, Laura; Thompson, Amber J.; de Lara, Catherine M.; Taylor, Kathryn S.; Haworth, Kathryn; Hutchings, Claire L.; Cargill, Tamsin; Angus, Brian; Klenerman, Paul; Pollard, Andrew J.",Journal of Infection,373,16

Periods of health crisis such as the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic add to the enormous burden of the media in keeping people constantly informed. Extant literature suggests that when a message is released through the media, what matters most is not what is said but how it is said. As such, the media could either mitigate or accentuate the crisis depending on the major frames adopted for the coverage. Methods: The study utilises content analysis. Data were sourced from LexisNexis database and two websites that yielded 6145 items used for the analysis. Nine predetermined frames were used for the coding. Results: Human Interest and fear/scaremongering frames dominated the global media coverage of the pandemic. We align our finding with the constructionist frame perspective which assumes that the media as information processor creates 'interpretative packages' in order to both reflect and add to the 'issue culture' because frames that paradigmatically dominate event coverage also dominate audience response. The language of the coverage of COVID-19 combines gloom, hope, precaution and frustration at varied proportions. Conclusion: We conclude that global media coverage of COVID-19 was high, but the framing lacks coherence and sufficient self-efficacy and this can be associated with media's obsession for breaking news. The preponderance of these frames not only shapes public perception and attitudes towards the pandemic but also risks causing more problems for those with existing health conditions due to fear or panic attack.","Ogbodo, Jude Nwakpoke; Onwe, Emmanuel Chike; Chukwu, Joseph; Nwasum, Chinedu Jude; Nwakpu, Ekwutosi Sanita; Nwankwo, Simon Ugochukwu; Nwamini, Samuel; Elem, Stephen; Iroabuchi Ogbaeja, Nelson",Health promotion perspectives,373,9

We sought to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiac injury and hypertension during the current coronavirus pandemic. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The clinical data of 366 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed. The clinical signs and laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Two independent, experienced clinicians reviewed and analyzed the data. RESULTS: Cardiac injury was found in 11.19% (30/268) of enrolled patients. 93.33% (28/30) of cardiac injury cases were in the severe group. The laboratory findings indicated that white blood cells, neutrophils, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate, and lactic dehydrogenase were positively associated with cardiac injury marker. Compared with healthy controls, the 190 patients without prior hypertension have higher AngⅡ level, of which 16 (8.42%) patients had a rise in blood pressure to the diagnostic criteria of hypertension during hospitalization, with a significantly increased level of the cTnI, procalcitonin, angiotensin-II (AngⅡ) than those normal blood pressure ones. Multivariate analysis indicated that elevated age, cTnI, the history of hypertension, and diabetes were independent predictors for illness severity. The predictive model, based on the four parameters and gender, has a good ability to identify the clinical severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients (area under the curve: 0.932, sensitivity: 98.67%, specificity: 75.68%). CONCLUSION: Hypertension, sometimes accompanied by elevated cTnI, may occur in COVID-19 patients and become a sequela. Enhancing Ang II signaling, driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection, might play an important role in the renin-angiotensin system, and consequently lead to the development of hypertension in COVID-19.","Chen, Ganxiao; Li, Xun; Gong, Zuojiong; Xia, Hao; Wang, Yao; Wang, Xuefen; Huang, Yan; Barajas-Martinez, Hector; Hu, Dan",PLoS One,373,4

In order to identify factors that might influence people’s attitudes towards COVID-19 policies and engagement in mitigation measures, we carried out a cross-sectional study in Germany. Altogether, n = 808 participants completed our questionnaire concerning items on demographics, media consumption, risk perception, and trust in health authorities, as well as willingness to receive a vaccination. An overwhelming majority of our participants perceived SARS-CoV-2 as a health threat (85.7%), and almost two thirds (63.5%) mentioned they would get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 when a vaccination was available. A greater likelihood of vaccination intention was associated with being male (71.5% male vs. 60% female, p < 0.05), left-wing voting, trusting health authorities, using public media as an information source about COVID-19, and, in particular, perceiving COVID-19 as a health threat.

Emerging studies of placenta, embryos, and cerebral organoids suggest that fetal organs including brain could also be vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, a case study from Paris has reported transient neurological complications in neonates born to pregnant mothers. However, it remains poorly understood whether the fetal brain expresses cellular components that interact with Spike protein (S) of coronaviruses, which facilitates fusion of virus and host cell membrane and is the primary protein in viral entry. To address this question, we analyzed the expression of known (ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN) and novel (ZDHHC5, GOLGA7, and ATP1A1) S protein interactors in publicly available fetal brain bulk and single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis across multiple regions of fetal brain spanning 8 weeks post conception (wpc)−37wpc indicates that two of the known S protein interactors are expressed at low levels with median normalized gene expression values ranging from 0.08 to 0.06 (ACE2) and 0.01–0.02 (TMPRSS2). However, the third known S protein interactor FURIN is highly expressed (11.1–44.09) in fetal brain. Interestingly, all three novel S protein interactors are abundantly expressed throughout fetal brain development with median normalized gene expression values ranging from 20.38–21.60 (ZDHHC5), 92.47–68.35 (GOLGA7), and 65.45–194.5 (ATP1A1). Moreover, the peaks of expression of novel interactors is around 12–26wpc. Using publicly available single cell RNA sequencing datasets, we further show that novel S protein interactors show higher co-expression with neurons than with neural progenitors and astrocytes. These results suggest that even though two of the known S protein interactors are present at low levels in fetal brain, novel S protein interactors are abundantly present and could play a direct or indirect role in SARS-CoV-2 fetal brain pathogenesis, especially during the 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimesters of pregnancy.","Varma, Parul; Lybrand, Zane R.; Antopia, Mariah C.; Hsieh, Jenny",Front Neurosci,373,24

The NIMHD Framework was used to identify SDOHs that may change for families during COVID-19. METHODS: Parents were recruited via Prolific (N = 321) and completed questions about COVID-19 family impacts on employment, income, access to food and healthcare, and psychosocial functioning, including discrimination. It was hypothesized that NHW families of children with asthma and BIPOC families would endorse greater negative outcomes relative to NHW parents of healthy children. RESULTS: BIPOC families experienced greater food insecurity and discrimination relative to NHW parents of healthy children. When compared with the NHW healthy group, COVID-19 resulted in greater parent-reported resource losses for both BIPOC groups and greater reductions in healthcare access for both asthma groups. Children with asthma and BIPOC children had greater distress surrounding COVID-19. BIPOC and NHW parents of children with asthma reported greater worries about resource losses due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic is widening inequities for BIPOC families, especially for families of children with asthma.

The aim of the study was to develop a Checklist to assist nurses to appraise the conduct of wound treatment when undertaken by the patient. A three-phase mixed methods study was conducted. A systematic and evidence-based approach to developing and using structured observations for the study of health behaviour guided the process of developing, piloting and refining the Checklist. The resulting ""Self-Treatment of Wounds for Venous Leg Ulcers Checklist"" (STOW-V Checklist V1.0) can assist the nurse to evaluate the conduct of key self-treatment behaviours in the areas of equipment and workspace, hand hygiene, wound dressing removal, skin care, wound cleansing and debridement, wound assessment, wound dressing application, and compression therapy application. The growing recognition that patients can benefit when involved in care, the need to enact self-management because of COVID-19, and the ever present competition for healthcare funding and resources are compelling reasons for patients, care providers, and healthcare services to afford the self-management approach, and associated interventions such as self-treatment, greater consideration.

In addition to contributing to the worst unregulated drug poisoning crisis in Canada's history, the policy framework prohibiting non-medical access to certain drugs has exacerbated numerous public health and safety concerns. An alternative approach to prohibition is for government to retake control of the currently illegal drug market through legal regulatory mechanisms. This paper presents the work of an ongoing international collaboration of organizations advocating legal regulation and some of the knowledge translation tools used to educate and engage the public on legal regulation within Canada. In order to encourage thinking and decision-making among stakeholders in a productive way, models of legal regulation for various substances were created as discussion tools to emerge values and considerations supporting different approaches. The models focus on five questions: 1) who has access to drugs; 2) how access is obtained; 3) where drugs can be accessed; 4) how much people can obtain; and 5) where drugs can be consumed. The models were presented to stakeholders in the context of an international meeting on legal regulation, and then adapted to a more “user-friendly” form: a collaborative negotiation-based Regulation Game, which was presented at a workshop in Montréal, Canada. Engaging different stakeholder groups on policy choices of legal regulation revealed initial barriers that we feel more confident can be overcome through creative and innovative tools such as the Regulation Game. Use of the game as a foundation for more traditional focus groups could be effective in reducing barriers to fulsome policy discussions on legal regulation.","Bernstein, Scott E.; Amirkhani, Emily; Werb, Dan; MacPherson, Donald",Int J Drug Policy,373,15

Infection with porcine cytomegalovirus and enterovirus, serotype V13, was universal in both herds. In herd A, as neonatal antibody to PCMV and reovirus type 3 declined, the majority of pigs became infected with these viruses at five to eight weeks and 11 weeks respectively. The majority of pigs showed seroconversion to these viruses. Enteroviruses were excreted continuously from eight weeks and one adenovirus was isolated at 11 weeks. In herd B, a similar pattern of PCMV excretion and antibody development was found in one group of pigs but infection in the other group occurred much earlier and all pigs in this group had a poor antibody response following infection. The coronavirus of vomiting-and-wasting disease (VWD) was isolated from some three-week-old pigs which had moderate, rising antibody titres. Adenoviruses, including type 4, and enteroviruses were also recovered from pigs at an earlier age than those in herd A and in addition a parvovirus was isolated. Porcine cytomegalovirus, porcine adenovirus type 4 and the coronavirus (VWD) were considered to be the only viruses which may have been directly associated with the respiratory disease.

In this study, we identified an identical ribosomal frameshift motif among the three bat–human pairs of viruses and strong purifying selection after jumping from bats to humans. This represents genetic signatures of coronaviruses that are related to bat‐to‐human transmission. To further trace the early human‐to‐human transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 in North America, a geographically stratified genome‐wide association study (North American isolates and the remaining isolates) and a retrospective study were conducted. We determined that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 1,059.C > T and 25,563.G > T were significantly associated with approximately half of the North American SARS‐CoV‐2 isolates that accumulated largely during March 2020. Retrospectively tracing isolates with these two SNPs was used to reconstruct the early, reliable transmission history of North American SARS‐CoV‐2, and European isolates (February 26, 2020) showed transmission 3 days earlier than North American isolates and 17 days earlier than Asian isolates.

Another concern is the lack of definitive treatment for this disease. The researchers tried different treatment options which are not specific. The current study aims to identify potential small molecule inhibitors against the main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2 by the computational approach. MAIN METHODS: In this study, a virtual screening procedure employing docking of the two different datasets from the ZINC database, including 1615 FDA approved drugs and 4266 world approved drugs were used to identify new potential small molecule inhibitors for the newly released crystal structure of main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the following to validate the docking result, molecular dynamics simulations were applied on selected ligands to identify the behavior and stability of them in the binding pocket of the main protease in 150 nanoseconds (ns). Furthermore, binding energy using the MMPBSA approach was also calculated. KEY FINDINGS: The result indicates that simeprevir (Hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pyronaridine (antimalarial agent) could fit well to the binding pocket of the main protease and because of some other beneficial features including broad-spectrum antiviral properties and ADME profile, they might be a promising drug candidate for repurposing to the treatment of COVID-19.

In the United Kingdom, lung disease affects approximately 1 in 5 people, resulting in over 700,000 hospital admissions each year. People with respiratory conditions have several symptoms and can require multiple health care visits and investigations before a diagnosis is made. The tests available can be difficult to perform, especially if a person is symptomatic, leading to poor quality results. A new, easy-to-perform, point-of-care test that can be performed in any health care setting and that can differentiate between various respiratory conditions would have a significant, beneficial impact on the ability to diagnose respiratory diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to use a new handheld device (Inflammacheck) in different respiratory conditions to measure the exhaled breath condensate hydrogen peroxide (EBC H(2)O(2)) and compare these results with those of healthy controls and with each other. This study also aims to determine whether the device can measure other parameters, including breath humidity, breath temperature, breath flow dynamics, and end tidal carbon dioxide. METHODS: We will perform a single-visit, cross-sectional observational study of EBC H(2)O(2) levels, as measured by Inflammacheck, in people with respiratory disease and volunteers with no known lung disease. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, breathing pattern disorder, and interstitial lung disease as well as volunteers with no history of lung disease will be asked to breathe into the Inflammacheck device to record their breath sample. RESULTS: The results from this study will be available in 2022, in anticipation of COVID-19–related delays. CONCLUSIONS: This study will investigate the EBC H(2)O(2), as well as other exhaled breath parameters, for use as a future diagnostic tool.","Fox, Lauren; Gates, Jessica; De Vos, Ruth; Wiffen, Laura; Hicks, Alexander; Rupani, Hitasha; Williams, Jane; Brown, Thomas; Chauhan, Anoop J",JMIR Res Protoc,373,9

The aim of the study was to examine the disability-inclusiveness of government responses to COVID-19 in four South American Countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. METHODS: We conducted documentary research, using framework analysis to analyse reports, legislation, decrees, and other official documents that communicated measures taken in response to the pandemic, published from February 1st until May 22nd, 2020. We included documents reporting measures that affected disabled people either directly (measures specifically designed for disabled people) or indirectly (measures for the general population). We developed an analytical framework based on recommendations for disability-inclusive response to COVID-19 published by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Carribean, the World Health Organisation, and other international organisations. RESULTS: We analysed 72 documents. The findings highlight that while some positive measures were taken, the needs of disabled people were not fully considered. Several countries published recommendations for a disability-inclusive response to COVID-19, without ensuring their translation to practice. All countries took at least some steps to ensure access to financial support, health, and education for disabled people, but at the same time they also implemented policies that had a detrimental impact on disabled people. The populations that are most exposed to the impacts of COVID-19, including disabled people living in institutional care, were protected in several cases only by recommendations rather by legislation. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates how the official government responses taken by four countries in the region – while positive, in several aspects – do not fully address the needs of disabled people, thus further disadvantaging them. In order to ensure response to COVID − 19 is disability inclusive, it is necessary to translate recommendations to practice, consider disabled people both in mainstream policy and in disability-specific measures, and focus on the long-term reconstruction phase.","Sakellariou, Dikaios; Malfitano, Ana Paula Serrata; Rotarou, Elena S.",Int J Equity Health,373,1

Inflammation concerns on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided into mild, severe or critical groups according to disease condition. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve. RESULTS: Significantly, disease severity was associated with age (R = -0.564, P < 0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R = -0.534, P < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R = -0.535, P < 0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R = -0.308, P < 0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R = -0.422, P < 0.001), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (R = -0.322, P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R = -0.604, P < 0.001), ferroprotein (R = -0.508, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (R = -0.650, P < 0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R = -0.54, P < 0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R = 0.56, P < 0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R = -0.585, P < 0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R = 0.299, P < 0.001).

The aim of this study was to explore the post-crisis psychological distress among residents in Taiwan after the SARS epidemic. Methods The target population consisted of a nationwide representative sample of residents aged ≥ 18 years. Data were collected using computer assisted telephone interview systems by stratified random sampling according to geographic area. The survey (n = 1278) was conducted in November 2003, about 4 months after resolution of the SARS crisis in Taiwan. The maximum deviation of sampling error at the 95% confidence level was ± 2.74%. Psychological distress was measured by a question related to subject's changes in perception of life, plus the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the correlation of psychological distress. Results About 9.2% of the participants reported that their perceptions of life became more pessimistic following the SARS crisis. The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was 11.7%. Major predictors of higher levels of pessimism after the SARS epidemic included demographic factors, perception of SARS and preparedness, knowing people or having personal experiences of SARS-related discrimination, and individual worries and psychiatric morbidity. The correlates of symptomatic cases, as indicated by the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale, included age ≥ 50 years, senior high school graduate, and worries about recurrence of SARS. Conclusion Psychological distress was significantly correlated with demographic factors and perception regarding the SARS epidemic. It is suggested that marketing of mental health education should be segmented according to age and education level, which should enhance crisis communication for newly emerging infectious diseases among community populations.","Peng, Eugene Yu-Chang; Lee, Ming-Been; Tsai, Shang-Ta; Yang, Chih-Chien; Morisky, Donald Edward; Tsai, Liang-Ting; Weng, Ya-Ling; Lyu, Shu-Yu",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association,373,26

We employed a mammalian two-hybrid system to screen all the viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for the protein–protein interactions. RESULTS: Our study detected 48 interactions, 14 of which were firstly reported here. Unlike Nsp1 of SARS-CoV, Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 has the most interacting partners among all the viral proteins and likely functions as a hub for the viral proteins. Five self-interactions were confirmed, and five interactions, Nsp1/Nsp3.1, Nsp3.1/N, Nsp3.2/Nsp12, Nsp10/Nsp14, and Nsp10/Nsp16, were determined to be positive bidirectionally. Using the replicon reporter system of SARS-CoV-2, we screened all viral Nsps for their impacts on the viral replication and revealed Nsp3.1, the N-terminus of Nsp3, significantly inhibited the replicon reporter gene expression. We found Nsp3 interacted with N through its acidic region at N-terminus, while N interacted with Nsp3 through its NTD, which is rich in the basic amino acids. Furthermore, using purified truncated N and Nsp3 proteins, we determined the direct interactions between Nsp3 and N protein. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided a basis for understanding the functions of coronavirus proteins and supported the potential of interactions as the target for antiviral drug development.

Recently, studies have found thyroid function abnormalities in COVID-19 cases which were interpreted as euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) or destructive thyroiditis. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the thyroid function status and thyroid autoimmunity in COVID-19 patients. Material and Method. 205 patients were included. The medical history and laboratory parameters at admission were collected from medical records. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), thyroid peroxidase antibody, and thyroglobulin antibody were measured, and patients were classified according to thyroid function status. RESULTS: 34.1% of the patients were euthyroid. Length of hospitalization (p < 0.001), rate of oxygen demand (p < 0.001), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (p=0.022) were lower, and none of the euthyroid patients died. 108 (52.6%) patients were classified to have ESS, 57 were classified as mild, and 51 were moderate. The inflammatory parameters were higher in patients with moderate ESS. In cluster analysis, a high-risk group with a lower median FT3 value (median = 2.34 ng/L; IQR = 0.86), a higher median FT4 value (median = 1.04 ng/dL; IQR = 0.33), and a lower median TSH value (median = 0.62 mIU/L; IQR = 0.59) included 8 of 9 died patients and 25 of the 31 patients that were admitted to ICU. Discussion. Length of hospitalization, oxygen demand, ICU admission, and mortality were lower in euthyroid patients. Moreover, none of the euthyroid patients died.

Method: During the 4 weeks immediately prior to and following the beginning of the German government's strategy for containment of Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 on March 23, 2020, 14 highly trained athletes (VO(2peak): 3,162 ± 774 ml/min; 500-m best time: 117.9 ± 7.9 s) wore a multi-sensor smartwatch to allow continuous assessment of heart rate, physical activity, and sleep duration. Result: In comparison to before lockdown, the overall weekly training time and the average length of each session of training during the lockdown decreased by 27.6% (P = 0.02; d = 0.91) and 15.4% (P = 0.36; d = 0.36), respectively. At the same time, the number of sessions involving specific (i.e., canoeing and kayaking) and non-specific (i.e., running, cycling) training, respectively, did not change (P = 0.36–0.37; d = 0.34–0.35). The number of sessions involving strength (+17.4%; P = 0.03; d = 0.89) or other types of training (+16.7%; P = 0.06; d = 0.75) increased during the lockdown with 2.8–17.5% more training time involving a heart rate <60%, 82–88, 89–93, or 94–100% of individual peak heart rate (HR(peak)) (P = 0.03–0.86; d = 0.07–1.38), and 4.3–18.7% less time with a heart rate of 60–72 or 73–83% HR(peak) (P = < 0.001–0.0.26; d = 0.44–2.24). The daily duration of sleep was ~30 min (6.7%) longer during the lockdown (P < 0.001; d = 1.53) and the overall time spent lying down was 17% greater (P < 0.001; d = 2.26); whereas sitting time (−9.4%; P = 0.003; d = 1.23), the duration of light (15 min; −7.3%; P = 0.04; d = 0.83), and moderate (−18.6%; P = 0.01; d = 1.00) physical activity other than training (−9.4%; P = 0.22; d = 0.00) were all lower during lockdown. Conclusion: The present data revealed that following the German lockdown for containment of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, highly trained kayakers and canoeists spent less overall time training each week (−27.6%) with, on average, shorter training sessions (−15.1%) and less light-to-moderate physical activity outside of training. Moreover, they performed more strength training sessions per week, and all engaged in more training at intensities >82 and <60% of HR(peak) and spent longer periods lying down and sleeping during the lockdown.","Zinner, Christoph; Matzka, Manuel; Leppich, Robert; Kounev, Samuel; Holmberg, Hans-Christer; Sperlich, Billy",Front Sports Act Living,373,2

Although a major physiological function of PF4 is to promote blood coagulation, this cytokine is involved in innate and adaptive immunity in events when platelets are activated in response to infections. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have abnormal coagulation activities, and severe patients develop higher D-dimer levels. D-dimers are small protein products present in the blood after blood clots are degraded by fibrinolysis. To prevent clotting, heparin is often clinically used in COVID-19 patients. Some clinical procedures for the management of COVID-19 patients may include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and renal replacement therapy (CRRT), which also require the use of heparin. Anti-PF4 antibodies are frequently detected in severe patients and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can also be observed. PF4 and its role in HIT as well as in pathologies seen in COVID-19 patients define a potential therapeutic option of using blocking antibodies in the treatment of COVID-19.","Cai, Zheng; Greene, Mark I.; Zhu, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Hongtao",Antibodies (Basel),373,10

Methods: Using routine statistics we estimate number of women affected by delays to screening. We used published research to estimate the proportion of screening age women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and progression rates to cancer. Under two scenarios we estimate the impact of COVID-19 on cervical cancer over one screening cycle (3y at ages 25-49 and 5y at ages 50-64). The duration of disruption in both scenarios is six months. In the first scenario all women have their screening interval is extended by six months. In the second some women (those who would have been screened during the disruption) miss one screening cycle, but most women have no delay. Results: Both scenarios result in similar numbers of excess cervical cancers: 630 vs. 632 (both 4.3 per 100,000 women in the population). However the scenario in which some women miss one screening cycle creates inequalities - they would have much higher rates of excess cancer: 41.5 per 100,000 screened women compared to those with a six month delay (5.9 per 100,000 screened). Conclusion: To ensure equity for those affected by COVID-19 related screening delays additional screening capacity will need to be paired with prioritising the screening of overdue women.","Castanon, A.; Rebolj, M.; Pesola, F.; Sasieni, P.",,373,20

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to describe eHealth use by patients with rheumatoid arthritis in France. The secondary objectives were to identify associations between patient demographics and disease characteristics and the use of eHealth tools, and assess their expectations of eHealth. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, multicenter study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, were recruited from 5 university hospitals (Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand, Limoges, Montpellier, and Toulouse). Patients completed an anonymous self-questionnaire, including demographic data, evaluating their eHealth use (ie, access, support, frequency of use, type of use, and reason for use). The rheumatologist in charge of each patient completed an independent medical questionnaire on disease characteristics, activity of rheumatoid arthritis, and treatments. Data were collected between December 2018 and July 2019. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 575 participants, with a mean age of 62 (SD 13) years, 447 (77.7%) of whom were female. Overall, 82.2% (473/575) of the participants had access to eHealth through a computer (402/467, 86.1%), tablet (188/467, 40.2%), or smartphone (221/467, 47.3%). Of these, 36.4% (170/467) of the participants used the internet for health in general, and 28.7% (134/467) used it specifically for rheumatoid arthritis–related reasons. All these 134 patients used eHealth to learn about disease pathology, and 66.4% (89/134) of them used it as a tool to help monitor rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients (87/125, 69.6%) had a paper file, 19.2% (24/125) used a digital tool (spreadsheets, 10/125, 8%; mobile app, 9/125, 7.2%; or website, 5/125, 4%), and 24.8% (31/125) did not use any tools for monitoring. Few patients (16/125, 12.8%) used tools for treatment reminders. About 21.6% (27/125) of the patients using eHealth used a specific app for rheumatoid arthritis. Univariate analysis showed that age, education level, employment status, treatment, comorbidities, membership of a patient association, and patient education program were associated with eHealth use for rheumatoid arthritis. Multivariate analysis showed that membership of a patient association (odds ratio [OR] 5.8, 95% CI 3.0-11.2), use of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0), and comorbidities (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8) remained associated with eHealth use for rheumatoid arthritis. Recommendation by a doctor (225/330, 68.2%), ease of use (105/330, 31.8%), and data security (69/330, 20.9%) were factors favoring the use of eHealth. CONCLUSIONS: To date, few patients have used eHealth for disease management. The use of a reliable and validated eHealth tool for rheumatoid arthritis could therefore be promoted by rheumatologists and could optimize therapeutic adherence.","Magnol, Marion; Eleonore, Berard; Claire, Rempenault; Castagne, Benjamin; Pugibet, Marine; Lukas, Cédric; Tournadre, Anne; Vergne-Salle, Pascale; Barnetche, Thomas; Truchetet, Marie-Elise; Ruyssen-Witrand, Adeline",J Med Internet Res,373,19

The impact of innate immunity mechanisms, such as mannose‐binding lectin (MBL), on respiratory symptoms remains unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate whether cord blood MBL levels are associated with respiratory symptoms during infancy and to determine the relative contribution of MBL when compared with known risk factors. This is a prospective birth cohort study including 185 healthy term infants. MBL was measured in cord blood and categorized into tertiles. Frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms were assessed weekly until age one. Association with MBL levels was analysed using multivariable random effects Poisson regression. We observed a trend towards an increased incidence rate of severe respiratory symptoms in infants in the low MBL tertile when compared with infants in the middle MBL tertile [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95–2.66; p = 0.076]. Surprisingly, infants in the high MBL tertile suffered significantly more from severe and total respiratory symptoms than infants in the middle MBL tertile (IRR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.20–3.25; p = 0.008). This association was pronounced in infants of parents with asthma (IRR = 3.64; 95% CI: 1.47–9.02; p = 0.005). The relative risk associated with high MBL was similar to the risk associated with well‐known risk factors such as maternal smoking or childcare. In conclusion the association between low MBL levels and increased susceptibility to common respiratory infections during infancy was weaker than that previously reported.

Umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UC‐MSCs) influence proinflammatory T‐helper 2 (Th(2)) cells to shift to an anti‐inflammatory agent. To investigate efficacy of UC‐MSC administration as adjuvant therapy in critically ill patients with COVID‐19, we conducted a double‐blind, multicentered, randomized controlled trial at four COVID‐19 referral hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. This study included 40 randomly allocated critically ill patients with COVID‐19; 20 patients received an intravenous infusion of 1 × 10(6)/kg body weight UC‐MSCs in 100 ml saline (0.9%) solution (SS) and 20 patients received 100 ml 0.9% SS as the control group. All patients received standard therapy. The primary outcome was measured by survival rate and/or length of ventilator usage. The secondary outcome was measured by clinical and laboratory improvement, with serious adverse events. Our study showed the survival rate in the UC‐MSCs group was 2.5 times higher than that in the control group (P = .047), which is 10 patients and 4 patients in the UC‐MSCs and control groups, respectively. In patients with comorbidities, UC‐MSC administration increased the survival rate by 4.5 times compared with controls. The length of stay in the intensive care unit and ventilator usage were not statistically significant, and no adverse events were reported. The application of infusion UC‐MSCs significantly decreased interleukin 6 in the recovered patients (P = .023). Therefore, application of intravenous UC‐MSCs as adjuvant treatment for critically ill patients with COVID‐19 increases the survival rate by modulating the immune system toward an anti‐inflammatory state.","Dilogo, Ismail Hadisoebroto; Aditianingsih, Dita; Sugiarto, Adhrie; Burhan, Erlina; Damayanti, Triya; Sitompul, Pompini Agustina; Mariana, Nina; Antarianto, Radiana D.; Liem, Isabella Kurnia; Kispa, Tera; Mujadid, Fajar; Novialdi, Novialdi; Luviah, Evah; Kurniawati, Tri; Lubis, Andri M.

The S1 glycoprotein genes of these IBV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. These Korean IBV isolates were classified into three groups according to their RFLP patterns obtained using the restriction enzyme HaeIII. Half of the twelve isolates were similar to the KM91 RFLP pattern, which is a common pattern in Korea. Three more isolates were related to the Arkansas strain pattern, but with some unique variations. The other three viruses showed variant RFLP patterns. For a comparison with the published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains, amplified PCR products from the twelve isolates were cloned and sequenced. The Korean IBV field isolates had 71.2-99.7% nucleotide sequence homology with each other and 45.9-80.7% nucleotide sequence homology with non-Korean IBV strains. With respect to the deduced amino acid sequence, the Korean IBV isolates had 71.5-99.3% similarity with each other and 44.9-80.3% similarity with non-Korean IBV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that some of the IBV isolates appear to belong to a new group, different from the non-Korean IBV strains or from previously isolated Korean IBV strains. Specifically, the new Korean IBV isolates K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03 represented a separate group. These findings suggest that the Korean IBVs appear to be continuously evolving.","Jang, Ji-Hyun; Sung, Haan-Woo; Song, Chang-Seon; Kwon, Hyuk-Moo",J Vet Sci,373,1

There is no study related to the patients’ preference for systemic therapy during this pandemic. We have conducted a prospective study to analyze that aspect. METHODS: All consecutive patients who visited during the lockdown period from April 1-10, 2020, for systemic chemotherapy were included in the study for a questionnaire-based survey to evaluate the willingness to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic and factors influencing the decisions. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included (median age, 56 years; range, 21-77 years). Most common sites of cancer were breast (n = 114), lung (n = 44), ovary (n = 34), and colon (n = 20). Home address was within the city for 125 patients (42%), outside the city for 138 (46%), and outside the state for 37 (12%). Treatment was curative in 150 patients and palliative in 152. Educational status was primary and above for 231 patients and no formal schooling for 71. A total of 203 patients wanted to continue chemotherapy, 40 wanted to defer, and 56 wanted the physician to decide. Knowledge about COVID-19 strongly correlated with intent of treatment (P = .01), disease status (P = .02), knowledge about immunosuppression (P < .001), home location (P = .02), and education status (P = .003). The worry about catching SARS-CoV-2 was high in those with controlled disease (P = .06) and knowledge about immunosuppression (P = .02). Worry about disease progression was more with palliative intent (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study shows that oncology patients in our country are more worried about disease progression than the SARS-CoV-2 and wish to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic. The treatment guidelines in the COVID-19 scenario should incorporate patients’ perspectives.","Ghosh, Joydeep; Ganguly, Sandip; Mondal, Debapriya; Pandey, Prashant; Dabkara, Deepak; Biswas, Bivas",JCO Glob Oncol,373,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This farm is located in the eastern jungle of Peru. Initially, clinical signs that appeared to be infectious diarrhea were detected, but the disease rapidly progressed to green diarrhea, vomiting, and increased mortality in piglets. These symptoms were compatible with those produced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, but also with PDCoV. Because the disease could not be diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction was used. Implementation of a feedback/controlled homogenization program was quickly planned, accompanied by the closure of the farm, animal and farm health strategies, and its respective monitoring. RESULTS: At the farm level, between 1 and 9 weeks after application of the program, the samples were positive for PDCoV, but at week 10, they were negative. At week 12, the weaned and fattening piglets gradually became populated as negative animals. In the follow-up before the opening of the farm, all the piglets were negative. In the final verification, gilts (week 35) entered the breeding area as replacements only after being tested negative for PDCoV. CONCLUSION: A rigorous feedback/controlled homogenization program and complementary measures led to eradicating PDCoV from the farm.","Vicente-Huaman, Jhonas; Gómez-Quispe, Oscar E.",J Adv Vet Anim Res,373,20

Moreover, we showed that the enhanced necroptosis in M1 macrophages is dependent on the kinase activity of receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and may involve the upregulation of key necroptosis signaling molecules including RIPK3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein, and Z-DNA/ RNA binding protein 1.

Objectives: To describe the association between lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c) use and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Study Design: Multicenter observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted in 33 Italian hospitals. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures, and outcomes were extracted from medical records. Patients were retrospectively divided in three groups, according to use of LPV/r, DRV/c or none of them. Primary outcome in a time-to event analysis was death. We used Cox proportional-hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting by multinomial propensity scores. Results: Out of 3,451 patients, 33.3% LPV/r and 13.9% received DRV/c. Patients receiving LPV/r or DRV/c were more likely younger, men, had higher C-reactive protein levels while less likely had hypertension, cardiovascular, pulmonary or kidney disease. After adjustment for propensity scores, LPV/r use was not associated with mortality (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13), whereas treatment with DRV/c was associated with a higher death risk (HR = 1.89, 1.53 to 2.34, E-value = 2.43). This increased risk was more marked in women, in elderly, in patients with higher severity of COVID-19 and in patients receiving other COVID-19 drugs. Conclusions: In a large cohort of Italian patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a real-life setting, the use of LPV/r treatment did not change death rate, while DRV/c was associated with increased mortality. Within the limits of an observational study, these data do not support the use of LPV/r or DRV/c in COVID-19 patients.","Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; Costanzo, Simona; Antinori, Andrea; Berselli, Nausicaa; Blandi, Lorenzo; Bonaccio, Marialaura; Bruno, Raffaele; Cauda, Roberto; Gialluisi, Alessandro; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Menicanti, Lorenzo; Mennuni, Marco; My, Ilaria; Parruti, Agostino; Patti, Giuseppe; Perlini, Stefano; Santilli, Francesca; Signorelli, Carlo; Stefanini, Giulio G.; Vergori, Alessandra; Ageno, Walter; Aiello, Luca; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Al Moghazi, Samir; Arboretti, Rosa; Aucella, Filippo; Barbieri, Greta; Barchitta, Martina; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Bologna, Carolina; Bonfanti, Paolo; Caiano, Lucia; Carrozzi, Laura; Cascio, Antonio; Castiglione, Giacomo; Chiarito, Mauro; Ciccullo, Arturo; Cingolani, Antonella; Cipollone, Francesco; Colomba, Claudia; Colombo, Crizia; Crosta, Francesco; Dalena, Giovanni; Dal Pra, Chiara; Danzi, Gian Battista; D'Ardes, Damiano; de Gaetano Donati, Katleen; Di Gennaro, Francesco; Di Tano, Giuseppe; D'Offizi, Gianpiero; Filippini, Tommaso; Maria Fusco, Francesco; Gaudiosi, Carlo; Gentile, Ivan; Gini, Giancarlo; Grandone, Elvira; Guarnieri, Gabriella; Lamanna, Gennaro L.

However, SNF-VBP may unintentionally punish facilities with lower profit margins struggling to invest resources to lower readmissions. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to estimate the SNF-VBP penalty amounts by skilled nursing facility (SNF) profit margin quintiles and examine whether facilities with lower profit margins are more likely to be penalized by SNF-VBP. RESEARCH DESIGN We combined the first round of SNF-VBP performance data with SNF profit margins and characteristics data. Our outcome variables included estimated penalty amount and a binary measure for whether facilities were penalized by the SNF-VBP. We categorized SNFs into 5 profit margin quintiles and examined the relationship between profit margins and SNF-VBP performance using descriptive and regression analysis. RESULTS The average profit margins for SNFs in the lowest profit margin quintile was -14.4% compared with the average profit margin of 11.1% for SNFs in the highest profit margin quintile. In adjusted regressions, SNFs in the lowest profit margin quintile had 17% higher odds of being penalized under SNF-VBP compared with facilities in the highest profit margin quintile. The average penalty for SNFs in the lowest profit margin quintile was $22,312. CONCLUSIONS SNFs in the lowest profit margins are more likely to be penalized by the SNF-VBP, and these losses can exacerbate quality problems in SNFs with lower quality. Alternative approaches to measuring and rewarding SNFs under SNF-VBP or programs to assist struggling SNFs is warranted, particularly considering the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which requires resources for prevention and management.","Sharma, Hari; Hefele, Jennifer G; Xu, Lili; Conkling, Bryant; Wang, Xiao Joyce",Medical care,373,16

It looks particularly at the benefits of using participatory research in conjunction with traditional modelling methods to potentially improve disease research, control and management. Integrated approaches can lead to more realistic mathematical models which in turn can assist with making policy decisions that reduce disease and benefit local people. The emergence, risk, spread and control of diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, environmental and socio-economic factors. These include climate and environmental change, land-use variation, changes in population and people’s behaviour. The evidence base for this scoping review comes from the work of a consortium, with the aim of integrating modelling approaches traditionally used in epidemiological, ecological and development research. A total of five examples of the impacts of participatory research on the choice of model structure are presented. Example 1 focused on using participatory research as a tool to structure a model. Example 2 looks at identifying the most relevant parameters of the system. Example 3 concentrates on identifying the most relevant regime of the system (e.g., temporal stability or otherwise), Example 4 examines the feedbacks from mathematical models to guide participatory research and Example 5 goes beyond the so-far described two-way interplay between participatory and mathematical approaches to look at the integration of multiple methods and frameworks. This scoping review describes examples of best practice in the use of participatory methods, illustrating their potential to overcome disciplinary hurdles and promote multidisciplinary collaboration, with the aim of making models and their predictions more useful for decision-making and policy formulation.

Subsequently, [Zn(H2qp1)(OTf)](+) was found to use the redox activity of the H2qp1 ligand to catalyze the conversion of O(2)˙(−) to O(2) and H(2)O(2), raising the possibility that the organic ligand, rather than the metal, could serve as the redox partner for O(2)˙(−) in the manganese chemistry. Here, we use stopped-flow kinetics and cryospray-ionization mass spectrometry (CSI-MS) analysis of the direct reactions between the manganese-containing contrast agents and O(2)˙(−) to confirm the activity and elucidate the catalytic mechanism. The obtained data are consistent with the operation of multiple parallel catalytic cycles, with both the quinol groups and manganese cycling through different oxidation states during the reactions with superoxide. The choice of ligand impacts the overall charges of the intermediates and allows us to visualize complementary sets of intermediates within the catalytic cycles using CSI-MS. With the diquinolic H4qp2, we detect Mn(iii)-superoxo intermediates with both reduced and oxidized forms of the ligand, a Mn(iii)-hydroperoxo compound, and what is formally a Mn(iv)-oxo species with the monoquinolate/mono-para-quinone form of H4qp2. With the monoquinolic H2qp1, we observe a Mn(ii)-superoxo ↔ Mn(iii)-peroxo intermediate with the oxidized para-quinone form of the ligand. The observation of these species suggests inner-sphere mechanisms for O(2)˙(−) oxidation and reduction that include both the ligand and manganese as redox partners. The higher positive charges of the complexes with the reduced and oxidized forms of H2qp1 compared to those with related forms of H4qp2 result in higher catalytic activity (k(cat) ∼ 10(8) M(−1) s(−1) at pH 7.4) that rivals those of the most active superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics. The manganese complex with H2qp1 is markedly more stable in water than other highly active non-porphyrin-based and even some Mn(ii) porphyrin-based SOD mimics.","Senft, Laura; Moore, Jamonica L.; Franke, Alicja; Fisher, Katherine R.; Scheitler, Andreas; Zahl, Achim; Puchta, Ralph; Fehn, Dominik; Ison, Sidney; Sader, Safaa; Ivanović-Burmazović, Ivana; Goldsmith, Christian R.",Chemical science,373,1

The objectives of this study were to determine if the levels of serum CC16 and MMP-9 and subsequent respiratory infections in children are associated with the ingestion of arsenic by drinking water. This cross-sectional study included 216 children from three Yaqui villages, Potam, Vicam, and Cocorit, with levels of arsenic in their ground water of 70.01 ± 21.85, 23.3 ± 9.99, and 11.8 ± 4.42 μg/L respectively. Total arsenic in water and urine samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometry. Serum was analyzed for CC16 and MMP-9 using ELISA. The children had an average urinary arsenic of 79.39 μg/L and 46.8 % had levels above of the national concern value of 50 μg/L. Increased arsenic concentrations in drinking water and average daily arsenic intake by water were associated with decreased serum CC16 levels (β = − 0.12, 95% CI − 0.20, − 0.04 and β = − 0.10, 95% CI − 0.18, − 0.03), and increased serum MMP-9 levels (β = 0.35, 95% CI 0.22, 0.48 and β = 0.29, 95% CI 0.18, 0.40) at significant levels (P < 0.05). However, no association was found between levels of these serum biomarkers and urinary arsenic concentrations. In these children, reduced serum CC16 levels were significantly associated with increased risk of respiratory infections (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.90). In conclusion, altered levels of serum CC16 and MMP-9 in the children may be due to the toxic effects of arsenic exposure through drinking water.

Discussion and conclusion: Acute respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients could require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Severe respiratory distress, loss of consciousness, and hypoxia were the most important reasons for intubation. Also, increased levels of ferritin, d-dimer, and lipase in common with hypoxia are correlated with intubation and ICU admission Mortality following intubation is reported to be 15 to 36%. Awake-prone positioning in comparison to high-flow nasal oxygen therapy did not reduce the risk of intubation and mechanical ventilation. There was no association between intubation timing and mortality of infected patients. noninvasive ventilation may have survival benefits.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the Oral Medicine Clinic in 31 patients who used teledentistry services at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic under informed consent. Questionnaire modification was validated with the Rasch model analysis and components that contribute to satisfaction were analyzed by the factor analysis. A total of satisfaction scores were then categorized into five levels (very dissatisfied; not satisfied; moderate; satisfied and very satisfied). RESULTS: The questionnaire shows Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83 and a reliability item of 0.95 with a separation of 4.49. The factor analysis shows two components that contribute to satisfaction, namely, components convenience and communication. One hundred percent of the subjects were in the satisfied and very satisfied categories. DISCUSSION: The Rasch model can determine the validity and reliability of the questionnaire used more accurately. The components of convenience and communication are the main things that are considered when patients choose teledentistry services. CONCLUSION: Oral medicine patients’ satisfaction level with teledentistry services during the COVID-19 pandemic was 100% in the satisfied and very satisfied categories, with contributing factors being convenience and communication.","Amtha, Rahmi; Gunardi, Indrayadi; Astoeti, Tri Erri; Roeslan, Moehamad Orliando",J Int Soc Prev Community Dent,373,22

In acute viral infections, this balance involves induction and inhibition of innate responses. Foot‐and‐mouth disease virus (FMDV) is considered one of the most contagious viruses known and is characterized by rapid induction of clinical disease in cloven hoofed animals exposed to infection. Viral shedding is extensive before the equally rapid resolution of acute disease. This positive strand RNA virus is an extremely successful pathogen, due in part to the ability to interrupt the innate immune response. Previous reviews have described the inhibition of cellular innate responses in the infected cell both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we present a review of virus inhibition of cells that are a source of antiviral function in swine. Particularly in the case of dendritic cells and natural killer cells, the virus has evolved mechanisms to interrupt the normal function of these important mediators of innate function, even though these cells are not infected by the virus. Understanding how this virus subverts the innate response will provide valuable information for the development of rapidly acting biotherapeutics to use in response to an outbreak of FMDV.","Golde, William T.; Nfon, Charles K.; Toka, Felix N.",Immunol Rev,373,9

The investigation has been recently extended to characterize the biotic and abiotic (photodynamic) effects of different wavelengths. Here, we investigated LED effects on kimchi fermentation. Kimchi broths were treated with three different colored-LEDs (red, green, and blue) or kept in the dark as a control. Multiomics was applied to evaluate the microbial taxonomic composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the metabolomic profiles were determined using liquid chromatography–Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Cell viability was tested to determine the potential cytotoxicity of the LED-treated kimchi broths. First, the amplicon sequencing data showed substantial changes in taxonomic composition at the family and genus levels according to incubation (initial condition vs. all other groups). The differences among the treated groups (red-LED (RLED), green-LED (GLED), blue-LED (BLED), and dark condition) were marginal. The relative abundance of Weissella was decreased in all treated groups compared to that of the initial condition, which coincided with the decreased composition of Lactobacillus. Compositional changes were relatively high in the GLED group. Subsequent metabolomic analysis indicated a unique metabolic phenotype instigated by different LED treatments, which led to the identification of the LED treatment-specific and common compounds (e.g., luteolin, 6-methylquinoline, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 9-HODE). These results indicate that different LED wavelengths induce characteristic alterations in the microbial composition and metabolomic content, which may have applications in food processing and storage with the aim of improving nutritional quality and the safety of food.","Oh, Yeong-Ji; Park, Ye-Rin; Hong, Jungil; Lee, Do-Yup",Metabolites,373,1

The main protein that interacts with the host cell receptor is the Spike-1 (S1) subunit of the coronavirus. This subunit binds with receptors present on the host cell membrane. It has been identified from several studies that neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is one of the co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the significance of NRP-1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEDLINE/PubMed database was used for a search of available literature. In the current review, we report that NRP-1 plays many important functions, including angiogenesis, neuronal development, and the regulation of immune responses. Additionally, the presence of this glycoprotein on the host cell membrane significantly augments the infection and spread of SARS-CoV-2. Literature data suggest that NRP-1 facilitates entry of the virus into the central nervous system through the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. Moreover, published findings show that interfering with VEGF-A/NRP-1 using NRP-1 inhibitors may produce an analgesic effect. The review describes an association between NRP-1, SARS-CoV-2 and, inter alia, pathological changes in the retina. Based on the published findings, we suggest that NRP-1 is a very important mediator implicated in, inter alia, neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, it appears that the use of NRP-1 inhibitors is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gudowska-Sawczuk, Monika; Mroczko, Barbara",J Clin Med,373,16

METHODS: The National Health Insurance claims data of Taipei were analyzed. We calculated the changes in utilization between June 2002 and June 2003 to estimate the impact that SARS had on utilization. RESULTS: The top three disease categories with the most significant drop in utilization were gastroenteritis (−53%), acute bronchitis (−45%), and tonsillitis (−40%) in ambulatory care and acute bronchitis (−82%), gastroenteritis (−72%), and pneumonia (−64%) in inpatient care. On the other hand, the disease categories with the smallest reduction were allergic reactions (−4%), skin infections (−6%), and anxiety (−10%) in ambulatory care and respiratory failure (+40%), delivery (−2%), and fractures of lower limbs (−5%) in inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: Disease categories could be classified into three groups according to the extent of change in utilization during the SARS outbreaks. Diseases with a prominent reduction were respiratory diseases, minor problems, and elective procedures. Diseases with a moderate reduction were mainly chronic diseases. Diseases with a limited reduction were acute conditions, difficult mental disorders, or procedures that could not be postponed. The utilization of some diseases shifted significantly from medical centers to district hospitals or clinics.","Lu, Tsung-Hsueh; Chou, Yiing-Jenq; Liou, Chien-Shian",Health Policy,373,16

It is imperative that medical trainees understand the implications of climate change/planetary health on the physical and mental health and well-being of their patients. Medical professionals generally are not trained to consider climate change impacts in patient encounters. Hence, there is a need to train climate-aware providers who will be at the forefront of patient care in managing these current and emerging health impacts. METHODS: We created a standardized patient (SP) case enhanced with details of risks and health impacts due to exposure to wildfire smoke. This session was deployed to 11 internal medicine clerkship students as part of a standard OSCE already included in our curriculum to evaluate core clinical and communication skills. Two cohorts, a group activity, and a one-on-one encounter were deployed and followed with a faculty debrief and learner assessments. RESULTS: Students had increased awareness and knowledge of health impacts of climate change and potential actions for adaptation and mitigation. The improvements were statistically significant for the one-on-one cohort (p = .006). Postsimulation comments were favorable; students were more inclined to consider health impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities exacerbated by climate change. DISCUSSION: Students had an increased recognition of climate change as a force impacting their patients' health which should be considered in patient care. This format allowed retention of well established curricular content, but also the inclusion of other crucial emerging issues that will impact public health locally and globally and foster the development of climate-aware health care providers.","Ramkumar, Japhia; Rosencranz, Holly; Herzog, Leslie",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,373,17

Currently, limited prophylactic or therapeutic intervention options are available against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, 400 compounds from the antimicrobial “pandemic response box” library were screened for inhibiting properties against SARS-CoV-2. An initial screen on Vero E6 cells identified five compounds that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, validation of the selected hits in a human lung cell line highlighted that only a single compound, namely Retro-2.1, efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. Additional analysis revealed that the antiviral activity of Retro-2.1 occurs at a post-entry stage of the viral replication cycle. Combined, these data demonstrate that stringent in vitro screening of preselected compounds in multiple cell lines refines the rapid identification of new potential antiviral candidate drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.","Holwerda, Melle; V’kovski, Philip; Wider, Manon; Thiel, Volker; Dijkman, Ronald",Microorganisms,373,24

Then, arguments were provided for why our study design is stronger and more realistic than the previously quoted papers, balancing the possible false expectations with facts. The authors consider that the potential of AI use in COVID-19 diagnosis on CXR is real. However, scientific community should be careful in interpreting statements, results and conclusions regarding AI use in imaging. It is therefore necessary to adopt standards for research and publication of data, because it seems that in the recent months scientific reality suffered manipulations and distortions. Also, a call for responsible approaches to the imaging methods in COVID-19 is raised. It seems mandatory to follow some rigorous approaches in order to provide with adequate results in daily routine.

Dental professionals and dental students are at an increased risk for these viruses from dental patients, as dental practice involves face-to-face communication with the patients and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids. Dental education can play an important role in the training of dental students, adequate knowledge and adopting attitudes regarding infection control measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and clinical education of dental students about COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 355 pre-clinical and clinical dental students (242 and 113, respectively, comprising 190 females and 165 males) at Fırat University Dentistry Faculty, in Elazığ, Turkey answered an online questionnaire about the biosafety procedures for and their attitudes to and knowledge of COVID-19. The study was conducted in March 2020, Turkey. The data gained were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and chi-square test. RESULTS: Both the clinical and preclinical students were found to be afraid of infecting themselves and their environment with COVID-19, and the difference between them was statistically significant. Three quarters (74.9%) of the participants responded yes to the question of whether they thought that experiences related to COVID-19 affected them psychologically, with the differences between gender and clinical status were statistically significant. Responses to the question of which clinical rotation worried them more were 29.9% endodontics, 25.1% oral and maxillofacial surgery, 16.3% prosthesis, 15.2% periodontology, 6.8% restorative dentistry, 3.9% oral diagnosis and radiology, 1.7% pedodontics, and 1.1% orthodontics, with a significant difference between the preclinical and clinical students. Regarding the measures applied by the clinical students in their clinical rotation, the responses were 100% gloves and 100% mask (with 11.5% FFP3/N95 mask), 73.6% face protective shield and 37.1% safety glasses, and 49% bonnet and 16.8% disposable box, with 90.2% frequent hand washing, and 86.7% frequent hand antiseptic usage. CONCLUSIONS: While students gave good responses regarding the standard measures they take to protect against transmission of COVID-19, their knowledge and attitudes about the extra measures they can take should be improved. For students to be least affected by fears associated with the disease, dental faculties should be ready to provide psychological services to those in need.","Ataş, Osman; Talo Yildirim, Tuba",PeerJ,373,1

Demand for NHS 111 advice has increased since its introduction in 2013, and the service is of particular importance in light of the current pandemic and resulting increased demand for emergency care. Currently, little is known about the effectiveness of NHS 111 in terms of the appropriateness of the advice given, or about the compliance of patients with that advice. We aimed to address this issue by analysing a large linked routine dataset of all NHS 111 calls (n = 3,631,069) and subsequent emergency department (ED) attendances made in the Yorkshire & Humber region from March 2013-March 2017. We found that many patients do not comply with advice, with 11% (n = 289,748) of patients attending ED when they are advised to self-care or seek primary care. We also found that a considerable number of these patients are further classed as urgent (88%, n = 255,931) and a substantial minority (37%, 106,207) are subsequently admitted to hospital. Further, many patients who are sent an ambulance or told to attend ED are classed as non-urgent upon attending ED (9%, n = 42,372). This research suggests that the level at which NHS 111 is currently triaging results in many hundreds of thousands of mis-triaged cases annually. Additionally, patients frequently do not comply with the advice they receive.

A corrected-for-signatures dN/dS analysis demonstrates that such mutational processes are affected by purifying selection, with important exceptions. In fact, several mutations appear to transit toward clonality, defining new clonal genotypes that increase the overall genomic diversity.

However, extra-pulmonary pathologies of SARS-CoV-2 infection that result in long Covid remains undefined in GSH. Here, using in silico modelling we show that hamster angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) interaction with SARS-CoV-2 is similar to human. Intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection in GSH resulted in early onset of lung pathologies marked by aggressive inflammatory response. Remarkably, late phase of SARS-CoV2 infection in GSH showed cardiovascular complications (CVC) characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular wall thickening, interstitial coronary fibrosis and altered lipidomics with elevated cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and long chain fatty acid triglycerides. Moreover, serum metabolomics profile of infected GSH correlated with Covid19 patients. Together, we propose GSH as a suitable animal model to study immediate and long Covid19 pathologies that could be extended to therapeutics against Covid19 related CVC.","Rizvi, Zaigham Abbas; Dalal, Rajdeep; Sadhu, Srikant; Kumar, Yashwant; Shrivastava, Tripti; Gupta, Sonu Kumar; Agarwal, Suruchi; Tripathy, Manas Ranjan; Yadav, Amit Kumar; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R.; Pandey, Amit Kumar; Samal, Sweety; Asthana, Shailendra; Awasthi, Amit",bioRxiv,373,32

Nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens are commonly used for the detection of respiratory viruses, but throat and saliva specimens are easier to obtain. The objective of this study was to compare the viral yield of direct fluorescent antigen detection of NP specimens and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT) of direct fluorescent antigen-negative NP specimens with the viral yield of NAT of throat swab and saliva specimens. Methods. NP, throat swab, and saliva specimens were obtained from children and adolescents aged ⩽17 years. Direct fluorescent antigen testing of the NP specimen for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses, and parainfluenza virus was performed. If no virus was detected, NAT was performed for these 4 viruses, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. If a virus was detected by either method, NAT for the same virus was performed for the corresponding throat swab and saliva specimens. Results. A virus was detected in 105 of the 137 NP specimens. The same virus was detectable by NAT in 87 (83%) of 105 throat swab specimens and 77 (74%) of 104 saliva specimens. The likelihood of viral detection among throat swab and saliva swab specimens was higher when the NP specimen tested positive by direct fluorescent antigen testing, compared with NAT alone, and when the specimens were obtained within 3 days after symptom onset, compared with later in the illness. Conclusions. Throat swab and saliva specimens are inferior to NP specimens for the detection of respiratory viruses but might be acceptable for screening in a setting where it is impractical to obtain an NP specimen.","Robinson, Joan L.; Lee, Bonita E.; Kothapalli, Sushma; Craig, William R.; Fox, Julie D.",Clin Infect Dis,373,16

METHODS: We systematically retrieved articles published on HIV infection and risk of COVID-19 mortality through PubMed, EMBase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and Chongqing VIP databases using a predefined search strategy from December 1, 2019 to January 31, 2021. Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics were quantified to measure heterogeneity. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed and displayed in the form of forest plots. Subgroup analysis was performed to explore the source of heterogeneity. Funnel plot, Begg test, and Egger test were used to assess potential publication bias. Stata software version 11.0 was used to analyze all the statistical data. RESULTS: We included 10 studies with 18,122,370 COVID-19 patients, of whom 41,113 were with HIV infection and 18,081,257 were without HIV infection. The pooled overall results suggested that people living with HIV infection had a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19 than those without HIV infection (OR = 1.252, 95% CI 1.027–1.524). Subgroup analysis showed that people living with HIV infection had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality than those without HIV infection in the United States (OR = 1.520, 95% CI 1.252–1.845) and in South Africa (OR = 1.122, 95% CI 1.032–1.220); however, no significant association was found in the United Kingdom (OR = 0.878, 95% CI 0.657–1.174).

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Nationwide healthcare registers in Denmark and Norway. PARTICIPANTS: All people aged 18-65 years who received a first vaccination with ChAdOx1-S from 9 February 2021 to 11 March 2021. The general populations of Denmark (2016-18) and Norway (2018-19) served as comparator cohorts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed 28 day rates of hospital contacts for incident arterial events, venous thromboembolism, thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders, and bleeding among vaccinated people compared with expected rates, based on national age and sex specific background rates from the general populations of the two countries. RESULTS: The vaccinated cohorts comprised 148 792 people in Denmark (median age 45 years, 80% women) and 132 472 in Norway (median age 44 years, 78% women), who received their first dose of ChAdOx1-S. Among 281 264 people who received ChAdOx1-S, the standardised morbidity ratio for arterial events was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.20). 59 venous thromboembolic events were observed in the vaccinated cohort compared with 30 expected based on the incidence rates in the general population, corresponding to a standardised morbidity ratio of 1.97 (1.50 to 2.54) and 11 (5.6 to 17.0) excess events per 100 000 vaccinations. A higher than expected rate of cerebral venous thrombosis was observed: standardised morbidity ratio 20.25 (8.14 to 41.73); an excess of 2.5 (0.9 to 5.2) events per 100 000 vaccinations. The standardised morbidity ratio for any thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders was 1.52 (0.97 to 2.25) and for any bleeding was 1.23 (0.97 to 1.55). 15 deaths were observed in the vaccine cohort compared with 44 expected. CONCLUSIONS: Among recipients of ChAdOx1-S, increased rates of venous thromboembolic events, including cerebral venous thrombosis, were observed. For the remaining safety outcomes, results were largely reassuring, with slightly higher rates of thrombocytopenia/coagulation disorders and bleeding, which could be influenced by increased surveillance of vaccine recipients. The absolute risks of venous thromboembolic events were, however, small, and the findings should be interpreted in the light of the proven beneficial effects of the vaccine, the context of the given country, and the limitations to the generalisability of the study findings.","Pottegård, Anton; Lund, Lars Christian; Karlstad, Øystein; Dahl, Jesper; Andersen, Morten; Hallas, Jesper; Lidegaard, Øjvind; Tapia, German; Gulseth, Hanne Løvdal; Ruiz, Paz Lopez-Doriga; Watle, Sara Viksmoen; Mikkelsen, Anders Pretzmann; Pedersen, Lars; Sørensen, Henrik Toft; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich; Hviid, Anders",BMJ,373,8

This disease can impact the cardiovascular system and lead to abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the ECG manifestations of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review outlines the pathophysiology and electrocardiographic findings associated with COVID-19. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is a potentially critical illness associated with a variety of ECG abnormalities, with up to 90% of critically ill patients demonstrating at least one abnormality. The ECG abnormalities in COVID-19 may be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, electrolyte abnormalities, plaque rupture, coronary spasm, microthrombi, or direct endothelial or myocardial injury. While sinus tachycardia is the most common abnormality, others include supraventricular tachycardias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, various bradycardias, interval and axis changes, and ST segment and T waves changes. Several ECG presentations are associated with poor outcome, including atrial fibrillation, QT interval prolongation, ST segment and T wave changes, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the relevant ECG findings associated with COVID-19. Knowledge of these findings in COVID-19-related electrocardiographic presentations may assist emergency clinicians in the evaluation and management of potentially infected and infected patients.","Long, Brit; Brady, William J.; Bridwell, Rachel E.; Ramzy, Mark; Montrief, Tim; Singh, Manpreet; Gottlieb, Michael",Am J Emerg Med,373,12

At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting a discrete-time variant of the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.","Koyama, Shinsuke; Horie, Taiki; Shinomoto, Shigeru",PLoS Comput Biol,373,1

The most common route of infection is mosquito bites and therefore, the virus must cross a number of polarized cell layers to gain access to organ tissue and the central nervous system. Resistance to trans-cellular movement of macromolecules between epithelial and endothelial cells is mediated by tight junction complexes. While a number of recent studies have documented that WNV infection negatively impacts the barrier function of tight junctions, the intracellular mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. In the present study, we report that endocytosis of a subset of tight junction membrane proteins including claudin-1 and JAM-1 occurs in WNV infected epithelial and endothelial cells. This process, which ultimately results in lysosomal degradation of the proteins, is dependent on the GTPase dynamin and microtubule-based transport. Finally, infection of polarized cells with the related flavivirus, Dengue virus-2, did not result in significant loss of tight junction membrane proteins. These results suggest that neurotropic flaviviruses such as WNV modulate the host cell environment differently than hemorrhagic flaviviruses and thus may have implications for understanding the molecular basis for neuroinvasion.","Xu, Zaikun; Waeckerlin, Regula; Urbanowski, Matt D.; van Marle, Guido; Hobman, Tom C.",PLoS One,373,26

Indeed, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key cytokine driving COVID-19 pathogenesis, downregulates lung CFTR protein expression, providing a strong rationale that acquired CFTR dysfunction arises in the context of COVID-19 infection. In this perspective, we propose that CFTR therapeutics, which are safe and generally well-tolerated, may provide benefit to COVID-19 patients. Although CFTR therapeutics are currently only approved for treating cystic fibrosis, there are efforts to repurpose them for conditions with “acquired” CFTR dysfunction, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to targeting the primary lung pathology, CFTR therapeutics may possess value-added effects: their anti-inflammatory properties may dampen exaggerated immune cell responses and promote cerebrovascular dilation; the latter aspect may offer some protection against COVID-19 related stroke.","Lidington, Darcy; Bolz, Steffen-Sebastian",Front Physiol,373,16

Viruses lacking 2′-O methyltransferase activity exhibited attenuation in primary macrophages that was rescued in cells lacking Ifit1 gene expression. Here, we examined the role of Ifit1 in restricting pathogenesis in vivo of wild type WNV (WNV-WT) and a mutant in the NS5 gene (WNV-E218A) lacking 2′-O methylation of the 5′ viral RNA cap. While deletion of Ifit1 had marginal effects on WNV-WT pathogenesis, WNV-E218A showed increased replication in peripheral tissues of Ifit1 (−/−) mice after subcutaneous infection, yet this failed to correlate with enhanced infection in the brain or lethality. In comparison, WNV-E218A was virulent after intracranial infection as judged by increased infection in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and a greater than 16,000-fold decrease in LD(50) values in Ifit1 (−/−) compared to wild type mice. Ex vivo infection experiments revealed cell-type specific differences in the ability of an Ifit1 deficiency to complement the replication defect of WNV-E218A. In particular, WNV-E218A infection was impaired in both wild type and Ifit1 (−/−) brain microvascular endothelial cells, which are believed to participate in blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulation of virus entry into the CNS. A deficiency of Ifit1 also was associated with increased neuronal death in vivo, which was both cell-intrinsic and mediated by immunopathogenic CD8(+) T cells. Our results suggest that virulent strains of WNV have largely evaded the antiviral effects of Ifit1, and viral mutants lacking 2′-O methylation are controlled in vivo by Ifit1-dependent and -independent mechanisms in different cell types.","Szretter, Kristy J.; Daniels, Brian P.; Cho, Hyelim; Gainey, Maria D.; Yokoyama, Wayne M.; Gale, Michael; Virgin, Herbert W.; Klein, Robyn S.; Sen, Ganes C.; Diamond, Michael S.",PLoS Pathog,373,23

The World Health Organization predicts that by 2030, mental health conditions will be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide. The current need for mental health care is overwhelming. In New Zealand, 1 in 6 adults has been diagnosed with common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety disorders, according to a national survey. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to effectively help patients overcome a wide variety of mental health conditions. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) might be one of the most exciting technologies emerging in the clinical setting for the treatment of anxiety and depression. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the virtual reality (VR) technologies currently being used to help support the treatment of depression and anxiety. We also aim to investigate whether and how CBT is included as part of VRET and look at the VR technologies and interventions that have been used in recent studies on depression and anxiety. METHODS: We performed a scoping review. To identify significant studies, we decided to use already aggregated sources from the Google Scholar database. Overall, the goal of our search strategy was to limit the number of initial results related to VR in mental health to only a relevant minimum. RESULTS: Using our defined keywords, Google Scholar identified >17,300 articles. After applying all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified a total of 369 articles for further processing. After manual evaluation, 34 articles were shortlisted; of the 34 articles, 9 (26%) reported the use of CBT with VR. All of the articles were published between 2017 and 2021. Out of the 9 studies, CBT was conducted within a VR environment in 5 (56%) studies, whereas in the remaining 4 (44%) studies, CBT was used as an addition to VRET. All 9 studies reported the use of CBT either in vivo or in a virtual environment to be effective in supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies demonstrated the use of VR to be effective for supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression in a range of settings and recommended its potential as a tool for use in a clinical environment. Even though standalone headsets are much easier to work with and more suitable for home use, the shift from tethered VR headsets to standalone headsets in the mental health environment was not observed. All studies that looked at the use of CBT either in vivo or in a virtual environment found it to be effective in supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression.","Baghaei, Nilufar; Chitale, Vibhav; Hlasnik, Andrej; Stemmet, Lehan; Liang, Hai-Ning; Porter, Richard",JMIR Ment Health,373,28

This condition has led to the death of about 2.15% of the total infected world population so far. Among survivors, the presence of the so-called post-COVID19 syndrome (PPCS) is a common finding. In patients who survived the SARS-CoV-2 infection, overt PPCS presents one or more symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, memory loss, sleep disorders, and difficulty concentrating. The pathophysiology of PPCS is currently poorly understood, and whether epigenetic mechanisms are involved in this process is unexplored. Methods & Results: In this study, a cohort of 117 COVID19 survivors (post-COVID19) and 144 non-infected volunteers (COVID19-free) were analyzed using pyrosequencing of defined CpG islands previously identified as suitable for biological age determination. Besides, telomere length (TL) and ACE2 and DPP4 receptor expression were determined. The results show a consistent biological age increase in the post-covid population (mean 58,44 DS 14,66 ChronoAge Vs. mean 67,18 DS 10,86 BioAge, P<0,0001), determining a DeltaAge acceleration of 10,45 DS 7,29 years (+5.25 years above range of normality) compared to 3,68 DS 8,17 years for the COVID19-free population (P<0,0001). A significant telomere shortening parallels this finding in the post-COVID19 cohort compared to COVID19-free subjects (post-COVID19 TL: 3,03 DS 2,39 Kb vs. COVID19-free: 10,67 DS 11,69 Kb; P<0,0001). Additionally, ACE2 expression was decreased in post-COVID19 patients compare to COVID19-free, while DPP-4 did not change. Conclusion: In light of these observations, we hypothesize that some epigenetic alterations are associated with the post-COVID19 condition, particularly in the younger (<60 years). Although the consequences of such modifications on the long-term clinical outcome remain unclear, they might 46 indicate a direction to investigate the pathophysiological basis of the post-COVID19 syndrome","Mongelli, A.; gaetano, c.; gottardi zamperla, m.; barbi, v.; atlante, s.; la rovere, m. t.; bachetti, t.; catalano, o.; bussotti, m.; della vecchia, l.; nanni, s.; farsetti, a.; martelli, f.",,373,1

Objectives To evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women compared to: (1) non-pregnant controls and (2) natural COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. Study Design 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131) and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, second vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post second vaccine, and at delivery by Luminex. Umbilical cord sera (N=10) titers were assessed at delivery. Titers were compared to those of pregnant women 4-12 weeks from natural infection (N=37) by ELISA. A pseudovirus neutralization assay was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titers for the subset of women who delivered during the study period. Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed via questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups. Results Vaccine-induced antibody titers were equivalent in pregnant and lactating compared to non-pregnant women (median [IQR] 5.59 [4.68-5.89] pregnant, 5.74 [5.06-6.22] lactating, 5.62 [4.77-5.98] non-pregnant, p = 0.24). All titers were significantly higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy (p < 0.0001). Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in umbilical cord compared to maternal sera, although this finding did not achieve statistical significance (median [IQR] 104.7 [61.2-188.2] maternal sera, 52.3 [11.7-69.6] cord sera, p=0.05). The second vaccine dose (boost dose) increased SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, but not IgA, in maternal blood and breastmilk. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. Conclusions COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placenta and breastmilk.","Gray, Kathryn J.; Bordt, Evan A.; Atyeo, Caroline; Deriso, Elizabeth; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Young, Nicola; Medina Baez, Aranxta; Shook, Lydia L.; Cvrk, Dana; James, Kaitlyn; De Guzman, Rose; Brigida, Sara; Diouf, Khady; Goldfarb, Ilona; Bebell, Lisa M.; Yonker, Lael M.; Fasano, Alessio; Rabi, S.

The clinical characteristics and epidemiology of COVID-19 have been extensively investigated, however studies focused on the patient’s microbiota are still lacking. In this study, we investigated the nasopharyngeal microbiome composition of patients who developed different severity levels of COVID-19. We performed Rdna-SSU (16S) sequencing from nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 positive (56) and negative (18) patients in the province of Alicante (Spain) in their first visit to the hospital. Positive SARS-CoV-2 patients were observed and later categorized in mild (symptomatic without hospitalization), moderate (hospitalization) and severe (admission to ICU). We compared the microbiome diversity and OTU composition among severity groups using Similarity Percentage (SIMPER) analysis and Maaslin2. We also built bacterial co-abundance networks for each group using Fastpar. Results Statistical analysis indicated differences in the nasopharyngeal microbiome of COVID19 patients. 62 OTUs were found exclusively in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, mostly classified as members of the phylum Bacteroidetes (18) and Firmicutes (25). OTUs classified as Prevotella were found to be significantly more abundant in patients that developed more severe COVID-19. Furthemore, co-abundance analysis indicated a loss of network complexity among samples from patients that later developed more severe symptoms. Conclusions Our preliminary study shows that the nasopharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients showed differences in the composition of specific OTUs and complexity of co-abundance networks. These microbes with differential abundances among groups could serve as biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. Nevertheless, further studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to validate these results. IMPORTANCE This work has studied the microbiota of the nasopharyngeal tract in COVID19 patients using advanced techniques of molecular microbiology. Diverse microorganisms, most of which are harmless or even beneficial to the host, colonize the nasopharyngeal tract. These microorganisms are the microbiota, and they are present in every people. However, changes in this microbiota could be related to different diseases as cancer, gastrointestinal pathologies or even COVID19. This study has been performed to investigate the microbiota from patients with COVID19, in order to determinate its implication in the pathology severity. The results obtained showed that it is possible that several specific microorganisms are present only in patients with severe COVID19. These data, could be used as a prognostic biomarker to early detect whose patients will develop a severe COVID19 and improve their clinical management.","Ventero, Maria Paz; Cuadrat, Rafael Ricardo Castro; Vidal, Inmaculada; Andrade, Bruno Gabriel N.; Molina-Pardines, Carmen; Haro-Moreno, Jose M.; Coutinho, Felipe H.; Merino, Esperanza; Regitano, Luciana CA; Silveira, Cynthia B; Afli, Haithem; López-Pérez, Mario; Rodríguez, Juan Carlos",bioRxiv,373,1

A cross-sectional survey was used to investigate 56 severe patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Wuhan. A general information questionnaire, the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale for Adults (MUIS-A) and the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire (MCMQ) were used to collect the data. A statistical analysis was performed. The total score of the MUIS-A was a 66.29 ± 17.25 which was at a low level, while the total score of the MCMQ was 54.16 ± 6.39. The scores of facing and avoiding were significantly higher than those in the norm. The difference in the yielding dimension of patients with different family economic situations was statistically significant. The total score of MUIS-A correlated negatively with the coping style of facing and avoiding and positively correlated with the coping style of yielding. The coping style of patients was one of the factors influencing uncertainty in illness. Nursing staff need to pay close attention to the psychological state of their patients, understand their coping styles and actively correct negative coping styles to reduce the uncertainty in illness and promote physical as well as mental recovery.","Lan, Cai-Feng; Nie, Cai-Ling; Lin, Yan-Juan",Epidemiol Infect,373,16

Here, we performed a comprehensive proteomics-based investigation of nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients to study the host response by employing simple extraction strategies. Few of the host proteins such as Interleukin-6, L-lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, Ferritin and Aspartate aminotransferase were found to be up-regulated only in COVID-19 positive patients using targeted Multiple Reaction Monitoring studies. The most important pathways identified by enrichment analysis were neutrophil degranulation, interleukin-12 signaling pathways and mRNA translation of proteins thus providing the detailed investigation of host response in COVID-19 infection. Thus, we conclude that mass spectrometry-detected host proteins have a potential for disease severity progression; however, suitable validation strategies should be deployed for the clinical translation. Furthermore, the in-silico docking of host proteins involved in the interleukin-12 signaling pathway might aid in COVID-19 therapeutic interventions.","Bankar, Renuka; Suvarna, Kruthi; Ghantasala, Saicharan; Banerjee, Arghya; Biswas, Deeptarup; Choudhury, Manisha; Viswanthram, P.; Salkar, Akanksha; Verma, Ayushi; Singh, Avinash; Mukherjee, Amrita; Pai, Medha Gayathri J.; Roy, Jyotirmoy; Srivastava, Alisha; Badaya, Apoorva; Agrawal, Sachee; Shrivastav, Om; Shastri, Jayanti; Srivastava, Sanjeeva",iScience,373,1

However, simulation provides a medium to bridge this gap. We identified a need for simulation in our anesthesiology residency program to help residents learn to treat perioperative emergencies. Objective: To describe the process of curriculum development, content, and early outcomes of a simulation-based curriculum for the management of perioperative emergencies for all levels of anesthesiology learners. Materials and methods: Curriculum development began in the Spring of 2019 and simulations began in August 2019. All anesthesiology residents rotating at a single center through December 2020 were eligible. Each resident was given their own simulation scenario detailing a specific perioperative emergency and then debriefed as a group afterward. All residents participating in the scenario were given a post-simulation survey assessing the value of the educational experience, relevance to their level of training, and quality of learning environment. Results: Out of 90 eligible residents, 79 participated in the study (87%). Overall, 100% of participants completed the post-simulation survey; 100% of residents reported that the curriculum was useful to their education; 98% of residents reported that the curriculum was relevant to their training level; 99% of residents reported that the simulation was an engaging learning experience. Conclusion: A simulation-based curriculum of perioperative emergencies for anesthesiology residents is feasible to implement, viewed as worthwhile by trainees, and can foster education in a different learning environment.","Kazior, Michael R; Ianchulev, Stefan; Nguyen, Jonathan; Trainer-Albright, Brooke; Shah, Paras",Cureus,373,22

We introduce a resource (website) that provides bibliometric analysis showing the current content and structure of the published literature. As new research is published daily, the analysis is regularly updated to show the status as the research field develops and matures. METHODS: Two bibliometric methods were employed, the first is a keyword co-occurrence analysis, based on published work available from PubMed. The second is a bibliometric coupling analysis, based on articles available through Scopus. The results are presented as clustered network graphs; available as interactive network graphs through the webpage. RESULTS: For research as of March 23rd, keyword co-occurrence analysis showed that research was organized in 4 topic clusters: “Health and pandemic management”, “The disease and its pathophysiology”, “Clinical epidemiology of the disease” and “Treatment of the disease”. Coupling analyses resulted in 4 clusters on literature that relates to “Overview of the new virus”, “Clinical medicine”, “On the virus” and “Reproduction rate and spread”. CONCLUSION: We introduced a dynamic resource that will give a wide readership an overview of how the structure of the COVID-19 literature is developing. To illustrate what this can look like, we showed the structure as it stands three months after the virus was identified; the structure is likely to change as we progress to later stages of this pandemic.","Andersen, Njål; Bramness, Jørgen G.; Lund, Ingunn Olea",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,373,24

Approach: Combining deep learning and transfer learning, 1560 lung x-ray images in the COVID-19 x-ray image database (COVID-19 Radiography Database) were used as the experimental data set, and the most representative image classification models, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and Xception, were fine-tuned and trained. Then, two new models for lung x-ray detection, SVRNet and SVDNet, were proposed on this basis. Finally, 312 test set images (including 44 COVID-19 and 268 normal images) were used as input to evaluate the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of SVRNet and SVDNet models. Results: In the classification experiment of lung x-rays that tested positive and negative for COVID-19, the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of SVRNet and SVDNet are 99.13%, 99.14%, 99.12% and 99.37%, 99.43%, 99.31%, respectively.

Knowledge of the genomic epidemiology of tuberculosis can help tailor public health interventions. Our aims were to determine tuberculosis genomic epidemiology and characterize resistance mutations in the ethnically diverse city of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, located at the nexus of Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Brunei. We used an archive of prospectively collected Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples paired with epidemiological data. We collected sputum and demographic data from consecutive consenting outpatients with pulmonary tuberculosis at the largest tuberculosis clinic from 2012 to 2014, and selected samples from tuberculosis inpatients from the tertiary referral centre during 2012–2014 and 2016–2017. Two hundred and eight M . tuberculosis sequences were available for analysis, representing 8 % of cases notified during the study periods. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that most strains were lineage 1 (195/208, 93.8 %), with the remainder being lineages 2 (8/208, 3.8 %) or 4 (5/208, 2.4 %). Lineages or sub-lineages were not associated with patient ethnicity. The lineage 1 strains were diverse, with sub-lineage 1.2.1 being dominant (192, 98 %). Lineage 1.2.1.3 isolates were geographically most widely distributed. The greatest diversity occurred in a border town sub-district. The time to the most recent common ancestor for the three major lineage 1.2.1 clades was estimated to be the year 1966 (95 % HPD 1948–1976). An association was found between failure of culture conversion by week 8 of treatment and infection with lineage 2 (4/6, 67 %) compared with lineage 1 strains (4/83, 5 %) (P<0.001), supporting evidence of greater virulence of lineage 2 strains. Eleven potential transmission clusters (SNP difference ≤12) were identified; at least five included people living in different sub-districts. Some linked cases spanned the whole 4-year study period. One cluster involved a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis strain matching a drug-susceptible strain from 3 years earlier. Drug resistance mutations were uncommon, but revealed one phenotype–genotype mismatch in a genotypically multidrug-resistant isolate, and rare nonsense mutations within the katG gene in two isolates. Consistent with the regionally mobile population, M. tuberculosis strains in Kota Kinabalu were diverse, although several lineage 1 strains dominated and were locally well established. Transmission clusters – uncommonly identified, likely attributable to incomplete sampling – showed clustering occurring across the community, not confined to households or sub-districts. The findings indicate that public health priorities should include active case finding and early institution of tuberculosis management in mobile populations, while there is a need to upscale effective contact investigation beyond households to include other contacts within social networks.","Bainomugisa, Arnold; Meumann, Ella M.; Rajahram, Giri Shan; Ong, Rick Twee-Hee; Coin, Lachlan; Paul, Dawn Carmel; William, Timothy; Coulter, Christopher; Ralph, Anna P.",Microb Genom,373,32

METHODS: French pilgrims were recruited between January 2012–December 2014 and information on demographics, medical history, compliance with preventive measures and health problems during travel were collected. RESULTS: A total of 382 pilgrims were included with 39.3% aged ≥65 years and 55.1% suffering from a chronic disease, most frequently hypertension and diabetes. The prevalence of cough was 80.9% and a high proportion presented with associated sore throat (91.0%), rhinitis (78.7%) and hoarseness (63.0%). Myalgia was reported in 48.3% of cases and subjective fever in 47.3%. The incubation time of respiratory symptoms was 7.7 days (range 0–25 days) and 51.9% of pilgrims presenting with a cough during their stay were still symptomatic on return. Among pilgrims with a cough, 69.4% took antibiotics. The prevalence of cough was significantly higher among females than men, but age, chronic conditions and preventive measures had no significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: The Hajj cough is highly common, likely a result of crowded conditions at religious places. Pilgrims should be advised to carry symptomatic relief for the Hajj cough such as cough suppressant, soothing throat lozenges and paracetamol.

Several studies have been performed in order to develop antiviral drugs, from which a few have been prescribed to patients. Also, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19. It has been well-documented that the surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the binding and entry of CoV. After entering, the viral RNA interrupts the cell proliferation system to activate self-proliferation. However, having all the information about the outbreakof the SARS-COV-2, it is not still clear which factors determine the severity of lung and heart function impairment induced by COVID-19. A major step in exploring SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is to determine the distribution of ACE2 in different tissues . In this review, the structure and origin of CoV, the role of ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-COV-2 on the surface of host cells, and the ACE2 distribution in different tissues with a focus on lung and cardiovascular system have been discussed. It was also revealed that acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may result in the clinical severity of COVID-19.

We assessed antibody and T cell reactivity in convalescent COVID-19 patients and healthy donors sampled both prior to and during the pandemic. Healthy donors examined during the pandemic exhibited increased numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, but no humoral response. Their probable exposure to the virus resulted in either asymptomatic infection without antibody secretion, or activation of pre-existing immunity. In convalescent patients, we observed a public and diverse T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing T cell receptor (TCR) motifs with germline-encoded features. Bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the spike glycoprotein were mediated by groups of homologous TCRs, some of them shared across multiple donors. Overall, our results demonstrate that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2, including the identified set of TCRs, can serve as a useful biomarker for surveying antiviral immunity.","Shomuradova, Alina S.; Vagida, Murad S.; Sheetikov, Savely A.; Zornikova, Ksenia V.; Kiryukhin, Dmitry; Titov, Aleksei; Peshkova, Iuliia O.; Khmelevskaya, Alexandra; Dianov, Dmitry V.; Malasheva, Maria; Shmelev, Anton; Serdyuk, Yana; Bagaev, Dmitry V.; Pivnyuk, Anastasia; Shcherbinin, Dmitrii S.; Maleeva, Alexandra V.; Shakirova, Naina T.; Pilunov, Artem; Malko, Dmitry B.; Khamaganova, Ekaterina G.; Biderman, Bella; Ivanov, Alexander; Shugay, Mikhail; Efimov, Grigory A.",Immunity,373,1

Earlier studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SARS-CoV-1 in Eastern Asian (EAS) populations. In this report, we aimed at exploring the frequency of a set of genetic polymorphisms that could affect SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or severity, including those that were previously associated with SARS-CoV-1. METHODS: We extracted the list of SNPs that could potentially modulate SARS-CoV-2 from the genome wide association studies (GWAS) on SARS-CoV-1 and other viruses. We also collected the expression data of these SNPs from the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) databases. Sequences from Qatar Genome Programme (QGP, n = 6,054) and 1000Genome project were used to calculate and compare allelic frequencies (AF). RESULTS: A total of 74 SNPs, located in 10 genes: ICAM3, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, AHSG, MBL, Furin, TMPRSS2, IL4, and CD209 promoter, were identified. Analysis of Qatari genomes revealed significantly lower AF of risk variants linked to SARS-CoV-1 severity (CCL2, MBL, CCL5, AHSG, and IL4) compared to that of 1000Genome and/or the EAS population (up to 25-fold change). Conversely, SNPs in TMPRSS2, IFN-γ, ICAM3, and Furin were more common among Qataris (average 2-fold change). Inter-population analysis showed that the distribution of risk alleles among Europeans differs substantially from Africans and EASs. Remarkably, Africans seem to carry extremely lower frequencies of SARS-CoV-1 susceptibility alleles, reaching to 32-fold decrease compared to other populations. CONCLUSION: Multiple genetic variants, which could potentially modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection, are significantly variable between populations, with the lowest frequency observed among Africans. Our results highlight the importance of exploring population genetics to understand and predict COVID-19 outcomes. Indeed, further studies are needed to validate these findings as well as to identify new genetic determinants linked to SARS-CoV-2.","Smatti, Maria K.; Al-Sarraj, Yasser A.; Albagha, Omar; Yassine, Hadi M.",Front Genet,373,3

Sensitive and quantitative detection of human enteric viruses is typically achieved through quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). A nanofluidic real-time PCR system was used to develop novel high-throughput methods for qualitative molecular detection (RT-qPCR array) and quantification of human pathogenic viruses by digital RT-PCR (RT-dPCR). The performance of high-throughput PCR methods was investigated for detecting 19 human pathogenic viruses and two main process controls used in food virology. The conventional real-time PCR system was compared to the RT-dPCR and RT-qPCR array. Based on the number of genome copies calculated by spectrophotometry, sensitivity was found to be slightly better with RT-qPCR than with RT-dPCR for 14 viruses by a factor range of from 0.3 to 1.6 log(10). Conversely, sensitivity was better with RT-dPCR than with RT-qPCR for seven viruses by a factor range of from 0.10 to 1.40 log(10). Interestingly, the number of genome copies determined by RT-dPCR was always from 1 to 2 log(10) lower than the expected copy number calculated by RT-qPCR standard curve. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR and RT-qPCR array assays was found to be similar for two viruses, and better with RT-qPCR than with RT-qPCR array for eighteen viruses by a factor range of from 0.7 to 3.0 log(10). Conversely, sensitivity was only 0.30 log(10) better with the RT-qPCR array than with conventional RT-qPCR assays for norovirus GIV detection. Finally, the RT-qPCR array and RT-dPCR assays were successfully used together to screen clinical samples and quantify pathogenic viruses. Additionally, this method made it possible to identify co-infection in clinical samples. In conclusion, given the rapidity and potential for large numbers of viral targets, this nanofluidic RT-qPCR assay should have a major impact on human pathogenic virus surveillance and outbreak investigations and is likely to be of benefit to public health.","Coudray-Meunier, Coralie; Fraisse, Audrey; Martin-Latil, Sandra; Delannoy, Sabine; Fach, Patrick; Perelle, Sylvie",PLoS One,373,20

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to have a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of older COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus was performed from December 2019 to May 3rd, 2020. Observational studies including older adults (age ≥ 60 years) with COVID-19 infection and reporting clinical characteristics or outcome were included. Primary outcome was assessing weighted pooled prevalence (WPP) of severity and outcomes. Secondary outcomes were clinical features including comorbidities and need of respiratory support. RESULT: Forty-six studies with 13,624 older patients were included. Severe infection was seen in 51% (95% CI– 36-65%, I(2)–95%) patients while 22% (95% CI– 16-28%, I(2)–88%) were critically ill. Overall, 11% (95% CI– 5-21%, I(2)–98%) patients died. The common comorbidities were hypertension (48, 95% CI– 36-60% I(2)–92%), diabetes mellitus (22, 95% CI– 13-32%, I(2)–86%) and cardiovascular disease (19, 95% CI – 11-28%, I(2)–85%). Common symptoms were fever (83, 95% CI– 66-97%, I(2)–91%), cough (60, 95% CI– 50-70%, I(2)–71%) and dyspnoea (42, 95% CI– 19-67%, I(2)–94%). Overall, 84% (95% CI– 60-100%, I(2)–81%) required oxygen support and 21% (95% CI– 0-49%, I(2)–91%) required mechanical ventilation. Majority of studies had medium to high risk of bias and overall quality of evidence was low for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of older patients with COVID-19 have severe infection, one in five are critically ill and one in ten die.

The VP1 genes of all very virulent strains were 97.5% to 99.8% identical. With the exception of an atypical Australian strain, 002-73, all of the classical virulent or attenuated and antigenic variant strains were also 97.5% to 100% identical. Serotype 2 strains showed only 4–6% divergence from serotype 1 classical virulent or attenuated strains; in contrast, however, the very virulent strains were 10.5% to 12.5% divergent from the classical virulent or attenuated strains as well as serotype 2 strains. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of VP1 revealed 17 common, including 8 unique amino acid substitutions in the very virulent strains. In the phylogenetic tree the very virulent strains formed a distinct cluster and all other strains including classical virulent, attenuated and antigenic variant strains and even serotype 2 strains were grouped together.

Modifications of full length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor.

Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs.

However, no study to date has examined the association between CRF and COVID-19. The objectives of this study were to determine whether CRF is independently associated with testing positive with or dying from COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 2,690 adults from the UK Biobank Study that were followed from March 16(th), 2020 to July 26(th), 2020. Participants who were tested for COVID-19 and had undergone CRF assessment were examined. CRF was estimated (eCRF) and categorized as low (<20(th) percentile), moderate (20(th) to 80(th) percentile) and high (≥80(th) percentile) within sex and ten-year age groups (e.g. 50–60 years). Participants were classified as having COVID-19 if they tested positive (primarily PCR tests) at an in-patient or out-patient setting as of July 26, 2020. Participants were classified as having died from COVID-19 if the primary or underlying cause of death was listed ICD-10 codes U071 or U072 by June 30(th), 2020. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and a forward model building approach used to identify covariates. FINDINGS: There was no significant association between eCRF and testing positive for COVID-19. Conversely, individuals with moderate (aRR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.75) and high fitness (aRR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.85) had a significantly lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than those with low fitness. CONCLUSIONS: While eCRF was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19, we observed a significant dose-response between having higher eCRF and a decreased risk of dying from COVID-19. This suggests that prior gains in CRF could be protective against dying from COVID-19 should someone develop the virus.","Christensen, Rebecca A.

To address this need, we are developing a subunit recombinant protein vaccine comprising residues 377–588 of the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which, when formulated with the AddaVax adjuvant, it induces a significant neutralizing antibody response and protection against MERS-CoV challenge in vaccinated animals. To prepare for the manufacture and first-in-human testing of the vaccine, we have developed a process to stably produce the recombinant MERS S377-588 protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To accomplish this, we transfected an adherent dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cell line (adCHO) with a plasmid encoding S377-588 fused with the human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc). We then demonstrated the interleukin-2 signal peptide-directed secretion of the recombinant protein into extracellular milieu. Using a gradually increasing methotrexate (MTX) concentration to 5 μM, we increased protein yield by a factor of 40.

An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C>T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C>T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C>T, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C>T mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.","Eskier, Doğa; Karakülah, Gökhan; Suner, Aslı; Oktay, Yavuz",bioRxiv,373,18

Rather, it might be more similar to complement-mediated TMA syndromes, which are well known to rheumatologists who care for patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. This perspective has critical implications for treatment. Anticoagulation and antiviral agents are standard treatments for DIC but are gravely insufficient for any of the TMA disorders that involve disorders of complement. Mediators of TMA syndromes overlap with those released in cytokine storm, suggesting close connections between ineffective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, severe pneumonia and life-threatening microangiopathy.","Merrill, Joan T.; Erkan, Doruk; Winakur, Jerald; James, Judith A.",Nat Rev Rheumatol,373,1

While this respiratory virus only causes mild symptoms in younger healthy individuals, elderly people and those with cardiovascular diseases such as systemic hypertension are susceptible to developing severe conditions that can be fatal. SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, and thromboembolism. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of this virus on the cardiovascular system should thus help develop therapeutic strategies to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since this virus causes severe and fatal conditions in older individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities, effective therapies targeting specific populations will likely contribute to ending this pandemic. In this review article, the effects of various viruses—including other coronaviruses, influenza, dengue, and human immunodeficiency virus—on the cardiovascular system are described to help provide molecular mechanisms of pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. The goal is to provide mechanistic information from the biology of other viral infections in relation to cardiovascular pathologies for the purpose of developing improved vaccines and therapeutic agents effective in preventing and/or treating the acute and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.","Seeherman, Sarah; Suzuki, Yuichiro J.",Int J Mol Sci,373,3

A previous drug repurposing screen identified the approved anthelminthic drug niclosamide as a small molecule inhibitor of Zika virus infection. However, as antihelminthic drugs are generally designed to have low absorption when dosed orally, the very limited bioavailability of niclosamide will likely hinder its potential direct repurposing as an antiviral medication. Here, we conducted SAR studies focusing on the anilide and salicylic acid regions of niclosamide to improve physicochemical properties such as microsomal metabolic stability, permeability and solubility. We found that the 5-bromo substitution in the salicylic acid region retains potency while providing better drug-like properties. Other modifications in the anilide region with 2’-OMe and 2’-H substitutions were also advantageous. We found that the 4’-NO2 substituent can be replaced with a 4’-CN or 4’-CF3 substituents. Together, these modifications provide a basis for optimizing the structure of niclosamide to improve systemic exposure for application of niclosamide analogs as drug lead candidates for treating Zika and other viral infections. Indeed, key analogs were also able to rescue cells from the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shamim, Khalida; Xu, Miao; Hu, Xin; Lee, Emily M; Lu, Xiao; Huang, Ruili; Shah, Pranav; Xu, Xin; Chen, Catherine Z; Shen, Min; Guo, Hui; Chen, Lu; Itkin, Zina; Eastman, Richard; Shinn, Paul; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; Michael, Sam; Simeonov, Anton; Lo, Donald C.; Ming, Guo-li; Song, Hongjun; Tang, Hengli; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Wenwei",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,373,16

Effective therapeutics and vaccines against multiple coronaviruses remain unavailable. Single chain variable fragment (scFv), a recombinant antibody exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses owing to its nucleic acid-hydrolyzing property. Objective This study is aimed to investigate an antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Methods 3D8, a recombinant scFv antibody was evaluated for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and PEDV in Vero E6 cell cultures. Viral growth was quantified with quantitative RT-qPCR and plaque assay. Nucleic acid hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 was assessed through abzyme assays of in vitro viral transcripts and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Results 3D8 inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Our results revealed the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of 3D8 scFv against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Immunoblot and plaque assays showed the reduction of coronavirus nucleoproteins and infectious particles respectively in 3D8 scFv-treated cells. Conclusions This data demonstrates the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of 3D8 against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Thus, it could be considered a potential antiviral countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2 and zoonotic coronaviruses.","Lee, Gunsup; Budhathoki, Shailesh; Lee, Geum-Young; Oh, Kwang-ji; Ham, Yeon Kyoung; Kim, Young Jun; Lim, Ye Rin; Hoang, Phuong Thi; Lee, Yongjun; Lim, Seok-Won; Kim, Jun-Mo; Cho, Seungchan; Kim, Tai-Hyun; Song, Jin-Won; Lee, Sukchan; Kim, Won-Keun",bioRxiv,373,32

To provide evidence on the post-lockdown risk of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, the city government conducted a citywide nucleic acid screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection between May 14 and June 1, 2020. Methods: All city residents aged [≥]6 years were potentially eligible to participate the screening programme. The rate of detection of asymptomatic infected cases was calculated, and their demographic and geographic distributions were investigated. ArcGIS 10.0 was used to draw a geographic distribution of asymptomatic infected persons. Results: The screening programme recruited a total of 9,899,828 persons (response rate, 92.9%). The screening found no newly confirmed patients with COVID-19, and identified 300 asymptomatic infected cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000). In addition, 107 of 34,424 previously recovered patients with a history of COVID-19 diagnosis were tested positive (relapse rate, 0.31%). Virus culture of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for all 300 asymptomatic cases and all 107 recovered COVID-19 patients. A total of 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases were traced and all of them had a negative nucleic acid testing result. Conclusions: Prevalence of COVID-19 nucleic acid test positivity was very low in the Wuhan general population, in recovered cases and in contacts of asymptomatic cases, five to eight weeks after the end of lockdown.

Methods: Two pulmonologists, two radiologists, and two pathologists reviewed 27 patients affected by severe COVID-19 pneumonia as the main diagnosis made by non-pulmonologists. To evaluate whether the contribution of specialists, individually and/or in combination, might modify the original diagnosis, a three-step virtual process was planned. The whole lung examination was considered the gold standard for the final diagnosis. The probability of a correct diagnosis was calculated using a model based on generalized estimating equations. The effectiveness of a multidisciplinary diagnosis was obtained by comparing diagnoses made by experienced pulmonologists with those made by non-pulmonologists. Results: In 19% of cases, the diagnosis of COVID-19-related death was mainly incorrect. The probability of a correct diagnosis increased strikingly from an undedicated clinician to an expert specialist. Every single specialist made significantly more correct diagnoses than any non-pulmonologist. The highest level of accuracy was achieved by the combination of 3 expert specialists (p = 0.0003). Conclusion: The dynamic interaction between expert specialists may significantly improve the diagnostic confidence and management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Calabrese, Fiorella; Pezzuto, Federica; Giraudo, Chiara; Vedovelli, Luca; Fortarezza, Francesco; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Lunardi, Francesca; Fraia, Anna Sara; Cocconcelli, Elisabetta; Vuljan, Stefania Edith; Gregori, Dario; Crisanti, Andrea; Balestro, Elisabetta; Spagnolo, Paolo",Front Med (Lausanne),373,1

Recently, various deep learning (DL) researches based on the EEG signals have been proposed to detect fatigue conditions. The research presented in this paper proposes an EEG classification system for DD based on DL networks. However, the proposed DD system is mainly realized into two procedures; (i) data acquisition and (ii) model analysis. For the data acquisition procedure, two key steps are considered, which are the signal collection using a wearable Emotiv EPOC [Formula: see text] headset to record 14 channels of EEG, and the signal annotation. Furthermore, a data augmentation (DA) step has been added to the proposed system to overcome the problem of over-fitting and to improve accuracy. As regards the model analysis, a comparative study is also introduced in this paper to argue the choice of DL architecture and frameworks used in our DD system. In this sense, The proposed DD protocol makes use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implemented using the Keras library.

METHODS: English databases included PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science. Chinese databases involved Wanfang Data, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Chinese Biological Medicine Database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing helmet and face mask NIMV for patients with ARF were searched. Meta-analysis was performed using Review manager 5.1.0. RESULTS: Twelve trials with a total of 569 patients were eligible. Our meta-analysis showed that, comparing with face mask, helmet could significantly decrease the incidences of intolerance [risk ratio (RR) 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09−0.39], facial skin ulcer (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.08−0.43) and aerophagia (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06−0.37), reduce respiratory rate [mean difference (MD) -3.10; 95% CI -4.85 to -1.34], intubation rate (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.26−0.59) and hospital mortality (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.39−0.99) in patients with ARF, and improve oxygenation index in patients with hypoxemic ARF (MD 55.23; 95% CI 31.37−79.09). However, subgroupanalysis for hypercapnic ARF revealed that PaCO(2) was significantly reduced in face mask group compared with helmet group (MD 5.34; 95% CI 3.41−7.27). CONCLUSION: NIMV with helmet can improve the patient’s tolerance, reduce adverse events, increase oxygenation effect, and decrease intubation rate and hospital mortality comparing to face mask. However, the low number of patients from included studies may preclude strong conclusions. Large RCTs are still needed to provide more robust evidence.","Hong, Shukun; Wang, Hongye; Tian, Yonggang; Qiao, Lujun",PLoS One,373,2

Ce travail a pour objectif de rapporter les observations rencontrées sur le terrain ainsi que de décrire les modalités pratiques de leurs mises en oeuvre. Matériels et méthodes L’étude s’est déroulée du 29/01/21 au 10/02/21. Il s’agit d’une analyse descriptive de données quantitatives recueillies auprès d’infectiologues impliqués dans la mise en place de centres de vaccination, après diffusion d’un questionnaire via infectio-flash, couplée à une analyse de données qualitatives extraites d’échanges entre des formateurs REB et de réunions de cadres de santé de certains établissements de santé de référence. Résultats Cinquante-deux répondants répartis sur l’ensemble du territoire, correspondants chacun à un centre de vaccination différents, ont complété le questionnaire ; 24 (46 %) exercent en centre hospitalier universitaire, 17 (33 %) en centre hospitalier et 11 dans d’autres types de structures. La première date de mise en place de centre de vaccination était le 28/12/2020. Trente-six (69 %) répondants rapportent avoir rencontré des freins techniques : 23 (63 %) avec le matériel d’injection pour la 6e dose du vaccin BNT162b2 et 29 (80 %) pour l’accès au portail AMELI SIVAC. L’identification à ce portail en utilisant la carte de professionnel de santé, semble avoir été l’une des principales difficultés. Quarante (78 %) répondants rapportent des freins logistiques, principalement liés à la disponibilité des vaccins (98 %), ainsi que celle de locaux pour vacciner (76 %). Un répondant sur deux déclare des difficultés liées au manque de personnel administratif (80 %), médical (76 %) et infirmier (26 %). Trent-sept répondants (71 %) ont jugé avoir été suffisamment informés, même si les directives des tutelles au cours du processus de mise en place des centres ont été estimées peu lisibles ou changeantes par certains. Quarante-neuf (96 %) répondants rapportent que des patients ne présentant pas les critères prioritaires de vaccination se rendent régulièrement (55 %) ou exceptionnellement (41 %) dans les centres. Une très large majorité des répondants (98 %) rapporte que l’établissement dans lequel ils exercent a été facilitant dans la mise en place du centre de vaccination.

Results: A total of 3,399 respondents were included in the analysis. It was observed that 14.2% (481/3,399) of the participants were screened positive for depressive symptoms. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, older age (OR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99), smoking (OR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.10–2.26), self-rated health (good: OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37–0.66; fairly: OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–0.80), having greater support scores (OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94–0.96), knowledge about the main symptom of COVID-19 (very clearly: OR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42–0.79; relatively clearly: OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44–0.79), and staying in Wuhan within 3 months before the outbreak of epidemic (OR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.34–2.38) were associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusion: A considerable proportion of the general population in China had depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Routine screening and targeted interventions for depression are needed among high-risk depressed individuals during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Peng, Songxu; Lai, Xin; Du, Yukai; Li, Yuting; Tian, Kunming; Gan, Yong",Front Psychol,373,16

In this Review, we summarize the crucial role of diagnostic tests during the first global wave of COVID-19. We explore the technical and implementation problems encountered during this early phase in the pandemic, and try to define future directions for the progressive and better use of (syndromic) diagnostics during a possible resurgence of COVID-19 in future global waves or regional outbreaks. Continuous global improvement in diagnostic test preparedness is essential for more rapid detection of patients, possibly at the point of care, and for optimized prevention and treatment, in both industrialized countries and low-resource settings.","Vandenberg, Olivier; Martiny, Delphine; Rochas, Olivier; van Belkum, Alex; Kozlakidis, Zisis",Nat Rev Microbiol,373,5

The effect of facecovers on the gaze when looking at faces has not been assessed yet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate a potential difference in eye movement pattern in observes which are exposed to images showing a face without and with facecover to identify if there is truly a change of gaze when identifying (masked) facial features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eye movement of a total of 64 study participants (28 males and 36 females) with a mean age of 31.84±9.0 years was analyzed in this cross-sectional observational study. Eye movement analysis was conducted based on positional changes of eye features within an x- and y- coordinate system while two images (face without/with facecover) were displayed for 8 seconds. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that the sequence of focussing on facial regions was not altered when wearing a facecover and followed the sequence: perioral, nose, periorbital. Wearing a facecover significantly increased the time of focussing on the periorbital region and increased also the number of repeated eye fixations during the interval of visual stimulus presentation. No statistically significant differences were observed between male and female participants in their eye movement pattern across all investigated variables with p > 0.433. CONCLUSION: Aesthetic practitioners could utilized the presented data and develop marketing and treatment strategies which majorly target the periorbital area understanding the altered eye movement pattern in times of COVID-19.","Frank, Konstantin; Schuster, Luca; Alfertshofer, Michael; Baumbach, Sebastian Felix; Herterich, Viktoria; Giunta, Riccardo E; Moellhoff, Nicholas; Braig, David; Ehrl, Denis; Cotofana, Sebastian",Aesthet Surg J,373,26

METHODS: Complete clinical and epidemiological data from 149 patients with COVID-19 at a hospital in Hunan Province, China, were collected and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Analysis of the distribution and receiver operator characteristic curve of incubation periods showed that 7 days was the optimal cut-off value to assess differences in disease severity between groups. Patients with shorter (≤7 days) incubation periods (n = 79) had more severe disease, longer durations of hospitalization, longer times from symptom onset to discharge, more abnormal laboratory findings, and more severe radiological findings than patients with longer (>7 days) incubation periods. Regression and correlation analyses also showed that a shorter incubation period was associated with longer times from symptom onset to discharge. CONCLUSION: The associations between the incubation periods and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients suggest that the incubation period may be a useful marker of disease severity and prognosis.","Cai, Yeyu; Liu, Jiayi; Yang, Haitao; Wang, Mian; Guo, Qingping; Huang, Deng; Yu, Qizhi; Xiao, Enhua",J Int Med Res,373,17

Sensitive tests that effectively predict the disease outcome are essentially required to guide proper intervention. Objectives: To evaluate the prognostic ability of serial procalcitonin (PCT) measurement to predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients, using PCT clearance (PCT-c) as a tool to reflect its dynamic changes. Methods: A prospective observational study of inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Quarantine Hospitals of Ain-Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. During the first five days of hospitalization, serial PCT and PCT-c values were obtained and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Patients were followed up to hospital discharge or in-hospital mortality. Results: Compared to survivors, serial PCT levels of non-survivors were significantly higher (p<0.001) and progressively increased during follow-up, in contrast, PCT-c values were significantly lower (p<0.01) and progressively decreased. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that by using the initial PCT value alone, at a cut off value of 0.80 ng/ml, the area under the curve for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.81 with 61.1% sensitivity and 87.3% accuracy. Serial measurements showed better predictive performance and the combined prediction value was better than the single prediction by the initial PCT. Conclusions: Serial PCT measurement could be a useful laboratory tool to predict the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, PCT-c could be a reliable tool to assess PCT progressive kinetics.","Taha, S. I.; Shata, A. K.; Baioumy, S. A.; Fouad, S. H.; Youssef, M. K.",,373,2

DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: Nine specialist and two large general medical journals. POPULATION: Authors of research manuscripts submitted between 1 January 2018 and 31 May 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: first author’s gender. Secondary outcomes: last and corresponding authors’ gender; number (percentage) of women on authorship byline in “pre-pandemic” period (1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019) and in “covid-19” and “non-covid-19” manuscripts during pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 63 259 manuscripts were included. The number of female first, last, and corresponding authors respectively were 1313 (37.1%), 996 (27.9%), and 1119 (31.1%) for covid-19 manuscripts (lowest values in Jan-May 2020: 230 (29.4%), 165 (21.1%), and 185 (22.9%)), compared with 8583 (44.9%), 6118 (31.2%), and 7273 (37.3%) for pandemic non-covid-19 manuscripts and 12 724 (46.0%), 8923 (31.4%), and 10 981 (38.9%) for pre-pandemic manuscripts. The adjusted odds ratio of having a female first author in covid-19 manuscripts was <1.00 in all groups (P<0.001) compared with pre-pandemic (lowest in Jan-May 2020: 0.55, 98.75% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.70). The adjusted odds ratio of having a woman as last or corresponding author was significantly lower for covid-19 manuscripts in all time periods (except for the two most recent periods for last author) compared with pre-pandemic (lowest values in Jan-May 2020: 0.74 (0.57 to 0.97) for last and 0.61 (0.49 to 0.77) for corresponding author). The odds ratios for pandemic non-covid-19 manuscripts were not significantly different compared with pre-pandemic manuscripts. The median percentage of female authors on the byline was lower for covid-19 manuscripts (28.6% in Jan-May 2020) compared with pre-pandemic (36.4%) and non-covid-19 pandemic manuscripts (33.3% in Jan-May 2020). Gender disparities in all prominent authorship positions and the proportion of women authors on the byline narrowed in the most recent period (Feb-May 2021) compared with the early pandemic period (Jan-May 2020) and were very similar to values observed for pre-pandemic manuscripts. CONCLUSIONS: Women have been underrepresented as co-authors and in prominent authorship positions in covid-19 research, and this gender disparity needs to be corrected by those involved in academic promotion and awarding of research grants. Women attained some prominent authorship positions equally or more frequently than before the pandemic on non-covid-19 related manuscripts submitted at some time points during the pandemic.","Gayet-Ageron, Angèle; Ben Messaoud, Khaoula; Richards, Mark; Schroter, Sara",BMJ,373,16

This work explores the perceptions of Spaniards with IDD during the lockdown with respect to four topics: access to information, emotional experiences, effects on living conditions and access to support. METHODS: The topics were explored using a subset of 16 closed‐ended questions from an online survey. In total, 582 participants with IDD completed the survey. The frequencies and percentages of responses to the questions were calculated, and chi‐square tests performed to explore the relationship between participants' sociodemographic characteristics and responses. Given that people differed in the way in which they completed the survey, the relationship between participants' responses and completion method was also analysed. RESULTS: Participants reported that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown have had a deleterious effect on their emotional well‐being (around 60.0% of participants) and occupations (48.0% of students and 72.7% of workers). Although access to information and support was reportedly good overall, being under the age of 21 years and studying were associated with perceptions reflecting poorer access to information (V = .20 and V = .13, respectively) and well‐being support (V = .15 and V = .13, respectively).

Such consequences are well established in the influenza and flavivirus fields. A first step to establish whether pre-existing responses can impact SARS-CoV-2 infection is to understand the nature and extent of cross-reactivity in humans to coronaviruses. We compared serum antibody and memory B cell responses to coronavirus spike (S) proteins from pre-pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors using a series of binding and functional assays. We found weak evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive serum antibodies in pre-pandemic donors. However, we found stronger evidence of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells that were activated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from the donors showed varying degrees of cross-reactivity with betacoronaviruses, including SARS and endemic coronaviruses. None of the cross-reactive mAbs were neutralizing except for one that targeted the S2 subunit of the S protein. The results suggest that pre-existing immunity to endemic coronaviruses should be considered in evaluating antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Song, Ge; He, Wan-ting; Callaghan, Sean; Anzanello, Fabio; Huang, Deli; Ricketts, James; Torres, Jonathan L.; Beutler, Nathan; Peng, Linghang; Vargas, Sirena; Cassell, Jon; Parren, Mara; Yang, Linlin; Ignacio, Caroline; Smith, Davey M.; Voss, James E.; Nemazee, David; Ward, Andrew B; Rogers, Thomas; Burton, Dennis R.; Andrabi, Raiees",bioRxiv,373,30

Three patients were at the time of admission in gestational week between 21 + 4 and 22 + 5 and treated during their antenatal period; meanwhile, the other two were admitted within 1 week postpartum. All of them were in need of intensive care: one was treated with high flow oxygen therapy, the other four with invasive mechanical ventilation (three with endotracheal intubation and one with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Age above thirty, overweight, and gestational diabetes are notable factors in the cases presented. At the time of admission, they all presented with symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea. Chest imaging with computer tomography scan was performed in each case and demonstrated multifocal pneumonic infiltrates in all of them, but no pulmonary embolism was confirmed in any.

One reason may be that psychological resources are protective in stressful contexts. This study tested whether indeed psychological resources are protective against biological degradation for healthy mid-life women under the chronic stress of caring for a child with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (“caregivers”). METHODS: We tested whether five types of psychosocial resources (i.e., eudaimonic well-being, autonomy, purpose in life, self-acceptance, and mastery) were associated with biological indices of aging in a sample of mid-life women stratified by chronic stress; half were caregivers (n = 92) and half were mothers of neurotypical children (n = 91; controls). Selected stress and age related biological outcomes were insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), systemic inflammation (IL-6, CRP), and cellular aging (leukocyte telomere length). We tested whether each resource was associated with these biomarkers, and whether caregiving status and high parenting stress moderated that relationship. RESULTS: All the psychological resources except mastery were significantly negatively associated with insulin resistance, while none were related to systemic inflammation or telomere length. The relationships between eudaimonic well-being and HOMA-IR, and self-acceptance and HOMA-IR, were moderated by parental stress; lower resources were associated with higher insulin resistance, but only for women reporting high parental stress. The well-known predictors of age and BMI accounted for 46% of variance in insulin resistance, and psychological resources accounted for an additional 13% of variance. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that higher eudaimonic well-being and greater self-acceptance may be protective for the metabolic health of mid-life women, and particularly in the context of high parenting stress. This has important implications given the rising rates of both parental stress and metabolic disease, and because psychological interventions can increase eudaimonic well-being and self-acceptance.

Phlorotannins show great pharmaceutical potential in in vivo models and, among the several examples, the anti-dyslipidemia activity of dieckol must be highlighted because it was more effective than lovastatin in an in vivo model. The IRLIIVLMPILMA tridecapeptide that exhibits an in vivo level of activity similar to the hypotensive clinical drug captopril should still be stressed, as well as griffithsin which showed such stunning results over a variety of animal models and which will probably move onto clinical trials soon. Regarding clinical trials, studies with pure algal metabolites are scarce, limited to those carried out with kahalalide F and fucoxanthin. The majority of clinical trials currently aim to ascertain the effect of algae consumption, as extracts or fractions, on obesity and diabetes.","Rosa, Gonçalo P.; Tavares, Wilson R.; Sousa, Pedro M.

More knowledge is needed to guide infection control measures. Objective: To characterize the family index case for detected SARS-CoV-2 and describe testing and secondary attack rates in the family. Design: Register-based cohort study. Setting: Individual-level administrative data of all families and all PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway in 2020. Participants: All families with at least one parent and one child below the age of 20, who lived at the same address (N=662 582), where at least one member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. Main outcome measures: Secondary attack rates (SAR7) were defined as the share of non-index family members with a positive PCR test within seven days of the index case. SARs were calculated separately for parent- and child-index cases, and for parent- and child-secondary cases. Results: We identified 7548 index cases, comprising 26 991 individuals, of which 12184 were parents and 14808 children. The index was a parent in 66% of the cases. Among the children, 42% of the index cases were in the age group 17-20 and only 8% 0-6 years. When the index was a parent, SAR7 was 24% (95%CI 24 to 25), whilst SAR7 was 14% (95%CI 13 to 15) when the index was a child. However, SAR7 was 24% (95%CI 20 to 28) when the index was a child aged 0-6 years and declined steeply with increasing age of the index child. SAR7 from index parent to other parents was 35% (95%CI 33 to 36), and from index child to other children 12% (95%CI 11 to 13). SAR7 from index child aged 0-6 to parents was 27% (95%CI 22 to 33). The percent of non-index family members tested within 7 days after the index case, increased from about 20% in April to 80% in December, however, SAR7 stabilized at about 20% from May. Conclusion: Parents and older children are most often index cases for SARS-CoV-2 in families in Norway, while parents and young children more often transmit the virus within the families. This study suggests that whilst the absolute infection numbers are low for young children because of their low introduction rate, when infected, young children and parents transmit the virus to the same extent within the family.","Telle, K.; Jorgensen, S.

COVID-19 also caused the overwhelming majority of information workers to rapidly shift to working from home (WFH). The central question this work addresses is: can we isolate the effects of WFH on information workers' collaboration activities from all other factors, especially the other effects of COVID-19? This is important because in the future, WFH will likely to be more common than it was prior to the pandemic. We use difference-in-differences (DiD), a causal identification strategy commonly used in the social sciences, to control for unobserved confounding factors and estimate the causal effect of WFH. Our analysis relies on measuring the difference in changes between those who WFH prior to COVID-19 and those who did not. Our preliminary results suggest that on average, people spent more time on collaboration in April (Post WFH mandate) than in February (Pre WFH mandate), but this is primarily due to factors other than WFH, such as lockdowns during the pandemic. The change attributable to WFH specifically is in the opposite direction: less time on collaboration and more focus time. This reversal shows the importance of using causal inference: a simple analysis would have resulted in the wrong conclusion. We further find that the effect of WFH is moderated by individual remote collaboration experience prior to WFH. Meanwhile, the medium for collaboration has also shifted due to WFH: instant messages were used more, whereas scheduled meetings were used less. We discuss design implications -- how future WFH may affect focused work, collaborative work, and creative work.","Yang, Longqi; Jaffe, Sonia; Holtz, David; Suri, Siddharth; Sinha, Shilpi; Weston, Jeffrey; Joyce, Connor; Shah, Neha; Sherman, Kevin; Lee, CJ; Hecht, Brent; Teevan, Jaime",Nature human behaviour,373,33

Although effective vaccines are now available, it is likely that this pathogen will become endemic and stay with us for years. In order to most effectively protect others and oneself from SARS-CoV‑2 infection, an understanding of how SARS-CoV‑2 is transmitted is of utmost importance. In this review paper, we explain transmission routes with an eye towards protecting others and oneself. We also address characteristics of SARS-CoV‑2 transmission in the community. This work will help to clarify the following questions based on the available literature: When and for how long is an infected person contagious? How is the virus excreted? How is the virus taken up? How does the virus spread in society? Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV‑2 is strongly determined by pathogen molecular characteristics as well as the kinetics of replication, shedding, and infection. SARS-CoV‑2 is transmitted primarily via human aerosols, which infected persons can excrete even if symptoms of the disease are not (yet) present. Most infected people cause only a few secondary cases, whereas a few cases (so-called super-spreaders) cause a high number of secondary infections – at the population level one speaks of a so-called “overdispersion.” These special characteristics of SARS-CoV‑2 (asymptomatic aerosol transmission and overdispersion) make the pandemic difficult to control.","Oh, Djin-Ye; Böttcher, Sindy; Kröger, Stefan; von Kleist, Max",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,373,26

The http://covid-webapp.numerusinc.com/ web app presented here fills this gap. METHODS: Our web app uses a model that explicitly identifies susceptible, contact, latent, asymptomatic, symptomatic and recovered classes of individuals, and a parallel set of response classes, subject to lower pathogen-contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file of incidence and, if of interest, mortality rate data. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a user-selected subset of these can be fitted to the model using maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). Model fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allow counterfactual and forecasting scenarios. Confidence or credible intervals can be generated using stochastic simulations, based on MLE values, or on an inputted CSV file containing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates of one or more parameters. RESULTS: We illustrate the use of our web app in extracting social distancing, social relaxation, surveillance or virulence switching functions (i.e., time varying drivers) from the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 epidemics in Israel, South Africa, and England. The Israeli outbreak exhibits four distinct phases: initial outbreak, social distancing, social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. An MCMC projection of this latter phase suggests the Israeli epidemic will continue to produce into late November an average of around 1500 new case per day, unless the population practices social-relaxation measures at least 5-fold below the level in August, which itself is 4-fold below the level at the start of July. Our analysis of the relatively late South African outbreak that became the world’s fifth largest COVID-19 epidemic in July revealed that the decline through late July and early August was characterised by a social distancing driver operating at more than twice the per-capita applicable-disease-class (pc-adc) rate of the social relaxation driver. Our analysis of the relatively early English outbreak, identified a more than 2-fold improvement in surveillance over the course of the epidemic. It also identified a pc-adc social distancing rate in early August that, though nearly four times the pc-adc social relaxation rate, appeared to barely contain a second wave that would break out if social distancing was further relaxed. CONCLUSION: Our web app provides policy makers and health officers who have no epidemiological modelling or computer coding expertise with an invaluable tool for assessing the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures. This includes an ability to generate an epidemic-suppression or curve-flattening index that measures the intensity with which behavioural responses suppress or flatten the epidemic curve in the region under consideration.","Getz, Wayne M.; Salter, Richard; Luisa Vissat, Ludovica; Horvitz, Nir",J Transl Med,373,3

This disruption to the economy provided an opportunity to measure change in air pollution when the population spends more time at home with fewer trips. Hourly air pollution observations were obtained for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Ontario air monitoring network for 2020 and the previous five years. The analysis is focused on a five-week period during the SOE with a previous five-week period used as a control. Fine particulate matter did not show any significant reductions during the SOE. Ozone concentrations at 12 of the 32 monitors were lower than any of the previous five-years; however, four locations were above average. Average ozone concentrations were 1 ppb lower during the SOE, but this ranged at individual monitors from 1.5 ppb above to 4.2 ppb below long-term conditions. Nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario, and both pollutants displayed their lowest concentrations for 22 of 29 monitors. Individual monitors ranged from 1 ppb (nitrogen dioxide) and 5 ppb (nitrogen oxides) above average to 4.5 (nitrogen dioxide) and 7.1 ppb (nitrogen oxides) below average. Overall, both nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario in response to the COVID-19 SOE, ozone concentrations suggested a possible reduction, and fine particulate matter has not varied from historic concentrations.","Adams, Matthew D.",Sci Total Environ,373,1

We propose a framework to understand attempts to develop more responsible behaviour at an industry level through processes of negotiation and coalition building. We suggest that any attempt to meaningfully influence ICR would require stakeholders to possess both power and legitimacy; moreover, magnitude and urgency of the issue at stake may affect the ability to influence ICR. The framework is applied to the retail banking industry, focusing on post-crisis experiences in two countries—Spain and the UK—where there has been considerable pressure on the retail banking industry by civil society and/or government to change behaviours, especially to abandon unethical practices. We illustrate in this paper how corporate responsibility at the sector level in retail banking is the product of context-specific processes of negotiation between civil society and public authorities, on behalf of customers and other stakeholders, drawing on legal and other institutions to influence industry behaviour.","de la Cuesta-González, Marta; Froud, Julie; Tischer, Daniel",J Bus Ethics,373,6

In China, a country stereotyped as a major source of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, research on the public understanding of animal influenza is limited to the Han, the main ethnic group. The present qualitative study in Southwest China investigated awareness of animal influenza among the Dai, an ethnic minority. The participants (15 men and 10 women, ages 18–83) were smallholder farmers of pigs and poultry in rural areas of Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province. A mixture of interviews and group discussions took place in homes and villages. The participants were asked about their knowledge of avian influenza (H7N9), swine influenza (H1N1), precautions taken to protect against influenza, procedures when animals were sick and perceived risk of animal influenza. The data were analysed following coding and thematic analysis. The findings demonstrated a limited understanding of animal health and welfare among participants. Specifically, they were largely unaware of animal influenza (H7N9, H1N1) including its causes, symptoms, prevention and treatment. The farmers were also uninformed of the risks they faced and unknowingly engaged in behaviours which increased direct or indirect exposure to infected animals, a risk factor for human infection. They also reported poor usage of veterinary services.

The role of RPT in critically ill COVID-19 patients is poorly described. We aimed to investigate the effects of RPT on oxygenation and lung aeration in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: Observational pre-post study. Patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, who received a protocolized CPT session and for which a pre-and post-RPT lung ultrasound (LUS) was performed, were included. A subgroup of patients had an available quantitative computed tomography (CT) scan performed within 4 days from RPT. The primary aim was to evaluate whether RPT improved oxygenation; secondary aims included correlations between LUS, CT and response to RPT. Results: Twenty patients were included. The median (1st–3rd quartile) PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 181 (105–456), 244 (137–497) and 246 (137–482) at baseline (T0), after RPT (T1), and after 6 h (T2), respectively. PaO(2)/FiO(2) improved throughout the study (p = 0.042); particularly, PaO(2)/FiO(2) improved at T1 in respect to T0 (p = 0.011), remaining higher at T2 (p = 0.007) compared to T0.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the continent will bear a higher burden of COVID-19 for the same reasons it suffers from other infectious diseases: ecology, socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems. However, so far SSA has reported lower incidence and fatalities compared to the predictions of standard models and the experience of other regions of the world. There are three leading explanations, each with different implications for the final epidemic burden: (1) low case detection, (2) differences in epidemiology (e.g. low R (0)), and (3) policy interventions. The low number of cases have led some SSA governments to relaxing these policy interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We show that the incidence of COVID-19 cases as of July 2020 can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. We then re-evaluate these findings in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic in Madagascar through August 2020. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of a growing health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar for the coming year, hence the importance of clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.","Evans, Michelle V.; Garchitorena, Andres; Rakotonanahary, Rado J.

We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Methods: The performance of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was assessed at Roche Diagnostics (Penzberg, Germany). Sensitivity was evaluated using anonymised residual frozen samples from patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); one or more consecutive samples were collected from patients at various timepoints after PCR confirmation. Specificity was evaluated using anonymised unselected residual frozen samples from routine diagnostic testing or from blood donors; all samples were collected before December 2019 and thus deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cross-reactivity was evaluated using anonymised frozen samples containing a wide range of potentially cross-reacting analytes, which were purchased from commercial vendors. For sensitivity and specificity, point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 496 samples from 102 patients with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99.5% (95% CI 97.0-100.0) at [â¥]14 days after PCR confirmation.

We link LAD to a potential solution using blockchain technology and circular economy principle capabilities. Use cases are used to show how blockchain-enabled circular economy practices can support supply chain LAD efforts. Supply chain tracking, tracing, and responsiveness can be supported blockchain-enabled circular economy practices. One result of identifying these relationships include solutions and insights at multiple levels and stakeholders – individual, organizational, supply chain, governmental, and community.

The risks of this emergency in prisons is mainly related to the problem of persistent overcrowding that makes social distancing difficult and the isolation of any contagion hard to arrange. The Department of Protection for Adults and Minors of the ASL Salerno Criminal Area has taken steps in order to perform screening operations and minimize the risks for prisoners and operators. (2) Methods: We conducted a two-phase observational study. In the first phase, we offered and then executed serum COVID-19 screening to all the convicted inmates. For those who had a doubtful or positive result, a swab was executed in the shortest time possible. In the second phase, a pharyngeal swab was offered and executed to all the police officers, the penitentiary administrative staff and the medical personnel working in the prison. (3) Results: In the first phase, we executed 485 COVID-19 blood tests on prisoners, 3 (0.61%) of which were positive. The three positive inmates underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing, which ultimately were negative. After that, we executed 276 nasopharyngeal swabs on the prison personnel, penitentiary administrative staff and medical personnel—all were negative. (4) Conclusion: All tests (blood tests and swabs) that were carried out on the prisoners and on the staff were negative for COVID-19. We believe that all prisons in Italy and in the world should take action to ensure preventive and control measures in order to safeguard the health of the prison population and of all the people who work there.","Pagano, Antonio Maria; Maiese, Aniello; Izzo, Carmine; Maiese, Adamo; Ametrano, Marcello; De Matteis, Alessandra; Attianese, Maria Rosaria; Busato, Gaia; Caruso, Rosa; Cestari, Michele; Biasi, Sebastiana De; Chiara, Anna De; De Matteis, Giuseppe; Goffredi, Goffredo; La Russa, Raffaele",Int J Environ Res Public Health,373,20

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which initially appeared in China at the end of 2019, exhibits a high infectivity and pathogenicity compared to other coronaviruses. As the viral coat and other viral components are recognized as being foreign by the immune system, this can lead to initial symptoms, which are induced by the very efficiently working immune defense system via the respiratory epithelium. During severe courses a systemically expressed proinflammatory cytokine storm and subsequent changes in the coagulation and complement systems can occur. Virus-specific antibodies, the long-term expression of which is ensured by the formation of B memory cell clones, generate a specific immune response that is also detectable in blood (seroconversion). Specifically effective cytotoxic CD8+ T‑cell populations are also formed, which recognize viral epitopes as pathogen-specific patterns in combination with MHC presentation on the cell surface of virus-infected cells and destroy these cells. At the current point in time it is unclear how regular, robust and durable this immune status is constructed. Experiences with other coronavirus infections (SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS) indicate that the immunity could persist for several years. Based on animal experiments, already acquired data on other coronavirus types and plausibility assumptions, it can be assumed that seroconverted patients have an immunity of limited duration and only a very low risk of reinfection. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of viral cycles and immunity is an important prerequisite for the development of vaccination strategies and development of effective drugs.","Ueffing, Marius; Bayyoud, Tarek; Schindler, Michael; Ziemssen, Focke",Ophthalmologe,373,28

Neutralizing antibody titres were higher for the immunizing than the heterologous virus, although cross-neutralization usually was detected. This confirmed that CCV and TGEV are distinct, but antigenically related coronaviruses. In sera from 41 dogs, CCV-neutralizing titres were on average 2.7 fold higher than TGEV-neutralizing titres, suggesting that CCV was the causal agent. Sera from 29 cats in colonies with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and known to contain TGEV-neutralizing antibody, were found to have titres 12.3 fold higher against CCV. The FIP virus (FIPV) is probably more closely related to CCV than TGEV as judged by antigens involved in virus neutralization. Antisera to two isolates of bovine coronavirus, three isolates of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus and the 229E strain of human coronavirus all failed to neutralize CCV and TGEV. Thus CCV, TGEV and probably FIPV fall into a group of antigenically related agents, separable from other members of the family Coronaviridae, by both virus neutralization and immunofluorescence tests.","Reynolds, D.

Several factors may influence such willingness, of which ethical, psychological, and practical factors seem to be the most important and frequently discussed. Moreover, individual willingness and readiness of a community may also vary based on the acquired level of knowledge about the incident and its cause and available management options.

An in-depth assessment of the risk of infection that considers environmental setting and mitigation strategies is needed to make safe and informed decisions regarding reopening university spaces. A quantitative model of infection probability that accounts for space-specific parameters is presented to enable assessment of the risk in reopening university spaces at given densities. The model uses the fraction of the campus population that are viral shedders, room capacity, face covering filtration efficiency, air exchange rate, room volume, and time spent in the space as parameters to calculate infection probabilities in teaching spaces, dining halls, dorms, and shared bathrooms. The model readily calculates infection probabilities in various university spaces, with face covering filtration efficiency and air exchange rate being among the dominant variables. When applied to university spaces, this model demonstrated that, under specific conditions that are feasible to implement, in-person classes could be held in large lecture halls with an infection risk over the semester <1%. Meal pick-ups from dining halls and usage of shared bathrooms in residential dormitories among small groups of students could also be accomplished with low risk. The results of applying this model to spaces at Harvard University (Cambridge and Allston campuses) and Stanford University are reported. Finally, a user-friendly web application was developed using this model to calculate infection probability following input of space-specific variables. The successful development of a quantitative model and its implementation through a web application may facilitate accurate assessments of infection risk in university spaces. However, since this model is thus far unvalidated, validation using infection rate and contact tracing data from university campuses will be crucial as such data becomes available at larger scales. In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on universities, this tool could provide crucial insight to students, faculty, and university officials in making informed decisions.","Ambatipudi, Mythri; Carrillo Gonzalez, Paola; Tasnim, Kazi; Daigle, Jordan T; Kulyk, Taisa; Jeffreys, Nicholas; Sule, Nishant; Trevino, Rafael; He, Emily M; Mooney, David J; Koh, Esther",J Occup Environ Hyg,373,1

In the last decades, other constructs have been proposed for assessing load, but also relying on relationships between volume and intensity. For example, Foster's Training Monotony has been used in athletes' load management simply by computing mean weekly load divided by its standard deviation, often multiplied by session rate of perceived exertion. Meanwhile, the Acute to Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) has been debated by the sport scientists as a useful monitoring metric and related to so-called injury prevention. None of these models includes parameters that are representative of training specificity, namely load orientation. The aim of this study is to present broader conceptual approaches translated by new indices for assessing Intraweek Training Monotony (ITM) and Acute to Chronic Workload Index (ACWI) while incorporating load orientation, session duration and weekly density (frequency normalized) in addition to parameters related to proxies of external and/or internal load. Our ITM and Foster's Training Monotony were similar in terms of average values, but very different for individualized analysis, illustrating how average values may be deceiving. While Foster's model provided clusters of values, ITM provided more scattered, individualized data. ACWI and ACWR provided very distinct qualitative information, and the two models were uncorrelated. Therefore, the models incorporating training load orientation presented in this study provide distinct and not redundant information when compared to previous models. More importantly, ITM and ACWI are metrics that are compatible to each other and might fit to coaches' monitoring targets in the short and medium terms, respectively. Because our models include several parameters, including load orientation, we contend that might provide a more complete monitoring tool. However, we suggest they are used for intraindividual comparisons and not so strongly for interindividual comparisons.","Afonso, José; Nakamura, Fábio Yuzo; Canário-Lemos, Rui; Peixoto, Rafael; Fernandes, Cátia; Mota, Tomás; Ferreira, Miguel; Silva, Rafaela; Teixeira, Armando; Clemente, Filipe Manuel",Front Sports Act Living,373,3

Of particular importance is the identification of immune correlates of infection that would support public health decision-making on treatment approaches, vaccination strategies, and convalescent plasma therapy. While ELISA-based assays to detect and quantitate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples have been developed, the detection of neutralizing antibodies typically requires more demanding cell-based viral assays. Here, we present a safe and efficient protein-based assay for the detection of serum and plasma antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay serves as a surrogate neutralization assay and is performed on the same platform and in parallel with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies against the RBD, enabling a direct comparison. The results obtained with our assay correlate with those of two viral based assays, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) that uses live SARS-CoV-2 virus, and a spike pseudotyped viral-vector-based assay.","Abe, Kento T.; Li, Zhijie; Samson, Reuben; Samavarchi-Tehrani, Payman; Valcourt, Emelissa J.; Wood, Heidi; Budylowski, Patrick; Dupuis, Alan P.; Girardin, Roxie C.; Rathod, Bhavisha; Wang, Jenny H.; Barrios-Rodiles, Miriam; Colwill, Karen; McGeer, Allison J; Mubareka, Samira; Gommerman, Jennifer L.; Durocher, Yves; Ostrowski, Mario; McDonough, Kathleen A.; Drebot, Michael A.; Drews, Steven J.; Rini, James M.; Gingras, Anne-Claude",bioRxiv,373,16

Although CF is a multi-organ system disease, most people with CF die of progressive lung disease that begins early in childhood and is characterized by chronic bacterial infection and inflammation. Nearly 90% of people with CF have at least one copy of the ΔF508 mutation, but there are hundreds of CFTR mutations that result in a range of disease severities. A CFTR gene replacement approach would be efficacious regardless of the disease-causing mutation. After the discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989, the in vitro proof-of-concept for gene therapy for CF was quickly established in 1990. In 1993, the first of many gene therapy clinical trials attempted to rescue the CF defect in airway epithelia. Despite the initial enthusiasm, there is still no FDA-approved gene therapy for CF. Here we discuss the history of CF gene therapy, from the discovery of the CFTR gene to current state-of-the-art gene delivery vector designs.

Oral healthcare providers, such as dentists, are crucial to the screening and identifying of individuals experiencing IPV, since most injuries occur in the head and neck region. A lack of knowledge and awareness regarding teaching and learning about IPV in dental school curricula has been identified. Based upon the overall lack of knowledge, the objective of this study was to conduct a longitudinal assessment of knowledge, awareness, and beliefs regarding IPV among dental students in their first year of education. Methods: All students (n = 245) from three consecutive, first-year dental student cohorts (n = 81, n = 82, n = 82) were provided a brief and voluntary in-class survey in conjunction with an instructional workshop. The survey included questions designed to ascertain knowledge, awareness, and beliefs regarding IPV as a healthcare and dental issue before and after the instructional session. Differences in responses to the questions before and after the IPV educational workshop were measured using paired t-tests. Results: A total of n = 232 completed pre- and post-responses were received from all three first-year dental student cohorts (n = 76, n = 80, n = 76), representing an overall 94.6% response rate. Analysis of these data showed that the student population was predominantly male and white (non-minority), aged in their mid- to late twenties, with most students reporting no previous IPV education. The few students reporting previous IPV education were mainly younger (<25 years), which may represent more recent endeavors to increase awareness of IPV among students currently attending colleges and universities. Conclusions: The results of this study may suggest that information-specific seminars within the curriculum might be adequate to provide dental students with awareness and knowledge of IPV and specific information regarding local resources and referrals for any patients experiencing IPV.","Buchanan, Charles; Kingsley, Karl; Everett, Rhonda J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,373,1

This is part of a wider problem, relating to air quality in indoor environment, such as homes or offices, where people spend more than 90% of their time. In particular, if indoor exposure occurs quickly and without any gradual adaptation to a temperature 2°–3° lower than the external temperature and especially with a 5° difference (avoiding indoor temperature below 24°) and an humidity between 40 and 60%, there is a risk of negative consequences on the respiratory tract and the patient risks to be in a clinical condition characterized by an exacerbation of the respiratory symptoms of his chronic respiratory disease (asthma and COPD) within a few hours or days. Surprisingly, these effects of cold climate remain out of the focus of the media unless spells of unusually cold weather sweep through a local area or unstable weather conditions associated with extremely cold periods of increasing frequency and duration. Moreover, the energy consumed by air conditioning induces an increase of CO(2) in atmosphere with increase of global warming. There is a need to better define the consequences of repeated exposure to cold air and the mechanisms by which such exposure could modify airway function and affect the outcomes of patients with pre-existing airway disease. This could help to promote adequate policy and public health actions to face the incoming challenges induced by climate change and global warming.","D’Amato, Maria; Molino, Antonio; Calabrese, Giovanna; Cecchi, Lorenzo; Annesi-Maesano, Isabella; D’Amato, Gennaro",Clin Transl Allergy,373,1

Authorities had to communicate with the public regularly to explain and ensure compliance with these measures and promote safety. The information given by authorities was mainly developed for adults, but children and adolescents may have different needs when it comes to information. This study examined how adolescents perceived information about Covid-19 provided by the media and other sources, and about what topics adolescents reported they lacked information during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three hundred seventy-seven adolescents in 11th, 12th, and 13th grade in Norwegian upper secondary schools (67% girls) completed an online questionnaire. Analyses included descriptive statistics, in addition to Generalized Linear Mixed Models analyses to examine gender differences in adolescents’ satisfaction with the information provided about Covid-19, to what extent the pandemic affected their everyday life, and to what extent they were concerned about becoming infected with Covid-19. RESULTS: The results showed that the majority of adolescents used the internet as the main source of information about Covid-19, followed by (online) newspapers. About half (49%) reported that they were satisfied with the information available, while 39% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 12% were dissatisfied. Adolescents wanted more information about the school situation, as well as virus- and future-related topics. A total of 21% reported that they were concerned about becoming infected with Covid-19. There was no significant gender difference in overall satisfaction with the information provided about Covid-19. Girls reported being significantly more affected by the pandemic than boys, and that they were significantly more concerned than boys about becoming infected with Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: This survey provides important knowledge to professionals working with adolescents, as well as to authorities, about what information channels can be used to reach adolescents, and what information they lacked about the Covid-19 pandemic.","Kaiser, Sabine; Kyrrestad, Henriette; Martinussen, Monica",Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,373,1

Furthermore, the low divergence of near-identical genomes sequenced in short periods of time presents a statistical challenge not addressed by available methods. In this work we present Bolotie, an efficient method designed to detect recombination and reassortment events between clades of viral genomes. We applied our method to a large collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discovered hundreds of isolates that are likely of a recombinant origin.

The WHO declared on January 31 that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was a public health emergency. SARS-Cov-2 is a member of highly pathogenic coronavirus group that also consists of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although respiratory tract lesions were regarded as main manifestation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, gastrointestinal lesions were also reported. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were also observed. Common gastrointestinal symptoms of patients mainly included diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal lesions could be used as basis for early diagnosis of patients, and at the same time, controlling gastrointestinal lesions better facilitated to cut off the route of fecal-oral transmission.

Hope for recovery lies in high equitable vaccine uptake. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to: i) explore attitudes and factors influencing attitudes, towards the COVID-19 vaccine amongst people living in Malta, ii) identify the reasons as to why individuals are unsure or unwilling to take the vaccine. METHODS: Two consecutive, short, anonymous online surveys using social media platforms were used to gather data from adult individuals. The first study was open to residents in Malta, while the second study invited international participation. Study 1 consisted of 17 questions inspired by the Theories of Planned Behaviour and Reasoned Action. Study 2 asked participates whether they were willing, unwilling or unsure of taking the vaccine and their reasons for being unsure or unwilling. RESULTS: A total of 2,529 individuals participated in Study 1 and 834 in Study 2. In both studies respondents were predominantly female having a tertiary education. Over 50% declared that they were willing to take the vaccine, with males being more willing (t=5.83, df=1164.2, p<0.00005). Opinions of significant others- family and friends (r=0.22, p<0.005) and health professionals (r=0.74, p<0.005) were associated with willingness to take the vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy was present in the study population with 32.6% being unsure and 15.6% declaring that they were not willing to take the vaccine. Females were more likely to be unsure (Chi-squared=14.63, df=4, p=0.006). Lack of vaccine safety was the main reason cited for unwillingness to take the vaccine. Predictors for willingness to take the vaccine were: i) The belief that the COVID-19 vaccine will protect the health of the people who take it; ii) Valuing the advice of health professionals regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine; iii) Having taken the influenza vaccine last year and; iv) Encouraging their elderly parents to take the vaccine.

After identifying 1,553 records, the documents were filtered, and a full-text screening was performed. In total, 178 studies were retained and analyzed by 8 researchers specialized in dentistry, AI, and ethics. The team used Covidence for data extraction and Dedoose for the identification of ethics-related information. PRISMA guidelines were followed.

The technologies used were neural learning techniques for 75 (42.1%), traditional learning techniques for 76 (42.7%), or a combination of several technologies for 20 (11.2%). Overall, 7 countries contributed to 109 (61.2%) studies. A total of 53 different applications of AI in dentistry were identified, involving most dental specialties. The use of initial data sets for internal validation was reported in 152 (85.4%) studies. Forty-five ethical issues (related to the use AI in dentistry) were reported in 22 (12.4%) studies around 6 principles: prudence (10 times), equity (8), privacy (8), responsibility (6), democratic participation (4), and solidarity (4). The ratio of studies mentioning AI-related ethical issues has remained similar in the past years, showing that there is no increasing interest in the field of dentistry on this topic. This study confirms the growing presence of AI in dentistry and highlights a current lack of information on the ethical challenges surrounding its use. In addition, the scarcity of studies sharing their code could prevent future replications. The authors formulate recommendations to contribute to a more responsible use of AI technologies in dentistry.","Mörch, C M; Atsu, S; Cai, W; Li, X; Madathil, S A; Liu, X; Mai, V; Tamimi, F; Dilhac, M A; Ducret, M",Journal of dental research,373,29

Existing antivirals cannot cure HBV or eliminate risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) can inhibit HBV replication, but promote virion secretion and hepatocellular cancer cell invasion. For these reasons, the overall effect of GRP78 on HBV production and whether to utilize the HBV replication-inhibitory effect of GRP78 up-regulation or the hepatocellular cancer cell invasion-inhibitory effect of its down-regulation were further investigated in order to improve the efficacy of current antiviral therapy. METHODS: GRP78 regulations in HepG2.2.15 cells were conducted by transfections of expressing vector and small interfering RNA, respectively. The changes in HBV replication, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) synthesis and hepatoma cell motility were monitored. RESULTS: GRP78 overall decreased HBV production due to its HBV replication-inhibitory effect time-dependently overwhelming virion secretion-promoting effect in HepG2.2.15 cells. Unlike the parental cells (HepG2), HepG2.2.15 cells demonstrated decreased expressions of the major genes in the interferon-β1-dependent pathway. Moreover, the expressions of these genes were not affected by GRP78 regulations. However, GRP78 was found to inhibit HBeAg secretion and to increase the retro-transportation of capsid assembly-interfering HBeAg precursor from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol where new viral nucleocapsids formed. Furthermore, GRP78 overexpression promoted wound healing process (the motility) of HepG2.2.15 cells. In contrast, GRP78 knockdown enhanced HBV replication and HBeAg secretion, but they were abolished by entecavir and furin inhibitor, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GRP78 mainly demonstrates anti-HBV effects, reducing HBV production and HBeAg secretion. With due regard to the hepatocellular cancer invasion risk of the overexpression and the rectifiability of the unpleasant effects of the knockdown, GRP78 down-regulation may be more suitable to serve as an additive strategy to cover the hepatocellular cancer prevention shortage of current antiviral therapy in the future.","Zheng, Nai Q.; Zheng, Zi H.; Xu, Hai X.; Huang, Ming X.; Peng, Xiao M.",Virol J,373,24

The underlying reasons why a smaller percentage of patients present with severe pulmonary symptoms whereas the majority is only mildly affected are to date not well understood. Comparing the immunological phenotype in healthy donors and patients with mild versus severe COVID‐19 shows that in COVID‐19 patients, NK‐/B‐cell activation and proliferation are enhanced independent of severity. As an important precondition for effective antibody responses, T‐follicular helper cells and antibody secreting cells are increased both in patients with mild and severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Beyond this, T cells in COVID‐19 patients exhibit a stronger activation profile with differentiation toward effector cell phenotypes. Importantly, when looking at the rates of pulmonary complications in COVID‐19 patients, the chemokine receptor CCR4 is higher expressed by both CD4 and CD8 T cells of patients with severe COVID‐19. This raises the hypothesis that CCR4 upregulation on T cells in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 promotes stronger T‐cell attraction to the lungs leading to increased immune activation with presumably higher pulmonary toxicity. Our study contributes significantly to the understanding of the immunological changes during COVID‐19, as new therapeutic agents, preferentially targeting the immune system, are highly warranted.","Spoerl, Silvia; Kremer, Anita N.; Aigner, Michael; Eisenhauer, Nina; Koch, Pauline; Meretuk, Lina; Löffler, Patrick; Tenbusch, Matthias; Maier, Clara; Überla, Klaus; Heinzerling, Lucie; Frey, Benjamin; Lutzny‐Geier, Gloria; Winkler, Thomas H.; Krönke, Gerhard; Vetter, Marcel; Bruns, Heiko; Neurath, Markus F.; Mackensen, Andreas; Kremer, Andreas E.; Völkl, Simon",Eur J Immunol,373,16

Genomic studies can be helpful in understanding the disease dynamics. We have downloaded 324 complete and near complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted in GISAID database from Bangladesh which were isolated between 30 March to 7 September, 2020. We then compared these genomes with Wuhan reference sequence and found 4160 mutation events including 2253 missense single nucleotide variations, 38 deletions and 10 insertions. The C>T nucleotide change was most prevalent (41% of all mutations) possibly due to selective mutation pressure to reduce CpG sites to evade CpG targeted host immune response. The most frequent mutation that occurred in 98% isolates was 3037C>T which is a synonymous change that usually accompanied 3 other mutations that include 241C>T, 14408C>T (P323L in RdRp) and 23403A>G (D614G in spike protein). The P323L was reported to increase mutation rate and D614G is associated with increased viral replication and currently most prevalent variant circulating all over the world. We identified multiple missense mutations in B-cell and T-cell predicted epitope regions and/or PCR target regions (including R203K and G204R that occurred in 86% of the isolates) that may impact immunogenicity and/or RT-PCR based diagnosis. Our analysis revealed 5 large deletion events in ORF7a and ORF8 gene products that may be associated with less severity of the disease and increased viral clearance. Our phylogeny analysis identified most of the isolates belonged to the Nextstrain clade 20B (86%) and GISAID clade GR (88%). Most of our isolates shared common ancestors either directly with European countries or jointly with middle eastern countries as well as Australia and India. Interestingly, the 19B clade (GISAID S clade) was unique to Chittagong, which was originally prevalent in China. This reveals possible multiple introductions of the virus in Bangladesh via different routes. Hence, more genome sequencing and analysis with related clinical data is needed to interpret functional significance and better predict the disease dynamics that may be helpful for policy makers to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rahman, Md.

But pharmacists can play a leading role in addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy by using a critical mobile phone-based technology. This technology, known as caller tunes or ringback tones, is flourishing in low- and middle-income countries such as those in Africa and Asia where it is used to promote popular songs and religious messages. With this technology, callers to mobile phones hear a message or a song instead of the typical ringing sound. There is a need for pharmacists associations to collaborate with the creative arts industry and telecommunication companies to have caller tunes on COVID-19 vaccines. As pharmacists and others download COVID-19 vaccine caller tunes onto their mobile phones, their callers will hear COVID-19 vaccines messages or songs. This could help combat disinformation and hesitancy, and promote widespread vaccination as availability increases.","Appiah, Bernard; Asamoah-Akuoko, Lucy; France, Christopher; Rene, Antonio; Amanquah, Nathan; Bates, Imelda",Res Social Adm Pharm,373,1

Furthermore, there is a need to re-evaluate regulatory and market approval mechanisms to accommodate the unique nature of personalized medicines. Physical and financial accessibility ought to be remedied before personalized medicines can be equitably delivered to patients.

The main solution consists of reducing or eliminating lactose from one’s diet, and so dairy products, particularly cheeses, are often the first foods excluded. The purpose of this study is to contribute to this topic by creating an updated list of naturally lactose-free (NLF) cheeses. Twenty-five PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) cheeses were selected and analyzed to determine their lactose content. At the same time, interviews with the PDO quality control consortia were carried out to understand which parameters are involved in lactose reduction, based on the cheeses’ product specifications. The analytical techniques used here for lactose determination are the most sensitive (HPAEC-PAD and LC/MS-MS), given their low limit of quantification (LOQ) of less than 10 mg/kg. The majority of selected PDO cheeses resulted in a lactose content less than the LOQ. Because of the high variability allowed in PDO cheeses’ operative conditions, it would be better to case-by-case examine the PDO cheese specification and declare the product as NLF after repeated analysis. The results of the chemical determination of this research allowed to draw up a very useful list of PDO cheeses for both consumers and nutritionists that could be identified as NLF.","Facioni, Maria Sole; Dominici, Simona; Marescotti, Francesca; Covucci, Rosanna; Taglieri, Isabella; Venturi, Francesca; Zinnai, Angela",Foods,373,22

METHODS: Information on COVID‐19 clusters (n >2) and morbidity and mortality of COVID‐19 was collected. RESULTS: A total of 381 clusters with 3,786 infected cases were collected, accounting for 23.9% of 15,852 cumulated cases on May 9, 2020. Although the cluster number (/10(7) subjects) in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly smaller compared to those in the other two groups, the cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly larger than that in non‐medical/welfare facilities. Cluster numbers in general medical/welfare facilities and in non‐medical/welfare facilities were significantly positively correlated with morbidity (/10(5)), indicating relatively early identification of clusters in these facilities. Unlike in these facilities, cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly positively correlated with morbidity, indicating that clusters in LCT hospitals/facilities were finally identified after already having grown to a large size in areas where infection was prevalent. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that both cluster number and cluster size only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently associated with higher mortality (> median: 0.64/10(5) subjects) after adjustment.

Growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 is a systemic illness that primarily injures the vascular endothelium, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. SARS-CoV-2 infection is believed to trigger a cytokine storm that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endothelialitis and vascular injury, eventually leading to respiratory and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients. We used a multiplex immunoassay to systematically profile and compare 65 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in plasma samples from 24 hospitalized (severe/critical) COVID-19 patients, 14 mild/moderate cases, and 13 healthy controls (HCs). Patients with severe/critical and mild/moderate COVID-19 had significantly higher plasma levels of 20 analytes than HCs. Surprisingly, only one cytokine (MIF) was among these altered analytes, while the rest were chemokines and growth factors. In addition, only MMP-1 and VEGF-A were significantly elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to mild/moderate cases. Given that excessive MMP-1 plays a central role in tissue destruction in a wide variety of vascular diseases and that elevated VEGF-A, an EC activation marker, increases vascular permeability, we further studied MMP-1 enzymatic activity and other EC activation markers such as soluble forms of CD146, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. We found that plasma MMP-1 enzymatic activity and plasma levels of MMP-1 and EC activation markers were highly dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. Some dysregulations were associated with patient age or gender, but not with race. Our results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients have distinct inflammatory profiles that are distinguished from the cytokine storms in other human diseases. Excessive MMP-1 and hyperactivation of ECs occur in COVID-19 patients and are associated with the severity of COVID-19.","Syed, F.; Li, W.; Relich, R. F.; Russell, P. M.; Zhang, S.; Zimmerman, M.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN). Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of Remdesivir. We found that Remdesivir’s 1’-cyano group of possesses the dual role of inhibiting nucleotide addition and proofreading. The presence of its polar 1’-cyano group at an upstream site in RdRp causes instability and hampers RdRp translocation. This leads to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension, which may also subsequently reduce the likelihood for Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on the 3’-terminal nucleotide. In addition, our simulations suggest that Remdesivir’s 1’-cyano group can also disrupt the cleavage active site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduced cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible molecular mechanisms on how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication and may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Dong; Wang, Xiaowei; Yuan, Congmin; Li, Yongfang; Jia, Xilin; Gao, Xin; Yen, Hui-Ling; Cheung, Peter Pak-Hang; Huang, Xuhui",bioRxiv,373,16

High liver serum enzymes can be found in covid-19 patients, and many factors cause this stop. Patients with high levels of liver enzymes that require invasive mechanical ventilation during their follow-up were examined, and it was aimed to determine whether it was among the predictive indicators of mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients infected with covid 19 who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit between March 30 and December 1, 2020 according to the criteria of hospitalization in the intensive care unit, clinical trials such as age, gender, length of stay, additional diseases, liver enzyme levels and whether invasive mechanical ventilation is required their characteristics were recorded and analyzed retrospectively and compared. RESULTS: Data were collected from 111 patients whose liver enzyme levels were measured from 131 patients included in the study. It was found that aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were statistically higher in the invasive mechanical ventilation group compared to the patients who did not undergo invasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were statistically higher in COVID19-infected patients who were treated in intensive care and undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. These enzymes are easily accessible and are shown among predictive values in mortality.","ince, u.; duran, h. t.",,373,12

OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection across Virginia and the risk factors associated with infection after the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this statewide cross-sectional surveillance study, 4675 adult outpatients presenting for health care not associated with COVID-19 in Virginia between June 1 and August 14, 2020, were recruited to participate in a questionnaire and receive venipuncture to assess SARS-CoV-2 serology. Eligibility was stratified to meet age, race, and ethnicity quotas that matched regional demographic profiles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as measured by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G assay. RESULTS: Among 4675 adult outpatients (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.9] years; 3119 women [66.7%]; 3098 White [66.3%] and 4279 non-Hispanic [91.5%] individuals) presenting for non–COVID-19–associated health care across Virginia, the weighted seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8%-3.1%) and ranged from 0% to 20% by zip code. Seroprevalence was notably higher among participants who were Hispanic (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.1%-14.3%), residing in the northern region (4.4%; 95% CI, 2.8%-6.1%), aged 40 to 49 years (4.4%; 95% CI, 1.8%-7.1%), and uninsured (5.9%; 95% CI, 1.5%-10.3%). Higher seroprevalence was associated with Hispanic ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.56; 95% CI, 1.76-7.21), residence in a multifamily unit (aOR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.25-5.22), and contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection (aOR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.77-10.58). The sensitivity of serology results was 94% (95% CI, 70%-100%) among those who reported receiving a previous polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 infection. Among 101 participants with seropositive results, 67 individuals (66.3%) were estimated to have asymptomatic infection. These data suggested a total estimated COVID-19 burden that was 2.8-fold higher than that ascertained by PCR-positive case counts. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This large statewide serologic study estimated that 2.4% of adults in Virginia had exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which was 2.8-fold higher than confirmed case counts. Hispanic ethnicity, residence in a multifamily unit, and contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors associated with exposure.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: As part of an RCT, CP was collected per FDA guidelines from individuals recovered from COVID‐19 infection. CP donors had to have ≥145 optical density (OD) units (ideal target ≥300) using a semiquantitative, immunochromatographic test for IgG antibody to the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS‐CoV‐2 (typical range 0–500 OD units). A random subset of samples [14 control plasma, 12 CP “medium‐anti‐NP” (145–299 OD units), and 13 CP “high” anti‐NP (≥300 OD units)] were tested for neutralizing antibodies using an established viral luciferase antibody inhibition assay to detect the infection of SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus that encoded spike protein (SARS2‐S(trunc)) on a human immunodeficiency virus 1 vector (NL43dEnvNanoLuc), using ACE2‐expressing 293 T cells. The titer needed to neutralize 50% of viral activity (NT50) was calculated. RESULTS: The uptake of SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus by 293T(ACE2) cells was inhibited by pretreatment with CP compared to control CP (p < .001) with control plasma having a median (IQR) 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of 1:28 (1:16,1:36) compared to 1:334 (1:130,1:1295) and 1:324 (1:244,1:578), for medium anti‐NP and high anti‐NP CP units, respectively. The neutralizing activity of CP met minimum FDA criteria with neutralizing antibody titers >1:80 in 100% of randomly selected samples, using a conservative approach that excluded non‐specific binding.

METHODS: Sixty patients with COVID-19 were included in this prospective study. Patients were examined by radiology and anesthesia clinic specialists for a visual CT score. A LUS 12-zone ultrasonography protocol was applied by the investigator blinded to the CT and PCR test results. The characteristics of abnormal findings and the relationship of lesions to the pleura and the distance to the pleura were investigated. RESULTS: Forty-five males and 25 females evaluated within the scope of the study had an average age of 61.2 ± 15.3 years. The total CT score was calculated as 14.3 ± 5.3, and the LUS score was found to be 19.9 ± 7.6. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the measured LUS and CT scores (r = 0.857, p < 0.001). The mean distance of these lesions to the pleura was 5.2 ± 1.76 cm. LUS findings in 51 areas corresponded to non-pleural lesions on CT. There was a negative correlation between the measured distance to the pleura and the LUS scores (p < 0.001, r = − 0.708).

PRESENTATION OF A CASE: A case of challenging diagnosis of human Taenia Saginata infection is here presented: during COVID-19 pandemic we performed a mininvasive robotic subtotal gastrectomy for gastric angulus adenocarcinoma. 10 hours after the end of the operation the patient presented an episode of vomiting with expulsion of a 5-meter-long adult form of Taenia Saginata. DISCUSSION: Parasitic infections are more frequent in the developing countries; in our case the transposition of small intestinal loop surely promoted the migration of Taenia Saginata throught the gastro-jejunal anastomosis into the gastric stump.

However, uncertainty or unwillingness to receive the vaccine could be a barrier in attaining sufficient vaccine coverage. Therefore, understanding the psychology of the population towards the vaccines against COVID-19 is of paramount importance. Our study was aimed at determining the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine intention in the Saudi Arabian population. A structured questionnaire guided by the ‘Report of the SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy’ was administered during a span of two months among the general population from all administrative regions of Saudi Arabia, proceeding the launch of the vaccination campaign. In total, 879 out of 1600 subjects responded and completed the survey (response rate 54.9%). About 56 percent of the participants intended to be vaccinated. The predictors of a higher intention to vaccinate included those 50 years of age or older, male subjects, people suffering from systemic disease/s, subjects who were not previously infected with COVID-19, those who follow the updates about COVID-19 vaccines, and adults with a higher level of anxiety about contracting coronavirus (p < 0.05).

This audit was performed over 6 days in a tertiary care hospital in Calcutta, India, with 42 surgical internees. Compliance to ideal hand washing technique was recorded after each attempt with the first attempt as baseline. Video demonstration, personal demonstration by a consultant, and individual instruction were used as subsequent interventions to achieve 100% compliance. The baseline level of compliance was found to be 33.59%. A total of 6 attempts was required to achieve 100% compliance, with the increase in compliance being statistically significant (p = 0.0294). Personal instruction was found to be the most effective intervention. Hand washing technique was the criterion that needed the most number of attempts (n = 6) to rectify. This study found video-based instruction and individual guidance effective teaching tools for surgical hand disinfection and gave novel data regarding the reasons responsible for poor compliance to proper hand washing in a general surgical setting.

The decision to administer antibiotics early in the course of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection depends on the likelihood of bacterial coinfection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted through the emergency department with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection over a 6‐week period in a large healthcare system in the United States. Blood and respiratory culture results were abstracted and adjudicated by multiple authors. The primary outcome was the rate of bacteremia. We secondarily looked to define clinical or laboratory features associated with bacteremia. RESULTS: There were 542 patients admitted with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, with an average age of 62.8 years. Of these, 395 had blood cultures performed upon admission, with six true positive results (1.1% of the total population). An additional 14 patients had positive respiratory cultures treated as true pathogens in the first 72 h. Low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate were statistically significantly associated with bacteremia. Clinical outcomes were not statistically significantly different between patients with and without bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low rate of bacteremia in patients admitted with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In hemodynamically stable patients, routine antibiotics may not be warranted in this population.","Lardaro, Thomas; Wang, Alfred Z.; Bucca, Antonino; Croft, Alexander; Glober, Nancy; Holt, Daniel B.; Musey, Paul I.; Peterson, Kelli D.; Trigonis, Russell A.; Schaffer, Jason T.; Hunter, Benton R.",J Med Virol,373,5

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, potential targets, and active ingredients of this prescription are still unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the molecular mechanism of YZG. METHODS: The active compounds in YZG were screened by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The putative targets of YZG were collected via TCMSP and Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals (STITCH) databases. The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) databases were used to identify the therapeutic targets of ODUB. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network containing both the putative targets of YZG and known therapeutic targets of ODUB was built. Furthermore, bioinformatics resources from the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) were utilized for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Finally, molecular docking was performed to verify the binding effect between the YZG screened compounds and potential therapeutic target molecules. RESULTS: The study employed a network pharmacology method, mainly containing target prediction, network construction, functional enrichment analysis, and molecular docking to systematically research the mechanisms of YZG in treating ODUB. The putative targets of YZG that treat ODUB mainly involved PTGS1, PTGS2, ALOX5, CASP3, LTA4H, F7 and F10. The functional enrichment analysis suggested that the produced therapeutic effect of YZG against ODUB is mediated by synergistical regulation of several biological pathways, including apoptosis arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, serotonergic synapse, complement and coagulation cascades and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Molecular docking simulation revealed good binding affinity of the seven putative targets with the corresponding compounds. CONCLUSION: This novel and scientific network pharmacology-based study holistically elucidated the basic pharmacological effects and the underlying mechanisms of YZG in the treatment of ODUB.","Li, Jialin; Luo, Hua; Liu, Xinkui; Zhang, Jingyuan; Zhou, Wei; Guo, Siyu; Chen, Xiuping; Liu, Yingying; Jia, Shanshan; Wang, Haojia; Li, Bingbing; Cheng, Guoliang; Wu, Jiarui",Chin Med,373,1

Minor errors in the use of personal protective equipment were identified as sources of contamination of Health Care Workers' to SARS CoV. Our hospital's policy mandated that all staff, be certified in IC practices through a competency based educational program. A multi-disciplinary educational module, derived from a SARS specific model used to educate the SARS designated care team; was developed. Essential components included basic IC principles, specimen collection, use of protective clothing, high risk procedures, modified protocols for ventilator management and oxygen/aerosol therapy, transportation and care of equipment and the environment. Competency checklists for each module were developed. Education was customized, depending on the potential risk of exposure.

The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the impact of disasters, including pandemics, on cardiometabolic outcomes across the life-course. DESIGN: A systematic search was conducted in May 2020 using two electronic databases, EMBASE and Medline. All studies were screened in duplicate at title and abstract, and full-text level. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the association between a population-level or community disaster and cardiometabolic outcomes ≥1 month following the disaster. There were no restrictions on age, year of publication, country or population. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure (eg, type of disaster, region, year), cardiometabolic outcomes and measures of effect. Study quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies were included, with 24 studies reporting the effects of exposure to disaster during pregnancy/childhood and 34 studies reporting the effects of exposure during adulthood. Studies included exposure to natural (n=35; 60%) and human-made (n=23; 40%) disasters, with only three (5%) of these studies evaluating previous pandemics. Most studies reported increased cardiometabolic risk, including increased cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality, diabetes and obesity, but not all. Few studies evaluated the biological mechanisms or high-risk subgroups that may be at a greater risk of negative health outcomes following disasters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that the burden of disasters extend beyond the known direct harm, and attention is needed on the detrimental indirect long-term effects on cardiometabolic health. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, these findings may inform public health prevention strategies to mitigate the impact of future cardiometabolic risk.

We inhibited IL17/IL17RA signaling using pharmacological and genetic strategies alongside mass cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence techniques. We uncovered that IL17 recruits neutrophils, triggers neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and excludes cytotoxic CD8 T cells from tumors. Additionally, IL17 blockade increases immune checkpoint blockade (PD-1, CTLA4) sensitivity. Inhibition of neutrophils or Padi4-dependent NETosis phenocopies IL17 neutralization. NMR spectroscopy revealed changes in tumor lactate as a potential early biomarker for IL17/PD-1 combination efficacy. Higher expression of IL17 and PADI4 in human PDAC corresponds with poorer prognosis, and the serum of patients with PDAC has higher potential for NETosis.

We analyzed datasets from 2015 until 2020 extracted from the hospital information system database and our documented outpatient files regarding patient numbers, gender, age, and diagnoses. In 2020, case numbers of outpatient care declined significantly (p = 0.021) compared to previous years and was related to the timing of political announcements answering SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Additionally, during calendar week 10 to 15—the peak time of the spread of COVID-19 in Germany—the proportion of patients missing their consultation was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (22.4% vs. 12.4%; p < 0.001).

However, limited prospective research prevents any directional conclusions. No known studies have assessed emotion regulation with PTSS in American Indians, a high-risk population for poor mental health outcomes. The present prospective study explored whether emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression) predicted later PTSS related to the COVID-19 global pandemic in a solely American Indian sample. METHODS: American Indian participants (N = 210; Mean (SD) age = 54.85(13.08) years, 58.7% female) completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) during Phase 1 (a few weeks before pandemic declaration) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic during Phase 2 (7–8 weeks after pandemic declaration). Bivariate correlations and hierarchical linear regression analyses were utilized. RESULTS: ERQ reappraisal was negatively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher reappraisal predicted lower PTSS. In contrast, ERQ suppression was positively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher suppression predicted higher PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: Greater suppression and lower reappraisal predicts PTSS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an entirely American Indian sample, providing critical information for future interventions in a population at high-risk for mental health disparities.","Tyra, Alexandra T.; Ginty, Annie T.; John-Henderson, Neha A.",Int J Behav Med,373,16

In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture or moxibustion is used to directly stimulate select acupoints on the surface of the human body and produce physical stimulation to further stimulate regulatory functions in the body, strengthening bodily resistance, eliminating disease, and adjusting the viscera. However, this Chinese medicine knowledge does not include the specific mechanisms of action or targets of acupoints. Therefore, an in-depth research is needed. METHODS: An acupoint-element database was constructed, and the target elements of the Feishu point were screened. The UniProt-Swiss-Prot sublibrary was used to obtain correct gene name information. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and GEO2R were used to analyze differentially expressed genes in pneumonia. The STRING database was used to analyze interactions, construct a network of the Feishu point efficacy system in pneumonia, and elucidate the mechanisms of action. RESULTS: The Feishu point comprises 34 elements in total. The protein interaction analysis has 38 nodes and 115 edges. The Feishu point efficacy system-pneumonia system network shows that cytokine signaling in the immune system, signaling by interleukins (ILs), IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, and the immune system may be related to immunity and inflammation. The Feishu point efficacy system regulating pneumonia showed that FCER2, IL4R, FASLG, TGFB1, IL6R, STAT6, IL1B, CASP3, IL5RA, IL2RB, MYD88, SQSTM1, IL12RB1, IFNGR1, ADAM17, and CDH1 are the main targets. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of systematic acupuncture and moxibustion, the Feishu point regulates cytokine signaling in the immune system, signaling by ILs, IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, and the immune system by targeting FCER2, IL4R, FASLG, TGFB1, IL6R, STAT6, IL1B, CASP3, IL5RA, IL2RB, MYD88, SQSTM1, IL12RB1, IFNGR1, ADAM17, and CDH1, thereby regulating pneumonia.","Xu, Yan; Cai, Jiali; Li, Weibin; Miao, Jingkun; Mei, Yan; Wang, Xinna; Xu, Hanying; Chen, Qixiong; Liu, Fang; Cui, Hongtao",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,373,29

By the end of March 2021, more than 136 million patients have been infected. Since the second and third waves of the COVID-19 outbreak are in full swing, investigating effective and timely solutions for patients’ check-ups and treatment is important. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test is recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the test results are prone to be false negative in the early course of COVID-19 infection. To enhance the screening efficiency and accessibility, chest images captured via X-ray or computed tomography (CT) provide valuable information when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. With advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, AI-driven models training with lung scans emerge as quick diagnostic and screening tools for detecting COVID-19 infection in patients. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art AI-empowered methods for computational examination of COVID-19 patients with lung scans.

The complement system is an important component of the innate immune system that is involved in the opsonization of viruses but also in triggering further immune cell responses. Complement activation was seen in plasma adsorber material that clogged during the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Apart from the lung, the kidney is the second most common organ affected by COVID-19. Using immunohistochemistry for complement factors C1q, MASP-2, C3c, C3d, C4d, and C5b-9 we investigated the involvement of the complement system in six kidney biopsies with acute kidney failure in different clinical settings and three kidneys from autopsy material of patients with COVID-19. Renal tissue was analyzed for signs of renal injury by detection of thrombus formation using CD61, endothelial cell rarefaction using the marker E-26 transformation specific-related gene (ERG-) and proliferation using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-staining. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Biopsies from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS, n = 5), severe acute tubular injury (ATI, n = 7), zero biopsies with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, n = 7) and 1 year protocol biopsies from renal transplants (Ctrl, n = 7) served as controls. In the material clogging plasma adsorbers used for extracorporeal therapy of patients with COVID-19 C3 was the dominant protein but collectin 11 and MASP-2 were also identified. SARS-CoV-2 was sporadically present in varying numbers in some biopsies from patients with COVID-19. The highest frequency of CD61-positive platelets was found in peritubular capillaries and arteries of COVID-19 infected renal specimens as compared to all controls. Apart from COVID-19 specimens, MASP-2 was detected in glomeruli with DIC and ATI. In contrast, the classical pathway (i.e. C1q) was hardly seen in COVID-19 biopsies. Both C3 cleavage products C3c and C3d were strongly detected in renal arteries but also occurs in glomerular capillaries of COVID-19 biopsies, while tubular C3d was stronger than C3c in biopsies from COVID-19 patients. The membrane attack complex C5b-9, demonstrating terminal pathway activation, was predominantly deposited in COVID-19 biopsies in peritubular capillaries, renal arterioles, and tubular basement membrane with similar or even higher frequency compared to controls. In conclusion, various complement pathways were activated in COVID-19 kidneys, the lectin pathway mainly in peritubular capillaries and in part the classical pathway in renal arteries whereas the alternative pathway seem to be crucial for tubular complement activation. Therefore, activation of the complement system might be involved in the worsening of renal injury. Complement inhibition might thus be a promising treatment option to prevent deregulated activation and subsequent collateral tissue injury.","Pfister, Frederick; Vonbrunn, Eva; Ries, Tajana; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Überla, Klaus; Lochnit, Günter; Sheriff, Ahmed; Herrmann, Martin; Büttner-Herold, Maike; Amann, Kerstin; Daniel, Christoph",Front Immunol,373,24

Diagnostic tools require rapid and accurate methods, of which a capture ELISA method may be useful. Toward this goal, we have prepared and characterized soluble full‐length nucleocapsid proteins (N protein) from SARS and 229E human coronaviruses. N proteins form oligomers, mostly as dimers at low concentration. These two N proteins degrade rapidly upon storage and the major degraded N protein is the C‐terminal fragment of amino acid (aa) 169–422. Taken together with other data, we suggest that N protein is a two‐domain protein, with the N‐terminal aa 50–150 as the RNA‐binding domain and the C‐terminal aa 169–422 as the dimerization domain. Polyclonal antibodies against the SARS N protein have been produced and the strong binding sites of the anti‐nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibodies produced were mapped to aa 1–20, aa 150–170 and aa 390–410. These sites are generally consistent with those mapped by sera obtained from SARS patients. The SARS anti‐NP antibody was able to clearly detect SARS virus grown in Vero E6 cells and did not cross‐react with the NP from the human coronavirus 229E. We have predicted several antigenic sites (15–20 amino acids) of S, M and N proteins and produced antibodies against those peptides, some of which could be recognized by sera obtained from SARS patients. Antibodies against the NP peptides could detect the cognate N protein clearly. Further refinement of these antibodies, particularly large‐scale production of monoclonal antibodies, could lead to the development of useful diagnostic kits for diseases associated with SARS and other human coronaviruses.","Tang, Tswen‐Kei; Wu, Mark P.‐J.; Chen, Shui‐Tsung; Hou, Ming‐Hon; Hong, Ming‐Hsiang; Pan, Fu‐Ming; Yu, Hui‐Ming; Chen, Jenn‐Han; Yao, Chen‐Wen; Wang, Andrew H.‐J.",Proteomics,373,1

In the U.S., residential recovery homes for persons with alcohol and drug disorders are good examples of high-risk environments where virus mitigation procedures are essential. The National Alliance for Recovery Residences (NARR) has taken recommendations developed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and applied them to recovery home settings. This paper describes how COVID-19 mitigation efforts in recovery homes may be influenced by two factors. First, while some houses are licensed by states with rigorous health and safety standards, others are not licensed and are subject to less oversight. These homes may be more inconsistent in adhering to mitigation standards. Second, to varying degrees, recovery homes use a social model approach to recovery that contrasts with mitigation procedures such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders. This paper provides examples of ways recovery homes have been forced to adjust to the competing demands of mitigation efforts and social model recovery. The paper also identifies multiple questions that could be addressed by provider-researcher coalitions to inform how social model recovery can navigate forward during the era of COVID-19. As we move forward during the era of COVID-19, providers are encouraged to remember that recovery homes have a history of resilience facing adversity and in fact have their origins in grassroots responses to the challenges of their times.","Polcin, Douglas L.; Mahoney, Elizabeth; Wittman, Friedner; Sheridan, Dave; Mericle, Amy A.",Int J Drug Policy,373,1

The analyses of 30 kb RNA SARS-CoVs genome sequences, protein structures, and functions have provided us a perspective of how host-virus protein-protein complexes act to mediate virus infection. The open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b translation yields 16 non-structural (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (p6, p7a, p8ab, p9b) with multiple functional domains. Viral proteins recruit over 300 host partners forming hetero-oligomeric complexes enabling the viral RNA synthesis, packing, and virion release. Many cellular host factors and the innate immune cells through pattern-recognition receptors and intracellular RNA sensor molecules act to inhibit virus entry and intracellular replication. However, non-structural ORF proteins hijack them and suppress interferon synthesis and its antiviral effects. Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines storm leads to dysfunctional inflammation, lung injury, and several clinical symptoms in patients. During the global pandemic, COVID-19 patients were identified with non-synonymous substitution of G614D in the spike protein, indicating virus co-evolution in host cells. We review findings that suggest that host RNA editing and DNA repair systems, while carrying on recombination, mutation, and repair of viral RNA intermediates, may facilitate virus evolution. Understanding how the host cell RNA replication process may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome fitness will help the testing of vaccines effectiveness to multiple independent mutated coronavirus strains that will emerge.","Belizário, J.E.",Braz J Med Biol Res,373,26

The resulting imbalance between inflammatory and resolving transcriptional programs can cause an overabundance of pro-inflammatory, classically activated macrophage type 1 (M1) and/or helper T cell type 1 (Th1) products, such as IFNγ, TNFα, IL1-β, and IL12, that prevent immune switching to resolution and healing. The low molecular weight fraction of human serum albumin (LMWF5A) is a novel biologic drug that is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of osteoarthritis and the hyper-inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. This study aims to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms of action involved with the ability of LMWF5A to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine release. METHODS: ELISA arrays were used to identify cytokines and chemokines influenced by LMWF5A treatment of LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The resulting profiles were analyzed by gene enrichment to gain mechanistic insight into the biologic processes and transcription factors (TFs) underlying the identified differentially expressed cytokines. DNA-binding ELISAs, luciferase reporter assays, and TNFα or IL-1β relative potency were then employed to confirm the involvement of enriched pathways and TFs. RESULTS: LMWF5A was found to significantly inhibit a distinct set of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-12, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) associated with pro-inflammatory M1/Th1 immune profiles. Gene enrichment analysis also suggests these cytokines are, in part, regulated by NF-κB and STAT transcription factors. Data from DNA-binding and reporter assays support this with LMWF5A inhibition of STAT1α DNA-binding activity as well as a reduction in overall NF-κB-driven luciferase expression. Experiments using antagonists specific for the immunomodulatory and NF-κB/STAT-repressing transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), indicate these pathways are involved in the LMWF5A mechanisms of action by reducing LMWF5A drug potency as measured by TNFα and IL-1β release. CONCLUSION: In this report, we provide evidence that LMWF5A reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine release by activating the immunoregulatory transcription factors PPARγ and AhR. In addition, our data indicate that LMWF5A suppresses NF-κB and STAT1α pro-inflammatory pathways. This suggests that LMWF5A acts through these mechanisms to decrease pro-inflammatory transcription factor activity and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production.","Thomas, Gregory; Frederick, Elizabeth; Thompson, Lisa; Bar-Or, Raphael; Mulugeta, Yetti; Hausburg, Melissa; Roshon, Michael; Mains, Charles; Bar-Or, David",J Transl Med,373,24

METHODS: A cohort of 2345 young Swiss men (from 21 out of 26 Swiss cantons; mean age = 29) completed survey-based assessments shortly before (April 2019 to February 2020) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (May to June 2020). Outcomes measured were psychological outcomes before and during the COVID-19 crisis (depression, perceived stress and sleep quality), and the fear, isolation and psychological trauma induced by it. We investigated associations between these outcomes and their predictors: pre-crisis socioeconomic status (relative financial status, difficulty paying bills, level of education), changes in work situation during the crisis (job loss, partial unemployment, working from home, change in workload) and working in contact with potentially infected people, both inside and outside the healthcare sector. For outcomes measured before and during the crisis, the analyses were adjusted for their pre-crisis levels. RESULTS: About 21% of participants changed their employment status (job loss, partial unemployment or lost money if self-employed) and more than 40% worked predominantly from home during the COVID-19 crisis. Participants with a lower relative socioeconomic status already before the crisis experienced a higher psychological impact due to the COVID-19 crisis, compared to participants with an average socioeconomic status (major depression (b = 0.12 [0.03, 0.22]), perceived stress (b = 0.15 [0.05, 0.25]), psychological trauma (b = 0.15 [0.04, 0.26]), fear (b = 0.20 [0.10, 0.30]) and isolation (b = 0.19 [0.08, 0.29])). A higher impact was also felt by participants who lost their job due to the COVID-19 crisis, the partially unemployed, those with an increased workload or those who worked mainly from home (e.g. depression b = 0.25 [0.16, 0.34] for those working 90%+ at home, compared to those not working at home). CONCLUSIONS: Even in a country like Switzerland, with relatively high social security benefits and universal healthcare, the COVID-19 crisis had a considerable psychological impact, especially among those with a lower socioeconomic status and those who experienced deteriorations in their work situation due to the COVID-19 crisis. Supporting these populations during the crisis may help to prevent an amplification of inequalities in mental health and social status. Such support could help to lower the overall impact of the crisis on the mental well-being of Switzerland’s population.","Marmet, Simon; Wicki, Matthias; Gmel, Gerhard; Gachoud, Céline; Daeppen, Jean-Bernard; Bertholet, Nicolas; Studer, Joseph",PLoS One,373,24

Here we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, expressed at high levels in yeast (Pichia pastoris), as a suitable vaccine candidate against COVID-19. After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel® were conducted in mice, and, after two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG antibodies. Using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we further showed that sera obtained after a two-dose immunization schedule of the vaccines were sufficient to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers in the 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 range, for both antigens tested. The vaccines induced IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion, among other cytokines.

Antiviral activity towards influenza virus, measles virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and cytomegalovirus was demonstrated for the 6000 Da polyelectrolyte polyallylamine. A nontoxic polyallylamine concentration of 30 µM at which the compound retains its antiviral effect towards measles and influenza viruses but lacks any toxic effect on human cells was previously determined. It is well known, at the same time, that simultaneous virus exposure to physical environmental factors and chemical substances causes a more significant decrease in virus infectivity. Temperature is among these physical factors since thermal exposure causes virus inactivation. Analysis of virus thermal inactivation parameters is of high practical importance when it comes to the development of vaccines against influenza virus and to the study of how virus particles infectivity decreases on various surfaces. In this view, the study of kinetic and thermodynamical characteristics of influenza virus thermal inactivation in the presence of the antiviral preparation polyallylanime is of particular interest. The paper reports that thermal inactivation of influenza virus in the temperature range of 38–60°C in the presence of polyallylamine follows the first-order reaction kinetics. Thermodynamic parameters of influenza virus thermal inactivation evidence that influenza virus surface proteins are involved in the inactivation process as a result of their interaction with polyallylamine. The obtained results show that polyallylamine may be used to accelerate thermal inactivation of the influenza virus.","Kontarov, N. A.; Dolgova, E. I.; Pogarskaya, I. V.; Kontarova, E.

Environmental risk factors, including community level pollution burden and exposure to smoking and secondhand smoke, have not been evaluated in relation to risk for infection with COVID-19. Methods: We evaluated self-reported infection rates of COVID-19 in three, preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx family cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area from May through September 2020 (N=383 households, 1,875 people). All households were enrolled during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff before the pandemic. For the COVID-19 sub-study, participants responded to a 15-minute telephonic interview where we assessed food consumption patterns, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection based on community and hospital-based testing. We also evaluated secondhand smoke exposure based on previously collected data. Environmental pollution exposure was determined from census tract residence using California EnviroScreen 2.0 data. Non-parametric tests were used to assess possible associations and multiple logistic regression analyses to determine independent predictors of COVID-19 infection. Results: In the combined Latinx, Eating and Diabetes Cohort (LEAD) and Hispanic, Eating and Nutrition (HEN) cohorts there was a 7.6% household infection rate (14/183) with a lower rate of 3.5% (7/200) in the Telomeres at Birth (TAB) cohort. Larger household size increased risk for infection (OR, 1.43 (95%CI 1.10-1.87)) in the combined LEAD/HEN cohorts and increasing number of children trended towards significance in the TAB cohort (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.98-3.37). Any exposure to secondhand smoke in the household also trended towards increasing risk after adjusting for household size and other exposures (OR 3.20, 95%CI 0.80-12.73) and (OR 4.37, 95% CI 0.80-23.70). We did not find any associations between neighborhood pollution level and COVID-19 infection based on census track and risk of infection. Furthermore, we found weak evidence between dietary exposure and risk of COVID-19 infection after adjusting for possible confounders. Conclusion: Crowding as indicated by household size increases risk for COVID-19 infection in Latinx families. Exposure to any secondhand smoke may also increase risk for COVID-19 through increased coughing and risk for respiratory impairment. Public policy and health interventions need to ensure that multi-unit residential complexes prevent any exposure to secondhand smoke.","DeCastro Mendez, A.; Escobar, M.; Romero Encinas, M.; Wojcicki, J.",,373,26

Many patients requiring treatment for COVID-19 may have either pre-existing renal or hepatic disease or experience acute renal/hepatic injury as a result of the acute infection. Altered renal or hepatic function can significantly affect drug concentrations of medications due to impaired drug metabolism and excretion, resulting in toxicity or reduced efficacy. The aim of this paper is to review the pharmacokinetics and available study data for the experimental COVID-19 therapies in patients with any degree of renal or hepatic impairment to make recommendations for dosing. METHODS: COVID-19 agents included in these recommendations were listed as primaries on the University of Liverpool COVID-19 drug interaction website (www.covid19-druginteractions.org), initially identified from Clinicialtrials.gov and ChicCTR.org.cn. A literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE as well as product licences and pharmacokinetic databases. FINDINGS: Remdesivir, dexamethasone, azithromycin, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta, ribavirin, tocilizumab, anakinra and sarilumab were identified as experimental drugs being used in COVID-19 trials as of November 2020. Limited study data was found for these drugs in patients with renal or hepatic impairment for COVID-19 or other indications. Recommendations were made based on available data, consideration of pharmacokinetic properties (including variability), the dosing and anticipated treatment duration of each regimen in COVID-19 and known toxicities. CONCLUSION: Dosing of drugs used to treat COVID-19 in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is complex.

Here, we report phase 3 results of early treatment of asymptomatic, SARS-CoV-2–positive adults and adolescents with subcutaneous REGEN-COV. METHODS: Individuals ≥12 years of age were eligible if identified within 96 hours of a household contact being diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2-positive; 314 were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous REGEN-COV 1200mg or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of infected participants without evidence of prior immunity (i.e., SARS-CoV-2-RT-qPCR–positive/seronegative) who subsequently developed symptomatic Covid-19 during a 28-day efficacy assessment period. RESULTS: Subcutaneous REGEN-COV 1200mg significantly prevented progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic disease compared with placebo (31.5% relative risk reduction; 29/100 [29.0%] vs. 44/104 [42.3%], respectively; P=0.0380). REGEN-COV also reduced the overall population burden of high viral load weeks (39.7% reduction vs. placebo; 48 vs. 82 total weeks; P=0.0010) and of symptomatic weeks (45.3% reduction vs. placebo; 89.6 vs. 170.3 total weeks; P=0.0273), the latter corresponding to an approximately 5.6-day reduction per symptomatic participant. Six placebo-treated participants had a Covid-19-related hospitalization or ER visit versus none for those receiving REGEN-COV. The proportion of participants receiving placebo who had ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse events was 48.1% compared to 33.5% for those receiving REGEN-COV, including Covid-19-related (39.7% vs. 25.8%, respectively) or non-Covid-19-related (16.0% vs. 11.0%, respectively) events. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous REGEN-COV 1200mg prevented progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection, reduced the duration of high viral load and symptoms, and was well tolerated.
