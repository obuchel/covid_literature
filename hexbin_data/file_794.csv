It is not Covid-19 itself, however, but the contradictions within the EU’s growth model and institutional architecture that would be to blame for such an outcome. The dramatic impact of the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic and the threat that it poses to Eurozone survival seem to have forced a reluctant Germany into action: a minor step, but an important signal. This note analyses the crossroads currently facing Europe—the risk of disintegration vis-a-vis the opportunity for a ‘Hamiltonian moment’—discussing possible future scenarios in the light of past developments.","Celi, Giuseppe; Guarascio, Dario; Simonazzi, Annamaria",J,794,29

To assist public health decision-makers, new suites of tools are needed to rapidly process and combine viral information retrieved from public-domain databases for a better risk assessment. RESULTS: Using our recently developed FluConvert and IniFlu software, we automatically processed and rearranged sequence data by standard viral nomenclature, determined the group-related consensus sequences, and identified group-specific polygenic signatures. The software possesses powerful ability to integrate viral, clinical, and epidemiological data. We demonstrated that both multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the HA gene and also at least 11 more evidence-based viral amino acid substitutions present in global highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 viruses during the years 2009–2016 that are associated with viral virulence and human infection. CONCLUSIONS: FluConvert and IniFlu are useful to monitor and assess all subtypes of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. These programs are implemented through command-line and user-friendly graphical interfaces, and identify molecular signatures with virological, epidemiological and clinical significance.

However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted teaching and learning, forcing programs to adapt to ensure residents can progress in their training.(1) Suddenly, academic days cannot be held in person, emergency department (ED) volumes are dynamically changing, and the role of residents in ED procedures has been questioned. Furthermore, medical student rotations through the ED have been cancelled, decreasing resident exposure to undergraduate teaching. These changes to resident education threaten resident wellness and will have downstream effects on training and personal professional development. In response, programs must develop strategies to ensure that residents continue receiving high-quality training in a safe learning environment. In this review, we will cover recommended strategies put forth by two large EM programs in Ontario (Table 1).","Mok, Garrick; Schouela, Nicholas; Thurgur, Lisa; Ho, Michael; Hall, Andrew K.; Caudle, Jaelyn; Rosenberg, Hans; Syed, Shahbaz",,794,12

The underlying pathophysiology is thought to be the ischaemia–reperfusion injury that occurs during the storage and reperfusion of the lung engraftment; this triggers a cascade of pathological changes, which result in pulmonary vascular dysfunction and loss of the normal alveolar architecture. There are a number of surgical and anaesthetic factors which may be related to the development of PGD. To date, although treatment options for PGD are limited, there are several promising experimental therapeutic targets.

SPENCD often coexists with neurologic disorders and immune dysregulation. Spasticity, developmental delay and intracranial calcification are main neurologic abnormalities. Large spectrum of immunologic abnormalities may be seen in SPENCD, including immune deficiencies and autoimmune disorders with autoimmune thrombocytopenia and systemic lupus erythematosus as the most common phenotypes. SPENCD is caused by loss of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, due to homozygous mutations in ACP5, playing a role in non-nucleic acid-related stimulation/regulation of the type I interferon pathway. We present two siblings, 13-year-old girl and 25-year-old boy with SPENCD, from consanguineous parents. Both patients had short stature, platyspondyly, metaphyseal changes, spastic paraparesis, mild intellectual disability, and juvenile-onset SLE. The age at disease-onset was 2 years for girl and 19 years for boy. Both had skin and mucosa involvement. The age at diagnosis of SLE was 4 years for girl, and 19 years for boy. The clinical diagnosis of SPENCD was confirmed by sequencing of ACP5 gene, which revealed a homozygous c.155A > C (p.K52T), a variant reported before as pathogenic. Juvenile-onset SLE accounts for about 15–20% of all SLE cases. But, the onset of SLE before 5-years of age and also monogenic SLE are rare. Our case report and the literature review show the importance of multisystemic evaluation in the diagnosis of SPENCD and to remind the necessity of investigating the monogenic etiology in early-onset and familial SLE cases.","Kara, Bulent; Ekinci, Zelal; Sahin, Sezgin; Gungor, Mesut; Gunes, Ayfer Sakarya; Ozturk, Kubra; Adrovic, Amra; Cefle, Ayse; Inanç, Murat; Gul, Ahmet; Kasapcopur, Ozgur",Rheumatol Int,794,12

This study assessed the relative capacities of IHNV and VHSV genes to modulate host general transcription and explores the abilities of specific IHNV genes to interfere with the interferon pathway in heterogenous teleost cell-lines. METHODS: Optimized protocols allowed for efficient transient transfections in EPC, BF-2, RTG-2 and RTgill-W1 cell lines of plasmids encoding IHNV (M genogroup) and VHSV (-IVb genotype) genes, including N, P, M, G and NV. Their impact on general cellular transcription was measured 48 hours post transfection (hpt) with luciferase constructs driven by a modified β-Actin promoter (pCAG). Their modulation of the innate antiviral immune response was characterized 72 hpt, using luciferase constructs measuring rainbow trout Type I IFN or MX-1 promoter augmentation, upon MAVS co-transfection. RESULTS: M was generally confirmed as the strongest constitutive transcriptional suppressor while IHNV P, but not VHSV P, augmented constitutive transcription in fibroblastic cell types. Cell-specific effects were observed for viral G gene, with VHSV G exhibiting suppression of basal transcription in EPC and BF-2 but not in trout cells; while IHNV G was stimulatory in RTG-2, but inhibitory in RTgill-W1. NV consistently stimulated constitutive transcription, with higher augmentation patterns seen in fibroblastic compared to epithelial cells, and for IHNV NV compared to VHSV NV. The innate antiviral immune response, focusing on the IFN pathway, was silenced by IHNV M in all cell lines tested. IHNV N showed a dose-dependent suppression of type I IFN, but with minor effects on MX-1. IHNV P and G played minor IFN-inhibitory roles, consistent and dose-dependent only for G in rainbow trout cells. IHNV NV mediated a consistent stimulatory effect on either Type I IFN or MX-1, but much less pronounced in RTgill-W1. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends our understanding of Novirhabdoviruses-host interaction, showing differential innate immune responses in heterogenous cell types. Viral regulators of innate immune signaling are identified, either as dose-dependent suppressors (such as M and N) or stimulators (mainly NV), indicating novel targets for the design of more efficient vaccination strategies.","Gorgoglione, Bartolomeo; Ringiesn, Jeffery L.; Pham, Loc H.; Shepherd, Brian S.; Leaman, Douglas W.",Virol J,794,26

Cellular oxidation is not necessarily harmful per se, but its effects depend on the balance between the peroxidation and antioxidation cascades, which can vary according to the stimulus and serve to maintain oxygen homeostasis. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated during influenza virus (IV) infection have critical effects on both the virus and host cells. In this review, we outline the link between viral infection and redox control using IV infection as an example. We discuss the current state of knowledge on the molecular relationship between cellular oxidation mediated by ROS accumulation and the diversity of IV infection. We also summarize the potential anti-IV agents available currently that act by targeting redox biology/pathophysiology.","Chen, Ker-Kong; Minakuchi, Moeko; Wuputra, Kenly; Ku, Chia-Chen; Pan, Jia-Bin; Kuo, Kung-Kai; Lin, Ying-Chu; Saito, Shigeo; Lin, Chang-Shen; Yokoyama, Kazunari K.",BMC Microbiol,794,24

While anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are a standard clinical measure of protein therapeutic immunogenicity, T cell epitopes in the primary sequences of these drugs are the key drivers or modulators of ADA response, depending on the type of T cell response that is stimulated (e.g., T helper or Regulatory T cells, respectively). In a previous publication on T cell-dependent immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, we addressed mitigation efforts such as identifying and reducing the presence of T cell epitopes or T cell response to protein therapeutics prior to further development of the protein therapeutic for clinical use. Over the past 5 years, greater insight into the role of regulatory T cell epitopes and the conservation of T cell epitopes with self (beyond germline) has improved the preclinical assessment of immunogenic potential. In addition, impurities contained in therapeutic drug formulations such as host cell proteins have also attracted attention and become the focus of novel risk assessment methods. Target effects have come into focus, given the emergence of protein and peptide drugs that target immune receptors in immuno-oncology applications. Lastly, new modalities are entering the clinic, leading to the need to revise certain aspects of the preclinical immunogenicity assessment pathway. In addition to drugs that have multiple antibody-derived domains or non-antibody scaffolds, therapeutic drugs may now be introduced via viral vectors, cell-based constructs, or nucleic acid based therapeutics that may, in addition to delivering drug, also prime the immune system, driving immune response to the delivery vehicle as well as the encoded therapeutic, adding to the complexity of assessing immunogenicity risk. While it is challenging to keep pace with emerging methods for the preclinical assessment of protein therapeutics and new biologic therapeutic modalities, this collective compendium provides a guide to current best practices and new concepts in the field.","Jawa, Vibha; Terry, Frances; Gokemeijer, Jochem; Mitra-Kaushik, Shibani; Roberts, Brian J.; Tourdot, Sophie; De Groot, Anne S.",Front Immunol,794,12

In this study, we generated a recombinant replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) co-expressing RABV G and SFTSV Gn (Ad5-G-Gn) and evaluated its immunogenicity and efficacy in mice. Ad5-G-Gn immunization activated more dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells in lymph nodes (LNs) and induced Th1-/Th2-mediated responses in splenocytes, leading to robust production of neutralizing antibodies against SFTSV and RABV. In addition, single dose of Ad5-G-Gn conferred mice complete protection against lethal RABV challenge and significantly reduced splenic SFTS viral load. Therefore, our data support further development of Ad5-G-Gn as a potential bivalent vaccine candidate against SFTS and rabies for dog and cat use.","Zhao, Zhongxin; Zheng, Wenwen; Yan, Lina; Sun, Peilu; Xu, Tong; Zhu, Yelei; Liu, Lele; Tian, Li; He, Hongbin; Wei, Yurong; Zheng, Xuexing",Front Microbiol,794,24

We recommend that only emergency and life-saving endoscopic procedures should be performed during COVID-19 pandemic, and semi-elective procedures should be performed after careful consideration. All routine endoscopy procedures should be deferred till normal hospital services resume. For emergency endoscopy procedures, prescreening of patients is critical to avoid nosocomial transmission.

As our understanding of the links between the gut microbiota with host immunity and infectious diseases deepens, there is a greater need to incorporate methods of modulating it as a means of therapy or infection prevention in daily clinical practice. Traditional antimicrobial stewardship principles have been evaluated to assess their impact on the gut microbiota diversity and the consequent repercussions, taking into consideration antibiotic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Novel strategies of selective digestive decontamination and fecal microbiota transplantation to regulate the gut microbiota have also been tested in different conditions with variable results. This review seeks to provide an overview of the available literature on the modulation of the gut microbiota and its implications for infection control and antimicrobial stewardship. With increased understanding, gut microbiota profiling through metataxonomic analysis may provide further insight into modulating microbial communities in the context of infection prevention and control.","Tan, Glorijoy Shi En; Tay, Hui Lin; Tan, Sock Hoon; Lee, Tau Hong; Ng, Tat Ming; Lye, David Chien",Adv Ther,794,12

A consideration is that these technologies can sometimes be expensive and inefficient if deployed on an ad hoc and stand-alone basis. An option is to incorporate RegTech into the digital transformation strategy of a management function such as Treasury. Integrated adoption would mean the digital platform can be deployed to support both strategic management activities and enhanced regulatory processes within Treasury, thereby ensuring commercial and prudential objectives are aligned.

Public health mitigation strategies, ranging from isolation of infected cases to implementation of national lockdowns, proved their effectiveness for the outbreaks control. However, the adjustment of public health measures is crucial during transition phases to avoid new outbreaks. To address the need for designing evidence-based strategies, we performed a systematic review, identifying healthcare systems approaches, experiences and recommendations used to manage COVID-19 and other epidemics. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane were searched to retrieve eligible studies of any study design, published in English until April 17th, 2020. Double-blinded screening process was conducted by titles/abstracts and subsequently eligible full-texts were read and pertinent data were extracted. We performed a narrative analysis of each implemented strategy. RESULTS: We included a total of 24 articles addressing the public health strategies implemented for respiratory viral infections outbreaks as COVID-19, influenza A H1N1, MERS and SARS. The identified strategies are ascribable to two main categories: healthcare systems management at a national level and healthcare providers strategies at a local level. The key components of the transition strategies regarded the implementation of evidence-based contextual policies, intrahospital management approaches, community healthcare facilities, non-pharmaceutical interventions, enhanced surveillance, workplace preventive measures, mental health interventions and communication plans. CONCLUSIONS: The identified healthcare systems strategies applied worldwide to face epidemics or pandemics, are a useful knowledge base to inform decision-makers about control measures to be used in the transition phases of COVID-19 and beyond. KEY MESSAGES: Healthcare systems strategies that can be implemented to manage pandemics/epidemics transition phases are a useful knowledge base to inform policy makers about the most effective solutions to adopt. The evidence reporting the healthcare systems management of respiratory viruses epidemics/pandemics, show the lack of a common and shared approach and more evidence-based research is needed.","Cascini, F; Hoxhaj, I; Zaçe, D; Ferranti, M; Ricciardi, W; Boccia, S",Eur J Public Health,794,1

It was first found in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since spread universally, causing a constant pandemic. On June 3, 2020, 6.37 million cases were found in 188 countries and regions. During pandemic prevention, this can minimize the impact of the disease on individuals and groups. A study was carried out on coronavirus to observe the number of cases, deaths, and recovery cases worldwide within a specific time period of 5 months. Based on this data, this research paper will predict the future spread of this infectious disease in human society. METHODS: In our study, the dataset was taken from WHO “Data WHO Coronavirus Covid-19 cases and deaths-WHO-COVID-19-global-data”. This dataset contains information about the observation date, provenance/state, country/region, and latest updates. In this article, we implemented several forecasting techniques: naive method, simple average, moving average, single exponential smoothing, Holt linear trend method, Holt-Winters method and ARIMA, for comparison, and how these methods improve the Root mean square error score. RESULTS: The naive method is best suited as described over all other methods. In the ARIMA model, utilizing grid search, we recognized a lot of boundaries that delivered the best-fit model for our time series data. By continuing the model, future predictions of death cases indicate that the number of deaths will increased by more than 600,000 by January 2021. CONCLUSION: This survey will support the government and experts in making arrangements for what is about to happen.

Its mechanism of action is described thoroughly, as well as precautions for monitoring adequate levels in patients using it. Dermatologists should also be aware of the possible adverse events it may present. In dermatology it can be used in bullous and autoimmune diseases, and in other conditions, including intractable pruritus, atopic dermatitis, photodermatoses, psoriasis, and others.

We further integrate this procedure into one application, namely into CeTA, a formally verified certifier to check untrusted termination proofs. This checking involves assertions of unsatisfiability of linear integer inequalities; previously, only a sufficient criterion for such checks was supported. To verify the soundness of the decision procedure, we first formalize the proof that every satisfiable set of linear integer inequalities also has a small solution, and give explicit upper bounds. To this end we mechanize several important theorems on linear programming, including statements on integrality and bounds. The procedure itself is then implemented as a branch-and-bound algorithm, and is available in several languages via Isabelle’s code generator. It internally relies upon an adapted version of an existing verified incremental simplex algorithm.","Bottesch, Ralph; Haslbeck, Max W.; Reynaud, Alban; Thiemann, René",NASA Formal Methods,794,5

As older adults spend most of their time at or near home, the characteristics of the proximate residential environments are particularly important for supporting those activities. This study aims to (1) explore places used for various social interactions older adults engage in, (2) examine specific neighborhood environmental features associated with intergenerational interactions, and (3) compare similarities and differences in environmental correlates of intergenerational interactions vs. walking. Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed self-reported survey data from 455 community-dwelling adults aged 65+ from Austin, Texas, as well as Geographic Information System (GIS) measures capturing the neighborhood environment around each participant's home. Descriptive statistics were used for Aim 1. Multivariable binary logistic models were used for Aims 2 and 3, to identify environmental variables predicting the odds of participating in intergenerational interactions (with children 1+ times/week, and with children, teenagers, or adults 1+ times/week) in one's neighborhood, as well as walking 1+ times/week for transportation or recreation purposes. Results: Participants had a mean age of 73 years, and were primarily female (72.1%) and non-Hispanic white (72.8%). Older adults interacted frequently with adults (79.2%, 1+ times/week) and other older adults (66.9%) in their neighborhood, while less frequently with children (28.0%) and teenagers (21.9%). Recreational walking (73.3%, 1+ times/week) was more popular for older adults than transportation walking (43.8%). Multivariable analyses showed that neighborhood perceptions, transportation infrastructure, land uses, land covers, population densities, development activities, and composite scores were significant predictors of intergenerational activities. Both similarities and differences were found in terms of the neighborhood environmental factors associated with intergenerational interactions vs. walking although differences were more evident in the domains of land covers, development activities, and composite scores. Conclusions: Given the significant health benefits, promoting intergenerational interactions and walking among older adults should be a national/global responsibility. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of the specific social and physical environmental facilitators as well as barriers to creating intergenerational communities that can support healthy living of all generations.","Zhong, Sinan; Lee, Chanam; Lee, Hanwool",Front Public Health,794,12

It is extremely rare to have malformations that occur simultaneously. There is literature to show that extralobar sequestration is associated with other congenital anomalies, most commonly diaphragmatic hernias, and also with other bronchopulmonary foregut malformations (e.g., extralobar sequestration and congenital pulmonary airway malformations). However, very few case reports were found that reported extralobar sequestration and foregut duplication cysts and only one report of a right-sided complex foregut malformation with pulmonary sequestration. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 3-month-old male infant with a prenatal diagnosis of a cystic lung lesion who, after developing symptoms of respiratory distress, was found to have concurrent right-sided extralobar pulmonary sequestration and a mediastinal bronchogenic cyst. CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent occurrence of these malformations in one patient could help support the theory that these malformations result from an early error in development during the time when both the lung buds and foregut are developing simultaneously.","Hanna, Carolyn; Sharma, Priya G.; Mustafa, Moiz M.; Reppucci, Jennifer; Shenoy, Archana; Rajderkar, Dhanashree",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,794,30

It is designed to capture the core mechanism of dependency in BLL, while it is also able to separate complexity aspects of BLL. The main feature of GBLL is to adopt a multi-object pseudo-semiring as a grading system of the !-modality. We analyze the complexity of cut-elimination in GBLL, and give a translation from BLL with constraints to GBAL with positivity axiom. We then introduce indexed linear exponential comonads (ILEC for short) as a categorical structure for interpreting the [Formula: see text]-modality of GBLL. We give an elementary example of ILEC using folding product, and a technique to modify ILECs with symmetric monoidal comonads. We then consider a semantics of BLL using the folding product on the category of assemblies of a BCI-algebra, and relate the semantics with the realizability category studied by Hofmann, Scott and Dal Lago.","Fukihara, Yōji; Katsumata, Shin-ya",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,794,7

Psychosocial stress can trigger MC hyperactivation and increases pro-inflammatory cytokines in target tissues such as the skin. If the cholinergic system (CS) and Chrna7 ligands play a role in these cascades is largely unknown. Objective: To elucidate the role of the CS in the response to psychosocial stress using a mouse-model for stress-triggered cutaneous inflammatory circuits. Methods: Key CS markers (ACh, Ch, SLURP-1, SLURP-2, Lynx1, Chrm3, Chrna7, Chrna9, ChAT, VAChT, Oct3, AChE, and BChE) in skin and its MC (sMC), MC activation, immune parameters (TNFα, IL1β, IL10, TGFβ, HIF1α, and STAT3) and oxidative stress were analyzed in skin from 24 h noise-stressed mice and in cultured MC (cMC) from C57BL/6 or Chrna7-Knockout mice. Results: First, Chrna7 and SLURP-1 mRNA were exclusively upregulated in stressed skin. Second, histomorphometry located Chrna7 and SLURP-1 in nerves and sMC and demonstrated upregulated contacts and increased Chrna7+ sMC in stressed skin, while 5 ng/mL SLURP-1 degranulated cMC. Third, IL1β+ sMC were high in stressed skin, and while SLURP-1 alone had no significant effect on cMC cytokines, it upregulated IL1β in cMC from Chrna7-KO and in IL1β-treated wildtype cMC. In addition, HIF1α+ sMC were high in stressed skin and Chrna7-agonist AR-R 17779 induced ROS in cMC while SLURP-1 upregulated TNFα and IL1β in cMC when HIF1α was blocked. Conclusions: These data infer that the CS plays a role in the regulation of stress-sensitive inflammatory responses but may have a surprising pro-inflammatory effect in healthy skin, driving IL1β expression if SLURP-1 is involved.","Ertle, Christoph M.; Rommel, Frank R.; Tumala, Susanne; Moriwaki, Yasuhiro; Klein, Jochen; Kruse, Johannes; Gieler, Uwe; Peters, Eva M.

Additionally, they do not systematically incorporate asymptomatic cases. Our study aimed at providing a framework for data-driven approaches, by leveraging the strengths of the grey-box system theory or grey-box identification, known for its robustness in problem solving under partial, incomplete, or uncertain data. Empirical data on confirmed cases and deaths, extracted from an open source repository were used to develop the SEAIRD compartment model. Adjustments were made to fit current knowledge on the COVID-19 behavior. The model was implemented and solved using an Ordinary Differential Equation solver and an optimization tool. A cross-validation technique was applied, and the coefficient of determination R(2) was computed in order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. Key epidemiological parameters were finally estimated and we provided the rationale for the construction of SEAIRD model. When applied to Brazil’s cases, SEAIRD produced an excellent agreement to the data, with an R(2) ≥ 90%. The probability of COVID-19 transmission was generally high (≥ 95%). On the basis of a 20-day modeling data, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was as low as 3 infected cases per 100,000 exposed persons in Brazil and France. Within the same time frame, the fatality rate of COVID-19 was the highest in France (16.4%) followed by Brazil (6.9%), and the lowest in Russia (≤ 1%). SEAIRD represents an asset for modeling infectious diseases in their dynamical stable phase, especially for new viruses when pathophysiology knowledge is very limited.

As a result, surgical guidelines shifted to recommend non-operative management despite uncertainty of its efficacy compared to standard operative management. Within general surgery, nowhere was this more relevant than with the management of appendicitis, the most common abdominal emergency worldwide. This novel research collaborative was set up during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the outcomes of appendicitis patients managed with antibiotics compared to appendicectomy. METHODS: Without the time to obtain funding for the project, trainee-driven recruitment of sites was vital and used established trainee-led regional research networks and twitter (@Covidharem). Further backing was provided by surgical societies who published and promoted the study protocol on their platforms. The steering group used surgical networks and contacts to recruit sites who were not already involved and RedCap was used for data entry to allow for real time monitoring of data completion. RESULTS: In just twelve weeks, 471 individual collaborators were recruited from 101 sites across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The collaborative went from inception to 500 patients uploaded in 30 days. The collaborative to date has recruited nearly 3500 patients, published both the protocol and an interim analysis within 4 months, and hosted a highly successful webinar. CONCLUSION: Quality research can be achieved in times of crisis, the key to successful projects is trainee driven and led, focussed “snapshots” that can be implemented rapidly during the dynamic environment of a crisis.","Javanmard-Emamghissi, Hannah; Javanmard-Emamghissi, Hannah",BJS Open,794,1

Presenting symptoms are classically those of thyrotoxicosis but with associated tenderness in the thyroid. Treatment of acute symptoms is possible and the thyroid function will generally normalize with time. Subacute thyroiditis has rarely been reported after administration of viral vaccinations such as the seasonal flu vaccine. We present a case of subacute thyroiditis which presented after administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Case: Patient is a 42yo female with no past medical history. She received the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 on 12/22/20. Five days later, the patient complained of sore throat and palpitations. These symptoms progressed and she was evaluated in an urgent care on 12/31/20 where she was found to have tachycardia. Infectious work-up, including PCR for COVID-19, was negative and she was sent home. She took ibuprofen with some improvement of her symptoms. The following day she went to the ED; she was found to have a heart rate in the 130s with sinus tachycardia on EKG. Thyroid function testing was done which revealed TSH <0.01, fT4 4.58, fT3 11.8. Her TPO antibody was <28 and inflammatory markers were elevated including sed rate of 62. The patient was prescribed prednisone 40mg daily and propranolol 20mg as needed for symptoms. She reports rapid improvement of symptoms with prednisone. On 1/21/20, thyroid function showed TSH <0.01, fT4 down to 3.2, tT3 normal at 135. Thyroglobulin was elevated at 140.8 with negative thyroglobulin antibody, TRAb and TSI. Her inflammatory markers had decreased with sed rate of 26 and normal C-reactive protein. She had improved symptoms. Discussion: Cases of subacute thyroiditis are most commonly associated with upper respiratory viruses but cases have been reported with traditional inactivated viral vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines such as those for annual influenza. We present the case of a 42-year-old female who has presented with a classic case of subacute thyroiditis which occurred in the time frame after receiving the Pfizer mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. Research has been ongoing for decades regarding development of mRNA vaccines but the mRNA vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been the first to be widely distributed to the general population. Thyroiditis has not been reported as a common side effect but the cross recognition between the coronavirus spike protein targeted with the mRNA vaccine and healthy thyroid cell antigens exists as evidenced by this case.

Especially affected are vulnerable patients in low- and middle-income countries who can only afford access to public health systems. Approach: Soon after physical distancing and curfew orders began on 15 March 2020 in Kenya, we rapidly implemented three supply-chain strategies to ensure a continuous supply of essential medicines while minimizing patients' COVID-19 exposure risks. We redistributed central stocks of medicines to peripheral health facilities to ensure local availability for several months. We equipped smaller, remote health facilities with medicine tackle boxes. We also made deliveries of medicines to patients with difficulty reaching facilities. Local setting: &#932;o implement these strategies we leveraged our 30-year partnership with local health authorities in rural western Kenya and the existing revolving fund pharmacy scheme serving 85 peripheral health centres. Relevant changes: In April 2020, stocks of essential chronic and non-chronic disease medicines redistributed to peripheral health facilities increased to 835 140 units, as compared with 316 330 units in April 2019. We provided medicine tackle boxes to an additional 46 health facilities. Our team successfully delivered medications to 264 out of 311 patients (84.9%) with noncommunicable diseases whom we were able to reach. Lessons learnt: Our revolving fund pharmacy model has ensured that patients' access to essential medicines has not been interrupted during the pandemic. Success was built on a community approach to extend pharmaceutical services, adapting our current supply-chain infrastructure and working quickly in partnership with local health authorities.","Tran, Dan N; Were, Phelix M; Kangogo, Kibet; Amisi, James A; Manji, Imran; Pastakia, Sonak D; Vedanthan, Rajesh",Bull World Health Organ,794,18

We propose how to evaluate suspected severe allergic reactions to the vaccines so that as many as possible may be safely vaccinated. RECENT FINDINGS: Rare cases of severe allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination have been observed, seemingly at a higher frequency than for other vaccines. Few excipients are likely to have caused these reactions. IgE-mediated reactions to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and its derivatives are the most suspected, albeit hitherto unproven, causes. We suggest to make a diagnosis based on skin tests with PEG and PEG derivatives and that these be considered in relation to the decisions required before the first and the second vaccine dose. A vaccine without these excipients is available, but published data about its side effects are limited. SUMMARY: The underlying immunological mechanisms of the rare severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are poorly understood and need to be clarified. Identifying those who have an undiagnosed allergy to PEG and PEG derivatives is crucial before vaccination, and these substances are found in laxatives, cosmetics and in 30% of all our medications today.","Nilsson, Lennart; Csuth, Ágnes; Storsaeter, Jann; Garvey, Lene H; Jenmalm, Maria C",Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol,794,22

Although the majority of patients who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, some patients develop severe symptoms that can permanently detract from their quality of life. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Both viruses infect the respiratory system, and there are direct and indirect effects of this infection on multiple organ systems, including the musculoskeletal system. Epidemiological data from the SARS pandemic of 2002 to 2004 identified myalgias, muscle dysfunction, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis as common sequelae in patients with moderate and severe forms of this disease. Early studies have indicated that there is also considerable musculoskeletal dysfunction in some patients with COVID-19, although long-term follow-up studies have not yet been conducted. The purpose of this article was to summarize the known musculoskeletal pathologies in patients with SARS or COVID-19 and to combine this with computational modeling and biochemical signaling studies to predict musculoskeletal cellular targets and long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Disser, Nathaniel P; De Micheli, Andrea J; Schonk, Martin M; Konnaris, Maxwell A; Piacentini, Alexander N; Edon, Daniel L; Toresdahl, Brett G; Rodeo, Scott A; Casey, Ellen K; Mendias, Christopher L",J Bone Joint Surg Am,794,8

At the same time, the pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health disparities that together constitute a form of structural racism. These disparities pose a critical ethical challenge in developing fair triage systems that will maximize lives saved without perpetuating systemic inequities. Here we review alternatives to 'utilitarian' triage, including first-come first-served, egalitarian, and prioritarian systems of allocating scarce medical resources. We assess the comparative advantages and disadvantages of these allocation schemes. Ultimately, we argue that while triage protocols should not exacerbate disparities, they are not an adequate mechanism for redressing systemic health inequities. Entrenched health disparities must be addressed through broader social change.","Tolchin, Benjamin; Hull, Sarah C; Kraschel, Katherine",J. med. ethics,794,16

SARS-CoV-2 shares almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV-1 and 50% with MERS-CoV. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 proteins share a high degree of homology (approximately 95%) with SARS-CoV-1 proteins. Hence, the mechanisms of SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 infection are similar and occur via binding to ACE2 protein, which is widely distributed in the human body, with a predominant expression in endocrine tissues including testis, thyroid, adrenal and pituitary. PURPOSE: On the basis of expression pattern of the ACE2 protein among different tissues, similarity between SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease, we aimed at discussing, after almost one-year pandemic, about the relationships between COVID-19 infection and the endocrine system. First, we discussed the potential effect of hormones on the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection; second, we examined the evidences regarding the effect of COVID-19 on the endocrine system. When data were available, a comparative discussion between SARS and COVID-19 effects was also performed. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search within Pubmed was performed. This review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statements. RESULTS: Among 450, 100 articles were selected. Tissue and vascular damages have been shown on thyroid, adrenal, testis and pituitary glands, with multiple alterations of endocrine function. CONCLUSION: Hormones may affect patient susceptibility to COVID-19 infection but evidences regarding therapeutic implication of these findings are still missing. SARS and COVID-19 may affect endocrine glands and their dense vascularization, impairing endocrine system function. A possible damage of endocrine system in COVID-19 patients should be investigated in both COVID-19 acute phase and recovery to identify both early and late endocrine complications that may be important for patient's prognosis and well-being after COVID-19 infection.","Piticchio, T; Le Moli, R; Tumino, D; Frasca, F",J. endocrinol. invest,794,16

We aimed to assess the health, psychosocial and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with chronic conditions in India. METHODS: Between July 29, to September 12, 2020, we telephonically surveyed adults (n = 2335) with chronic conditions across four sites in India. Data on participants' demographic, socio-economic status, comorbidities, access to health care, treatment satisfaction, self-care behaviors, employment, and income were collected using pre-tested questionnaires. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the factors associated with difficulty in accessing medicines and worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Further, a diverse sample of 40 participants completed qualitative interviews that focused on eliciting patient's experiences during the COVID-19 lockdowns and data analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred thirty-four individuals completed the survey (response rate = 74%). The mean (SD) age of respondents was 57.8 years (11.3) and 50% were men. During the COVID-19 lockdowns in India, 83% of participants reported difficulty in accessing healthcare, 17% faced difficulties in accessing medicines, 59% reported loss of income, 38% lost jobs, and 28% reduced fruit and vegetable consumption. In the final-adjusted regression model, rural residence (OR, 95%CI: 4.01,2.90-5.53), having diabetes (2.42, 1.81-3.25) and hypertension (1.70,1.27-2.27), and loss of income (2.30,1.62-3.26) were significantly associated with difficulty in accessing medicines. Further, difficulties in accessing medicines (3.67,2.52-5.35), and job loss (1.90,1.25-2.89) were associated with worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Qualitative data suggest most participants experienced psychosocial distress due to loss of job or income and had difficulties in accessing in-patient services. CONCLUSION: People with chronic conditions, particularly among poor, rural, and marginalized populations, have experienced difficulties in accessing healthcare and been severely affected both socially and financially by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Singh, Kavita; Kondal, Dimple; Mohan, Sailesh; Jaganathan, Suganthi; Deepa, Mohan; Venkateshmurthy, Nikhil Srinivasapura; Jarhyan, Prashant; Anjana, Ranjit Mohan; Narayan, K M Venkat; Mohan, Viswanathan; Tandon, Nikhil; Ali, Mohammed K; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj; Eggleston, Karen",BMC Public Health,794,2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 130 women: T1DM (n = 40), T2DM (n = 35), gestational diabetes (GDM, n = 40) and the control group (n = 15). The serum concentrations of NT, 8-isoprostane, and TAC were measured by ELISA methods. RESULTS: Elevated 8-isoprostane levels were observed in all patients with DM, but this biomarker's maximum values have been seen in T1DM and T2DM on insulin groups. A similar tendency was observed for the concentration of NT in both the 1st and 3rd trimesters. TAC levels showed a statistically relevant decrease in all DM groups compared to the control. The correlation analysis showed a direct correlation between HbA1c and serum 8-isoprostane levels in the 1st (r = .27) and 3rd (r = .3) pregnancy trimesters as well as inverse correlation with TAC level (r = -.48). Direct (NT, 8-isoprostane) and inverse correlations (TAC) were fixated for this biomarker concentration and preeclampsia rates. CONCLUSION: DM in pregnancy is related to oxidative stress activation, which might lead to the development of adverse perinatal outcomes.","Kapustin, Roman; Chepanov, Sergey; Kopteeva, Ekaterina; Arzhanova, Olga",Gynecol Endocrinol,794,16

We hypothesized that the inclusion of BCI in the diets may lead to fermentation parameters equivalent to those of conventional feedstuff such as tropical grasses or grains; therefore, we aimed to evaluate ruminal fermentation parameters of BCI in in vitro conditions. Three different substrates were prepared: 100% BCI (BCI diet), 100% tifton (Cynodon spp.) hay (CTL diet), and 50% tifton hay +50% BCI (THB diet). Ruminal fermentation parameters of these diets were evaluated in in vitro gas production assays. In a 24-h incubation, increased values for total gas production, organic matter degradability, and methane production were observed for BCId and THB as compared to CTL (p < 0.05), while neutral THB showed the highest value for neutral detergent fiber degradability (p < 0.05). Fermentation profile was evaluated in a 48-h assay: shorter lag time as well as increased gas production potential and fractional fermentation rate were observed for the BCId and THB as compared to CTL (p < 0.05). Our results suggested that by-product from cassava industry is a suitable feed for ruminant production, providing desirable in vitro ruminal fermentation performance and organic matter degradability.","Bizzuti, Beatriz Elisa; de Abreu Faria, Leticia; da Costa, Wilian Santos; Lima, Paulo de Mello Tavares; Ovani, Vagner S; Krüger, Ana Maria; Louvandini, Helder; Abdalla, Adibe Luiz",Trop Anim Health Prod,794,17

Thus, patients with hypertension with COVID-19 could have worse prognosis. Indeed, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers may interfere with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression/activity. Thus, patients with hypertension undergoing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blockers drug therapy may be at a higher risk of contracting a serious COVID-19 infection and should be monitored. Moreover, in the present study we investigated the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor versus angiotensin receptor blockers versus calcium channel blockers on clinical outcomes as mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admissions, heart injury, and death in 62 patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS The multicenter study was prospectively conducted at Department of Infectious Diseases of Sant'Anna Hospital of Caserta, and of University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"" of Naples, at Department of Advanced Surgical and Medical Sciences of University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli,"" Naples, and at General Medical Assistance Unit ""FIMG,"" Naples, Italy. Lowest values of left ventricle ejection fraction predicted deaths (1.142, 1.008-1.294, P<0.05), while highest values of interleukin-6 predicted the admission to intensive care unit (1.617, 1.094-2.389), mechanical ventilation (1.149, 1.082-1.219), heart injuries (1.367, 1.054-1.772), and deaths (4.742, 1.788-8.524). CONCLUSIONS Anti-hypertensive drugs didn't affect the prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Consequently, tailored anti-inflammatory and immune therapies in addition to chronic antihypertensive therapy, could prevent a worse prognosis, as well as improve the clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension with COVID-19 infection.","Sardu, Celestino; Maggi, Paolo; Messina, Vincenzo; Iuliano, Pasquale; Sardu, Antonio; Iovinella, Vincenzo; Paolisso, Giuseppe; Marfella, Raffaele",J Am Heart Assoc,794,16

Given the importance of COVID-19 TP rates for understanding COVID-related morbidity, researchers and clinicians have become increasingly interested in comparing TP rates across countries. The statistical methods for performing such comparisons fall into two general categories: frequentist tests and Bayesian methods. Using data from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org), we performed comparisons for two prototypical yet disparate pairs of countries: Bolivia versus the United States (large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates), and South Korea vs. Uruguay (two very small TP rates of similar magnitude). Three different statistical procedures were used: two frequentist tests (an asymptotic z-test and the 'N-1' chi-square test), and a Bayesian method for comparing two proportions (TP rates are proportions). Results indicated that for the case of large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates (Bolivia versus the United States), the frequentist and Bayesian approaches both indicated that the two rates were substantially different. When the TP rates were very small and of similar magnitude (values of 0.009 and 0.007 for South Korea and Uruguay, respectively), the frequentist tests indicated a highly significant contrast, despite the apparent trivial amount by which the two rates differ. The Bayesian method, in comparison, suggested that the TP rates were practically equivalent-a finding that seems more consistent with the observed data. When TP rates are highly similar in magnitude, frequentist tests can lead to erroneous interpretations. A Bayesian approach, on the other hand, can help ensure more accurate inferences and thereby avoid potential decision errors that could lead to costly public health and policy-related consequences.","Hittner, James B; Fasina, Folorunso O",Methods (S.
