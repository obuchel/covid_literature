UCBT is traditionally associated with an increased risk of infection, particularly during the first 3 months after transplantation. Controlling interstitial pneumonia and severe infection is the key to reducing patient mortality from infection. Legionella pneumophila can cause a mild cough to rapidly fatal pneumonia. After mNGS confirmed that the pathogen was L. pneumophila, azithromycin, cefoperazone sulbactam, and posaconazole were used for treatment, and the patient's temperature decreased and remained normal. The details of this case highlight the benefits of the timely use of metagenomic NGS to identify pathogens for the survival of immunocompromised patients.","Wang, Yangyan; Dai, Yuanyuan; Lu, Huaiwei; Chang, Wenjiao; Ma, Fan; Wang, Ziran; Liu, Zhican; Ma, Xiaoling",Front Med (Lausanne),595,16

Main funding source(s): Dutch Olympic Committee*Dutch Sports Federation (NOC*NSF) Amsterdam Movement Sciences (AMS) ABSTRACT: Most studies investigating the cardiotropic effects of SARS-CoV-2 focus on cardiac complications in severely ill patients. Little is known about eventual sustained cardiac involvement after recovery from COVID-19, especially in patients with a moderate or mild course of illness. Furthermore, as physical exercise can potentially worsen the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 peri- or myocarditis, cardiac involvement in athletes or in the physically active population warrants investigation. Finally, the risk of arrhythmias in such individuals remains largely unknown. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of myocardial and pericardial involvement after SARS-CoV-2 infection, long-term cardiac sequelae after infection, and risks of SCD/SCD in a predominantly healthy/physical active population, including athletes. We performed a systematic PubMed and MedRxiv search through December 19th, 2020, with the combined terms or synonyms for: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, cardiovascular imaging, cardiac MRI, athletes. Exclusion criteria were: no CMR investigations reported, ≥1 comorbidities, age ≤16 years, and reviews. Two investigators independently screened and assessed all identified manuscripts, and additionally searched for reported arrhythmia outcomes. The initial search yielded 127 papers; after extensive review, we included a total of nine papers comprising 607 recovered post-COVID patients/athletes. The table summarises the main CMR findings. No study reported arrhythmias except for Ho et al. who found 18% undefined arrhythmias at baseline. In 5 studies in 201 patients, the weighted mean for the prevalence of elevated T1 was 55%, elevated T2 48%, myocardial LGE 35%, and pericardial LGE 17%. One study (Knight et al.) did not report T1 and T2 measurements. Ho et al. and Ming-Yen et al. found respectively 40% and 19% of patients to meet the Lake Louise Criteria (LLC) for myocarditis; Puntmann et al. reported that 60% had active myocardial inflammation. Second, in 1 study in 139 healthcare workers, the mean for the prevalence of elevated T1 was 42%, T2 4%, LGE 30%, and 5% met LCC for myocarditis. Third, in 3 studies in 96 athletes, the weighted mean for the prevalence of elevated T1 was 21%, T2 24%, myocardial LGE 4%, and pericardial LGE 29%. Brito et al., Clark et al. and Rajpal et al. reported that respectively 0%, 5% and 15% met the LCC for myocarditis. Studies investigating peri- and myocardial sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection report varying prevalences of cardiac abnormalities. Such studies are limited in numbers, generally include a low number of individuals, and report no follow-up; only 1 study reported non-specified arrhythmia outcomes. Based on the available studies, the short-term risk for post-COVID-19 SCD due to arrhythmias caused by myocardial inflammation appears to be low. Prospective investigations in larger, well-defined populations, including longer-term follow up and arrhythmia monitoring, are urgently needed.","Van Hattum, J; Spies, JL; Verwijs, SM; Verwoert, GC; Boekholdt, SM; Groenink, M; Pinto, YM; Wilde, AAM; Jorstad, HT",Eur J Prev Cardiol,595,24

The objectives of this study were to propose standard techniques, perform physicomechanical testing, and classify materials commonly used for inguinal hernia repair. STUDY DESIGN Nine meshes were evaluated: 4 polypropylene, 1 polyester, 1 polytetrafluoroethylene, and 3 partially absorbable. Physical properties were determined through image analysis, laser micrometry, and density measurements. Biomechanical properties were determined through suture retention, tear resistance, uniaxial, and ball burst testing with specimens tested in 2 different orientations. A 1-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-test or a t-test were performed, with p < 0.05. RESULTS Significant differences were observed due to both mesh type and orientation. Areas of interstices ranged from 0.33 ± 0.01 mm² for ProLite (Atrium Medical Corp) and C-QUR Lite (Atrium Medical Corp) Large to 4.10 ± 0.06 mm² for ULTRAPRO (Ethicon), and filament diameters ranged from 99.00 ±8.1 μm for ProLite Ultra (Atrium Medical Corp) and C-QUR Lite Small to 338.8 ± 3.7 μm for Parietex Flat Sheet TEC (Covidien). These structural characteristics influenced biomechanical properties such as tear resistance and tensile strength. ProLite Ultra, C-QUR Lite Small, ULTRAPRO and INFINIT (WL Gore & Associates) did not resist tearing as effectively as the others. All meshes exhibited supraphysiologic burst strengths except INFINIT and ULTRAPRO. CONCLUSIONS Significant differences exist between the physicomechanical properties of polypropylene, polyester, polytetrafluoroethylene, and partially absorbable mesh prostheses commonly used for inguinal hernia repair. Orientation of the mesh was also shown to be critical for the success of meshes, particularly those demonstrating anisotropy.","Deeken, Corey R; Abdo, Michael S; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,595,16

Conferences, such as the annual NESPS, are important opportunities to increase visibility of female role models and resources to address deterrents to surgical careers. We thus sought to examine the participation and visibility of women in the NESPS over the last decade. METHODS Abstracts and programs from the NESPS regional conferences between 2013 and 2019 were accessed via the publicly available past meetings archives, and registration lists were provided by the NESPS. Registrants, panelists, speakers, moderators, and first author and senior author listed for each poster presentation, podium presentation was listed, sex was determined (male or female), and sex were aggregated by category of participation. Significance was set at a P value of less than 0.05. RESULTS Registration of women for the NESPS annual conferences was constant for 5 years (2013-2017), followed by an increase in female registrants from 27.1% in 2017 to 42.3% in 2019. Female representation among poster and podium presentations also increased from 2017 to 2019 (7.7%-23.3% poster presentations and 11.1%-23.4% podium presentations). Invited positions (speakers, panelists, and moderators) had a peak of 32.2% in 2017, but otherwise, there is no clear evidence of improved representation of women. CONCLUSIONS We found an increase in the proportion of female registrants at the annual NESPS conferences from 2013 to 2019. However, visibility of female participants fluctuated over the same period; addressing this represents one opportunity for closing the gender gap at the NESPS. As the percentage of female trainees continues to rise, we look to female faculty to continue to participate in educational events, such as the NESPS meeting, and to be present as role models for the growing new generation of female plastic surgeons.","Xun, Helen; He, Waverley; Chen, Jonlin; Long, Chao; Kraenzlin, Franca; Lee, Erica; Yesantharao, Pooja; Cooney, Carisa S; Amalfi, Ashley; Huston, Tara L; Broderick, Kristen",Annals of plastic surgery,595,32

This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting GE before and after SG. METHODS We enrolled 35 normal weight healthy subjects and 23 obese patients receiving SG. The normal individuals and obese patients before and 3 months after SG received oatmeal-based scintigraphy to measure GE. Gastrointestinal symptoms and circulating levels of peptide YY (PYY) were also measured. RESULTS There were no differences in the GE parameters, including simple half-time at 3 h and percentage of gastric retention at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h between healthy controls and pre-SG obese subjects. SG led to accelerated GE, more gastrointestinal symptoms, and increased fasting PYY levels postoperatively. Based on our previously established normal GE values, 18 (78.3%) obese patients with rapid postoperative GE had higher levels of preoperative fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin, and homeostasis model assessment of the insulin resistance index than those with normal postoperative GE. Twelve (52.2%) obese patients had preoperative diabetes mellitus (DM), and only four (17.4%) remained diabetic after SG. The post-SG gastric retention at 0.5 and 1 h was lower in patients with preoperative DM than in those without preoperative DM. Neither severity of gastrointestinal symptoms nor fasting PYY levels were associated with postoperative GE alterations. CONCLUSION Most of the obese patients had accelerated GE after SG. A higher preoperative glycemic profile was associated with rapid post-SG GE.","Yang, Po-Jen; Cheng, Mei-Fang; Yang, Wei-Shiung; Tsai, Ming-Shian; Lee, Po-Chu; Chen, Chiung-Nien; Lin, Ming-Tsan; Tseng, Ping-Huei",Obesity surgery,595,28

METHODS A 38-year-old patient with an L1 burst fracture (AO A3.3) underwent a standard thoracoscopic corpectomy and replacement of the vertebral body with an extendable vertebral body replacement 10 days after posterior instrumentation of T12-L2. In patients history chronic abusive alcoholism with related diseases such as pancreatitis, followed by hemipancreatectomy was found. Six hours after the surgery, the patient became hemodynamically unstable. An emergency CT scan revealed a splenic rupture. Emergent splenectomy was performed. RESULTS After surgical treatment of the L1 burst fracture, a rupture of the spleen was detected. An immediate splenectomy was performed. At the 18-month follow-up, an unchanged stable position of the cage was observed on CT. CONCLUSIONS Due to its proximity to the thoracolumbar junction, the spleen is vulnerable to injury during spine surgery. If the patient has undergone previous intra-abdominal operations or chronic inflammation of the pancreas is found, special care of the spleen during the operation is necessary.","Bogner, Robert; Resch, Herbert; Mayer, Michael; Lederer, Stefan; Ortmaier, Reinhold","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",595,19

Despite the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak, relatively few diagnostic images are openly available to develop automatic diagnosis algorithms. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle when data is highly unbalanced with many cases in one class and only a few cases in another; new methods must be developed to overcome this challenge. We propose a novel activation function based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution from extreme value theory, which improves performance over the traditional sigmoid activation function when one class significantly outweighs the other. We demonstrate the proposed activation function on a publicly available dataset and externally validate on a dataset consisting of 1,909 healthy chest X-rays and 84 COVID-19 X-rays. The proposed method achieves an improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (DeLong's p-value < 0.05) compared to the sigmoid activation. Our method is also demonstrated on a dataset of healthy and pneumonia vs. COVID-19 X-rays and a set of computerized tomography images, achieving improved sensitivity. The proposed GEV activation function significantly improves upon the previously used sigmoid activation for binary classification. This new paradigm is expected to play a significant role in the fight against COVID-19 and other diseases, with relatively few training cases available.","Bridge, Joshua; Meng, Yanda; Zhao, Yitian; Du, Yong; Zhao, Mingfeng; Sun, Renrong; Zheng, Yalin",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,595,33

The use of a TEG or ROTEM system to guide blood product administration has been shown in some surgical settings to reduce transfusion requirements. The aim of this review is to evaluate all published evidence regarding viscoelastic testing in the setting of hepatic surgery. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify randomised controlled trials examining the use of viscoelastic testing for hepatic surgery. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts of studies identified and will independently extract data. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. A meta-analysis will be conducted if feasible. DISCUSSION Viscoelastic devices such as TEG and ROTEM are increasingly available to clinicians as a bedside test. Patients undergoing hepatic surgery have a significant risk of blood loss and coagulopathy requiring transfusion. Theoretical benefits of use of a TEG or ROTEM system in the hepatic surgical setting include a rationalisation of blood products, a reduction in transfusion-related side effects, an improvement in patient outcomes including mortality, and a reduction in cost. This systematic review will summarise the current evidence regarding the use of viscoelastic testing for hepatic surgery.

QuantiFERON Monitor (QFM) is an in vitro diagnostic test that detects interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release in peripheral blood. The aim of our study was to compare QFM testing results in stable kidney transplant recipients and kidney transplant recipients with infection, in a single-centre cohort.We enrolled 71 kidney transplant recipients from our transplantation centre. They were divided into 2 groups according to clinical presentation (Stable kidney transplant recipients or Infection).There were no significant differences in interferon-γ release between the 2 groups (Stable kidney transplant recipients 140.59 ± 215.28 IU/ml, Infection group 78.37 ± 197.03 IU/ml, P = .24). A further analysis revealed that kidney transplant recipients presenting with bacterial infection had significantly lower IFN-γ release when compared to stable kidney transplant recipients (26.52 ± 42.46 IU/ml vs 140.59 ± 215.28 IU/ml, P = .04).Kidney transplant recipients presenting with bacterial infection had lower IFN-γ release when compared to stable kidney transplant recipients. The QFM test may be useful as a tool to help guide immunosuppression dosing in kidney transplant recipients, but further studies are required to confirm its diagnostic value.","Margeta, Ivan; Mareković, Ivana; Pešut, Ana; Zelenika, Marina; Dorotić, Marija; Mrnjec, Ivana; Knotek, Mladen",Medicine,595,1

The goal of this study is to review our institution's experience with totally laparoscopic gastrectomy for the treatment of both early- and advanced-stage gastric cancer. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to examine the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy performed at Monmouth Medical Center between May 2003 and June 2012. We reviewed postoperative complications, surgical margins, number of resected lymph nodes, estimated blood loss, length of stay, narcotic use, and recurrence rate. RESULTS Forty patients were included in the study. There were 21 cases of adenocarcinoma, 15 cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, 2 cases of carcinoid, 1 case of small cell neuroendocrine tumor, and 1 case of squamous cell carcinoma. The mean operative time was 220 minutes (range, 67- 450 minutes). The median length of stay was 6 days (range, 1-37 days). The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 11. Early postoperative complications occurred in 7 patients and included anastomotic stricture, wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, bowel obstruction, and esophageal pneumatosis. There were two deaths. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rate for all cases of adenocarcinoma was 63.2%. CONCLUSIONS Totally laparoscopic gastrectomy is a reasonable option for the treatment of gastric malignancy, with early data showing acceptable survival rates and perioperative outcomes. Large-scale randomized trials are still needed to confirm oncologic equivalency to open gastrectomy in patients with advanced disease.","Theodorous, Arianne N; Train, William W; Goldfarb, Michael A; Borao, Frank J",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,595,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study included 101 children aged between 2 months and 2 years diagnosed with clinical bronchiolitis between September 2011 and April 2012. The demographics and clinical, laboratory, and radiological results of the patients were recorded. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and analyzed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The patients were followed up for at least one year for new episodes, existence of wheezing, frequency of pulmonary infections, and progression of asthma. RESULTS In half of the patients, determinants were indicated through the PCR method, with the most frequent being respiratory syncytial virus (44%). The frequency of bronchiolitis was higher in prematures (p<0.005). There was a relationship between crowded family structure and the existence of wheezing (p=0.003), increased recurrence (p=0.014), and need for inhaler treatment (p=0.014). The frequency was higher in patients living in urban cities (p<0.001), in houses with heating stoves (p=0.001), and in houses with smokers (p=0.001). Patients living in houses with heating stoves had more severe episodes (p=0.018). Recurrent wheezing and the need for regular inhaler usage were positively correlated with high API scores (p=0.008 and p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION Prematurity, exposure to smoking, living in a crowded house with heating stoves, and an urban life are the risk factors for frequent bronchiolitis. The API can be used to predict the recurrence of bronchiolitis.","Atay, Özge; Pekcan, Sevgi; Göktürk, Bahar; Özdemir, Mehmet",Turkish thoracic journal,595,13

If so, the prevalence of asthma in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 should be lower than in the general population. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of asthma in Mexican children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS A public database of the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico was analyzed. Those who underwent the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-SARS-CoV-2 (rtRT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2) test from February 27 to June 21, 2020, were included. In addition to the prevalence of asthma, some factors associated with it were investigated. RESULTS Data from 417,366 subjects were analyzed. Asthma prevalence in children, adults, and global were 3.7%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Although the asthma prevalence was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive over negative patients, significant differences were only found in adults (2.8% vs. 3.7% respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.77); but not in children (3.5% vs. 3.8%, respectively; OR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.76-1.10). Multivariate analysis showed in younger than 18 years that girls and immunosuppression were factors associated with a decrease in the odds to develop asthma. In adults, asthma was positively associated with females, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION The prevalence of asthma in child and adult were lower than those previously reported. Our study seems to support the hypothesis that asthma patients have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to demonstrate the consistency of our findings.","Bedolla-Barajas, Martín; Morales-Romero, Jaime; Bedolla-Pulido, Tonatiuh Ramses; Meza-López, Carlos; Robles-Figueroa, Martín; Pulido-Guillén, Norma Angélica; Orozco-Alatorre, Luis Gustavo; Andrade-Castellanos, Carlos Alberto",Allergologia et immunopathologia,595,20

Although it has been described more than 100 years ago, the literature is limited to small retrospective studies. This study aimed to follow patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that developed PM during hospitalization and describe their clinical and radiological evolution. METHODS A prospective cohort was developed with patients with PM, excluding those with aerodigestive trauma, inside a hospital COVID-19 dedicated hospital. Clinical variables including onset of symptoms, hemodynamic instability, associated complications, the need of interventions, and disease course were all recorded. Also, radiological findings such as the presence of the Macklin effect, extension of lung involvement by COVID-19, and characteristics of the PM were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-one patients with non-traumatic PM were followed, resulting in an overall incidence of 0.5% during the study period. Seven (33%) patients had associated pneumothorax and malignant/tension PM was observed in three (14%) cases. The Macklin effect could be found in 11 patients (52%) and the majority of them had more than 50% of lung involvement due to COVID-19. The mortality rate was 49%; however, no deaths were directly related to the PM. CONCLUSIONS PM incidence is probably increased in the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19, especially in those with greater involvement of the lungs, and the Macklin effect may be an important underlying mechanism of this complication. Usually, PM has a benign course, but complications like tension/malignant PM may occur requiring prompt detection and intervention.","Brito, João; Gregório, Paulo; Mariani, Alessandro; D'ambrosio, Paula; Filho, Mauro; Ferreira, Lorena; Sawamura, Marcio; Pêgo-Fernandes, Paulo",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,595,1

The aim of the present study is to analyse the learning curve for robotic assisted laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS We included in our study 43 consecutive rectal cancer resections (16 females and 27 males) performed from January 2008 through December 2010. Mean age of patients was 66 ± 9.0 years. Surgical procedures included both abdomino-perineal and anterior resections. We analysed the following parameters: demographic data of the patients included in the study, intra- and postoperative data, time taking to set up the robot for operations (set-up or docking time), operative time, intra- and postoperative complications, conversion rates and pathological specimen features. The learning curve was analysed using cumulative sum (CUSUM) methodology. RESULTS The procedures understudied included seven abdomino-perineal resections and 36 anterior resections. In our series of patients, mean robotic set-up time was 62.9 ± 24.6 min, and the mean operative time was 197.4 ± 44.3 min. Once we applied CUSUM methodology, we obtained two graphs for CUSUM values (operating time and success), both of them showing three well-differentiated phases: phase 1 (the initial 9-11 cases), phase 2 (the middle 12 cases) and phase 3 (the remaining 20-22 cases). Phase 1 represents initial learning; phase 2 plateau represents increased competence in the use of the robotic system, and finally, phase 3 represents the period of highest skill or mastery with a reduction in docking time (p = 0.000), but a slight increase in operative time (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION The CUSUM curve shows three phases in the learning and use of robotic assisted rectal cancer surgery which correspond to the phases of initial learning of the technique, consolidation and higher expertise or mastery. The data obtained suggest that the estimated learning curve for robotic assisted rectal cancer surgery is achieved after 21-23 cases.","Jiménez-Rodríguez, Rosa M; Díaz-Pavón, José Manuel; de la Portilla de Juan, Fernando; Prendes-Sillero, Emilio; Dussort, Hisnard Cadet; Padillo, Javier",International journal of colorectal disease,595,16

We performed a review to compare indications and outcomes of EMLP in an early cohort of publications (1990-2008) versus a contemporary cohort (2009-2016) and compare outcomes associated with follow-up ≥2 years versus <2 years. DATA SOURCES PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases. REVIEW METHODS An English-language search of the PubMed and Ovid databases was conducted to identify publications from 1990 to 2016 reporting clinical outcomes of EMLP. Meta-analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis System 9.4. RESULTS A total of 1,205 patients were abstracted from 29 articles with a mean follow-up of 29.1 ± 10.3 months. The overall rate of significant or complete symptom improvement was 86.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 84.2%-88.7%). The overall patency rate was 90.7% (95% CI: 89.1%-92.3%), with a revision rate of 12.6% (95% CI: 10.6%-14.3%). Compared to the early cohort, patients in the contemporary cohort underwent EMLP more often for tumors (P < .001), had higher rates of complete or significant symptom improvement (90.0% vs. 82.6 %, P < .001); and trended toward greater patency rates (92.1% vs. 88.6%, P = .052). Compared to the short-term follow-up cohort, the long-term cohort showed no differences in symptom improvement or patency, but the revision rate was higher (14.5% vs. 9.2%, P = .016). CONCLUSIONS In the last decade, EMLP has been performed more frequently for tumors. Recent studies have demonstrated improved symptom outcomes and a trend toward improved patency rates. The revision rate increased significantly when follow-up exceeded 2 years.

METHODS This cross-sectional study was based on the data from more than 10 million patients in the IMS longitudinal prescription (LRx) database. The outcome of this study was the development in the number of patients receiving cardiovascular or diabetic medications from pharmacies in January, February, and March 2020, compared to January, February, and March 2019. RESULTS From March 2019 to March 2020, there was a 39% increase in angiotensin II antagonist prescriptions, a 33% increase in lipid-lowering drug prescriptions, a 32% increase in calcium channel blocker (CCB) prescriptions, a 30% increase in beta blocker prescriptions, a 27% increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, vitamin k antagonist (VKA), and oral antidiabetic prescriptions, a 24% increase in diuretic prescriptions, and an 18% increase in insulin prescriptions. The largest increase was found in the age group of 18 - 40 years (e.g., 57% for VKA, 52% for CCB and angiotensin II antagonists), and the smallest increase occurred in the age group over 80 years (for example, 10% for VKA, 9% for oral antidiabetics, and 3% for insulins). CONCLUSION The number of patients receiving their drugs from pharmacies was significantly higher in March 2020 than in March 2019, which is an indication of good therapy adherence. Additional studies are needed to examine adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic and possible age differences in adherence.","Kostev, Karel; Kumar, Sachin; Konrad, Marcel; Bohlken, Jens",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,595,7

The preventive measures and self-protecting measures are the suggested and viable solution to mitigate the spread of pandemic till new vaccine is discovered. The preventive measures are framed based on the detailed analysis of the current data of the ongoing pandemic. The correctness of the policies relies on the quality of the data and its analysis with a meaningful interpretation. In this paper, the present status of the epidemic across the world is analyzed using a control measure score which is computed using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) where partition of data is performed using fuzzy c-means clustering. We have used transmission rate and recovery rate independently obtained from the discrete version of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to predict the score. Since the transmission parameters depends on incubation period, recovery and death, the parameter has been calculated based on active cases where its mean value changes significantly. It is observed that the recovery rate is more than the transmission rate of all Gulf countries at present which shows that the outbreak reached its highest value. The current control measure score emphasizes on the normal working atmosphere keeping strict social distancing measures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Varghese, A.; Kolamban, S.; Sherimon, V.; Lacap, E.

Several factors, such as the older and obesity have been reported to be risks of COVID-19 infection, but little is known about the clinical factors limited to patients with T2D. Here, we aimed to identify clinical factors linked to hospitalization with COVID-19 infection in T2D. Research Design and Methods: We used data from Electronic Medical Record (EHR) registered in the Healthjump database provided by the COVID-19 Research Database consortium. Primary outcomes were to determine clinical factors linked to COVID-19 infection-associated hospitalization. Results: Of 4,445 T2D patients with COVID-19, hospitalization occurred in 228 (5.1%). The risk of Covid-19 infection-related hospitalization was higher with ≥65years old (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.63), high in patients with a body-mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 (HR 1.59;95% CI, 1.10-2.31), and Blacks than in Caucasians (HR 1.39;95% CI, 1.04-1.85). The risk was lower in Metformin users (HR 0.56;95% CI, 0.34-1394) and SGLT2inhibitors users (HR 0.45;95% CI, 0.22-0.91). Asians tended to be at increased risk, but there was no significant difference due to the small number of cases (HR 1.88;95% CI, 0.59-5.96). Conclusions: We revealed that the risk of hospitalization may be higher with older, obesity and blacks. Furthermore, we discovered a low risk of hospitalization in patients with treated SGLT2 inhibitors and/or metformin. These findings can help inform patient-centered care decision making for people with T2D at risk for COVID-19.","Horii, Takeshi Ando Wataru Otori Katsuya Atsuda Koichiro",Diabetes,595,1

The authors posit that improved supply chain signals can result in improved handling and distribution of vaccines in a post-COVID world and identify recommendations for redesign of the vaccine supply chain as well as future research questions for scholars.Design/methodology/approachThe supply chain operating reference (SCOR) model is used as a framework to identify each of the major gaps that exist in the supply chain for the COVID vaccine. The critical bottlenecks and delays that exist within this supply chain are identified through this framework and validated through the ongoing research and interviews in the field.FindingsWhilst the vaccine supply chain for influenza is perfectly sized for development and distribution of this cyclical virus, the emergence of a new virus created a pandemic, which has exposed a number of critical shortages. The authors find that the design of the COVID vaccine supply chain suffers from a flawed structure. To date, less than 3% of the United States and global population has been fully vaccinated. The authors advocate a ""back to front design"", beginning with demand planning for actual vaccinations and working backwards toward supply planning and distribution planning. These lessons may be helpful for capacity planning and supply chain strategy for future vaccinations as variants of the COVID vaccine emerge.Originality/valueThe authors provide a unique approach for viewing the current shortages that exist in the vaccine supply chain and offer suggestions for new variants of this supply chain for the future.","Finkenstadt, D.

This pandemic situation forces us, as health care workers, to redefine our medical and surgical actions to adapt them to this new reality. It is important, when the rules of the game change, to rethink and to reevaluate if the balance between risk and benefit have moved to a different point of equilibrium, and if our indications of certain surgical interventions need to be redefined.

To achieve its own replication and spread, it simultaneously depends on and subverts cellular mechanisms. At the early stage of infection, SARS-CoV-2 expresses the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), which inhibits host translation by blocking the mRNA entry tunnel on the ribosome; this interferes with the binding of cellular mRNAs to the ribosome. Viral mRNAs, on the other hand, overcome this blockade. We show that NSP1 enhances expression of mRNAs containing the SARS-CoV-2 leader. The first stem-loop (SL1) in viral leader is both necessary and sufficient for this enhancement mechanism. Our analysis pinpoints specific residues within SL1 (three cytosine residues at the positions 15, 19 and 20) and another within NSP1 (R124) which are required for viral evasion, and thus might present promising drug targets. Additionally, we carried out analysis of a functional interactome of NSP1 using BioID and identified components of anti-viral defense pathways. Our analysis therefore suggests a mechanism by which NSP1 inhibits the expression of host genes while enhancing that of viral RNA. This analysis helps reconcile conflicting reports in the literature regarding the mechanisms by which the virus avoids NSP1 silencing.","Bujanic, Lucija; Shevchuk, Olga; von Kügelgen, Nicolai; Ludwik, Katarzyna; Koppstein, David; Zerna, Nadja; Sickmann, Albert; Chekulaeva, Marina",bioRxiv,595,6

In recent years, China has been emphasizing the integration of innovative entrepreneurship concepts into university curricula. Entrepreneurial education can also contribute to the sustainability of business development. In the context of “mass entrepreneurship and innovation”, entrepreneurial education is important to promote the restructuring of the economic and business model, enhance the development momentum, and follow the innovation-driven development path. However, whether the promotion of entrepreneurial education will lead to entrepreneurial intentions of college students, and thus, specific proposals for the promotion of the entrepreneurial education model remains unclear. Therefore, this study adopted the theory of planned behavior perspective coupled with perceived university support to extend the theory of planned behavior framework and explain the effect of such support on student entrepreneurial intention. The study results revealed that perceived university support significantly affected student attitude toward entrepreneurship, which signaled universities’ critical role in establishing entrepreneurial spirit in students. A significant effect on behavioral control was also observed for perceived university support. Regarding the effects of perceived university support on attitude toward entrepreneurship and behavioral control, the results revealed the effect was far greater on attitude than on behavioral control. Such intention was not directly affected by subjective norms. Therefore, a scientifically rational entrepreneurship course system is critical for effective entrepreneurship education. Overall, encouraging students to engage in the continuous process of entrepreneurship through entrepreneurship courses can concurrently benefit overall economic and social development.","Su, Yushun Zhu Zeren Chen Jingwen Wang Ting Xu Danying",Sustainability,595,1

Such tools generally rely on existing transcriptomic datasets or curated databases of cell type defining genes, while the application of scalable natural language processing (NLP) methods to enhance analysis workflows has not been adequately explored. Here we deployed an NLP framework to objectively quantify associations between a comprehensive set of over 20,000 human protein-coding genes and over 500 cell type terms across over 26 million biomedical documents. The resultant gene-cell type associations (GCAs) are significantly stronger between a curated set of matched cell type-marker pairs than the complementary set of mismatched pairs (Mann Whitney p < 6.15×10−76, r = 0.24; cohen’s D = 2.6). Building on this, we developed an augmented annotation algorithm that leverages GCAs to categorize cell clusters identified in scRNA-seq datasets, and we tested its ability to predict the cellular identity of 185 clusters in 13 datasets from human blood, pancreas, lung, liver, kidney, retina, and placenta. With the optimized settings, the true cellular identity matched the top prediction in 66% of tested clusters and was present among the top five predictions for 94% of clusters. Further, contextualization of differential expression analyses with these GCAs highlights poorly characterized markers of established cell types, such as CLIC6 and DNASE1L3 in retinal pigment epithelial cells and endothelial cells, respectively.

In this study, we used a highly sensitive and specific nucleocapsid-Ag assay to explore the presence of N-Ag in urine during the course of Covid-19, and explore its relationship with the severity of the disease. Material and Methods: Urine and blood samples were collected from 82 patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection proven by PCR and included in the COVIDotheque. We explored the presence of N-Ag in urine and blood using the AAZ N-Ag test, studied the kinetics of the marker according to the time since the onset of symptoms and evaluated the association between N-Ag levels, clinical severity and inflammation. Results: In the first and second weeks of Covid-19, hospitalized patients tested positive for urinary N-Ag (81.25% and 71.79%, respectively) and blood N-Ag (93.75% and 94.87%, respectively). N-Ag levels in urine and blood were moderately correlated with the number of days after the onset of symptoms (r=-0.43, p<0.0001; r=-0.55 p<0.0001, respectively). The follow up of seven SARS-CoV-2 infected patients confirmed the waning of N-Ag in urine and blood over the course of the disease. High urinary N-Ag levels were associated with the absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-IgG (N-IgG), admission in intensive care units, high C-reactive protein levels, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Conclusion: Our study demonstrate that N-Ag is present in the urine of patients hospitalized in the early phase of Covid-19.

The degree of blastogenesis was quantitated by the measurement of the uptake of the [125I]deoxyuridine in the presence of fluorodeoxyuridine. The stimulation indices were consistently higher in the infected birds compared with those in the noninfected controls, and they were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The detection of TCV specific responses indicated that cell-mediated immunity may be important in determining the immunity against turkey coronaviral enteritis.

Three previously undescribed DNA viruses were also detected, a parvovirus and two viruses related to TT virus (TTV). Nucleic acids in human plasma that were distantly related to bacterial sequences or with no detectable similarities to known sequences were also found. Nearly complete viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of a new parvovirus distinct from known human and animal parvoviruses and of two related TTV-like viruses highly divergent from both the TTV and TTV-like minivirus groups. The detection of two previously undescribed viral species in a small group of individuals presenting acute viral syndrome with unknown etiology indicates that a rich yield of new human viruses may be readily identifiable using simple methods of sequence-independent nucleic acid amplification and limited sequencing.","Jones, Morris S; Kapoor, Amit; Lukashov, Vladimir V; Simmonds, Peter; Hecht, Frederick; Delwart, Eric",Journal of virology,595,20

The concept of medical treatment is to prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from rupture and avoid surgical treatment by preventing aneurysm enlargement or even reducing aneurysm size. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are structurally related metalloendopeptidases that can degrade the extracellular matrix and is thought to play important roles in AAA. There are many proposed pharmacological treatments including: β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), statins, macrolides and, doxycycline, an inhibitor of the MMP.

By the 20 January 2021, the cumulative numbers reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 had reached 169,379 including 630 deaths. Malaysia has been hit by three waves of COVID-19. This article reports on the three waves, the current situation and some of the possible factors associated. It outlines the need to reassess the overall situation, re-strategize the approach in order to contain the spread. The first COVID-19 wave lasted from 25 January to 16 February 2020, the second wave occurred between the 27 February 2020 and the 30 June 2020. The current third wave began on 8th September 2020.The sudden surge of cases in the third wave was mainly due to the two largest contributors, namely the Benteng Lahad Datu cluster in Sabah state and Kedah's Tembok cluster. The current situation is critical. The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to soar. The challengers faced by healthcare workers and other front liners is tremendous. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer are the leading cause of death in Malaysia. A paradigm shift in the approach is required to ensure the sustainability of the normal healthcare services provided by the government especially for the lower income groups. There is also a need to expedite the tabling of Tobacco Control Bill in coming parliament session which is long overdue.

Evidence that sensors could be used to develop fever monitoring capabilities would enable large-scale health-monitoring research and provide high-temporal resolution data on fever responses across heterogeneous populations. We launched the TemPredict study in March of 2020 to capture continuous physiological data, including peripheral temperature, from a commercially available wearable device during the novel coronavirus pandemic. We coupled these data with symptom reports and COVID-19 diagnosis data. Here we report findings from the first 50 subjects who reported COVID-19 infections. These cases provide the first evidence that illness-associated elevations in peripheral temperature are observable using wearable devices and correlate with self-reported fever. Our analyses support the hypothesis that wearable sensors can detect illnesses in the absence of symptom recognition. Finally, these data support the hypothesis that prediction of illness onset is possible using continuously generated physiological data collected by wearable sensors. Our findings should encourage further research into the role of wearable sensors in public health efforts aimed at illness detection, and underscore the importance of integrating temperature sensors into commercially available wearables.","Smarr, Benjamin L; Aschbacher, Kirstin; Fisher, Sarah M; Chowdhary, Anoushka; Dilchert, Stephan; Puldon, Karena; Rao, Adam; Hecht, Frederick M; Mason, Ashley E",Sci Rep,595,26

In the setting of pandemic disease, investigations such as arterial blood gases are difficult to obtain on admission. This retrospective study evaluated the ability of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), and national early warning signs (NEWS) scores to predict in-hospital mortality. These scoring systems require limited data and may offer utility with regard to predicting outcomes on admission. METHODS Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were analyzed in 520 patients admitted for COVID-19 between March 20, 2020 and May 5, 2020. SIRS, qSOFA, and NEWS scoring was applied to each patient based on their admission characteristics. Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analyses were completed to assess the predictive accuracy for in-hospital mortality. The need for ICU level of care was evaluated as a secondary composite outcome. Univariate regression analyses were completed to assess the predictive function of each scoring threshold. RESULTS Of 520 patients enrolled, 57.5% were male. Of the cohort, 53.8% were Hispanic, 33.3% were African American, 5.8% were Asian, and 7.3% were Caucasian. Mean age was 61.6 years of age. A total of 182 patients (35%) died in hospital. 179 patients (34.4%) required ICU level of care. NEWS demonstrated the greatest discrimination for in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.716 [95% CI, 0.671-0.762]) and ICU admission (AUC 0.641 [95% CI, 0.591-0.691]). The predictive ability of SIRS criteria was more modest for in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.611 [95% CI, 0.560-0.662]) and ICU admission (AUC 0.571 [95% CI, 0.520-0.622]). qSOFA demonstrated the least discrimination for in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.534 [95% CI, 0.479-0.588]) and ICU admission (AUC 0.545 [95% CI, 0.491-0.599]). A mortality rate of 59.76% was observed in patients with a NEWS score ≥ 5 (OR 3.354 [95% CI, 2.213-5.083]). Likewise, a mortality rate of 56.48% was observed in patients with a SIRS score ≥ 2 (OR 1.77 [95% CI, 1.21-2.59]), while a mortality rate of 30.33% was observed in patients with a qSOFA score ≥ 2 (OR 2.124 [95% CI, 1.442-3.129]). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest NEWS offers the best prognostic accuracy in predicting in-hospital mortality, as compared to qSOFA and SIRS scoring systems.

Historically, the worldwide use of quinoline based-drugs has led to a spectacular reduction in death from malaria. Unfortunately, scientists have been forced to seek alternative drugs to treat malaria due to the emergence of chloroquine-resistant parasites in the 1960s. The repurposing of hydroxychloroquine against viral infections, various types of cancer and autoimmune diseases has been ongoing for more than 70 years, with no clear understanding of its mechanism of action (MOA). Here, we closely examine the MOA of this old but influential drug in and beyond malaria. Better insights into how chloroquine targets the host's cellular and immune responses may help to develop applications against to new pathogens and diseases, and perhaps even restore the clinical utility of chloroquine against malaria.","Coban, Cevayir",Curr Opin Immunol,595,1

We developed a machine-learning-backed system, SmartTriage, which goes beyond conventional symptom checking through a tight bi-directional integration with the electronic medical record (EMR). Conditioned on EMR-derived patient history, our system identifies the patient's chief complaint from a free-text entry and then asks a series of discrete questions to obtain relevant symptomatology. The patient-specific data are used to predict detailed ICD-10-CM codes as well as medication, laboratory, and imaging orders. Patient responses and clinical decision support (CDS) predictions are then inserted back into the EMR. To train the machine learning components of SmartTriage, we employed novel data sets of over 25 million primary care encounters and 1 million patient free-text reason-for-visit entries. These data sets were used to construct: (1) a long short-term memory (LSTM) based patient history representation, (2) a fine-tuned transformer model for chief complaint extraction, (3) a random forest model for question sequencing, and (4) a feed-forward network for CDS predictions. We also present the full production architecture for the pilot deployment of SmartTriage that covers 337 patient chief complaints.","Valmianski, Ilya; Finn, Ian M.; Frost, Nave; Wang, Yang; Liu, Baodong; Zhu, James J.; Karumuri, Sunil; Zisook, Daniel S.",,595,20

We sequenced complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 1659 individuals, including 468 students, representing 20% of cases in students and 25% of total confirmed cases in Washtenaw County over the study interval. Phylogenetic analysis identified over 200 introductions into the student population, most of which were not related to other student cases. There were two prolonged transmission clusters among students that spanned across multiple on-campus residences. However, there were very few genetic descendants of student clusters among non-students during a subsequent November wave of infections in the community.

However, different genetic variants can affect the metabolism of HCQ leading to inter-individual differences in its efficacy. In this study, we investigated the effects of variants in CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 on the risk of Covid-19 infection among patients receiving HCQ for controlling rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A total of 60 patients were genotyped for CYP2D6*2XN, CYP2D6*4, CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*2. They were receiving HCQ for the treatment of RA. The patients were evaluated clinically for fever and dry cough, radiologically via chest computed tomography (CT) and immunologically via anti-Covid-19 IgG and IgM titers. RESULTS: Variants in CYP2D6 significantly affected the grade of ground glass (CYP2D6*4 AA carriers showed the higher risk for grade 3) and the risk of positive anti-Covid-19 IgM (CYP2D6*2XN CC and CYP3A4*1B AA had the lowest risk), the duration of HCQ, the use of corticosteroids or gender did not affect the Covid-19 status significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the outcome of the studied patients receiving HCQ was good (no deaths, no intubation needed). CYP2D6 variants could affect the outcome of Covid-19 infection.","Salem Hareedy, Mohammad; Rashad, Sonya Mohamed; Hetta, Helal F; Hassanien, Sara Mahmoud; Abdellatif, Hebatallah; Hassanien, Manal",Drug Metab.

Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate to consider a sixth challenge, notably, training teachers capable of delivering mathematical distance learning courses focused on students' conceptual understanding. It therefore is necessary to link the stakes of initial training with that of distance learning, which can enhance conceptual understanding. Linking the need to construct knowledge among students with technological tools used for distance learning allows new challenges faced in the planning of mathematics teaching to be highlighted. These new challenges give rise to the anticipation genesis that helps in situating the planning of mathematics teaching between three variables: artifact variables, arrangement variables, and variables related to the nature of the data to be used. These variables are a major asset for the training of the preservice mathematics teacher. Their study in this article allows us to recognize that the choice of technological tools to be used in mathematics distance learning depends greatly on the conceptual analysis of the mathematical knowledge to be taught. This study shows that it is important to rethink and question distance learning for each mathematical concept.","Nongni, G.",International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning,595,24

Human consciousness and decision-making capabilities are negatively influenced by manipulated, fabricated, biased or unverified news posts. Therefore, there is a high demand for designing veracity analysis systems to detect fake information contents in multiple data modalities. In an attempt to find a sophisticated solution to this critical issue, we proposed an architecture to consider both the textual and visual attributes of the data. After the data pre-processing is done, text and image features are extracted from the training data using separate deep learning models. Feature extraction from text is done using BERT and ALBERT language models that leverage the benefits of bidirectional training of transformers using a deep self-attention mechanism. The Inception-ResNet-v2 deep neural network model is employed for image data to perform the task. The proposed framework focused on two independent multi-modal fusion architectures of BERT and Inception-ResNet-v2 as well as ALBERT and Inception-ResNet-v2. Multi-modal fusion of textual and visual branches is extensively experimented and analysed using concatenation of feature vectors and weighted averaging of probabilities named as Early Fusion and Late Fusion respectively.

Besides, infectious persons with and without symptoms can be distinguished. Due to the current world-wide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19 pandemic) models for description of the spread of infectious diseases and their application for forecasts have become into the focus of the scientific community as well as of broad public more than usual. Currently, many papers and studies have appeared and appear dealing with the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease caused by it. This occurs under medical, virological, economic, sociological and further aspects as well as under mathematical points of view. Concerning the last-mentioned point, the main focus lies on the application of existing models and their adaptation to data about the course of infection available at the current time. Clearly, the aim is to predict the possible further development, for instance in Germany. It is of particular interest to investigate how will be the influence of political and administrative measures like contact restrictions, closing or rather re-opening of schools, restaurants, hotels etc. on the course of infection. The steps considered here for building up suitable models are well-known for long time. However, understandably they will not be dealt with in an extended way in current application-oriented works. Therefore, it is the aim of this study to present some existing steps of modelling without any pretension of completeness. Thus, on the one hand we give assistance and, on the other hand, we develop a model capable to take already known properties of COVID-19 as well as a later possible passive immunisation by vaccination and a possible loss of immunity of recovered persons into account.","Wolff, Michael",Z Angew Math Mech,595,0

We will describe how the Infectious Diseases Society of America has leveraged digital strategy and social media and how individuals can amplify these resources to disseminate information, provide clinical knowledge, community guidance, and build their own person brand. We conclude in providing guidance to infectious diseases specialists in aiming to build and preserve public trust, consider their audience and specific goals, and use social media to highlight the value of the field of infectious diseases.","Marcelin, J.

In pregnancy the dangers to the mother and fetus are still being explored. SARS-CoV2 can potentially compromise maternal and neonatal outcomes and this may be dependent on the pregnancy stage during which the infection occurs. OBJECTIVE: The present study was done to find the histopathological alterations in the placenta of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnancies with either no symptoms or mild coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 related symptoms and its association with neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective analytical study. Twenty seven asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy delivered between 1st July 2020 and 15th September 2020, were included as cases. An equal number of SARS-CoV-2 negative singleton pregnancies matched for maternal and gestational age during the same period were included as controls. After delivery the histopathological examination of the placenta of these women was done and the findings recorded on a predesigned proforma based on the Amsterdam consensus criteria for evidence of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion changes. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were comparable between the cases and controls. The following features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) were significantly higher in the placentae of COVID-19 positive pregnancies: retroplacental hematomas (RPH), accelerated villous maturation (AVM), distal villous hyperplasia (DVH), atherosis, fibrinoid necrosis, mural hypertrophy of membrane arterioles (MHMA), vessel ectasia and persistence of intramural endovascular trophoblast (PIEVT). Fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM) significantly associated with the positive pregnancies were chorioangiosis, thrombosis of the fetal chorionic plate (TFCP), intramural fibrin deposition (IMFD) and vascular ectasia. Additionally, perivillous fibrin deposition was also significantly higher in the placentae of cases. The percentage of spontaneously delivered women was comparable in the two groups. The sex and weight of the newborn and the number of live births were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women, with otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies, show evidence of placental injury at a microscopic level. Similar findings have been demonstrated in other studies too. This placental injury apparently does not lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. The extent of this injury in symptomatic cases of COVID-19 pregnancies and its consequences on the outcomes need to be analysed.","Jaiswal, Nishtha; Puri, Manju; Agarwal, Kiran; Singh, Smita; Yadav, Reena; Tiwary, Narendra; Tayal, Prerna; Vats, Barkha",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,595,29

The development of automated methods for quantifying COVID-19 abnormalities in these CT images is invaluable to clinicians. The hallmark of COVID-19 in chest CT images is the presence of ground-glass opacities in the lung region, which are tedious to segment manually. We propose anamorphic depth embedding-based lightweight CNN, called Anam-Net, to segment anomalies in COVID-19 chest CT images. The proposed Anam-Net has 7.8 times fewer parameters compared to the state-of-the-art UNet (or its variants), making it lightweight capable of providing inferences in mobile or resource constraint (point-of-care) platforms. The results from chest CT images (test cases) across different experiments showed that the proposed method could provide good Dice similarity scores for abnormal and normal regions in the lung. We have benchmarked Anam-Net with other state-of-the-art architectures, such as ENet, LEDNet, UNet++, SegNet, Attention UNet, and DeepLabV3+. The proposed Anam-Net was also deployed on embedded systems, such as Raspberry Pi 4, NVIDIA Jetson Xavier, and mobile-based Android application (CovSeg) embedded with Anam-Net to demonstrate its suitability for point-of-care platforms.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in high- and low-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: This was a multinational retrospective cohort study involving women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from 76 centers from 25 countries in Europe, the United States, South America, Asia, and Australia from April 4, 2020, to October 28, 2020. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity, including admission to the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of adverse perinatal outcome, including miscarriage, fetal loss, neonatal and perinatal death, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. All outcomes were assessed in high- and low-risk pregnancies. Pregnancies were considered high risk in case of either preexisting chronic medical conditions in pregnancy or obstetrical disorders occurring in pregnancy. The Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 887 singleton pregnancies who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were included in the study. The risk of composite adverse maternal outcomes was higher in high-risk pregnancies than in low-risk pregnancies (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.24; P=.035). In addition, women carrying high-risk pregnancies were at higher risk of hospital admission (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.04; P=.002), presence of severe respiratory symptoms (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-3.21; P=.001), admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-4.88), and invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.94; P=.002). When exploring perinatal outcomes, high-risk pregnancies were at high risk of adverse perinatal outcomes (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-2.72; P=.009). However, such association was mainly because of the higher incidence of miscarriage in high-risk pregnancies compared with that in low-risk pregnancies (5.3% vs 1.6%, P=.008); furthermore, there was no difference in other explored outcomes between the 2 study groups. At logistic regression analysis, maternal age (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.22; P=.023) and high-risk pregnancy (odds ratio, 4.21; 95% confidence interval, 3.90-5.11; P<.001) were independently associated with adverse maternal outcomes. CONCLUSION: High-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were at higher risk of adverse maternal outcomes than low-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.","D039,; Antonio, Francesco; Sen, Cihat; Mascio, Daniele Di; Galindo, Alberto; Villalain, Cecilia; Herraiz, Ignacio; Arisoy, Resul; Ovayolu, Ali; Eroglu, Hasan; Canales, Manuel Guerra; Ladella, Subhashini; Cojocaru, Liviu; Turan, Ozhan; Turan, Sifa; Hadar, Eran; Brzezinski-Sinai, Noa A; Dollinger, Sarah; Uyaniklar, Ozlem; Ocakouglu, Sakine Rahimli; Atak, Zeliha; Premru-Srsen, Tanja; Kornhauser-Cerar, Lilijana; Druskovic, Mirjam; Ples, Liana; Gündüz, Reyhan; Agaçayak, Elif; Schvartzman, Javier Alfonso; Malbran, Mercedes Negri; Liberati, Marco; Sebastiano, Francesca Di; Oronzi, Ludovica; Cerra, Chiara; Buca, Danilo; Cagnacci, Angelo; Ramone, Arianna; Barra, Fabio; Carosso, Andrea; Benedetto, Chiara; Cosma, Stefano; Pintiaux, Axelle; Daelemans, Caroline; Costa, Elena; Özel, Aysegül; Muhçu, Murat; Lopez, Jesús S Jimenez; Alvarado, Clara; Piqueras, Anna Luengo; Oliva, Dolores Esteban; Schera, Giovanni Battista Luca; Volpe, Nicola",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,595,30

Mathematical modelling was established in infectious diseases over a century ago, with the seminal works of Ross and others. Propelled by the discovery of etiological agents for infectious diseases, and Koch's postulates, models have focused on the complexities of pathogen transmission and evolution to understand and predict disease trends in greater depth. This has led to their adoption by policy makers; however, as model-informed policies are being implemented, the inaccuracies of some predictions are increasingly apparent, most notably their tendency to overestimate the impact of control interventions. Here, we discuss how these discrepancies could be explained by methodological limitations in capturing the effects of heterogeneity in real-world systems.

Proton pump inhibitors have shown antiviral potencies in various in vivo and in vitro studies. Some of the major possible ways through which they can act against SARS-CoV-2 are by exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, via vacuolar ATPase pumps leading to raised endolysosomal pH and by targeting endosomal complexes. The current pandemic has put forward a challenge to find treatment options. Although the potential roles of proton pump inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 have been discussed in recent publications, the clinical evidences for their real-world effectiveness do not point towards a beneficial effect clearly yet.

Using this description, we compute the holomorphic and non-minimal twists at the perturbative level. This calculation hinges on the existence of an $L_\infty$ action of the supersymmetry algebra on the abelian tensor multiplet, which we describe in detail. Our formulation appears naturally in the pure spinor superfield formalism, but understanding it requires developing a presymplectic generalization of the BV formalism, inspired by Dirac's theory of constraints. The holomorphic twist consists of symplectic-valued holomorphic bosons from the $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ hypermultiplet, together with a degenerate holomorphic theory of holomorphic coclosed one-forms from the $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ tensor multiplet, which can be interpreted as representing the intermediate Jacobian. We check that our formulation and our results match with known ones under various dimensional reductions, as well as comparing the holomorphic twist to Kodaira-Spencer theory.

The attitude towards performing surgery is influenced by the pandemic. Setting special recommendations for safe cardiothoracic surgery is of extreme importance. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional survey that included 77 Egyptian cardiothoracic surgeons. The survey consisted of a self-administered constructed questionnaire with six sections, and was delivered as a Google Forms questionnaire (https://www.google.com/forms/about) that was sent to individuals via social networks and email. RESULTS: More than 80% of Egyptian cardiothoracic surgeons believe they and their patients are at risk. Out of all participants, none had actually been infected with COVID-19 but 26% had encountered a positive COVID-19 person in their surgical team. Although 51% were testing patients before surgery, they reported 9 confirmed cases postoperatively. Computed tomography was the most recommended investigation prior to surgery (by 69%). Most had postponed elective surgeries and only one-third of all surgeons recommended performing elective surgeries cautiously with pretesting for COVID-19 and maximizing protective measures, while more than 40% recommended not performing high-risk elective surgeries. CONCLUSION: We are committed to the safety of our patients, ourselves, our staff, and our families. Planning for the new phase of reopening, whether total reopening or step-by-step reopening, should carefully consider how we should utilize our resources, respect social distancing, and prevent exposure to untested patients or health workers who might turn out to be an undetected positive case.","Bakry, Ahmed Ma; Sobhy, Ehab; Abdelmohty, Hysam",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,595,1

COVID-19 appeared in China in late 2019 and quickly spread to other countries. Factors inherent to dental practice, such as proximity to the patient, transmission through saliva and breath, and the generation of aerosols during procedures, place the dental team at the top of the list among the most vulnerable healthcare providers. Health authorities initially recommended only maintaining urgent and emergency care and suspending elective dental procedures. Currently, elective care is gradually being resumed and requires numerous adjustments to the environment and professional routine in terms of biosafety. Several methods had been recommended to prevent the spread of other infectious diseases prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. However, further modifications are needed for the waiting room, patient screening and flow, procedures, garments, and even in dental office itself. Thus, dental professionals need to be prepared to adopt the new recommendations in order to reduce the chance of disease transmission.","SILVEIRA, Manuela Gonçalves de Souza e Silva; FERNANDEZ, Matheus dos Santos; TILLMANN, Thais Freitas Formozo; DANIGNO, Júlia Freire; ECHEVERRIA, Mariana Silveira; SILVA, Alexandre Emidio Ribeiro",RGO (Porto Alegre),595,18

We construct new measures of the income distribution and poverty with a lag of only a few weeks using high-frequency data from the Basic Monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), which collects income information for a large, representative sample of US families. Because the family income data for this project are rarely used, we validate this timely measure of income by comparing historical estimates that rely on these data to estimates from data on income and consumption that have been used much more broadly. Our results indicate that at the start of the pandemic, government policy effectively countered its effects on incomes, leading poverty to fall and low percentiles of income to rise across a range of demographic groups and geographies. Simulations that rely on the detailed CPS data and that closely match total government payments made show that the entire decline in poverty that we find can be accounted for by the rise in government assistance, including unemployment insurance benefits and the Economic Impact Payments. Our simulations further indicate that of those losing employment the vast majority received unemployment insurance,though this was less true early on in the pandemic, and receipt was uneven across the states, with some states not reaching a large share of their out of work residents.

It is thought that surfactant, which is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for intratracheal administration to treat neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in pre-term infants, could benefit COVID-19-infected individuals by: (1) restoring surfactant damaged by lung infection and/or decreased due to the virus-induced death of the type II pneumocytes that produce it and (2) reducing surface tension to decrease the work of breathing and limit pulmonary edema. In addition, a constituent of surfactant, phosphatidylglycerol, could mitigate COVID-19-induced lung pathology by: (3) decreasing excessive innate immune system stimulation via its inhibition of toll-like receptor-2 and -4 activation by microbial components and cellular proteins released by damaged cells, thereby limiting inflammation and the resultant pulmonary edema, and (4) possibly blocking spread of the viral infection to non-infected cells in the lung. Therefore, it is suggested that surfactant preparations containing phosphatidylglycerol be tested for their ability to improve lung function in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Bollag, Wendy B.; Gonzales, Joyce N.",Med.

A Computational Biophysical Study,8.768162,9.365121,2020,"PURPOSE: The described work aimed to avoid cancellations of indispensable treatments by implementing active patient flow management practices and optimizing infrastructure utilization in the radiation oncology department of a large university hospital and regional COVID-19 treatment center close to the first German SARS-CoV­2 hotspot region Heinsberg in order to prevent nosocomial infections in patients and personnel during the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised year-to-date intervention analyses of in- and outpatient key procedures, machine occupancy, and no-show rates in calendar weeks 12 to 19 of 2019 and 2020 to evaluate effects of active patient flow management while monitoring nosocomial COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: Active patient flow management helped to maintain first-visit appointment compliance above 85.5%. A slight appointment reduction of 10.3% daily (pâ¯= 0.004) could still significantly increase downstream planning CT scheduling (pâ¯= 0.00001) and performance (pâ¯= 0.0001), resulting in an absolute 20.1% (pâ¯= 0.009) increment of CT performance while avoiding overbooking practices. Daily treatment start was significantly increased by an absolute value of 18.5% (pâ¯= 0.026). Hypofractionation and acceleration were significantly increased (pâ¯= 0.0043). Integrating strict testing guidelines, a distancing regimen for staff and patients, hygiene regulations, and precise appointment scheduling, no SARS-CoV­2 infection in 164 tested radiation oncology service inpatients was observed. CONCLUSION: In times of reduced medical infrastructure capacities and resources, controlling infrastructural time per patient as well as optimizing facility utilization and personnel workload during treatment evaluation, planning, and irradiation can help to improve appointment compliance and quality management. Avoiding recurrent and preventable exposure to healthcare infrastructure has potential health benefits and might avert cross infections during the pandemic. Active patient flow management in high-risk COVID-19 regions can help Radiation Oncologists to continue and initiate treatments safely, instead of cancelling and deferring indicated therapies.","Akuamoa-Boateng, Dennis; Wegen, Simone; Ferdinandus, Justin; Marksteder, Regina; Baues, Christian; Marnitz, Simone",Strahlenther Onkol,595,1

AIMS: To describe how to rapidly convert general wards to intensive care units for critically ill patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comprehensive assessment and analysis of available resources and standard requirements. RESULTS: The ICUs were successfully assembled in 4 days. The conversion included environment reconstruction, configuration and management of equipment, information system construction and human resource allocation. A total of 172 critically ill patients had been admitted to the contemporary ICUs and none medical staff was infected. DISCUSSION: The epidemic situation of COVID-19 poses a great challenge to various management departments of the hospital, especially for critically ill patients with a high mortality rate. To save more critically ill patients, the conversion of a general ward to a quarantine ICU ward must be completed in a short time, and the optimal allocation of resources must be appropriate to ensure that the medical team works effectively and is of high quality. In face of the overloaded medical system, the ideal non-negative pressure ward is hard to achieve. However, we have demonstrated with evidence that our conversions are effective in both providing care to critical patients and protecting the safety of our staff. CONCLUSION: The conversion is successful and the running experience would be a reference for hospitals in other areas nationally or globally.","Xiong, Jie; Hu, Luhong; Huang, Sufang; Li, Zhaoxia; Guo, Chunling; Deng, Juan; He, Mei",Int J Clin Pract,595,16

A detailed disease model of COVID-19 is combined with a model of the US economy to estimate the direct impact of labor supply shock to each sector arising from morbidity, mortality, and lock down, as well as the indirect impact caused by the interdependencies between sectors. During a lockdown, estimates of jobs that are workable from home in each sector are used to modify the shock to labor supply. Results show trade-offs between economic losses, and lives saved and infections averted are non-linear in compliance to social distancing and the duration of lockdown. Sectors that are worst hit are not the labor-intensive sectors such as Agriculture and Construction, but the ones with high valued jobs such as Professional Services, even after the teleworkability of jobs is accounted for. Additionally, the findings show that a low compliance to interventions can be overcome by a longer shutdown period and vice versa to arrive at similar epidemiological impact but their net effect on economic loss depends on the interplay between the marginal gains from averting infections and deaths, versus the marginal loss from having healthy workers stay at home during the shutdown.","Chen, Jiangzhuo; Vullikanti, Anil; Santos, Joost; Venkatramanan, Srinivasan; Hoops, Stefan; Mortveit, Henning; Lewis, Bryan; You, Wen; Eubank, Stephen; Marathe, Madhav; Barrett, Chris; Marathe, Achla",,595,26

The objective of the systematic review was to investigate the rate of ICU admission, mortality, morbidity, and complications among patients with coronavirus. METHODS: A comprehensive strategy was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct and LILACS from December 2002 to May 2020 without language restriction. The Heterogeneity among the included studies was checked with forest plot, &#967;2 test, I2 test, and the p-values. All observational studies reporting rate of ICU admission, the prevalence of mortality and its determinants among ICU admitted patients with coronavirus were included and the rest were excluded. RESULT: A total of 646 articles were identified from different databases and 50 articles were selected for evaluation. Thirty-seven Articles with 24983 participants were included. The rate of ICU admission was 32% (95% CI: 26 to 38, 37 studies and 32, 741 participants). The Meta-Analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease in ICU was 39% (95% CI: 34 to 43, 37 studies and 24, 983 participants). CONCLUSION: The Meta-Analysis revealed that approximately one-third of patients admitted to ICU with severe Coronavirus disease and more than thirty percent of patients admitted to ICU with a severe form of COVID-19 for better care died which warns the health care stakeholders to give attention to intensive care patients. REGISTRATION: This Systematic review and Meta-Analysis was registered in Prospero international prospective register of systemic reviews (CRD42020177095) on April 9/2020.","Abate, Semagn Mekonnen; Ahmed Ali, Siraj; Mantfardo, Bahiru; Basu, Bivash",PLoS One,595,20

The Self-Testing Africa (STAR) Initiative aims to scale up HIVST among priority and undertested populations. HIVST has the potential to help maintain testing services during the social distancing restrictions implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This project evaluates linkage to confirmatory testing and treatment for HIV-positive clients for the STAR South Africa site. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This secondary data analysis protocol aims to evaluate different HIVST distribution models from a prospective study implemented during November 2017 and December 2020 by Ezintsha, a subdivision of Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute. Routinely collected distribution and self-reported HIVST outcomes data will be deidentified and analysed. The main outcomes of interest are linkage to care and treatment among HIVST users who report a reactive HIVST result. Additionally, we plan to determine sociodemographic factors associated with linkage to care and treatment among HIVST users. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the variables of interest, and modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimation will be performed to identify factors associated with linkage to care and treatment among HIVST users who report a reactive HIVST result. Risk ratios and 95% CIs for the risk ratios will be reported. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the University of Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee. The dissemination plan for the study findings will include presentations to local and international health authorities, international conferences and publications in open access journals.","Majam, Mohammed; Conserve, Donaldson F; Zishiri, Vincent; Haile, Zelalem T; Tembo, Angela; Phiri, Jane; Hatzold, Karin; Johnson, Cheryl C; Venter, Francois",BMJ Open,595,16

METHODS: An online well-structured and validated faculty self-perceived competency questionnaire was used to collect responses from medical faculty. The questionnaire consisted of four purposely build sections on competence in student engagement, instructional strategy, technical communication and time management. The responses were recorded using a Likert ordinal scale (1-9). The Questionnaire was uploaded at www.surveys.google.com and the link was distributed through social media outlets and e-mails. Descriptive statistics and Independent paired t-test were used for analysis and comparison of quantitative and qualitative variables. A p-value of &#8804;0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 738 responses were assessed. Nearly 54% (397) participants had less than 5 years of teaching experience, 24.7% (182) had 6-10 years and 11.7% (86) had 11-15 years teaching expertise. 75.6% (558) respondents have delivered online lectures during the pandemic. Asynchronous methods were used by 61% (450) and synchronous by 39% (288) of participants. Moreover, 22.4% (165) participants revealed that their online lectures were evaluated by a structured feedback from experts, while 38.3% participants chose that their lectures were not evaluated. A significant difference (pâ<â0.01) was found between FSPC scores and online teaching evaluation by experts. The mean score of FSPC scale was 5.62±1.15. The mean score for student's engagement, instructional strategies, technical communication and time management were of 5.18±1.60, 5.67±1.61, 5.49±1.71 and 6.12±1.67 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Medical faculty members were found somewhat competent in E-teaching for student engagement, instructional strategy, technical communication and time management skills. Faculty receiving feedback was more competent in comparison to peers teaching without feedback.","Sarfaraz, Shaur; Ahmed, Naseer; Abbasi, Maria S; Sajjad, Batool; Vohra, Fahim; Al-Hamdan, Rana S; Maawadh, Ahmed A; Al-Hamoudi, Nawwaf; Mokeem, Sameer A; Aldahiyan, Nada; Abduljabbar, Tariq",Work,595,1

The COVID-19 outbreak is considered a pandemic and has created a number of challenges for the general population, patients, and healthcare professionals. Lockdowns have been implemented to slow down the spread of the virus with the expectation that these restrictions will limit the number of cases, and hence the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. However, these restrictions, and in particular lockdowns, impact on the life of everyone living in Ireland. AIM: To record how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictive measures impacted on people's activities, work, schooling, and childcare. METHODS: The Corona Citizens' Science Project was set up as a population-wide survey. A questionnaire was designed, and the survey was first launched on the 8th of April 2020. An overview of results was released in the press days later. Data was collected in four waves: April 8, April 22, May 6, and June 17, 2020. Each wave had core questions allowing to compare each wave, and wave-specific questions, to understand current impact of changing measures. RESULTS: Over four waves, 152,259 responses were collected. The mean age of respondents was 47 with about 10% over the age of 65. Around 75% were female and 85% had a higher degree. Nearly 70% of the respondents were in employment, and around 13% were retired. Up to 20% of the respondents were essential workers, and 10% of respondents indicated they were in receipt of the COVID-19 pandemic unemployment payment. Around 10% of the people who responded were living alone. The number of people talked to the previous day was on average 2.3 in the first survey; during the lockdown, this went up over time, and in the last survey, the mean was 3.9. The percentage of respondents who did not talk to anyone the previous day decreased from 40 to 22% over the waves. In the first wave, about 6% of respondents reported having had flu-like symptoms in the last 14 days, which declined to 3.3%, 2.5%, and 2.0% in waves 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Similarly, over the four waves, the respondents who indicated that someone they lived with had flu-like symptoms declined from 17 to 12%, 9%, and 11%. Throughout the four waves, nearly one third of people reported one or more underlying conditions. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of restrictive measures, in particular lockdown, were implemented in Ireland to protect populations and healthcare systems. To record some of the major impacts on society, we launched a Corona Citizens Science Project, with the aim to support decision-making. This report provides detail of its findings.","Vellinga, Akke; Mellotte, Marc; Mealy, P J; Staines, Anthony; O039,; Connor, Paul; Brychkova, Galina; d039,; Aquin, Mathieu",Ir. j. med. sci,595,30

People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth increases the severity of respiratory viral infections. Hyperoxia at birth increases the severity of influenza A virus infections in adult mice by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Since AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), their expression should decline as AT2 cells are depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, ACE2 was detected in airway Club cells and endothelial cells at birth, and then AT2 cells at one year of age. Neonatal hyperoxia stimulated expression of ACE2 in Club cells and in AT2 cells by 2 months of age. It also stimulated expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung. Increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was blocked by mitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial superoxide scavenger that reduced oxidative stress and DNA damage seen in oxygen-exposed mice. Our finding that hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in mice helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities.","Yee, Min; David Cohen, E; Haak, Jeannie; Dylag, Andrew M; O039,; Reilly, Michael A",Sci Rep,595,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 9 different institutions. The primary endpoint was to assess the prevalence of adapted patient care during the pandemic for elderly cancer patients. The secondary endpoint was to assess the incidence of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19. All patients were older than 65years of age. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 332 outpatients' case files between 9th of March and 30th of April 2020. The median age was 75years (range: 65-101) and 53% were male. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of the outpatients received modified patient care, defined as postponement or cancellation of surgery, irradiation scheme adapted, systemic treatment or the use of telemedicine. Among patients with localized cancer, 60% had a change in management strategy due to the pandemic. Changes in management strategy were made for 53% of patients at the metastatic stage. GCSF was used , in 83% of patients, increasing considerably in the context of the pandemic. Sixty-nine percent of physicians used telemedicine. In the final analysis, only one patient was hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. No deaths due to COVID-19 were reported in elderly cancer patients during this time period. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to assess modification of patient care in elderly cancer outpatients during an epidemic. With this unprecedented crisis, our objective is to protect our patients from infection via protective barrier measures and social distancing, but also to guarantee the continuity of cancer care without overexposing this fragile population. Physicians were able to adapt their practice and used new forms of management, like telemedicine.","Helissey, Carole; Ghebriou, Djamel; Cessot, Anatole; Boudin, Laurys; Prieux, Caroline; Romeo, Emilie; Schernberg, Anotine; Grellier, Noémie; Joly, Charlotte; Bauduceau, Olivier; Thibault, Constance; Mamou, Elodie; Raynal, Gauthier; Serey Eiffel, Sophie; Le Floch, Hervé; Ricard, Damien; Brureau, Laurent",Bull. cancer,595,20

METHODS: We developed a model to determine the number of N95 respirators needed for HCWs both in a single acute-care hospital and the United States. RESULTS: For an acute-care hospital with 400 all-cause monthly admissions, the number of N95 respirators needed to manage COVID-19 patients admitted during a month ranges from 113 (95% interpercentile range [IPR], 50-229) if 0.5% of admissions are COVID-19 patients to 22,101 (95% IPR, 5,904-25,881) if 100% of admissions are COVID-19 patients (assuming single use per respirator, and 10 encounters between HCWs and each COVID-19 patient per day). The number of N95s needed decreases to a range of 22 (95% IPR, 10-43) to 4,445 (95% IPR, 1,975-8,684) if each N95 is used for 5 patient encounters. Varying monthly all-cause admissions to 2,000 requires 6,645-13,404 respirators with a 60% COVID-19 admission prevalence, 10 HCW-patient encounters, and reusing N95s 5-10 times. Nationally, the number of N95 respirators needed over the course of the pandemic ranges from 86 million (95% IPR, 37.1-200.6 million) to 1.6 billion (95% IPR, 0.7-3.6 billion) as 5%-90% of the population is exposed (single-use). This number ranges from 17.4 million (95% IPR, 7.3-41 million) to 312.3 million (95% IPR, 131.5-737.3 million) using each respirator for 5 encounters.

Due to the mutations, the virus evolves at a rapid pace that helps them to survive better inside the host. One of the hotspots of pharmacological interventions is to inhibit binding of virus with the host cells, which is mediated by Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors present on the human cells. This study was conducted with an aim to identify and characterise the mutation (s) present in the Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Towards this, an in silico methodology was used, and the mutations on Spike glycoprotein were identified by comparing the Spike glycoprotein of first reported sequence from Wuhan wet seafood market virus with the available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates. Our analysis revealed the presence of twenty-five mutations in Spike glycoprotein among Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. These mutations spread all over the protein and can be clustered at least into four distinct positions. Further, mutations at eleven positions exhibited alterations in the secondary structure of the polypeptide chain. We also investigated the influence of these mutations on overall protein dynamics and have shown that they affect the dynamic stability of the Spike glycoprotein.","Chand, Gyanendra Bahadur; Banerjee, Atanu; Azad, Gajendra Kumar",Gene Rep,595,29

For bacteriologists, the proteome of bacteria is much less complex than that of eukaryotic organisms. However, not all the different cell ""compartments"" are easily accessible, and the analysis of cell envelope proteins is particularly challenging. For the Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, one of the main foodborne pathogen microorganisms, the study of surface proteins is crucial to better understand the mechanisms of pathogenicity, as well as adaptation/resistance to and persistence in hostile environments. The evolution of proteomic techniques, and particularly the possibility of separating and analyzing complex protein samples by off-gel (LC-MS/MS) versus in-gel (two-dimensional electrophoresis) approach, has opened the doors to new extraction and preparation methods to target the different subproteomes. Here, we describe three procedures to prepare and analyze intracellular, exocellular, and cell surface proteins: (1) the cell fractionation, based on cell broken and separation of protein subfractions by differential centrifugation; (2) the biotinylation, based on the labeling of cell surface proteins and their selective extraction; and (3) the enzymatic shaving by the action of trypsin on intact cells. These complementary methods allow to encompass all L. monocytogenes subproteomes for general profiling or target studies and could be applicable to other Gram-positive bacteria.","Santos, Tiago; Hébraud, Michel",Methods Mol Biol,595,1

We present here a complete generative model that describes how confidence judgments result from some confidence evidence. The model that generates confidence evidence has two main parameters, confidence noise and confidence boost. Confidence noise reduces the sensitivity to the confidence evidence, and confidence boost accounts for information used for confidence judgment which was not used for the perceptual decision. The opposite effect of these two parameters creates a problem of confidence parameters indeterminacy, where the confidence in a perceptual decision is the same in spite of differences in confidence noise and confidence boost. When confidence is estimated for multiple stimulus strengths, both of these parameters can be recovered, thus allowing us to estimate whether confidence is generated using the same primary information that was used for the perceptual decision or some secondary information. We also describe a novel measure of confidence efficiency relative to the ideal confidence observer, as well as the estimate of one type of confidence bias. Finally, we apply the model to the confidence forced-choice paradigm, a paradigm that provides objective estimates of confidence, and we discuss how each parameter of the model can be recovered using this paradigm.

However, this may be related to the lower variability and hence narrower normative limits of structural tests. In this study, we ask whether a time lag exists between the true rates of change in structure and function, regardless of clinical detectability of those changes. Methods: Structural equation models were used to determine whether the rate of change in function (mean linearized total deviation, AveTDLin) or structure (retinal nerve fiber layer thickness [RNFLT]) was predicted by the concurrent or previous rate for the other modality, after adjusting for its own rate in the previous time interval. Rates were calculated over 1135 pairs of consecutive visits from 318 eyes of 164 participants in the Portland Progression Project, with mean 207 days between visits. Results: The rate of change of AveTDLin was predicted by its own rate in the previous time interval, but not by rates of RNFLT change in either the concurrent or previous time interval (both P > 0.05). Similarly, the rate of RNFLT change was not predicted by concurrent AveTDLin change after adjusting for its own previous rate. However, the rate of AveTDLin change in the previous time interval did significantly improve prediction of the current rate for RNFLT, with P = 0.005, suggesting a time lag of around six months between changes in AveTDLin and RNFLT. Conclusions: Although RNFL thinning may be detectable sooner, true functional change appears to predict and precede thinning of the RNFL in glaucoma.","Gardiner, Stuart K; Mansberger, Steven L; Fortune, Brad",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,595,20

METHODS: A systematic literature search was undertaken in April 2020. In four teams of three reviewers each, all abstracts were independently reviewed for inclusion by two reviewers. Using a pre-defined checklist of 93 criteria for each publication, data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers and subsequently compared and discussed. If necessary, a third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. The search was updated in February 2021 to retrieve new publications on HRQoL issues including issues related to the long-term consequences of COVID-19. RESULTS: The search in April 2020 identified 3342 potentially relevant publications, and 339 publications were selected for full-text review and data extraction. We identified 75 distinct symptoms and other HRQoL issues categorized into 12 thematic areas; from general symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and fatigue, to neurological and psychological issues. The updated search revealed three extra issues experienced during active disease and long-term problems with fatigue, psychological issues and impaired cognitive function. CONCLUSION: This first comprehensive systematic review provides a detailed overview of the wide range of HRQoL issues experienced by patients with COVID-19 throughout the course of the disease. It demonstrates the devastating impact of the disease and provides critically important information for clinicians, to enable them to better recognize the disease and to provide knowledge important for treatment and follow-up.

In this topical review, we propose a conceptual model of multidomain pain resilience (MDPR) in late AYAs with chronic pain that extends existing pain resilience literature, including the Ecological Resilience-Risk Model for Pediatric Chronic Pain. METHOD: A conceptual framework for MDPR in late AYAs was developed from the existing literature on resilience in young people with chronic pain. Gaps in knowledge specific to late AYAs are identified, and relevant research examining MDPR in adults with pain are summarized to inform applications of this concept to youth as they transition to adulthood. RESULTS: Few studies have explored resilience factors in pediatric pain. Of note, these endeavors have largely neglected late adolescence and young adulthood, despite unique considerations germane to this crucial developmental period. Existing research has also focused exclusively on assessing resilience as a unitary, rather than a multidimensional construct. Although limited, MDPR has been examined in midlife and older adults with chronic pain, highlighting the need to expand prior models of pain resilience and extend these principles to emerging adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding MDPR in late AYAs with chronic pain may provide insights regarding measurable and modifiable resilience factors (e.g., adaptive and personal resources) that promote healthy pain-related outcomes (e.g., reduced pain and enhanced physical functioning) and optimize prevention and/or treatment strategies for this group.","Palit, Shreela; Palermo, Tonya M; Fillingim, Roger B; Bartley, Emily J",J. pediatr. psychol,595,16

Currently, to our knowledge, there is no effective pharmacologic prophylaxis for individuals at risk. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals, with enrollment from April 9, 2020, to July 14, 2020; follow-up ended August 4, 2020. The trial randomized 132 full-time, hospital-based HCWs (physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency technicians, and respiratory therapists), of whom 125 were initially asymptomatic and had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab. The trial was terminated early for futility before reaching a planned enrollment of 200 participants. Interventions: Hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, or size-matched placebo taken orally for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a nasopharyngeal swab during the 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, treatment discontinuation, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, frequency of QTc prolongation, and clinical outcomes for SARS-CoV-2-positive participants. Results: Of the 132 randomized participants (median age, 33 years [range, 20-66 years]; 91 women [69%]), 125 (94.7%) were evaluable for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in infection rates in participants randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (4 of 64 [6.3%] vs 4 of 61 [6.6%]; P > .99). Mild adverse events were more common in participants taking hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (45% vs 26%; P = .04); rates of treatment discontinuation were similar in both arms (19% vs 16%; P = .81). The median change in QTc (baseline to 4-week evaluation) did not differ between arms (hydroxychloroquine: 4 milliseconds; 95% CI, -9 to 17; vs placebo: 3 milliseconds; 95% CI, -5 to 11; P = .98). Of the 8 participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (6.4%), 6 developed viral symptoms; none required hospitalization, and all clinically recovered. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, although limited by early termination, there was no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine administered daily for 8 weeks as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hospital-based HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19.

In parallel with a relentless search for therapeutics and vaccines, considerable effort is being expended to develop ever more powerful technologies to restricting the spread of airborne microorganisms in indoor spaces through the minimization of health- and environment-related risks. In this context, UV-based and photocatalytic oxidation (PCO)-based technologies (i.e., the combined action of ultraviolet (UV) light and photocatalytic materials such as titanium dioxide (TiO2)) represent the most widely utilized approaches at present because they are cost-effective and ecofriendly. The virucidal and bactericidal effect relies on the synergy between the inherent ability of UV light to directly inactivate viral particles and bacteria through nucleic acid and protein damages, and the production of oxidative radicals generated through the irradiation of the TiO2 surface. In this literature survey, we draw attention to the most effective UV radiations and TiO2-based PCO technologies available and their underlying mechanisms of action on both bacteria and viral particles. Since the fine tuning of different parameters, namely the UV wavelength, the photocatalyst composition, and the UV dose (viz, the product of UV light intensity and the irradiation time), is required for the inactivation of microorganisms, we wrap up this review coming up with the most effective combination of them.

In the context of COVID-19, this issue is even more necessary to be highlighted. However, most BioKG construction inevitably includes numerous conflicts and noises deriving from incorrect knowledge descriptions in literature and defective information extraction techniques. Many studies have demonstrated that reasoning upon the knowledge graph is effective in eliminating such conflicts and noises. This paper proposes a method BioGRER to improve the BioKG's quality, which comprehensively combines the knowledge graph embedding and logic rules that support and negate triplets in the BioKG. In the proposed model, the BioKG refinement problem is formulated as the probability estimation for triplets in the BioKG. We employ the variational EM algorithm to optimize knowledge graph embedding and logic rule inference alternately. In this way, our model could combine efforts from both the knowledge graph embedding and logic rules, leading to better results than using them alone. We evaluate our model over a COVID-19 knowledge graph and obtain competitive results.","Zhao, Sendong; Qin, Bing; Liu, Ting; Wang, Fei",,595,16

Manaus, Brazil offers a concerning glimpse of what may come: six months after the majority of the citys population experienced primary infection, a second wave with a new strain resulted in more deaths than the first wave. Current hypotheses for this surge rely on prior immunity waning due to time and antigenic distance. Here we show this hypothesis predicts a severe endemic state. We propose an alternative hypothesis in which individuals infected in the first wave lose protection against transmission but retain immunity against severe disease and show this hypothesis is equally compatible with existing data. In this scenario, the increased number of deaths is due to an increased infection fatality ratio (IFR) for primary infections with the new variant. This alternative predicts a mild endemic state will be reached within decades. Collecting data on the severity of reinfections and infections post-vaccination as a function of time and antigenic distance from the original exposure is crucial for optimizing control strategies.","Lavine, Jennie S; Bjornstad, Ottar N; Coombs, Daniel; Antia, Rustom",,595,24

We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. METHODS: We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction sample for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, 1 tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with from the chalet a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored; all contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 73) were negative. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence in this cluster of 1 asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019.","Danis, Kostas; Epaulard, Olivier; Bénet, Thomas; Gaymard, Alexandre; Campoy, Séphora; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Spaccaferri, Guillaume; Ader, Florence; Mailles, Alexandra; Boudalaa, Zoubida; Tolsma, Violaine; Berra, Julien; Vaux, Sophie; Forestier, Emmanuel; Landelle, Caroline; Fougere, Erica; Thabuis, Alexandra; Berthelot, Philippe; Veil, Raphael; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; Chidiac, Christian; Lina, Bruno; Coignard, Bruno; Saura, Christine",Clin Infect Dis,595,5

The existential struggle with the awareness of death impacts the gamut of human cognition, emotion, and behavior. This multi-method research (&#931;N = 1,219) explains the psychosocial impact of COVID-19-related mortality salience on altruism. Drawing from terror management theory, two studies tested death-thought accessibility, mortality salience, and anxiety buffer hypotheses. Study 1 (cross-sectional survey), using structural equation modeling, confirms death anxiety and fear are predictors of powerlessness and materialism which, in turn, predict charitable donations. Study 2 (between-subjects experiment) confirms the causal effects of COVID-19-induced mortality salience on altruism. Controlling income and socioeconomic status, people in the mortality salience treatment condition indicate greater monetary donations ($), ratio of prosocial (altruistic) to proself (egocentric) spending (%), donation of time (hour), monetary valuation of time (hourly rate = $/hour), and economic value of donated time (hourly rate*hour) than the controls. These effects are mediated by powerlessness. Moderating effects of relevant individual difference factors are significant: the greedier, more selfish, narcissistic, materialistic, and system-justifying the donor is, the higher monetary donations, volunteer time, and perceived value of donated time are, only when the COVID-19-induced mortality is made salient but not in the controls. Environmental and dispositional factors jointly influence vulnerability to mortality salience. The paradox of egocentrism and altruism, as an evolutionarily adaptive protective buffer against existential insecurity for social and cultural animals, can help revitalize resilience, thus shedding some lights on the sociopsychological mechanism of consumers' subjective well-being. Implications for consumer affairs, social marketers, and policymakers are discussed.","Jin, S Venus; Ryu, Ehri",,595,24

The investigation was conducted on aluminum rotating disk electrodes as a function of potential, ionic liquid composition, and temperature. Two different dissolution mechanisms were realized. At modest overpotentials, dissolution takes place under mixed kinetic-mass transport control. However, as the overpotential is increased to induce higher dissolution rates and/or the ionic liquid is made more acidic, the dissolution reaction transitions to a potential-independent passivation-like process ascribed to the formation of a porous solid layer of AlCl3(s). At a fixed temperature and composition, the limiting passivation current density displays Levich behavior and also scales linearly with the concentration of AlCl4 - in the ionic liquid. The heterogeneous kinetics of the Al dissolution reaction were measured in the active dissolution potential regime. The exchange current densities were independent of the composition of the ionic liquid, and the anodic transfer coefficients were close to zero and seemed to be independent of the Al grain size.","Wang, Chen; Creuziger, Adam; Stafford, Gery; Hussey, Charles L",Journal of the Electrochemical Society,595,1

Among HBV factors, the surface protein is the most sensitive biomarker for viral infection, given that it is expressed at high levels in all viral infection phases. The large HBV surface protein (LHBs) contains the integral pre-S1 domain, which binds to the HBV receptor sodium taurocholate co transporting polypeptide on the hepatocyte to facilitate viral entry. The accumulation of viral LHBs and its prevalent pre-S mutants in chronic HBV carriers triggers a sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) overload response, leading to ER stress-mediated cell proliferation, metabolic switching and genomic instability, which are associated with pro-oncogenic effects. Ground glass hepatocytes identified in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients harbor pre-S deletion variants that largely accumulate in the ER lumen due to mutation-induced protein misfolding and are associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and metastasis. Moreover, in contrast to the major HBs, which is decreased in tumors to a greater extent than it is in peritumorous regions, LHBs is continuously expressed during tumorigenesis, indicating that LHBs serves as a promising biomarker for HCC in people with CHB. Continuing efforts to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which LHBs regulates pathological changes in CHB patients are important for establishing a correlation between LHBs biomarkers and HCC development.","Lin, Wei-Ling; Hung, Jui-Hsiang; Huang, Wenya",,595,16

Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on the throat swab nucleic acid test results of 1 452 COVID-19 patients admitted to Guanggu Branch of Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital of Hubei Province from Feb. 19 to Mar. 20, 2020. The negative results before positive results at discharge were judged as false negative results, and the false negative rate was calculated. The discharged patients were followed up to screen for the patients who were positive for nucleic acid test again, and the relationship between the times of consecutive negative nucleic acid tests before discharge and the positive again results was analyzed. Results Among the 1 452 COVID-19 patients, 592 (40.77%) were males and 860 (59.23%) were females. A total of 212 cases (14.60%) had false negative results. Twenty-eight cases (1.93%) were discovered nucleic acid positive again after discharge. Among the 918 patients whose nucleic acid tests were negative for two consecutive times, 24 (2.61%) were positive again, which was significantly higher than that of the patients whose nucleic acid tests were negative for three consecutive times (0.75%, 4/534; χ 2=6.21, P=0.012 7). Conclusion The throat swab nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 has a certain proportion of false negative results, which is one of the reasons for COVID-19 patients are found nucleic acid positive again after discharge.

We abstracted data from electronic health records on baseline, biomarker profiles, key time points, quality measures and radiographic data. RESULTS: Of 179 patients admitted with ischemic stroke, 36 had ELVO. Patients with COVID-19 and ELVO had a higher risk of mortality during the pandemic versus patients without COVID-19 (OR 16.63, p = 0.004). An age-based sub-analysis showed in-hospital mortality in 60% of COVID-19 positive patients between 61-70 years-old, 66.7% in between 51-60 years-old, 50% in between 41-50 years-old and 33.3% in between 31-40 years old. Patients that presented with pulmonary symptoms at time of stroke presentation had 71.4% mortality rate. 27.3% of COVID-19 patients presenting with ELVO had a good outcome at discharge (mRS 0-2).

A small percentage of COVID-19 ELVO patients had good outcomes. Age greater than 60 and pulmonary symptoms at presentation have higher risk for mortality. Other risk factors for mortality were a history of cigarette smoking, elevated, failure to recanalize, elevated d-dimer and ferritin levels.","Altschul, David J; Esenwa, Charles; Haranhalli, Neil; Unda, Santiago R; de La Garza Ramos, Rafael; Dardick, Joseph; Fernandez-Torres, Jenelys; Toma, Aureliana; Labovitz, Daniel; Cheng, Natalie; Lee, Seon-Kyu; Brook, Allan; Zampolin, Richard",Interv Neuroradiol,595,20

Despite their different physiological functions, disease-related proteins like tau, alpha-synuclein, Tar DNA binding protein-43, Fused in sarcoma and mutant Huntingtin, all share low complexity regions that can mediate their liquid-liquid phase transitions. The proteins' phase transitions can range from native monomers to soluble oligomers, liquid droplets and further to irreversible, often-mislocalised aggregates that characterise the stages and severity of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms have associated mislocalisation and aberrant accumulation of disease-related proteins with defective nucleocytoplasmic transport and its mediators called karyopherins. These studies identify karyopherin abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, that range from altered expression levels to the subcellular mislocalisation and aggregation of karyopherin alpha and beta proteins. The reported findings reveal that in addition to their classical function in nuclear import and export, karyopherins can also act as chaperones by shielding aggregation-prone proteins against misfolding, accumulation and irreversible phase-transition into insoluble aggregates. Karyopherin abnormalities can, therefore, be both the cause and consequence of protein mislocalisation and aggregate formation in degenerative proteinopathies. The resulting vicious feedback cycle of karyopherin pathology and proteinopathy identifies karyopherin abnormalities as a common denominator of onset and progression of neurodegenerative disease. Pharmacological targeting of karyopherins, already in clinical trials as therapeutic intervention targeting cancers such as glioblastoma and viral infections like COVID-19, may therefore represent a promising new avenue for disease-modifying treatments in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.","Pasha, Terouz; Zatorska, Anna; Sharipov, Daulet; Rogelj, Boris; Hortobágyi, Tibor; Hirth, Frank",Brain,595,22

RESULT: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 62.68% fewer patients underwent surgery than during the homologous period of time 1 year earlier (P < 0.01). After the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of orchidopexy cases increased significantly from 175.14 to 504.57 per week (P < 0.01).

Afterwards, we discussed the kinetics of SARS- or MERS-CoV proliferation in animal models which is significantly different compared to that in humans. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future perspective on the application of RDV either alone or in combination with other anti-viral agents against CoVs infection were surveyed to determine the efficiency of RDV in preclinical trials.

Dentists, like many other health professionals, are at an increased risk of contracting the virus as they work in close proximity to patients, especially when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Thus, in order for dentists to protect themselves and their patients, it is recommended that practitioners wear filtering facepiece 2 (FFP2) respirators. The prolonged use of these FFP2 respirators has been linked to several side effects. The aim of this paper is to assess the perceived experience associated with N95/FFP2 respirators based on the available literature and data collected through an online survey completed by Italian dental professionals. Articles were included up to May 2020 and literature searches were conducted through The National Library of Medicine, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase databases. The search terms included COVID-19, respirators, masks, and discomfort. An online survey was administered to 256 Italian dentists. The results from this survey were in agreement with the available literature. The findings concurred that the prolonged use of respirators was associated with headaches (47.5%), severe exertion and discomfort (50.8%), moderate concentration problems (54.3%), moderate breathing difficulties (63.5%), and consequently, an impaired work ability (85.5%). These findings were not influenced by the number of hours spent wearing the respirator. Despite several side effects, FFP2 respirators are fundamental in protecting dentists and their importance was acknowledged.","Farronato, Marco; Boccalari, Elisa; Del Rosso, Ettore; Lanteri, Valentina; Mulder, Riaan; Maspero, Cinzia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),595,16

The present study provides further insight into the role of miR-27a-3p in the regulation of CDH5 expression in renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC). METHODS: Thedysregulation of CDH5 expression in ccRCC and its association with clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed using the TCGA database. A meta-analysis was performed to verify the alteration of CDH5 expression in ccRCC using the GEO database. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining were applied to assess the transcriptional and protein levels of CDH5. TargetScan and Tarbase were employed to predict the miRNAs with the potential to target mRNA of CDH5. RESULTS: The mRNA level of CDH5 in ccRCCwas significantly higher than in normal tissue. CDH5 mRNA expression could therefore serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for ccRCC (AUC = 0.844). However, the reduced CDH5 transcription levels were significantly correlated with patients in the T3-4 stage, lymph node, and distant metastasis, as well as with a worse clinical outcome. We further observed that CDH5, at the protein level, was almost absent in ccRCC samples. In addition, a few databases screen showed that mir-27a-3p is a highly conserved miRNA targeting CDH5. The expression of mir-27a-3p was significantly elevated in ccRCC tissues in contrast to normal tissues. Importantly, it was positively associated with the T3-4 stage and M stage, respectively, suggesting that the expression level of mir-27a-3p could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for ccRCC (AUC = 0.775). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that thereduced translational level of CDH5 in ccRCC was related to the overexpression of mir-27a-3p. The higher mir-27a-3p and lower CDH5 expression significantly correlated with advanced clinical stages for ccRCC patients.","Wang, Yifang; Zhou, Xiaohui; Han, Peipei; Lu, Yunliang; Zhong, Xuemin; Yang, Yanping; Li, Danping; Liu, Deling; Li, Qiuyun; Pan, Nenghui; Mo, Yingxi; Luo, Wenqi; Li, Ping; Zhou, Xiaoying; Liudmila, Matskova",Pathol Res Pract,595,24

In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, Neuroticism decreased across these six weeks, particularly the facets of Anxiety and Depression, and Conscientiousness did not change. Interestingly, there was some evidence that the rapid changes in the social context had changed the meaning of an item. Specifically, an item about going to work despite being sick was a good indicator of conscientiousness before COVID-19, but the interpretation of it changed with the pandemic. In sum, the unexpected small decline in Neuroticism suggests that, during the acute phase of the coronavirus outbreak, feelings of anxiety and distress may be attributed more to the pandemic than to one's personality.","Sutin, Angelina R; Luchetti, Martina; Aschwanden, Damaris; Lee, Ji Hyun; Sesker, Amanda A; Strickhouser, Jason E; Stephan, Yannick; Terracciano, Antonio",PLoS One,595,26

This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays.

Primary outcome was time to resolution of major symptoms. Secondary outcomes included prevention of hospitalisation. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Findings: All patients achieved complete remission. The median [IQR] time to resolution of major symptoms was 18 [14-23] days in the 'recommended schedule' cohort and 14 [7-30] days in the matched 'control' cohort (p = 0·033). Other symptoms persisted in a lower percentage of patients in the 'recommended' than in the 'control' cohort (23·3% versus 73·3%, respectively, p<0·0001) and for a shorter period (p = 0·0107).

The model enabled the evaluation of three resource allocation strategies, for two COVID-19 wave scenarios: proactive cancellation of elective surgery, reactive cancellation of elective surgery, and ring-fencing operating theatre capacity. The results suggest that a ring-fencing strategy outperforms the other strategies, regardless of the COVID-19 scenario, in terms of total direct deaths and the number of surgeries performed. However, this does come at the cost of 50% more critical care rejections. In terms of aggregate hospital performance, a reactive cancellation strategy prioritising COVID-19 is no longer favourable if more than 7.3% of elective surgeries can be considered life-saving. Additionally, the model demonstrates the impact of timely hospital preparation and staff availability, on the ability to treat patients during a pandemic. The model can aid hospitals worldwide during pandemics and disasters, to evaluate their resource allocation strategies and identify the effect of redefining the prioritisation of patients.","Melman, G J; Parlikad, A K; Cameron, E A B",Health care manag. sci,595,1

For this reason, there is a growing need to characterize economic models more representative of the negative effects and counteracting responses that irradiation causes on human skin. These models will serve for the screening of protective compounds against damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) and high energy visible light (HEV). Therefore, two common in vitro models employed for sunlight irradiation studies, namely human keratinocyte HaCat culture and reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), were compared with the medaka fish embryo model, traditionally used in other scientific disciplines. Using suberythemal doses of UVA and HEV to determine the level of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation and thymine dimers formed by UVB, we show that medaka embryo responds with a lower damage level, more comparable to human skin, than the other two models, probably due to the protective mechanisms that work in a complete organism. In the same way, the protective effects of antioxidant compounds have the greatest effect on medaka embryos. Taken together, these findings suggest that medaka embryos would be a good alternative in vitro model for sunlight effect studies, and for the screening of molecules with counteracting capacity against the damage caused by UV and HEV.","Merino, Marián; Mullor, José Luis; Sánchez-Sánchez, Ana Virginia",,595,16

The scale of the problem is enormous because we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agent or vaccine. The human immune system has never been exposed to this novel virus, so the viral interactions with the human immune system are completely naive. New approaches are being studied at various levels, including animal in vitro models and human-based studies, to contain the COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible. Many drugs are being tested for repurposing, but so far only remdesivir has shown some positive benefits based on preliminary reports, but these results also need further confirmation via ongoing trials. Otherwise, no other agents have shown an impactful response against COVID-19. Recently, research exploring the therapeutic application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19 has gained momentum. The patients belonging to this subset are most likely beyond the point where they could benefit from an antiviral therapy because most of their illness at this stage of disease is driven by inflammatory (over)response of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the potential of MSCs as a therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19, based on the encouraging results from the preliminary data showing improved outcomes in the progression of COVID-19 disease.","Sahu, Kamal Kant; Siddiqui, Ahmad Daniyal; Cerny, Jan",,595,33

For example, rapid Antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 are assessed relative to more established PCR tests. In this paper, I argue that the new test can be described as producing ambiguous information when the pre-established is imperfect. This allows for a phenomenon called dilation -- an extreme form of non-informativeness. As an example, I present hypothetical test data satisfying the WHO's minimum quality requirement for rapid Antigen tests which leads to dilation. The ambiguity in the information arises from a missing data problem due to imperfection of the established test: the joint distribution of true infection and test results is not observed. Using results from Copula theory, I construct the (usually non-singleton) set of all these possible joint distributions, which allows me to assess the new test's informativeness. This analysis leads to a simple sufficient condition to make sure that a new test is not a dilation. I illustrate my approach with applications to data from three COVID-19 related tests. Two rapid Antigen tests satisfy my sufficient condition easily and are therefore informative. However, less accurate procedures, like chest CT scans, may exhibit dilation.","Ziegler, Gabriel",,595,20

In response, governments initiated a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that led to severe economic and social impacts. The effect of these intervention measures on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are not well investigated within developing country settings. This study simulated the trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic curve in Jordan between February and May and assessed the effect of Jordan's strict NPI measures on the spread of COVID-19. A modified susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was utilized. The compartments in the proposed model categorized the Jordanian population into six deterministic compartments: suspected, exposed, infectious pre-symptomatic, infectious with mild symptoms, infectious with moderate to severe symptoms, and recovered. The GLEAMviz client simulator was used to run the simulation model. Epidemic curves were plotted for estimated COVID-19 cases in the simulation model, and compared against the reported cases. The simulation model estimated the highest number of total daily new COVID-19 cases, in the pre-symptomatic compartmental state, to be 65 cases, with an epidemic curve growing to its peak in 49 days and terminating in a duration of 83 days, and a total simulated cumulative case count of 1048 cases. The curve representing the number of actual reported cases in Jordan showed a good pattern compatibility to that in the mild and moderate to severe compartmental states. The reproduction number under the NPIs was reduced from 5.6 to less than one. NPIs in Jordan seem to be effective in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the reproduction rate.

This study aims to develop a theory that attempts to explain the older adults' resiliency perspectives during crisis and how it has affected their well-being and quality of life as population group. Deductive theory generation using axiomatic approach was adopted resulting to five axioms that served as basis for the generation of three propositions such as: (1) An older person's health needs have tendencies to develop into a health threat, (2) when the threat is perceived, older persons developed a sense of internal control and adaptation to the changes it creates known as internal resiliency, and (3) internal resiliency can influence the quality of life in old age. The evolved theory suggests that in times of crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), health needs develop into a health threat that compels older persons to develop internal resiliency in order to preserve their integrity, wellbeing and quality of life.

However, there has been no discussion of what may induce intravascular coagulation. Platelets are critical in the formation of thrombi and their most potent trigger is platelet activating factor (PAF), first characterized by Demopoulos and colleagues in 1979. PAF is produced by cells involved in host defense and its biological actions bear similarities with COVID-19 disease manifestations. PAF can also stimulate perivascular mast cell activation, leading to inflammation implicated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Mast cells are plentiful in the lungs and are a rich source of PAF and of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1ß and IL-6, which may contribute to COVID-19 and especially SARS. The histamine-1 receptor antagonist rupatadine was developed to have anti-PAF activity, and also inhibits activation of human mast cells in response to PAF. Rupatadine could be repurposed for COVID-19 prophylaxis alone or together with other PAF-inhibitors of natural origin such as the flavonoids quercetin and luteolin, which have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-PAF actions.","Demopoulos, Constantinos; Antonopoulou, Smaragdi; Theoharides, Theoharis C",Biofactors,595,23

The difficulty in treating cases of fusariosis in the human medical clinic exemplifies this situation, because when Fusarium spp. are present in the form of biofilm, the permeation of antifungal agents is compromised. OBJECTIVES: This study proposes an association of clioquinol, an inhibitor of fungal cells with antifungal drugs prescribed to combat fusariosis in humans. METHODS: Susceptibility was assessed by microdilution in broth. Formation of biofilm by staining with violet crystal. Inhibition and removal of biofilm using the MTT colorimetric reagent. Time-kill combination, hypoallergenicity test, cytotoxicity test and toxicity prediction by computer analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Clioquinol associated with voriconazole and ciclopirox inhibited biofilm formation. Possibly, clioquinol acts in the germination and elongation of hyphae, while voriconazole prevents cell adhesion and ciclopirox the formation of the extracellular polymeric matrix. The CLIO-VRC association reduced the biofilm formation by more than 90%, while the CLIO-CPX association prevented over 95%. None of the association was irritating, and over 90% of the leucocytes remained viable. Computational analysis does not reveal toxicity relevant to CLIO, whereas VRC and CPX showed some risks for systemic use, but suitable for topical formulations. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CLIO-VRC or CLIO-CPX proved to be a promising association strategy in the medical clinic, both in combating fungal keratitis and onychomycosis, since they prevent the initial process of establishing an infection, the formation of biofilm.","de Chaves, Magda Antunes; Ferreira do Amaral, Thaís; Monteiro da Silva Rodrigues Coutinho, Natália; Fernanda Andrzejewski Kaminski, Taís; Teixeira, Mário Lettieri; Flavio Souza de Oliveira, Luís; de Andrade, Saulo Fernandes; Fuentefria, Alexandre Meneghello",Mycoses,595,20

Greater understanding of healthcare students (HCS) vaccine knowledge, attitudes and beliefs is necessary to provide an adequate vaccination education to better equip them to promote vaccination in their future careers. The aim of this study was to assess vaccination perception (VP) (perception of benefits and risks of vaccines) and its impact on vaccination coverage (VC) for mandatory and recommended vaccines among HCS. METHODS: A standardized, anonymous self-reporting electronic questionnaire was prospectively sent to HCS (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, midwifery, physiotherapy students and 1st year of health sciences students) of Normandy University in France between 18/03/2019 and 8/04/2019. VP was evaluated with questions regarding vaccination hesitancy, safety of vaccine and the benefit/risk balance of vaccination. Global VC (GVC) was defined as being vaccinated according to the mandatory and/or recommended vaccination schedule by national French law in 2018. RESULTS: 542 HCS took part in this survey. VC was high for mandatory (diphtheriae, poliomyelitis, tetanus 93.5%, hepatitis B virus 88.6%) and even most of recommended vaccinations (measles 95%, pertussis 88.2%). Global VC (40.4%) was not statistically different between HCS except for 1st year health sciences students who were less vaccinated (25.6%). Regarding VP, 97.8% of HCS thought that vaccine are effective. When vaccine safety and level of vaccine hesitancy were assessed (on a 0–10 scale, 0: not safe or not hesitant and 10: completely safe and strongly hesitant for vaccine), 91% of respondents stated that vaccine safety is ≥7 and in 80% the vaccine hesitancy was < 3. There was no difference among student categories. 80.6% of HCS recommended all vaccines but only 52% agreed that flu vaccination should be mandatory for HCS. In the multivariate analysis, being a 1st year health care sciences student was associated with a lower GVC (OR 95% CI = 2 [1.2–3.3], p = 0.004) than being a medical student. CONCLUSION: HCS perceived vaccine as effective and secure. Despite the good perception of vaccines, less than half HCS are well vaccinated.

Currently, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a potentially effective treatment option. METHODS: Patients who had recovered from COVID‐19 and had been discharged from the hospital for more than two weeks were recruited. COVID‐19 convalescent plasma (CCP)‐specific donor screening and selection were performed based the following criteria: 1) aged 18‐55 years; 2) eligible for blood donation; 3) diagnosed with COVID‐19; 4) had two consecutive negative COVID‐19 nasopharyngeal swab tests based on PCR (at least 24 h apart) prior to hospital discharge; 5) had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2 weeks; and 6) had no COVID‐19 symptoms prior to convalescent plasma donation. In addition, preference was given to CCP donors who had a fever lasting more than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5 Celsius, and 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. CCP collection was performed using routine plasma collection procedures via plasmapheresis. In addition to routine donor testing, the CCP donors’ plasma was also tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid and S‐RBD‐specific IgG antibody. RESULTS: Of the 81 potential CCP donors, 64 (79%) plasma products were collected. There were 18 female donors and 46 male donors. There were 34 first‐time blood donors and 30 repeat donors. The average time between CCP collection and initial symptom onset was 49.1 days, and the average time between CCP collection and hospital discharge was 38.7 days. The average volume of CCP collected was 327.7 ml. All Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) testing results met blood donation requirements. HIV Ag/Ab, anti‐HCV, anti‐syphilis and HBsAg were all negative; NAT for HIV, HBV, and HCV were also negative. In addition, all of the CCP donors’ plasma units were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA. Of the total 64 CCP donors tested, only one had an S‐RBD‐specific IgG titer of 1:160, all others had a titer of ≥1:320. CONCLUSION: Based on a feasibility study of a pilot CCP program in Wuhan China, we demonstrated the success and feasibility of CCP collection. In addition, all of the CCP units collected had a titer of ≥ 1:160 for S‐RBD‐specific IgG antibody, which met the CCP quality control requirements based on the Chinese national guidelines for CCP.

We analyzed the experience at our hospital with SARS-CoV2 infection and cancer patients (p). Method(s): We analyzed our experience from March 1 to April 30 at the Puerta de Hierro University Hospital in Madrid. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection was made by RT-PCR, suspected cases not confirmed were excluded. Result(s): Overall in-hospital mortality cancer p with COVID-19 was 15.2% (95%CI, 6.3;5.2), similar to 12.7% (95%CI,11.1;4.4) with p=0.615 of the global COVID-19 hospitalised population and greater than that of patients admitted without SARS-CoV-2 infection during the same period 4.3% (95%CI;3.6;5.2) p0.001. Among 653 patients receiving active cancer therapy during this period, 24 (3.7%) developed COVID-19 and required admission, 4.2% of were receiving chemotherapy, 9.5% immunotherapy and 2.1% targeted therapies. Lung and breast cancer were the most frequent (26.1%), followed by colorectal (19.6%) and breast cancer. No significant differences due to the cancer treatment received were observed. Mortality in lung cancer patients was the highest (25%).

As for now, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs or vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methods: Polyphenolic compounds have potential as drug candidates for various diseases, including viral infections. In this study, polyphenolic compounds contained in Geranii Herba were chosen for an in silico approach. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), 3CL(pro) (Replicase polyprotein 1ab), and the cell surface receptor glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were chosen as target proteins. Results: Based on the molecular docking analysis, ellagic acid, gallic acid, geraniin, kaempferitrin, kaempferol, and quercetin showed significant binding interactions with the target proteins. Besides, the molecular dynamic simulation studies support Geranii Herba’s inhibition efficiency on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We assume that the active compounds in Geranii Herba might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through the ACE2 receptor and inhibit the proteolytic process. Besides, these compounds may help to regulate the cell signaling under the unfolded protein response in endoplasmic reticulum stress through the binding with GRP78 and avoid the SARS-CoV-2 interaction. Conclusions: Hence, the compounds present in Geranii Herba could be used as possible drug candidates for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Arokiyaraj, Selvaraj; Stalin, Antony; Kannan, Balakrishnan Senthamarai; Shin, Hakdong",Antibiotics (Basel),595,28

We developed a bispecific, IgG1-like molecule (CoV-X2) based on two antibodies derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors, C121 and C1353. CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable S binding to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as the escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonals. In a novel animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, combining into a single molecule the advantages of antibody cocktails.","De Gasparo, Raoul; Pedotti, Mattia; Simonelli, Luca; Nickl, Petr; Muecksch, Frauke; Cassaniti, Irene; Percivalle, Elena; Lorenzi, Julio C.

However, TOTs are not merely instances of retrieval failures. Clues that increase the subjective likelihood of retrieval success, such as cue familiarity and target-related information, also have been shown to elicit feelings of imminent recall, supporting a metacognitive, inferential etiology of the TOT phenomenon. A survey conducted on our university campus provided anecdotal evidence that TOTs are occasionally shared among people in small groups. Although shared TOTs may suggest the influence of social contagion, we hypothesized that metacognitive appraisal of group recall efficiency could be involved. There should be more instances of remembering in several heads than in one. From this, we conjectured that people remembering together entertain the inference that successful retrieval is more likely in group recall than in a single-person recall situation. Such a metacognitive appraisal may drive a stronger feeling of closeness with the target word and of recall imminence, precipitating one (or more people) into a TOT state. We used general knowledge questions to elicit TOTs. We found that participants reported more TOTs when remembering in small groups than participants remembering alone. Critically, the experimental manipulation selectively increased TOTs without affecting correct recall, suggesting that additional TOTs observed in small groups were triggered independently from the retrieval process. Near one third (31%) of the TOTs in small groups were reported by two or more participants for the same items. However, removing common TOTs from the analyses did not change the basic pattern of results, suggesting that social contagion was not the main factor involved in the observed effect. We argue that beyond social contagion, group recall magnifies the inference that target words will be successfully retrieved, prompting the metacognitive monitoring system to launch more near-retrieval success “warning” (TOT) signals than in a single-person recall situation.","Rousseau, Luc; Kashur, Nathalie",Front Psychol,595,24

Different techniques, including genome sequencing, structural feature classification by electron microscopy, and chest imaging using computed tomography, are primarily used to diagnose and screen SARS-CoV-2 suspected individuals. Determination of the viral structure, surface proteins, and genome sequence has provided a design blueprint for the diagnostic investigations of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and rapidly emerging diagnostic technologies, vaccine trials, and cell-entry-inhibiting drugs. Here, we describe recent understandings on the spike glycoprotein (S protein), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and their receptor complex. This report also aims to review recently established diagnostic technologies and developments in surveillance measures for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the characteristics and performance of emerging techniques. Smartphone apps for contact tracing can help nations to conduct surveillance measures before a vaccine and effective medicines become available. We also describe promising point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technologies that are under consideration by researchers for advancement beyond the proof-of-concept stage.

Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a translating mammalian ribosome primed for frameshifting on the viral RNA. The viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure that lodges at the entry to the ribosomal mRNA channel to generate tension in the mRNA and promote frameshifting, whereas the nascent viral polyprotein forms distinct interactions with the ribosomal tunnel. Biochemical experiments validate the structural observations and reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence frameshifting efficiency. Finally, we compare compounds previously shown to reduce frameshifting with respect to their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, establishing coronavirus frameshifting as a target for antiviral intervention.","Bhatt, Pramod R.; Scaiola, Alain; Loughran, Gary; Leibundgut, Marc; Kratzel, Annika; Meurs, Romane; Dreos, René; O’Connor, Kate M.; McMillan, Angus; Bode, Jeffrey W.; Thiel, Volker; Gatfield, David; Atkins, John F.; Ban, Nenad",Science,595,21

Therefore, the introduction of serological tests for determination of IgM and IgG antibodies has become the main diagnostic tool, useful for tracking the spread of the virus and for consequently allowing its containment. In our study we compared point of care test (POCT) lateral flow immunoassay (FIA) vs automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), in order to assess their specificity and sensibility for COVID-19 antibodies detection. RESULTS: We find that different specificities and sensitivities for IgM and IgG tests. Notably IgM POCT FIA method vs CLIA method (gold standard) has a low sensitivity (0.526), while IgG POCT FIA method vs CLIA method (gold standard) test has a much higher sensitivity (0.937); further, with respect of IgG, FIA and CLIA could arguably provide equivalent information. CONCLUSIONS: FIA method could be helpful in assessing in short time, the possible contagiousness of subjects that for work reasons cannot guarantee “social distancing”.","Noce, Annalisa; Santoro, Maria Luisa; Marrone, Giulia; D’Agostini, Cartesio; Amelio, Ivano; Duggento, Andrea; Tesauro, Manfredi; Di Daniele, Nicola",Biol Direct,595,16

This ‘position effect’ is seen in cases where a mutation creates an AUG codon upstream from the normal start site and translation shifts to the upstream site. The position effect is evident also in cases where a silent internal AUG codon is activated upon being relocated closer to the 5′ end. Two mechanisms for escaping the first-AUG rule – reinitiation and context-dependent leaky scanning – enable downstream AUG codons to be accessed in some mRNAs. Although these mechanisms are not new, many new examples of their use have emerged. Via these escape pathways, the scanning mechanism operates even in extreme cases, such as a plant virus mRNA in which translation initiates from three start sites over a distance of 900 nt. This depends on careful structural arrangements, however, which are rarely present in cellular mRNAs. Understanding the rules for initiation of translation enables understanding of human diseases in which the expression of a critical gene is reduced by mutations that add upstream AUG codons or change the context around the AUG(START) codon. The opposite problem occurs in the case of hereditary thrombocythemia: translational efficiency is increased by mutations that remove or restructure a small upstream open reading frame in thrombopoietin mRNA, and the resulting overproduction of the cytokine causes the disease. This and other examples support the idea that 5′ leader sequences are sometimes structured deliberately in a way that constrains scanning in order to prevent harmful overproduction of potent regulatory proteins. The accumulated evidence reveals how the scanning mechanism dictates the pattern of transcription – forcing production of monocistronic mRNAs – and the pattern of translation of eukaryotic cellular and viral genes.","Kozak, Marilyn",Gene,595,1

While socioeconomic factors were suggested to contribute to this trend, they arguably do not explain the range of the differences observed, allowing for possible genetic implications. Almost concurrently, the analysis of a cohort in Chinese COVID-19 patients proposed an association between the severity of the disease and the presence of the minor allele of rs12252 of the Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene. This SNP, together with rs34481144, are the two most studied polymorphisms of IFITM3 and have been associated in the past with increased severity in Influenza, Dengue, Ebola, and HIV viruses. IFITM3 is an immune effector protein that is pivotal for the restriction of viral replication, but also for the regulation of cytokine production. Following up on these two developments in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the present study investigates a possible association between the differences in mortality of ethnic groups in England and the combined haplotypes of rs12252 and rs34481144. The respective allele frequencies were collected for 26 populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and subgroups were pooled wherever possible to create correspondences with ethnic groups in England. A significant correlation (r = 0.9687, p = 0.0003) and a striking agreement was observed between the reported Standardized Mortality Ratios and the frequency of the combined haplotype of both reference alleles, suggesting that the combination of the reference alleles of the specific SNPs may be implicated in more severe outcomes of COVID-19. This study calls for further focus on the role of IFITM3 variants in the mechanism of cellular invasion of SARS-CoV-2, their impact in COVID-19 severity and their possible implications in vaccination efficacy.","Nikoloudis, Dimitris; Kountouras, Dimitrios; Hiona, Asimina",PeerJ,595,5

The application of this method allows for the identification of key questions that need to be answered to determine the constitutionality of a mandatory vaccination program. These questions cannot be answered a priori and in the abstract because they depend on the concrete circumstances of the pandemic, on the characteristics of the vaccine(s) against COVID-19, and on how a mandatory vaccination policy might be designed and implemented by authorities.","Wang, Daniel Wei Liang; Moribe, Gabriela; Arruda, Ana Luiza Gajardoni De M.",Health Hum Rights,595,24

In the case of diagnostic activities with SARS-CoV-2, this may also affect BSC that are operated at protection level 2; therefore, decontamination of all contaminated surfaces of the BSC may be required. In addition to fumigation with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), dry fogging of H(2)O(2)-stabilized peroxyacetic acid (PAA) represents another alternative to fumigation with formalin. However, to prove their efficacy, these alternatives need to be validated for each model of BSC. Methods: The validation study was performed on 4 different BSCs of Class II A2 using the “Mini Dry Fog” system. Results: An aerosol concentration of 0.03% PAA and 0.15% H(2)O(2) during a 30 min exposure was sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Effective concentrations of 1.0% PAA and 5% H(2)O(2) were required to decontaminate the custom-prepared biological indicators loaded with spores of G. stearothermophilus and deployed at 9 different positions in the BSC. Commercial spore carriers were easier to inactivate by a factor of 4, which corresponded to a reduction of 10(6) in all localizations. Conclusions: Dry fogging with PAA is an inexpensive, robust, and highly effective decontamination method for BSCs for enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The good material compatibility, lack of a requirement for neutralization, low pH – which increases the range of efficacy compared to H(2)O(2) fumigation – the significantly shorter processing time, and the lower costs argue in favor of this method.","Teifke, Jens Peter; Scheinemann, Hendrik; Schinköthe, Jan; Eschbaumer, Michael; Melüh, Alina; Streitz, Mathias; Freese, Holger; Reiche, Sven",GMS Hyg Infect Control,595,13

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, WHO COVID-19 databases from inception to 15/06/2020 and medRxiv. No language restriction. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and GRADE framework were utilised to assess the risk of bias and certainty of evidence. PROSPERO CRD42020188421. RESULTS: Seventy-two articles (59 cohort studies with 17,950,989 participants, 13 ecological studies; 54 US-based, 15 UK-based; 41 peer-reviewed) were included for systematic review and 45 for meta-analyses. Risk of bias was low: median NOS 7 of 9 (interquartile range 6–8). Compared to White ethnicity, unadjusted all-cause mortality was similar in Black (RR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.83–1.08]) and Asian (RR: 0.99 [0.85–1.16]) but reduced in Hispanic ethnicity (RR: 0.69 [0.57–0.84]). Age- and sex-adjusted risks were significantly elevated for Black (HR: 1.38 [1.09–1.75]) and Asian (HR: 1.42 [1.15–1.75]), but not for Hispanic (RR: 1.14 [0.93–1.40]). Further adjusting for comorbidities attenuated these associations to non-significance: Black (HR: 0.95 [0.72–1.25]); Asian (HR: 1.17 [0.84–1.63]); Hispanic (HR: 0.94 [0.63–1.44]). Subgroup analyses showed a trend towards greater disparity in outcomes for UK ethnic minorities, especially hospitalisation risk.

Both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses that circulate in Asian poultry. Both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 subunits, which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals, respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented healthcare crisis in recent times with effects reverberating in all spheres of human lives. India has registered the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. This paper aims to dwell in the religious and social background of Kumbh Mela massive gathering, as well as the ritualistic practices that could potentially entail public health risks in the current situation. It also aims to identify possible preparatory and interventional measures to evade such risks. RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, the increase in the number of people attending the Kumbh Mela has been phenomenal. Congregants are put up at the holy sites for several days. The sheer number of people assembling at the religious venues poses a great challenge to manage the crowds, to cater to the requirements of basic amenities, and to meet their healthcare needs. Some of the ritualistic practices could heighten the risk for transmission of respiratory pathogens. The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated over the past few months in India. The pandemic is expected to sustain its tempo in India throughout the foreseeable future. Organization of the forthcoming Kumbh Mela needs meticulous planning. SUMMARY: Kumbh Mela is a Hindu religious gathering at the banks of India’s rivers, held periodically. It witnesses assembly of huge numbers of people and has the potential to amplify the COVID-19 pandemic in India; this could overwhelm the healthcare system.","Quadri, Sayed A.; Padala, Prasad R.",Curr Trop Med Rep,595,26

After virus entry in host cells the global organization of the viral life cycle is strongly regulated by the formation of virus-host protein interactions. With the advent of high-throughput -omics platforms, the mirage to obtain a “high resolution” view of virus–host interactions has come true. In fact, the rapidly expanding approaches of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics in the study of PPIs provide efficient tools to identify a significant number of potential drug targets. Generation of PPIs maps by affinity purification-MS and by the more recent proximity labeling-MS may help to uncover cellular processes hijacked and/or altered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), providing promising therapeutic targets. The possibility to further validate putative key targets from high-confidence interactions between viral bait and host protein through follow-up MS-based multi-omics experiments offers an unprecedented opportunity in the drug discovery pipeline. In particular, drug repurposing, making use of already existing approved drugs directly targeting these identified and validated host interactors, might shorten the time and reduce the costs in comparison to the traditional drug discovery process. This route might be promising for finding effective antiviral therapeutic options providing a turning point in the fight against the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.","Terracciano, Rosa; Preianò, Mariaimmacolata; Fregola, Annalisa; Pelaia, Corrado; Montalcini, Tiziana; Savino, Rocco",Int J Mol Sci,595,1

Antibody testing detects one form of the acquired immunological response to a pathogenic antigen. Once the immune system recognizes a viral antigen or a protein as foreign, a humoral immune response is initiated, which is generally detected by laboratory testing in 5 to 10 days after the initial exposure. While this information is critical from a public health perspective to implement surveillance systems and measures to limit infectivity and transmission rate, the misinterpretation of serologic testing in clinical practice has generated much confusion in the medical community because some attempted to apply these strategies to individual patient's treatment schemes. In this mini‐review, we examine the different serologic‐based testing strategies, how to interpret their results, and their public health impact at the population level, which are critical to contain the transmission of the virus in the community within a busy cardiovascular practice.

METHODS: A cohort study was performed in 60 Spanish hospitals including 778 patients with COVID-19 with clinical and laboratory data indicative of hyperinflammatory state. Main exposure was treatment with tocilizumab; intermediate-high dose of corticosteroids (IHDC); pulse dose of corticosteroids (PDC); combination therapy; or no treatment. Primary outcome was intubation or death; follow-up was 21 days. Propensity score-adjusted estimations using Cox regression (logistic regression if needed) were calculated. Propensity scores were used as confounders, matching variables and for the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW). RESULTS: 88, 117, 78 and 151 patients treated with tocilizumab, IHDC, PDC, and combination therapy, respectively were compared with 344 not treated patients. The primary endpoint occurred in 10 (11.4%), 27 (23.1%), 12 (15.4%), 40 (25.6%) and 69 (21.1%), respectively. The IPTW-based hazard ratio (odds ratio for combination therapy) for the primary endpoint were 0.32 (95% CI, 0.22-0.47; p<0.001) for tocilizumab, 0.82 (0.71-1.30; p=0.82) for IHDC, 0.61 (0.43-0.86; p=0.006) for PDC, and 1.17 (0.86-1.58; p=0.30) for combination therapy. Other applications of the propensity score provided similar results, but were not significant for PDC.

First confined in China and then disseminated widely across Europe and America, SARS-CoV-2 has impacted and moved the scientific community around the world to working in a fast and coordinated way to collect all possible information about this virus and generate new strategies and protocols to try to stop the infection. During March 2020, more than 16,000 full viral genomes have been shared in public databases that allow the construction of genetic landscapes for tracking and monitoring the viral advances over time and study the genomic variations present in geographic regions. In this work, we present the occurrence of genetic variants and lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile during March to April 2020. Complete genome analysis of 141 viral samples from different regions of Chile revealed a predominance of variant D614G like in Europe and the USA and the major presence of lineage B.1. These findings could help take control measures due to the similarity of the viral variants present in Chile, compared with other countries, and monitor the dynamic change of virus variants in the country.","Castillo, Andrés E.; Parra, Bárbara; Tapia, Paz; Lagos, Jaime; Arata, Loredana; Acevedo, Alejandra; Andrade, Winston; Leal, Gabriel; Tambley, Carolina; Bustos, Patricia; Fasce, Rodrigo; Fernández, Jorge",Front Public Health,595,11

However, a more extended daily fast poses many challenges. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a 200-calorie fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) energy bar formulated to prolong ketogenesis and mitigate fasting-associated side effects. A randomized, controlled study was conducted comparing the impact of consuming an FMD bar vs. continued water fast, after a 15-h overnight fast. Subjects in the FMD group showed a 3-h postprandial beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) level and 4-h postprandial BHB area under the curve (AUC(0–4)) that were non-inferior to those who continued with the water fast (p = 0.891 and p = 0.377, respectively). The postprandial glucose AUC(0–4) in the FMD group was non-inferior to that in the water fast group (p = 0.899). A breakfast group served as a control, which confirmed that the instrument used in home glucose and ketone monitoring functioned as expected. The results indicate that FMD bar consumption does not interfere with the physiological ketogenesis associated with overnight fasting and could be used to facilitate the practice of time-restricted eating or intermittent fasting.","Huang, Angie W.; Wei, Min; Caputo, Sara; Wilson, Melissa L.; Antoun, Joseph; Hsu, William C.",Nutrients,595,20

Infections due to these organisms are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Among them, metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae are of global concern today. The ceftazidime/avibactam combination and the ceftazidime/avibactam + aztreonam combination currently represent the most promising antibiotic strategies to stave off these kinds of infections. We describe the case of a patient affected by thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) admitted in our ICU after developing a hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia during his stay in the hematology department. His medical conditions during his ICU stay were further complicated by a K. Pneumoniae NDM sepsis. To our knowledge, the patient had no risk factors for multidrug-resistant bacteria exposure or contamination during his stay in the hematology department. During his stay in the ICU, we treated the sepsis with a combination therapy of ceftazidime/avibactam + aztreonam. The therapy solved his septic state, allowing for a progressive improvement in his general condition. Moreover, we noticed that the negativization of the hemocultures was also associated to a decontamination of his known rectal colonization. The ceftazidime/avibactam + aztreonam treatment could not only be a valid therapeutic option for these kinds of infections, but it could also be considered as a useful tool in selected patients’ intestinal decolonizations.","Perrotta, Francesco; Perrini, Marco Paolo",Medicina (Kaunas),595,16

The implementation of strict lockdown policies has had unprecedented impacts on air quality globally. This study is an attempt to assess the effects of COVID-19 induced lockdown measures on air quality in both regional, country, and city scales in the South and Southeast Asian region using open-source satellite-based data and software frameworks. We performed a systematic review of the national lockdown measures of 19 countries of the study area based on publicly available materials. We considered two temporal settings over a period of 66 days to assess and compare the effects of lockdown measures on air quality levels between standard business as usual and current situation COVID-19 lockdown. Results showed that compared to the same period of 2019, atmospheric NO(2), SO(2), PM(2.5), and CO levels decreased by an average of 24.16%, 19.51%, 20.25%, and 6.88%, respectively during the lockdown, while O(3) increased by a maximum of 4.52%. Among the 19 studied cities, Dhaka, Kathmandu, Jakarta, and Hanoi experienced the highest reduction of NO(2) (40%–47%) during the lockdown period compared to the corresponding period of 2019. The methodological framework applied in this study can be used and extended to future research in the similar domain such as understanding long-term effects of COVID-19 mitigation measures on the atmospheric pollution at continental-scale or assessing the effects of the domestic emissions during the stay-at-home; a standard and effective COVID-19 lockdown measure applied in most of the countries.","Roy, Sanjoy; Saha, Monojit; Dhar, Bandhan; Pandit, Santa; Nasrin, Rubaiya",Sci Total Environ,595,16

However, in some patients, there can also be immunological problems, such as macrophage activation syndrome (CSS) that results in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Comprehension of host-microbe communications is the critical aspect in the advancement of new therapeutics against infectious illnesses. Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.","Gupta, Anita; Gupta, G.

Understanding parental decision-making for children’s vaccination is important, particularly among minority groups who are most vulnerable and underserved. This study explored how a subsample of new immigrant mothers from mainland China, a rapidly-growing subpopulation in Hong Kong, made decisions on various childhood and adolescent vaccines for their offspring, and identified key influences affecting their decision making. METHODS: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 Chinese new immigrant mothers recruited by purposive sampling. All interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach. RESULTS: Participants’ conversation revealed five underlying themes which influenced parents’ vaccination decision-making: (1) Institutional factors, (2) Insufficient vaccination knowledge and advice, (3) Affective impacts on motivation, (4) Vaccination barriers, and (5) Social influences. The role of social norms appeared overwhelmingly salient influencing parents’ vaccination decision making. Institutional factors shaped parent’s perceptions of vaccination necessity. Fear of vaccine-targeted diseases was a key motivating factor for parents adopting vaccination. Insufficient knowledge about vaccines and targeted diseases, lack of advice from health professionals and, if provided, suspicions regarding the motivations for such advice were common issues. Vaccination cost was a major barrier for many new immigrant parents. CONCLUSIONS: Social norms play a key role influencing parental vaccination decision-making. Insight gained from this study will help inform healthcare providers in vaccination communication and policymakers in future vaccination programme.","Wang, Linda DL; Lam, Wendy WT; Wu, Joseph T; Liao, Qiuyan; Fielding, Richard",BMC Public Health,595,1

We call this the SEPARdmodel. A delay differential equation version of the model is added; it allows a better comparison to other models. We carry this out by a comparison with the classical SIR model and indicate why we believe that the SEPARdmodel may work better for Covid-19 than other apporaches. In the second part of the paper we explain how to deal with the data provided by the JHU, in particular we explain how to derive central model parameters from the data. Other parameters, like the size of the dark sector, are less accessible and have to be estimated more roughly, at best by results of representative serological studies which are accessible, however, only for a few countries. % for a few studies available in Germany and Switzerland, where the dark sector has already a visible impact. We start our country studies with Switzerland where such data are available. % and use it as an example for discussing the role of the dark sector for modelling the course of the epidemic. Then we apply the model to a collection of other countries, three European ones (Germany, France, Sweden), the three most stricken countries from three other continents (USA, Brazil, India). Finally we show that even the aggregated world data can be well represented by our approach. At the end of the paper we discuss the use of the model. Perhaps the most striking application is that it allows a quantitative analysis of the influence of the time until people are sent to quarantine or hospital. This suggests that imposing means to shorten this time is a powerful tool to flatten the curves.","Scholz, E.; Kreck, M.",,595,26

Excess deaths were concentrated in a limited number of regions—expected deaths exceeded 20% in just 16 regions—with more than 40% of the regions considered experiencing no excess mortality during the first 6 months of 2020. Highly connected regions, in colder and dryer climates, with high air pollution levels, and relatively poorly endowed health systems witnessed the highest incidence of excess mortality. Institutional factors also played an important role. The first wave hit regions with a combination of weak and declining formal institutional quality and fragile informal institutions hardest. Low and declining national government effectiveness, together with a limited capacity to reach out across societal divides, and a frequent tendency to meet with friends and family were powerful drivers of regional excess mortality.","Rodríguez‐Pose, Andrés; Burlina, Chiara",J Reg Sci,595,1

This algorithm can obtain new and relevant information from extremely limited and poor datasets. In a world dominated by the concept of big (fat?) data we want to show that it is possible, by necessity or choice, to work profitably even on small data. This peculiarity of the algorithm means that even in the early stages of an epidemic process, when the data are too few to have sufficient statistics, it is possible to obtain important information. To prove our theory, we addressed one of the most central issues at the moment: the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the cases recorded in Italy have been selected. Italy seems to have a central role in this epidemic because of the high number of measured infections. Through this innovative artificial intelligence algorithm, we have tried to analyze the evolution of the phenomenon and to predict its future steps using a dataset that contained only geospatial coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the first recorded cases. Once the coordinates of the places where at least one case of contagion had been officially diagnosed until February 26(th), 2020 had been collected, research and analysis was carried out on: outbreak point and related heat map (TWC alpha); probability distribution of the contagion on February 26th (TWC beta); possible spread of the phenomenon in the immediate future and then in the future of the future (TWC gamma and TWC theta); how this passage occurred in terms of paths and mutual influence (Theta paths and Markov Machine). Finally, a heat map of the possible situation towards the end of the epidemic in terms of infectiousness of the areas was drawn up. The analyses with TWC confirm the assumptions made at the beginning.","Buscema, Paolo Massimo; Torre, Francesca Della; Breda, Marco; Massini, Giulia; Grossi, Enzo",Physica A,595,14

SARS-CoV-2 binds its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the viral spike (S) protein. The mortality related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients has been suggested to be connected with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), an excessive immune response that severely damages healthy lung tissue. In addition, cardiac symptoms, including fulminant myocarditis, are frequent in patients in a severe state of illness. Diacerein (DAR) is an anthraquinone derivative drug whose active metabolite is rhein. Different studies have shown that this compound inhibits the IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-α, NF-κB and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. The antiviral activity of rhein has also been documented. This metabolite prevents hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and influenza A virus (IAV) adsorption and replication through mechanisms involving regulation of oxidative stress and alterations of the TLR4, Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB signalling pathways. Importantly, rhein inhibits the interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting rhein as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DAR is a multi-target drug useful for COVID-19 treatment. This anthraquinone may control hyperinflammatory conditions by multi-faceted cytokine inhibition and by reducing viral infection.","de Oliveira, Pedro Gonçalves; Termini, Lara; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Lepique, Ana Paula; Sposito, Andrei C; Pierulivo, Enrique Mario Boccardo",Med Hypotheses,595,16

Although evidence analysing immediate effects is expanding, repercussions following lockdown measures remain poorly understood. This systematic review aims to analyse biopsychosocial consequences after lockdown measures end according to short, medium, and long-term impacts. METHODS: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to January 12, 2021. Reference lists were manually reviewed. Eligible studies analysed biopsychosocial functioning after lockdown measures secondary to recent infectious outbreaks ended. Lockdown measures were defined as quarantine, isolation, workplace or educational closures, social or physical distancing, and national or local closure of public institutions deemed non-essential. Studies exclusively researching outcomes during lockdown measures, examined infectious participants, or analysed lockdown measures not pertaining to an infectious outbreak were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed bias with a third resolving discrepancies. Data was extracted from published reports with further information requested from authors where necessary. The mixed methods appraisal tool assessed study quality, languages were restricted to English, German, Italian, and French and narrative synthesis was applied. RESULTS: Of 5149 identified studies, 40 were eligible for inclusion. Psychological distress, economic repercussions, social, biological, and behavioural ramifications were observed. Short to medium-term effects comprised reactions relating to early trauma processing whereas medium to long-term repercussions manifested in maladaptive behaviours and mental health deterioration. Increased alcohol intake, stigmatisation, and economic effects were also identified consequences. High-risk groups included health care workers, children, elderly, inpatients, those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses, and socially isolated individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting vulnerable groups and offering education, workplace modifications, financial, and social assistance may mitigate negative repercussions. Establishing a rapid and comprehensive evidence base appraising the efficacy of such interventions and identifying areas for development is essential.

The main aim of this study is to examine the level of psychological distress during COVID-19 in Bangladesh and explore factors associated with higher psychological distress. METHODS: An internet-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020 in Bangladesh among adults 18 years old and above using structured online questionnaires distributed through emails and other social media throughout Bangladesh with an overall response rate of 34%. Modified version of the Covid19 peritraumatic distress index (CPDI) was used to measure distress. Univariate and Bivariate analysis was used to estimate prevalence of CPDI symptoms and test for the associations between CPDI and the exposure variables. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds ratios of our outcome variable by exposure variables. RESULTS: Overall, 44.3% of respondents were suffering from mild to moderate distress and 9.5% were suffering from severe distress. Female respondents were 2.435 times more likely to suffer from CPDI mild to severe distress than males. As compared to Dhaka and Mymensing region of Bangladesh, odds of distress was 1.945 times more in Chittagong/Sylhet region (p-value = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Large proportion of adult population in Bangladesh are experiencing psychological distress, with level of distress varies by different symptoms and predictors. This study suggest the need to develop comprehensive crisis prevention system including epidemiological monitoring, screening, and referral with targeted intervention to reduce psychological distress.","Marzo, Roy Rillera; Singh, Akansha; Mukti, Roushney Fatima",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,595,3

Although it has been suggested that these drugs might lead to a higher susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection, experimental data suggest these agents may reduce acute lung injury via blocking angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary permeability, inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of medications that influence ACE2 expression (ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazolidinediones) on the outcomes of COVID-19? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 24 June 2020. After systematic analysis, nine studies were included. RESULTS: The results were described for two different groups, an overall group in which all users were compared with non-users and a group in which only hypertensive patients were included. Within each group a distinction was made between results for ACEI/ARB use, ACEI use, ARB use, NSAID use and thiazolidinedione use. None of the studies demonstrated increased mortality in the two groups. Furthermore, none of the studies showed an effect on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from ‘moderate’ to ‘very low’, according to the GRADE methodology. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the literature demonstrated that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of ACE2 expression mediating pharmacotherapy on outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies. Randomised controlled studies are needed to answer this question.

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11, 2020. Elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which 19 elderly residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the increased susceptibility to cytokine release syndrome, inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, 19 patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: All patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable, and 18 of the 19 patients (94.7%) were discharged clinically recovered with negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test results at 13 days. After one dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased within the first 24–48 h in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminarily assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients that did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. The control subjects were well matched regarding age, comorbidities, and severity of the disease. The percentage of itolizumab-treated, moderately ill patients who needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit was only one-third of that of the control group not treated with itolizumab. Additionally, treatment with itolizumab reduced the risk of death 10 times as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab in combination with other antivirals reduces COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19. Our results suggest the possible use of itolizumab in patients with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.","Díaz, Yayquier; Ramos-Suzarte, Mayra; Martín, Yordanis; Calderón, Néstor Antonio; Santiago, William; Viñet, Orlando; La O, Yulieski; Oyarzábal, Jorge Pérez Augusto; Pérez, Yoan; Lorenzo, Geidy; Cepeda, Meylan; Saavedra, Danay; Mazorra, Zaima; Estevez, Daymys; Lorenzo-Luaces, Patricia; Valenzuela, Carmen; Caballero, Armando; Leon, Kalet; Crombet, Tania; Hidalgo, Carlos Jorge",Gerontology,595,16

Epidemic risk analysis can help in rapidly predicting potentially serious outcomes and flagging the need for rapid response. We developed a multifactorial risk analysis tool ‘EpiRisk’ to provide rapid insight into the potential severity of emerging epidemics by combining disease-related parameters and country-related risk parameters. An initial set of 18 disease and country-related risk parameters was reduced to 14 following qualitative discussions and the removal of highly correlated parameters by a correlation and clustering analysis. Of the remaining parameters, three risk levels were assigned ranging from low (1) moderate (2) and high (3). The total risk score for an outbreak of a given disease in a particular country is calculated by summing these 14 risk scores, and this sum is subsequently classified into one of four risk categories: low risk (<21), moderate risk (21–29), high risk (30–37) and extreme risk (>37). Total risk scores were calculated for nine retrospective outbreaks demonstrating an association with the actual impact of those outbreaks. We also evaluated to what extent the risk scores correlate with the number of cases and deaths in 61 additional outbreaks between 2002 and 2018, demonstrating positive associations with outbreak severity as measured by the number of deaths. Using EpiRisk, timely intervention can be implemented by predicting the risk of emerging outbreaks in real time, which may help government and public health professionals prevent catastrophic epidemic outcomes.","Lesmanawati, Dyah A S; Veenstra, Patrick; Moa, Aye; Adam, Dillon C; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina",BMJ Glob Health,595,1

In order to accurately locate the blood sampling point in the venous area, we propose a new finger vein image segmentation approach basing on Gabor transform and Gaussian mixed model (GMM). Firstly, Gabor filter parameter can be set adaptively according to the differential excitation of image and we use the local binary pattern (LBP) to fuse the same-scale and multi-orientation Gabor features of the image. Then, finger vein image segmentation is achieved by Gabor-GMM system and optimized by the max flow min cut method which is based on the relative entropy of the foreground and the background. Finally, the blood sampling point can be localized with corner detection. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has significant performance in segmenting finger vein images which the average accuracy of segmentation images reach 91.6%.","Li, Xi; Li, Zhangyong; Yang, Dewei; Zhong, Lisha; Huang, Lian; Lin, Jinzhao",Sensors (Basel),595,3

The aim of this study was to screen the population in Germany for negative impact on mental health in the current COVID‐19 pandemic and to analyze possible risk and protective factors. METHODS: A total of 6,509 people took part in an online survey in Germany from 27 March to 6 April. The questionnaire included demographic information and ascertained psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk and protective factors. RESULTS: In our sample, over 50% expressed suffering from anxiety and psychological distress regarding the COVID‐19 pandemic. Participants spent several hours per day thinking about COVID‐19 (M = 4.45). Psychological and social determinants showed stronger associations with anxiety regarding COVID‐19 than experiences with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The current COVID‐19 pandemic does cause psychological distress, anxiety, and depression for large proportions of the general population. Strategies such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and social contacts, acceptance of anxiety and negative emotions, fostering self‐efficacy, and information on where to get medical treatment if needed, seem of help, while substance abuse and suppression of anxiety and negative emotions seem to be associated with more psychological burden.","Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Bendau, Antonia; Plag, Jens; Pyrkosch, Lena; Mascarell Maricic, Lea; Betzler, Felix; Rogoll, Janina; Große, Julia; Ströhle, Andreas",Brain Behav,595,16

It is documented that health-seeking behaviors change during pandemics. The objective of this study was to examine social determinants associated with decisions to seek dental care in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 4372 participants were invited to this cross-sectional web-based survey distributed from April 21 to June 20, 2020. The survey included a list of emergency, urgent, and routine dental procedures. Participants were asked if they would seek dental care for these conditions during the pandemic, and what pain severity would make them seek dental treatment. Logistic regression models were performed for predicting variables that explain the decision to go or not to go to the dental clinic during the pandemic for each dental condition. RESULTS: A total of 3443 responded to this survey. The emergency dental situation participants were most willing to go to the dental clinic for was trauma involving facial bones compromising the airway (94.5%). Only 65.8% were willing to seek care for facial cellulitis compromising the airway. On average 35.2% reported seeking teleconsultation as the first step. Eighteen percent of participants were still willing to go to the dental clinic during the pandemic for routine dental procedures. Multiple logistic regression showed that females (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.6, OR 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), people who had never visited a dentist (OR: 1.8, OR 95% CI 1.3, 2.5), and people living in metropolitan regions (OR: 1.8, OR 95%: 1.4, 2.3) had higher odds for not seeking emergency dental care during this pandemic. The pain threshold for seeking dental care during the pandemic was 7 out of 10. Female, those who never visited a dentist, and those from urban regions reported higher pain threshold before seeking dental care (P value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Social disparities were found in emergency dental care seeking decision-making in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was alarming that some people were afraid to seek dental care for life-threatening dental emergencies as cellulitis during this pandemic. This reflects the importance of increasing public health awareness and governmental regulations.

We observed OxPL production in the lungs of humans and animals infected with SARS, Anthrax, or H5N1. Pulmonary challenge with an inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus rapidly induces ALI and OxPL formation in mice. Loss of TLR4 or TRIF expression protects mice from H5N1-induced ALI. Moreover, deletion of ncf1, which controls ROS production, improves the severity of H5N1-mediated ALI.

Human vaccine preparation requires the use of appropriate cell substrates to support the efficient production of a seed vaccine with minimum concerns of tumorigenicity, oncogenicity, or adventitious agents. Vero cells, which were derived from the African green monkey kidney, represent one of the few mammalian cell lines that are used for vaccine manufacturing. This study demonstrates the rescue of RVF virus (RVFV) MP-12 infectious clones in Vero cells using plasmids encoding the Macaca mulatta RNA polymerase I promoter. Although Vero cells demonstrated an ∼20% transfection efficiency, only 0.5% of transfected cells showed the replication of viral genomic RNA, supported by the coexpression of RVFV N and L helper proteins. RVFV infectious clones were detectable in the culture supernatants at approximately 4 to 9 days posttransfection, reaching maximum titers during the following 5 days. The reamplification of rescued recombinant MP-12 (rMP-12) in Vero cells led to an increase in the genetic subpopulations, affecting the viral phenotype via amino acid substitutions in the NSs gene, whereas rMP-12 reamplified in human diploid MRC-5 cells did not increase viral subpopulations with NSs gene mutations. The strategy in which RVFV infectious clones are rescued in Vero cells and then subsequently amplified in MRC-5 cells will support the vaccine seed lot systems of live-attenuated recombinant RVFV vaccines for human use. IMPORTANCE RVF is a mosquito-transmitted, viral, zoonotic disease endemic to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and its spread outside the area of endemicity will potentially cause devastating economic damage and serious public health problems. Different from classical live-attenuated vaccines, live-attenuated recombinant vaccines allow rational improvement of vaccine production efficiency, protective efficacy, and vaccine safety via genetic engineering. This study demonstrated the generation of infectious Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus from cloned cDNA using Vero cells, which are one of a few mammalian cell lines used for vaccine manufacturing. Subsequent reamplification of virus clones in Vero cells unexpectedly increased viral subpopulations encoding unfavorable mutations, whereas viral reamplification in human diploid MRC-5 cells could minimize the emergence of such mutants. Rescue of recombinant RVFV from Vero cells and reamplification in MRC-5 cells will support the vaccine seed lot systems of live-attenuated recombinant RVFV vaccines for human use.","Ikegami, Tetsuro",J Virol,595,5

The most effective intervention measure will be to develop safe and effective vaccines to protect the population from the disease and limit the spread of the virus. An inactivated, whole virus vaccine candidate of SARS-CoV-2 has been developed by Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Wuhan Institute of Virology. The low toxicity, immunogenicity, and immune persistence were investigated in preclinical studies using seven different species of animals. The results showed that the vaccine candidate was well tolerated and stimulated high levels of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Low or no toxicity in three species of animals was also demonstrated in preclinical study of the vaccine candidate. Biochemical analysis of structural proteins and purity analysis were performed. The inactivated, whole virion vaccine was characterized with safe double-inactivation, no use of DNases and high purity. Dosages, boosting times, adjuvants, and immunization schedules were shown to be important for stimulating a strong humoral immune response in animals tested. Preliminary observation in ongoing phase I and II clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in Wuzhi County, Henan Province, showed that the vaccine is well tolerant. The results were characterized by very low proportion and low degree of side effects, high levels of neutralizing antibodies, and seroconversion.

The primary outcomes were seroprotection (SP), seroconversion (SC), and/or seroresponse rates for each type of vaccine reported. As the pandemic influenza vaccine (2009 H1N1) has standardized definitions for SP and SC, and represented a novel primary antigen similar to the COVID-19 vaccine, meta-analysis was conducted for SC of studies of this vaccine. Pooled estimates, relative benefit ratios (RBs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Thirty-eight studies (905 patients treated with anti-CD20 therapy) were included (19 studies of patients with hematologic malignancies). Patients on active (<3 months since last dose) anti-CD20 therapy had poor responses to all types of vaccines. The pooled estimate for SC after 1 pandemic influenza vaccine dose in these patients was 3% (95% CI, 0% to 9%), with an RB of 0.05 (95% CI, 0-0.73) compared with healthy controls and 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09-0.56) compared with disease controls.

Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 US cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly nonuniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform health care planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.","Thomas, Loring J.; Huang, Peng; Yin, Fan; Luo, Xiaoshuang Iris; Almquist, Zack W.; Hipp, John R.; Butts, Carter T.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,595,16

In Portugal, before COVID-19 Pandemic, there were strong indicators of high prevalence of burnout in physicians and nurses. However, the Portuguese Health Care Service was able to efficiently respond to the increased demands. This study intends to understand how psychosocial variables might have been protective factors for burnout in physicians and nurses in Portugal. Specifically, we considered several psychosocial variables that have been found to be protective factors for burnout in previous research and we compared their predictive and unique impact in the prediction of burnout. These variables are perceptions of justice (distributive, procedural, justice from colleagues, justice from patients, and their families), professional identification, meaningful work and empathy. We also included workload, as a risk factor, and controlled other variables that can be confounds for burnout, such as socio-demographic variables, ideological variables (religiosity, political orientation), and specific variables related with COVID-19 pandemic. The sample of the present study is composed by 229 physicians (aged between 23 and 70 years old, M = 36.54; SD = 10.72; 48% male and 52% female) and 268 nurses (aged between 22 and 69 years old, M = 34.96; SD = 9.52; 27% male and 73% female). An online survey was created using Qualtrics and participants were recruited via Facebook and LinkedIn. The data were collected during 29 days (between the 45th and the 74th days after the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 in Portugal). The results showed that workload was a significant risk factor, except for disengagement in physicians. The most consistent protectors across samples were procedural justice (for both dimensions of burnout, both in physicians and nurses) and professional identification (for disengagement, both in physicians and nurses; for exhaustion only in physicians). This study suggests that decreasing workload and promoting procedural justice and professional identification are key factors that might be simultaneously and independently addressed in interventions for reducing the risk of burnout or preventing it from occurring in the first place.","Correia, Isabel; Almeida, Andreia E.",Front Psychol,595,16

It is applied widly for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, diarrhea, acute hepatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease and ulcerative colitis in clinic. Two species, namely Patrinia scabiosaefolia Fisch. (PS) and Patrinia villosa Juss. (PV) from the Caprifoliaceae family, are considered as Herba Patriniae in the pharmaceutical industry. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This paper aims to comprehensively outline the traditional uses, botanical description, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, quality control, pharmacokinetics and patents of Herba Patriniae, and elaborate the same/different characteristics between PS and PV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detailed information of Herba Patriniae was collected from various online databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Google Schola, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, National Intellectual Property Administration, PRC National Medical Products Administration), and those published resources (M.Sc. Thesis and books). RESULTS: A total of 233 compounds have been identified in Herba Patriniae, including triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids, organic acids, iridoids, and volatiles. A very distinct difference was observed, that PS is rich in triterpenoid saponins and volatiles, while PV contains more flavonoids. Two source species of Herba Patriniae gave similar pharmacological effects on anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, sedative and hypnotic effects. But there were no reports were on antipruritic, proangiogenic and anti-diarrheal effects for PS, and no studies on anti-diabetic effects for PV. Generally, Herba Patriniae showed non-toxic in the clinical dose, but mild side effects, such as temporary leukopenia, dizziness and nausea, could be found when large and excessive dosage is used. A variety of compounds have been quantified for the quality control of PS and PV. The variety, growth environment, growth time, and harvest time not only affected the contents but also the pharmacological activities of the bioactive compounds. In the past year, patents for compositions containing PV and PS have been filed, mainly involving human health, hygiene, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Unfortunately, the research on pharmacokinetics is insufficient. Only the prototype components and metabolites were repored after intragastric administration of total flavonoids extract from PV in rats. CONCLUSION: Herba Patriniae has displayed a significant medicinal value in clinic, but the differences in phytochemistry, pharmacological effects and the content of compounds have been found between two official recorded species. About side effects and pharmacokinetic characteristics, the differeces between two species have not been well studied. For a better clinical use of Herba Patriniae, it is urgent to establish systematic pharmacology, quality control, pharmacokinetics, and clinical researches on the same/different characteristics between PS and PV.","Gong, Linna; Zou, Wei; Zheng, Keyang; Shi, Birui; Liu, Menghua",J Ethnopharmacol,595,21

In Korea, non-hospital facilities called “living and treatment centers (LTCs)” have been established since 5 March 2020. The LTCs provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the safety of selection criteria for low-risk groups. METHODS: Between 5 March and 9 April 2020, patients with COVID-19 who met the following criteria were admitted to the LTC; alert, age below 65 years old, no underlying disease or well-controlled underlying disease, body temperature below 38.0°C, whether taking antipyretics or not, and no dyspnea. Patients were closely observed by doctors or nurses’ interviews twice a day and transferred to hospitals when symptoms worsened. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were admitted to the LTC; 52.2% were female, with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range, 21.5 to 39.5). Of 113 patients, 54 (47.8%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15 (13.3%) had no symptoms until they were released from isolation. During the follow-up period, two (1.8%) patients were transferred to a hospital but did not progress to severe status during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of progression was negligible in COVID-19 patients who met the admission criteria for LTC at the time of diagnosis. LTCs could be a safe alternative considering shortage of hospital beds.","Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Kang, Eun Kyo; Lee, Sun Young; Oh, Boram; Im, Dahae; Lee, Hyo Yeon; Jung, Hyemin; Kang, Chang Kyung; Kim, Min Sun; Park, Wan Beom; Choi, Eun Hwa; Cho, BeLong; Oh, Myoung-don; Kim, Nam Joong",Korean J Intern Med,595,32

However, existing studies on brain magnetic resonance imaging lesion segmentation focus on large lesions with obvious features, such as glioma and acute cerebral infarction. Owing to the multi-model tiny lesion areas of FCI and LACI, reliable and precise segmentation and/or detection of these lesion areas is still a significant challenge task. METHODS: We propose a novel segmentation correction algorithm for estimating the lesion areas via segmentation and correction processes, in which we design two sub-models simultaneously: a segmentation network and a correction network. The segmentation network was first used to extract and segment diseased areas on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Consequently, the correction network was used to classify these areas at the corresponding locations on T1 FLAIR images to distinguish between FCI and LACI. Finally, the results of the correction network were used to correct the segmentation results and achieve segmentation and recognition of the lesion areas. RESULTS: In our experiment on magnetic resonance images of 113 clinical patients, our method achieved a precision of 91.76% for detection and 92.89% for classification, indicating a powerful method to distinguish between small lesions, such as FCI and LACI. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we developed a complete method for segmentation and detection of WMHs related to FCI and LACI. The experimental results show that it has potential clinical application potential. In the future, we will collect more clinical data and test more types of tiny lesions at the same time.","Liu, Yue; Li, Xiang; Li, Tianyang; Li, Bin; Wang, Zhensong; Gan, Jie; Wei, Benzheng",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,595,22

COVID-19 patients with hypertension were enrolled to evaluate the effect of RAS inhibitors. We observed that patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy had a lower rate of severe diseases and a trend toward a lower level of IL-6 in peripheral blood. In addition, ACEI or ARB therapy increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in peripheral blood and decreased the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs.

We show here that 6-Thioguanine (6-TG), an orally available and widely available generic drug, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-E6 cells with an EC50 of approximately 2 μM. 6-TG also inhibited PLpro-catalyzed polyprotein cleavage and de-ISGylation in cells and inhibited proteolytic activity of the purified PLpro domain in vitro.

However, the precise evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 microevolution in host is very limited because the exact genetic information of infected virus could not be acquired in human researches. In this report, we performed deep sequencing for seed virus and SARS-CoV-2 isolated in eight cynomolgus and rhesus macaques at 3 days postinoculation and evaluated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SARS-CoV-2 by variant analysis. A total of 69 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were present in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR), 3′-UTR, ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, ORF8, and N genes of the seed virus passaged in VERO cells. Between those present on the seed virus and those on each SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the lungs of the macaques, a total of 29 variants was identified in 4 coding proteins (ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, and N) and non-coding regions (5′- and 3′-UTR). Variant number was significantly different according to individuals and ranged from 2 to 11. Moreover, the average major frequency variation was identified in six sites between the cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques.

The mechanism of organ tropism and innate immune evasion of DPV has not been completely deciphered due to a lack of cell models to study the innate immune manipulation and pathogenicity of aquatic viruses. In the present study, we isolated five types of duck primary cells [duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), neurons, astrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocytes/macrophages] to identify appropriate cell models for DPV, using tropism infection and innate immunologic assays. Cells responded differently to stimulation with DNA viruses or RNA virus analogs. DPV infection exhibited broad tropism, as the recombinant virulent strain (CHv-GFP) infected DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, but not the PBMCs, as the expression of EGFP was negligible. The basal levels of innate immunity molecules were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lower in DEFs and astrocytes. Conversely, the titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain was higher in DEFs and astrocytes than in neurons and monocytes/macrophages. The titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain were higher compared with the virulent strain in DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes. The innate immune response was not significantly induced by either DPV strain in DEFs, neurons, or astrocytes. The virulent strain persistently infected monocytes/macrophages, but the attenuated strain did so abortively, and this was accompanied by the phenomenon of innate immune inhibition and activation by the virulent and attenuated strains, respectively. Blockage of IFNAR signaling promoted replication of the attenuated strain. Pre-activation of IFNAR signaling inhibited infection by the virulent strain. The selection assay results indicated that induction of innate immunity plays an essential role in controlling DPV infection, and monocytes/macrophages are an important cell model for further investigations. Our study provided practical methods for isolating and culturing duck primary cells, and our results will facilitate further investigations of organ tropism, innate immune responses, latent infection, and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating DPV and potentially other aerial bird pathogens.","Tian, Bin; Cai, Dongjie; He, Tianqiong; Deng, Liyao; Wu, Liping; Wang, Mingshu; Jia, Renyong; Zhu, Dekang; Liu, Mafeng; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Zhao, Xinxin; Chen, Shun; Zhang, Shaqiu; Huang, Juan; Ou, Xumin; Mao, Sai; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling; Liu, Yunya; Cheng, Anchun",Front Immunol,595,20

It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114698 lives overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays. METHODS: In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. RESULTS: CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal), the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available. CONCLUSION: CoroNet achieved promising results on a small prepared dataset which indicates that given more data, the proposed model can achieve better results with minimum pre-processing of data. Overall, the proposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.","Khan, Asif Iqbal; Shah, Junaid Latief; Bhat, Mohammad Mudasir",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,595,21

The specific immunoglobulin G antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 in severe and critically ill patients were significantly lower than that in regular patients (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that the lymphocyte counts, red blood cell counts and the immunoglobulin G antibodies of COVID-19 patients were impaired to varying degrees and the blood was in a state of hypercoagulation, which were more obvious in critically ill patients.

We analyzed factors related to vaccination efficiency in KTRs. In a multicenter prospective observational study (NCT04743947), IgG antibodies levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit and their neutralization capacity after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were analyzed in 225 KTRs and compared to 176 controls. After the vaccination, 56 (24.9%) KTRs became seropositive of whom 68% had neutralizing antibodies. This immune response was significantly lower compared to controls [239 (78-519) BAU/ml versus 1826 (560-3180) BAU/ml for KTRs and controls, p<0.0001]. The strongest predictor for an impaired response was mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that MMF-free regimen was highly associated with seroconversion (OR 13.25, 95% CI 3.22-54.6; p<0.001). In contrast, other immunosuppressive drugs had no significant influence. 187 out of 225 KTRs were treated with MMF of whom 26 (13.9%) developed antibodies. 23 of these seropositive KTRs had a daily MMF dose ≤1g. Furthermore, higher trough MMF concentrations correlated with lower antibody titers (R -0.354, p<0.001) supporting a dose-dependent unfavorable effect of MMF. Our data indicate that MMF dose modification could lead to an improved immune response.","Kantauskaite, Marta; Müller, Lisa; Kolb, Thilo; Fischer, Svenja; Hillebrandt, Jonas; Ivens, Katrin; Andree, Marcel; Luedde, Tom; Orth, Hans Martin; Adams, Ortwin; Schaal, Heiner; Schmidt, Claudia; Königshausen, Eva; Rump, Lars C; Timm, Jörg; Stegbauer, Johannes",Am. j. transplant,595,1

Both are complex and urgent problems that demand collective action in the light of their global and trans-boundary scope. In this article we use a geopolitical framework to examine some of the tensions and contradictions in global governance and cooperation that are revealed by the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We argue that the pandemic provides an early warning of the dangers inherent in weakened international cooperation. The world’s states, with their distinct national territories, are reacting individually rather than collectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries have introduced extraordinary measures that have closed, rather than opened up, international partnership and cooperation. Border closures, restrictions on social mixing, domestic purchase of public health supplies and subsidies for local industry and commerce may offer solutions at the national level but they do not address the global strategic issues. For the poorest countries of the world, pandemics join a list of other challenges that are exacerbated by pressures of scarce resources, population density and climate disruption. COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on those living with environmental stresses, such as poor air quality, should guide more holistic approaches to the geopolitical intersection of public health and climate change. By discussing unhealthy geopolitics, we highlight the urgent need for a coordinated global response to addressing challenges that cannot be approached unilaterally.","Cole, Jennifer; Dodds, Klaus",Bull World Health Organ,595,19

To determine whether the renin-angiotensin inhibition regulates ACE2 expression, either enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or losartan (an AT1 receptor blocker) was infused subcutaneously to male C57BL/6J mice for two weeks. Neither enalapril nor losartan changed abundance of ACE2 mRNA in lung, ileum, kidney, and heart. Viral entry also depends on transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to prime the S protein. TMPRSS2 mRNA was abundant in lungs and ileum, modest in kidney, but barely detectable in heart. TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance was not altered by either enalapril or losartan in any of the 4 tissues. Next, we determined whether depletion of angiotensinogen (AGT), the unique substrate of the renin-angiotensin system, changes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance. AGT antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) were injected subcutaneously to male C57BL/6J mice for 3 weeks. Abundance of ACE2 mRNA was unchanged in any of the 4 tissues, but TMPRSS2 mRNA was significantly decreased in lungs. Our data support that the renin-angiotensin inhibition does not regulate ACE2 and hence are not likely to increase risk for COVID-19.","Wu, Congqing; Ye, Dien; Mullick, Adam E.; Li, Zhenyu; Danser, A.H.

We collected laboratory, microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with galactomannan-antigen-detection from bronchial aspirates. We used logistic regression analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with matched controls. Findings: CAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11/32 (34%) of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort.

Mental healthcare delivery in low and middle income countries where resources were already limited are likely to be affected more during this pandemic. This paper describes the efforts of ensuring mental healthcare delivery is continued in a referral hospital in Kenya, Moi Teaching and Referral hospital, as well as the challenges faced. These efforts are guided by the interim guidelines developed by the Kenyan ministry of health. Some of the adjustments described includes reducing number of patients admitted, shortening the stay in the inpatient setting, using outdoors for therapy to promote physical distancing, utilization of electronic platforms for family therapy sessions, strengthening outpatient services, and supporting primary care workers to deliver mental health care services. Some of the challenges include limited ability to move about, declining ability for patients to pay out of pocket due to the economic challenges brought about by measures to control Covid-19, limited drug supplies in primary care facilities, inability to fully implement telehealth due to connectivity issues and stigma for mental health which results in poor social support for the mentally ill patients. It is clear that current pandemic has jeopardized the continuity of usual mental healthcare in many settings. This has brought to sharp focus the need to decentralize mental health care and promote community based services. Meanwhile, there is need to explore feasible alternatives to ensure continuity of care.","Kwobah, Edith; Jaguga, Florence; Robert, Kiptoo; Ndolo, Elias; Kariuki, Jane",Front Psychiatry,595,1

OBJECTIVE: To examine outcomes and risk factors associated with COVID-19 clinical severity in a large, diverse cohort of North American patients with MS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This analysis used deidentified, cross-sectional data on patients with MS and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by health care professionals in North American academic and community practices between April 1, 2020, and December 12, 2020, in the COVID-19 Infections in MS Registry. Health care professionals were asked to report patients after a minimum of 7 days from initial symptom onset and after sufficient time had passed to observe the COVID-19 disease course through resolution of acute illness or death. Data collection began April 1, 2020, and is ongoing. EXPOSURES: Laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection or highly suspected COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcome with 4 levels of increasing severity: not hospitalized, hospitalization only, admission to the intensive care unit and/or required ventilator support, and death. RESULTS: Of 1626 patients, most had laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (1345 [82.7%]), were female (1202 [74.0%]), and had relapsing-remitting MS (1255 [80.4%]). A total of 996 patients (61.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 337 (20.8%) were Black, and 190 (11.7%) were Hispanic/Latinx. The mean (SD) age was 47.7 (13.2) years, and 797 (49.5%) had 1 or more comorbidity. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%). Ambulatory disability and older age were each independently associated with increased odds of all clinical severity levels compared with those not hospitalized after adjusting for other risk factors (nonambulatory: hospitalization only, odds ratio [OR], 2.8 [95% CI, 1.6-4.8]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.6-7.8]; death, OR, 25.4 [95% CI, 9.3-69.1]; age [every 10 years]: hospitalization only, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.99-1.7]; death, OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this registry-based cross-sectional study, increased disability was independently associated with worse clinical severity including death from COVID-19. Other risk factors for worse outcomes included older age, Black race, cardiovascular comorbidities, and recent treatment with corticosteroids. Knowledge of these risk factors may improve the treatment of patients with MS and COVID-19 by helping clinicians identify patients requiring more intense monitoring or COVID-19 treatment.","Salter, Amber; Fox, Robert J.; Newsome, Scott D.; Halper, June; Li, David K.

However, it remains unknown how chromatin dynamics contributes to or modulates disease pathogenesis. Here, we show that upon influenza virus infection, the H4K20me3 methyltransferase Suv4-20h2 binds the viral protein NP, which results in the inactivation of Suv4-20h2 and the dissociation of cohesin from Suv4-20h2. Inactivation of Suv4-20h2 by viral infection or genetic deletion allows the formation of an active chromatin loop at the HoxC8-HoxC6 loci coincident with cohesin loading. HoxC8 and HoxC6 proteins in turn enhance viral replication by inhibiting the Wnt-β-catenin mediated interferon response. Importantly, loss of Suv4-20h2 augments the pathology of influenza infection in vivo. Thus, Suv4-20h2 acts as a safeguard against influenza virus infection by suppressing cohesin-mediated loop formation.","Shiimori, Masami; Ichida, Yu; Nukiwa, Ryota; Sakuma, Toshie; Abe, Haruka; Kajitani, Rei; Fujino, Yuji; Kikuchi, Akira; Kawamura, Takeshi; Kodama, Tatsuhiko; Toyooka, Shinichi; Shirahige, Katsuhiko; Schotta, Gunnar; Kuba, Keiji; Itoh, Takehiko; Imai, Yumiko",iScience,595,16

CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are essential to control infectious virus but at the cost of tissue damage. An enigma in understanding the contribution of T cell subsets in pathogenesis resides in their distinct migration pattern across the BBB (blood brain barrier). CD4(+) T cells transiently accumulate within the perivascular space, whereas CD8(+) T cells migrate directly into the CNS parenchyma. As MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) facilitate migration across the glia limitans, specific expression of the TIMP (tissue inhibitor of MMPs)-1 by CD4(+) T cells present in the perivascular cuffs suggested that TIMP-1 is responsible for stalling CD4(+) T cell migration into the CNS parenchyma. Using TIMP-1 deficient mice, the present data demonstrate an increase rather than a decrease in CD4(+) T cell accumulation within the perivascular space during JHMV infection. Whereas virus control was not affected by perivascular retention of CD4(+) T cells, disease severity was decreased and associated with reduced IFNγ (interferon γ) production. Moreover, decreased CD4(+) T cell recruitment into the CNS parenchyma of TIMP-1 deficient mice was not associated with impaired T cell recruiting chemokines or MMP expression, and no compensation by other TIMP molecules was identified. These data suggest an MMP-independent role of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4(+) T cell access into the CNS parenchyma during acute JHMV encephalitis.","Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C.; Hinton, David R.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",ASN Neuro,595,24

Also, antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae is progressively being involved in invasive infections with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of the current study was to determine antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the incidence of resistance genes (integron types and ß-lactamase-encoded genes) among clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 100 clinical samples were obtained from hospitalized patients in three teaching hospitals in the north of Iran, from November 2018 and October 2019. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using disk agar diffusion test in line with CLSI recommendations. For colistin, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using broth microdilution. Based on antibiogram, multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensive-drug resistant (XDR) strains were detected. Finally, integron types and ß-lactamase resistance genes were identified using polymerase chain reaction technique. RESULTS: The most and least clinical samples were related to the urine and bronchoalveolar lavage, respectively. Based on the antibiogram results, amikacin and gentamicin exhibited good activity against K. pneumoniae strains in vitro. The high resistance rate (93%) to ampicillin/sulbactam predicts the limited efficacy of this antibiotic, in the hospitals studied. Among all the 100 isolates, the frequency of MDR and XDR phenotypes were 58% and 13%, respectively, while no pan-drug resistant (PDR) strains were found. In the MDR K. pneumoniae strains, the prevalence of blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-15, blaKPC, blaOXA-48, blaNDM ß-lactamase genes were 91.4%, 82.7%, 79.3%, 29.3%, 36.2% and 6.9%, respectively, however 91.4% of the isolates were carrying intI gene. Class II and III integrons were not detected in any isolates. CONCLUSION: The MDR K. pneumoniae is becoming a serious problem in hospitals, with many strains developing resistance to most available antimicrobials. Our results indicate co-presence of a series of ß-lactamase and integron types on the MDR strains recovered from hospitalized patients. The increasing rate of these isolates emphasizes the importance of choosing an appropriate antimicrobial regimen based on antibiotic susceptibility pattern.","Farhadi, Mojgan; Ahanjan, Mohammad; Goli, Hamid Reza; Haghshenas, Mohammad Reza; Gholami, Mehrdad",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,595,11

In Bangladesh, rate of new infection has been on the rise despite limited testing facility. Constraint of resources in the healthcare sector makes the fight against Covid more challenging for a developing country like Bangladesh. Vascular surgeons find themselves in a precarious situation while delivering professional services during this crisis. With the limited number of dedicated vascular surgeons in Bangladesh, it is important to safeguard these professionals without compromising emergency vascular care services in the long term. To this end, we, at the National Institute of cardiovascular diseases and hospital (NICVD), Dhaka have developed a working guideline for our vascular surgeons to follow during the Covid-19 pandemic. The guideline takes into account high vascular work volume against limited resources in the country. METHODS: A total of 307 emergency vascular patients were dealt with in the first 4 Covid months (March through June, 2020) according to the working guideline and the results compared with the 4 pre-Covid months. Vascular trauma, dialysis access complications and chronic limb threatening ischemia formed the main bulk of the patient population. Vascular healthcare workers were regularly screened for Covid-19 infection. RESULTS: There was a 38% decrease in the number of patients in the Covid period. Treatment outcome in Covid months were comparable with that in the pre-Covid months except that limb loss in the CLTI patients was higher. Covid infection among the vascular healthcare professionals was low. CONCLUSION: Vascular surgery practice guideline customized for the high work volume and limited resources of NICVD was effective in delivering emergency care in during Covid-19 pandemic ensuring safety of the caregivers. Despite the fact that similar guidelines exist in different parts of the world, we believe that the present one is still relevant on the premises of a deepening Covid-19 crisis in a developing country like Bangladesh.","Bashar, Abul Hasan Muhammad; Hakim, Md Enamul; Rahman, Md Mokhlesur; Dey, Nirmal Kanti; Hasan, Minhazul; Islam, Md.

However, the result of different studies is heterogeneous. The aim of this study was to evaluate the methylation pattern in cord blood in relation to pet ownership during pregnancy. We investigated the methylation patterns of 96 cord blood samples, participants of the Epigenetic Hallmark of Maternal Atopy and Diet—ELMA project, born to mothers who either owned pets (n = 32) or did not own pets (n = 64) during their pregnancy. DNA from cord blood was analysed using the Infinium methylation EPIC. For statistical analysis, RnBeads software was applied. We found 113 differentially methylated sites (DMs) in the covariate-adjusted analysis (FDR p < 0.05), with small methylation differences. The top DMs were associated with genes: UBA7, THRAP3, GTDC1, PDE8A and SBK2. In the regional analysis, two promoter regions presented with significance: RN7SL621P and RNU6-211P. Cis-regulatory element analysis revealed significant associations with several immune-related pathways, such as regulation of IL18, Toll signalling, IL6 and complement. We conclude that pet exposure during pregnancy causes subtle but significant changes in methylation patterns in cord blood, which are reflected in the biological processes governing both innate and adaptive immune responses.","Danielewicz, Hanna; Gurgul, Artur; Dębińska, Anna; Myszczyszyn, Grzegorz; Szmatoła, Tomasz; Myszkal, Anna; Jasielczuk, Igor; Drabik-Chamerska, Anna; Hirnle, Lidia; Boznański, Andrzej",Genes Immun,595,20
