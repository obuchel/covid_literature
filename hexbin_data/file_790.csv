36451,Sedation with ketamine and fentanyl combination improves patient outcomes in intensive care units,2020-07-10,"Place recognition is an important step in intelligent driving, allowing the vehicle recognize where it is to plan its route. Obtaining distinguishable features can ensure the success of image-based place recognition. However, generating robust features across drastically appearance changing images is still a challenging problem. Deep features are frequently chosen instead of local features in the tasks of place recognition following the development of convolutional neural networks. But even the deep features generated by powerful neural models can cause unsatisfactory recognition results. This is perhaps due to a lack of information selecting process. The technology of semantic segmentation allows recognizing and classifying image information. Semantic segmentation followed by image inpainting provide a possibility of detecting, deleting and reconstructing annoying information. This paper proves that dynamic information present in images such as vehicles and pedestrians damages the performance of place recognition and proposes a feature extraction system that includes a step to decrease the presence of dynamic information of an image. This system is composed of two stages: 1) dynamic objects detection and removing, 2) image inpainting to reconstruct the background of removed regions. Objects detection and removing consists of deleting unstable objects recognized by semantic segmentation method from images. Image inpainting and reconstructing deals with generating inpaint-images by repairing missing regions through image inpainting method. The robustness of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing to the non-selecting deep feature based place recognition approaches over three datasets.","Liu, Linrunjia; Cappelle, Cindy; Ruichek, Yassine",Image and Signal Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340885/,790
38252,Reply,2020-08-25,"Propositional model counting is a classic problem that has recently witnessed many technical advances and novel applications. While the basic model counting problem requires computing the number of all solutions to the given formula, in some important application scenarios, the desired count is not of all solutions, but instead, of all unique solutions up to isomorphism. In such a scenario, the user herself must try to either use the full count that the model counter returns to compute the count up to isomorphism, or ensure that the input formula to the model counter adequately captures the symmetry breaking predicates so it can directly report the count she desires. We study the use of CNF-level and domain-level symmetry breaking predicates in the context of the state-of-the-art in model counting, specifically the leading approximate model counter ApproxMC and the recently introduced exact model counter ProjMC. As benchmarks, we use a range of problems, including structurally complex specifications of software systems and constraint satisfaction problems. The results show that while it is sometimes feasible to compute the model counts up to isomorphism using the full counts that are computed by the model counters, doing so suffers from poor scalability. The addition of symmetry breaking predicates substantially assists model counters. Domain-specific predicates are particularly useful, and in many cases can provide full symmetry breaking to enable highly efficient model counting up to isomorphism. We hope our study motivates new research on designing model counters that directly account for symmetries to facilitate further applications of model counting.","Wang, Wenxi; Usman, Muhammad; Almaawi, Alyas; Wang, Kaiyuan; Meel, Kuldeep S.; Khurshid, Sarfraz",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439727/,790

The placenta serves as a gatekeeper between mother and fetus. Knowledge regarding the barrier capacity of the placenta for nanoparticles is limited, mostly due to technical obstacles and ethical issues. We systematically summarize and discuss the current evidence and define knowledge gaps concerning the maternal-fetal transport and fetoplacental accumulation of (ultra)fine particles and nanoparticles. We included 73 studies on placental translocation of particles, of which 21 in vitro/ex vivo studies, 50 animal studies, and 2 human studies on transplacental particle transfer. This systematic review shows that (i) (ultra)fine particles and engineered nanoparticles can bypass the placenta and reach fetal units as observed for all the applied models irrespective of the species origin (i.e., rodent, rabbit, or human) or the complexity (i.e., in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo), (ii) particle size, particle material, dose, particle dissolution, gestational stage of the model, and surface composition influence maternal-fetal translocation, and (iii) no simple, standardized method for nanoparticle detection and/or quantification in biological matrices is available to date.

64563,Assessment of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women.,2021-04-25,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disease that starts at a focal point and gradually spreads to other parts of the nervous system. One of the main clinical symptoms of ALS is muscle weakness. To study spreading patterns of muscle weakness, we analyze spatiotemporal binary muscle strength data, which indicates whether observed muscle strengths are impaired or healthy. We propose a hidden Markov model-based approach that assumes the observed disease status depends on two latent disease states. The model enables us to estimate the incidence rate of ALS disease and the probability of disease state transition. Specifically, the latter is modeled by a logistic autoregression in that the spatial network of susceptible muscles follows a Markov process. The proposed model is flexible to allow both historical muscle conditions and their spatial relationships to be included in the analysis. To estimate the model parameters, we provide an iterative algorithm to maximize sparse-penalized likelihood with bias correction, and use the Viterbi algorithm to label hidden disease states. We apply the proposed approach to analyze the ALS patients' data from EMPOWER Study.","Shin, Yei Eun; Liu, Dawei; Sang, Huiyan; Ferguson, Toby A; Song, Peter X K",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763884/,790
70560,Rescuers' physical fatigue with different chest compression to ventilation methods during simulated infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation.,2016,"BACKGROUND Despite existing best practice care recommendations for addressing tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and weight management in preconception and antenatal care, such recommendations are often not implemented into routine practice. Effective strategies that target known barriers to implementation are key to reducing this evidence to practice gap. The aim of this review is to synthesise the evidence on the effectiveness of implementation strategies in improving the provision of preconception and antenatal care for these modifiable risk factors. METHODS Randomised and non-randomised study designs will be eligible for inclusion if they have a parallel control group. We will include studies that either compare an implementation strategy to usual practice or compare two or more strategies. Participants may include any health service providing preconception or antenatal care to women and/or the health professionals working within such a service. The primary outcome will be any measure of the effectiveness of implementation strategies to improve preconception and/or antenatal care for tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and/or weight management (including care to improve nutrition and/or physical activity). Secondary outcomes will include the effect of the implementation strategy on women's modifiable risk factors, estimates of absolute costs or cost-effectiveness and any reported unintentional consequences. Eligible studies will be identified via searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Maternity and Infant Care, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses and other sources (e.g. contacting experts in the field). Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias will be assessed independently by two review authors and differences resolved by a third reviewer. If data permits, we will conduct fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis where appropriate. If studies do not report the same outcome or there is significant heterogeneity, results will be summarised narratively. DISCUSSION This review will identify which implementation strategies are effective in improving the routine provision of preconception and antenatal care for tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and weight management. Such a review will be of interest to service providers, policy makers and implementation researchers seeking to improve women's modifiable risk factors in preconception and antenatal care settings.

71224,Multiple organ failure syndrome in the newborn: morphological and immunohistochemical data.,2012,"BACKGROUND since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of developing a serological test has emerged and a debate on test accuracy and reliability become an issue widely discussed in the media. The importance of communication during this pandemic has been strongly underlined by public health experts, epidemiologists, media expert, psychologists, sociologists. In the case of serological tests, there are several aspects that have to be considered: why we perform the test, what population is tested, which are the parameters conditioning the results and their interpretation. OBJECTIVES to show how to quantify the uncertainty related to the validity of the serological test with respect to its predictive value and in particular the positive predictive value. METHODS the evaluation of a qualitative diagnostic test includes four distinct assessments: accuracy, empirical evidence, practical importance, and prevalence of the pathology. Accuracy is measured by the sensitivity and specificity of the test; empirical evidence is quantified by the likelihood ratio, respectively for a positive and negative test result; the practical importance of the result of a diagnostic test is assessed by the positive or negative predictive value. Prevalence of COVID-19 is substantial uncertainty and it is possible to estimate the apparent prevalence starting from the results obtained with a diagnostic test. RESULTS at the moment, the knowledge about the accuracy of serological tests is limited and little attention is paid to confidence interval on point estimates. In terms of practical importance of testing at individual level, while negative predictive values are high whatever the level of sensitivity of the test, the interpretation of a positive results is very cumbersome. Positive predictive values above 90% can be reached only by tests with specificity above 99% at the expected prevalence rate of 5%. There is a linear relationship between apparent - testing positive - prevalence and real prevalence. The apparent prevalence in the context of serological test for COVID-19 is always larger than real prevalence. The level of specificity is crucial. CONCLUSIONS the main applications of the serological test in the epidemic contest are: to study the seroprevalence of the virus antibodies in the general population; to screen the healthcare workers for the early identification of contagious subjects' health care settings and to screen the general population in order to identify new incident cases. In the first two cases, seroprevalence study and screening of a high-risk population, the consequences of the uncertainty associated to the statistics are already accounted for in the first situation, or are overcome by repeating the screening on the healthcare workers, and using the molecular test to verify the presence of the virus in those tested positive. The case of screening of general population is more complex and of major interest for the implication it may have on individual behaviours and on the implementation of public health interventions by the political decision makers. A positive result has, per se, no practical value for individuals since the probability of being really infected by the virus is low. The uncertainty associated with the different estimates (sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) play a double role: it is a key factor in defining the informative content of the test result and it might guide the individual actions and the public policy decisions.","Biggeri, Annibale; Forni, Silvia; Braga, Mario",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412809/,790
72329,Respiratory inhibition after crying or gastroesophageal reflux and feeding hypoxemia in infants.,2016,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of primary constipation and fecal incontinence in the elderly. RECENT FINDINGS Among elderly people, 6.5%, 1.7%, and 1.1% have functional constipation, constipation-predominant IBS, and opioid-induced constipation. In elderly people, the number of colonic enteric neurons and smooth muscle functions is preserved; decreased cholinergic function with unopposed nitrergic relaxation may explain colonic motor dysfunction. Less physical activity or dietary fiber intake and postmenopausal hormonal therapy are risk factors for fecal incontinence in elderly people. Two thirds of patients with fecal incontinence respond to biofeedback therapy. Used in combination, loperamide and biofeedback therapy are more effective than placebo, education, and biofeedback therapy. Vaginal or anal insert devices are another option. In the elderly, constipation and fecal incontinence are common and often distressing symptoms that can often be managed by addressing bowel disturbances. Selected diagnostic tests, prescription medications, and, infrequently, surgical options should be considered when necessary.","Deb, Brototo; Prichard, David O; Bharucha, Adil E",Current gastroenterology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11894-020-00791-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839874/,790
73631,Early human milk lactoferrin during SARS-CoV-2 infection.,2021-05-09,"BACKGROUND Around 1 in 7 people in India are impacted by mental illness. The treatment gap for people with mental disorders is as high as 75-95%. Health care systems, especially in rural regions in India, face substantial challenges to address these gaps in care, and innovative strategies are needed. METHODS We hypothesise that an intervention involving an anti-stigma campaign and a mobile-technology-based electronic decision support system will result in reduced stigma and improved mental health for adults at high risk of common mental disorders. It will be implemented as a parallel-group cluster randomised, controlled trial in 44 primary health centre clusters servicing 133 villages in rural Andhra Pradesh and Haryana. Adults aged ‚â• 18 years will be screened for depression, anxiety and suicide based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7) scores. Two evaluation cohorts will be derived-a high-risk cohort with elevated PHQ-9, GAD-7 or suicide risk and a non-high-risk cohort comprising an equal number of people not at elevated risk based on these scores. Outcome analyses will be conducted blinded to intervention allocation. EXPECTED OUTCOMES The primary study outcome is the difference in mean behaviour scores at 12 months in the combined 'high-risk' and 'non-high-risk' cohort and the mean difference in PHQ-9 scores at 12 months in the 'high-risk' cohort. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety remission rates in the high-risk cohort at 6 and 12 months, the proportion of high-risk individuals who have visited a doctor at least once in the previous 12 months, and change from baseline in mean stigma, mental health knowledge and attitude scores in the combined non-high-risk and high-risk cohort. Trial outcomes will be accompanied by detailed economic and process evaluations. SIGNIFICANCE The findings are likely to inform policy on a low-cost scalable solution to destigmatise common mental disorders and reduce the treatment gap for under-served populations in low-and middle-income country settings.

74486,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnant women: a preliminary study.,2020-05-18,"The international wine market has been repeatedly hit by cases of fraud in recent decades. While several studies attested a special vulnerability of the fast growing wine business in China, reports on chemical analyses of commercial wine samples are rare. We examined 50 predominantly red wines with European labelling, which were purchased on the Chinese market, for fraud-relevant parameters. More than 20% of the tested samples revealed anomalies in relation to the stable isotope ratios of D/H, 18O/16O and 13C/12C, contents of technical glycerol by-products or anthocyanin composition. These results strongly suggested watering of the wines, chaptalisation, glycerol addition or the use of non-Vitis anthocyanin sources, respectively. Some of these samples also showed suspicious spelling errors or other irregularities in the labelling, but the majority appeared genuine to the eye. Hence, this spot check demonstrates the importance of chemical authenticity analysis of market samples in order to detect fraudulent products. Moreover, we used the same sample set for an evaluation of the Chinese standard method for carbon stable isotope determination of wine ethanol in comparison to the current OIV (International Organisation of Vine and Wine) standard method. The results of a Bland-Altman analysis indicated that the methods can be applied interchangeably. As the two methods differ in their workflow and in the requested equipment, this might eventually enable more laboratories to perform 13C/12C analysis of wine and spirits.","M√ºller, Teresa M; Zhong, Qiding; Fan, Shuangxi; Wang, Daobing; Fauhl-Hassek, Carsten","Food additives & contaminants.

74677,COVID-19: changing the care process for women's health-the patient's perspective.,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND Amantadine constitutes an interesting, diamond crystal lattice-shaped, antivirally active amine with an inhibitory effect on influenza A viruses causing common 'flu' in humans. Unfortunately, amantadine forfeited most of its therapeutic potential because of resistance development in recent influenza A virus isolates. The antiviral efficacy of amantadine congeners can be chemically modified, resulting in re-constitution, improvement and/or extension of antiviral activities mediated by amino-adamantyls. METHODS Newly synthesized compounds were evaluated towards HIV type-1 (HIV-1) replication in primary human lymphocytes. One N-phenacyl amantadine derivative was investigated for inhibiting the in vitro replication of respiratory viruses (influenza A viruses, influenza B virus, human parainfluenza virus type 3 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). RESULTS Two ketone-stabilized 1-adamantyl singlet nitrenes were discovered serendipitously. To our best knowledge these are the first persistently stable nitrenes to be reported. Their structure was proved by determining the X-ray single crystal structure of one hydrolytic elaboration product. This salt adduct revealed an incommensurately modulated crystal structure, which was solved by extensive computational refinement. We could show that ketone-stabilized 1-adamantyl singlet nitrenes are versatile synthons for the synthesis of antiviral drug candidates. An amantadine-folate conjugate was inhibitory on HIV-1 replication in primary human lymphocytes, and one N-phenacyl amantadine derivative was inhibitory towards low pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1) replication in vitro. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the aromatic-aliphatic ketone-stabilized 1-adamantyl singlet nitrenes, beyond being of fundamental interest in organic chemistry, represent versatile synthons for the synthesis of new amantadine-related potentially antiviral drugs.","Kesel, Andreas J; Weiss, Hans-Christoph; Sch√∂nleber, Andreas; Day, Craig W; Barnard, Dale L; Detorio, Mervi A; Schinazi, Raymond F",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.3851/imp2485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23234699/,790

75641,Maternal and umbilical cord ischemia-modified albumin levels in nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings regarding the mode of delivery.,2013,"BACKGROUND It is unclear what factors affect the uptake of sevoflurane administered through the membrane oxygenator during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and whether this can be monitored via the oxygenator exhaust gas. METHODS Stable delivery of sevoflurane was administered to 30 elective cardiac surgery patients at 1.8 vol% (inspiratory) via the anaesthetic circuit and ventilator. During CPB, sevoflurane was administered in the oxygenator fresh gas supply (Compactflo Evolution‚Ñ¢; Sorin Group, Milano, Italy). Sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) was measured using gas chromatography. Changes were correlated with bispectral index (BIS), patient temperature, haematocrit, plasma albumin concentration, oxygenator fresh gas flow, and the sevoflurane concentration in the oxygenator exhaust at predefined time points. RESULTS The mean SPC pre-bypass was 54.9 ¬µg ml(-1) [95% confidence interval (CI): 50.6-59.1]. SPC decreased to 43.2 ¬µg ml(-1) (95% CI: 40.3-46.1; P<0.001) after initiation of CPB, and was lower still during rewarming and weaning from bypass, 39.4 ¬µg ml(-1) (95% CI: 36.6-42.3; P<0.001). BIS did not exceed a value of 55. SPCs were higher during hypothermia (P<0.001) and with an increase in oxygenator fresh gas flow (P=0.015), and lower with haemodilution (P=0.027). No correlation was found between SPC and the concentration of sevoflurane in the oxygenator exhaust gas (r=-0.04; 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.09; P=0.53). CONCLUSIONS The uptake of sevoflurane delivered via the membrane oxygenator during CPB seems to be affected by hypothermia, haemodilution, and changes in the oxygenator fresh gas supply flow. Measuring the concentration of sevoflurane in the exhaust from the oxygenator is not useful for monitoring sevoflurane administration during bypass.","Nitzschke, R; Wilgusch, J; Kersten, J F; Trepte, C J; Haas, S A; Reuter, D A; Goetz, A E; Goepfert, M S",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aet018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23462192/,790

These remain the most common interventions implemented by stewardship programs. Although these approaches have been shown to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, they incorrectly put the onus for appropriate antibiotic use on the stewardship team rather than the prescribing clinician. We propose that a primary focus of stewardship programs should be implementation of broader interventions that engage frontline clinicians and equip them with tools to integrate antibiotic stewardship into their own daily practice, thus reducing the need for day-to-day stewardship team oversite.

80146,Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for acute adnexal pathology during pregnancy: preliminary experience.,2013,"IMPORTANCE Although conventional bariatric surgery results in weight loss, it does so with potential short-term and long-term morbidity. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intermittent, reversible vagal nerve blockade therapy for obesity treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial involving 239 participants who had a body mass index of 40 to 45 or 35 to 40 and 1 or more obesity-related condition was conducted at 10 sites in the United States and Australia between May and December 2011. The 12-month blinded portion of the 5-year study was completed in January 2013. INTERVENTIONS One hundred sixty-two patients received an active vagal nerve block device and 77 received a sham device. All participants received weight management education. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary efficacy objectives were to determine whether the vagal nerve block was superior in mean percentage excess weight loss to sham by a 10-point margin with at least 55% of patients in the vagal block group achieving a 20% loss and 45% achieving a 25% loss. The primary safety objective was to determine whether the rate of serious adverse events related to device, procedure, or therapy in the vagal block group was less than 15%. RESULTS In the intent-to-treat analysis, the vagal nerve block group had a mean 24.4% excess weight loss (9.2% of their initial body weight loss) vs 15.9% excess weight loss (6.0% initial body weight loss) in the sham group. The mean difference in the percentage of the excess weight loss between groups was 8.5 percentage points (95% CI, 3.1-13.9), which did not meet the 10-point target (P = .71), although weight loss was statistically greater in the vagal nerve block group (P = .002 for treatment difference in a post hoc analysis). At 12 months, 52% of patients in the vagal nerve block group achieved 20% or more excess weight loss and 38% achieved 25% or more excess weight loss vs 32% in the sham group who achieved 20% or more loss and 23% who achieved 25% or more loss. The device, procedure, or therapy-related serious adverse event rate in the vagal nerve block group was 3.7% (95% CI, 1.4%-7.9%), significantly lower than the 15% goal. The adverse events more frequent in the vagal nerve block group were heartburn or dyspepsia and abdominal pain attributed to therapy; all were reported as mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Among patients with morbid obesity, the use of vagal nerve block therapy compared with a sham control device did not meet either of the prespecified coprimary efficacy objectives, although weight loss in the vagal block group was statistically greater than in the sham device group. The treatment was well tolerated, having met the primary safety objective.

82008,Relationship between pregnancy and coronavirus: what we know.,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND The discovery of somatostatin (SST) and the synthesis of a variety of analogues constituted a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumours (GEP-NETs). They currently provide the most efficient treatment to achieve symptomatic relief and have recently been demonstrated to inhibit tumour growth. AIM To review 35 years of experience regarding the clinical application and efficacy of SST analogues. METHODS The PubMed database (1972-2009) was searched using somatostatin as a search term with combinations of terms including 'treatment'; 'neuroendocrine'; 'carcinoid'; 'tumor'; 'octreotide'; 'lanreotide' and 'pasireotide'. RESULTS In a review of 15 studies including 481 patients, the slow-release formulations Sandostatin LAR and Somatuline SR/Autogel achieved symptomatic relief in 74.2% (61.9-92.8%) and 67.5% (40.0-100%), biochemical response in 51.4% (31.5-100%) and 39.0% (17.9-58%), and tumour response in 69.8% (47.0-87.5%) and 64.4% (48.0-87.0%) respectively. Novel SST analogues like SOM230 (pasireotide) that exhibit pan SST receptor activity and analogues with high affinity to specific somatostatin receptor (sstr) subtypes may further advance the field, but efficacy studies are lacking. CONCLUSION As more precise understanding of NET cell biology evolves and molecular biological tools advance, more accurate identification of individual tumours sstr profile will probably facilitate a more precise delineation of SST analogue treatment.","Modlin, I M; Pavel, M; Kidd, M; Gustafsson, B I",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04174.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19845567/,790

Different combinations of fSampEn parameters were used to calculate fSampEn in both non-invasive and the gold standard invasive myographic respiratory signals. All signals were recorded in a heterogeneous population of healthy subjects and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients during loaded breathing, thus allowing the performance of fSampEn to be evaluated for a variety of inspiratory muscle activation levels. The performance of fSampEn was assessed by means of the cross-covariance of fSampEn time-series and both mouth and transdiaphragmatic pressures generated by inspiratory muscles. A set of optimal general fSampEn parameters was proposed, allowing fSampEn of different subjects to be compared and contributing to improving the assessment of inspiratory muscle activity in health and disease.","Lozano-Garc√≠a, Manuel; Estrada, Luis; Jan√©, Raimon",Entropy,https://doi.org/10.3390/e21020183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33266898/,790
84699,Perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in Siberia and the Russian Far East.,2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND Choroidal naevi are a common incidental finding prompting specialist referrals to ocular oncology. Rarely, such lesions have sufficient suspicious features to diagnose a small melanoma. The aim of the study is to show that 'virtual' imaging-based pathways are a safe and efficient option to manage such referrals. METHODS A prospective cohort study at the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospital between June 2016 and July 2017 of the management decision of 400 patients reviewed by an ophthalmologist in a face-to-face consultation (gold standard) supported by fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, autofluorescence (AF) and B-mode ultrasound. The images were also read independently by blinded graders (non-medical) and blinded ophthalmologists, and a management decision was made based on image review alone (virtual pathway). The two pathways were compared for safety. RESULTS The agreement for management decisions between face-to-face and virtual pathways was 83.1% (non-medical) and 82.6% (medical). There were more over-referrals in the virtual pathway (non-medical 24.3%, medical 23.3% of gold standard discharge) and only two under-referrals (10.5% of gold standard referrals), both borderline cases with minimal clinical risk. The agreement for risk factors of growth (orange pigment, subretinal fluid, hyper-AF) ranged between 82.3% and 97.3%. CONCLUSIONS We prospectively validated a virtual clinic model for the safe management of choroidal naevi. Such a model of care is feasible with low rate of under-referral. An over-referral rate of almost 24% from the vitrual pathway needs to be factored into designing such pathways in conjunction with evidence on their cost-effectiveness.","Al Harby, Lamis; Ali, Zaria; Rajai, Azita; Roberts, Stephen A; Peto, Tunde; Leung, Irene; Gray, Jane; Hay, Gordon; Arora, Amit K; Keane, Pearse A; Cohen, Victoria M L; Sagoo, Mandeep; Balaskas, Konstantinos",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-317371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33037007/,790

87248,Pharmacological treatment in pregnant women with moderate symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.,2021-03-26,"OBJECTIVE At the end of 2019, the Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread rapidly from China to the whole world. Circadian rhythms can play crucial role in the complex interplay between viruses and organisms, and temporized schedules (chronotherapy) have been positively tested in several medical diseases. We aimed to compare the possible effects of a morning vs. evening antiviral administration in COVID patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated all patients admitted to COVID internal medicine units with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and treated with darunavir-ritonavir (single daily dose, for seven days). Age, sex, length of stay (LOS), pharmacological treatment, and timing of antiviral administration (morning or evening), were recorded. Outcome indicators were death or LOS, and laboratory parameters, e.g., variations in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2, mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PaO2/FiO2), and leucocyte count. RESULTS The total sample consisted of 151 patients, 33 (21.8%) of whom were selected for antiviral treatment. The mean age was 61.8¬±18.3 years, 17 (51.5%) were male, and the mean LOS was 13.4¬±8.6 days. Nine patients (27.3%) had their antiviral administration in the morning, and 24 (72.7%) had antiviral administration in the evening. No fatalities occurred. Despite the extremely limited sample size, morning group subjects showed a significant difference in CRP variation, compared to that in evening group subjects (-65.82¬±33.26 vs. 83.32¬±304.89, respectively, p<0.032). No significant differences were found for other parameters. CONCLUSIONS This report is the first study evaluating temporized morning vs. evening antiviral administration in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The morning regimen was associated with a significant reduction in CRP values. Further confirmations with larger and multicenter samples of patients could reveal novel potentially useful insights.","De Giorgi, A; Fabbian, F; Di Simone, E; Greco, S; De Giorgio, R; Zuliani, G; Passaro, A; Caselli, E; Manfredini, R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767353/,790

A search strategy without language restrictions was developed with expert help, and two reviewers undertook independent study selection. Five studies were included in this review (four for quantitative analysis) with a total of 783 participants. The mean overall prevalence of parental decision regret was 65.2% (moderate to severe - 20.3%). Although significant predictors of regret were identified (post-operative complications, small size glans, meatal location, decision conflict between parents, parental educational level and others), they had unexplained discordance between studies. Parental decision regret after proximal hypospadias surgery and refusing surgery was inadequately reported. In conclusion, even though the prevalence of parental decision regret after consenting for the hypospadias repair appears to be high, risk factors associated with it were discordant suggesting imprecision in estimates due to unknown confounders.","Vavilov, Sergey; Smith, Grahame; Starkey, Malcolm; Pockney, Peter; Deshpande, Aniruddh V",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885548/,790
90617,Risk factors for infection following cesarean delivery: an interventional study.,2012,"INTRODUCTION Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) quarantine has been associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We hypothesize these symptoms might even be more pronounced in the elderly, who may be particularly sensitive to social isolation. However, certain individuals might be more resilient than others due to their coping mechanisms, including religious coping. OBJECTIVES We aimed to examine the levels of perceived stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in older adults under COVID-19 quarantine in Qatar; and to identify the sociodemographic, psychological, and clinical factors associated with mental health outcomes, with a focus on the role of resilience, and religiosity. METHODS A cross-sectional study assessing depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms as well as resilience, and religiosity through a phone survey in adults aged 60 years or more under COVID-19 quarantine in the State of Qatar, in comparison to age and gender-matched controls. RESULTS The prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in elderly subjects under COVID-19 quarantine in Qatar was not significantly different from the prevalence in gender and age-matched controls. In the quarantined group, higher depressive, anxiety, and stress scores were associated with the female gender and with lower resilience scores but were not linked to age, psychiatric history, medical history, duration of quarantine, or religiosity. CONCLUSION The elderly population does not seem to develop significant COVID-19 quarantine-related psychological distress, possibly thanks to high resilience and effective coping strategies developed through the years.","Ouanes, Sami; Kumar, Rajeev; Doleh, Esraa Saleh Idriss; Smida, Malek; Al-Kaabi, Abdulaziz; Al-Shahrani, Ahmad Medawi; Mohamedsalih, Ghassan Ahmed; Ahmed, Nagi Eltagi; Assar, Ahmed; Khoodoruth, Mohamed Adil Shah; AbuKhattab, Mohammed; Maslamani, Muna Al; AlAbdulla, Majid Ali",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2021.104457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34146999/,790

This study aims to determine the important factors affecting microparticle injectability and establish a predictive framework using computational fluid dynamics, design of experiments, and machine learning. A numerical multiphysics model was developed to examine microparticle flow and needle blockage in a syringe-needle system. Using experimental data, a simple empirical mathematical model was introduced. Results from injection experiments were subsequently incorporated into an artificial neural network to establish a predictive framework for injectability. Last, simulations and experimental results contributed to the design of a syringe that maximizes injectability in vitro and in vivo. The custom injection system enabled a sixfold increase in injectability of large microparticles compared to a commercial syringe.

It was shown to inhibit the replication of multiple viruses by producing a ribonucleotide called 3'-deoxy-3'4'-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP), which acts as a chain terminator for the viral RNA polymerase2. Here we show that the eukaryotic viperin has originated from a clade of bacterial and archaeal proteins that protect against phage infection. Prokaryotic viperins (pVips) produce a set of modified ribonucleotides that include ddhCTP, as well as ddhGTP and ddhUTP. We further provide evidence that pVips protect against T7 phage infection by inhibiting viral polymerase-dependent transcription, implying an anti-viral mechanism of action similar to the animal viperin.

94213,Respiratory outcomes after neonatal prone versus supine positioning following scheduled cesarean delivery: a randomized trial.,2019,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful and debilitating disease characterized by the chronic and progressive degradation of articular cartilage. Post-traumatic OA (PTOA) is a secondary form of OA that develops in ~50% of cases of severe articular injury. Inflammation and re-occurring injury have been implicated as contributing to the progression of PTOA after the initial injury. However, there is very little known about external factors prior to injury that could affect the risk of PTOA development. To examine how the gut microbiome affects PTOA development we used a chronic antibiotic treatment regimen starting at weaning for six weeks prior to ACL rupture, in mice. A six-weeks post-injury histological examination showed more robust cartilage staining on the antibiotic (AB)-treated mice than the untreated controls (VEH), suggesting slower disease progression in AB cohorts. Injured joints also showed an increase in the presence of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in the AB group. Molecularly, the phenotype correlated with a significantly lower expression of inflammatory genes Tlr5, Ccl8, Cxcl13, and Foxo6 in the injured joints of AB-treated animals. Our results indicate that a reduced state of inflammation at the time of injury and a lower expression of Wnt signaling modulatory protein, Rspo1, caused by AB treatment can slow down or improve PTOA outcomes.","Mendez, Melanie E; Murugesh, Deepa K; Sebastian, Aimy; Hum, Nicholas R; McCloy, Summer A; Kuhn, Edward A; Christiansen, Blaine A; Loots, Gabriela G",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899361/,790
94820,SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy: characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized and non-hospitalized women due to COVID-19.,2020-07-20,"Ducks can survive infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that are lethal to chickens. We showed that the influenza detector, RIG-I can initiate antiviral responses in ducks, but this gene is absent in chickens. We can reconstitute this pathway by transfecting chicken DF-1 embryonic fibroblast cells with duck RIG-I, which augments their antiviral response to influenza and decreases viral titer. However, the genes downstream of duck RIG-I that mediate this antiviral response to influenza are not known. Using microarrays, we compared the transcriptional profile of chicken embryonic fibroblasts transfected with duck RIG-I or empty vector, and infected with low or highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Transfected duck RIG-I expressed in chicken cells was associated with the marked induction of many antiviral innate immune genes upon infection with both viruses. We used real-time PCR to confirm upregulation of a subset of these antiviral genes including MX1, PKR, IFIT5, OASL, IFNB, and downregulation of the influenza matrix gene. These results provide some insight into the genes induced by duck RIG-I upon influenza infection, and provide evidence that duck RIG-I can function to elicit an interferon-driven, antiviral response against influenza in chicken embryonic fibroblasts.","Barber, Megan R W; Aldridge, Jerry R; Fleming-Canepa, Ximena; Wang, Yong-Dong; Webster, Robert G; Magor, Katharine E",Molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2012.10.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220072/,790

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect on mortality of a supervised early PR program, initiated during or within 4 weeks after hospitalization with an acute exacerbation of COPD compared with usual post-exacerbation care or no PR program. Secondary outcomes were days in hospital, COPD related readmissions, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise capacity (walking distance), activities of daily living (ADL), fall risk and drop-out rate. METHODS We identified randomized trials through a systematic search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cocharne Library and other sources through October 2017. Risk of bias was assessed regarding randomization, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS We included 13 randomized trials (801 participants). Our meta-analyses showed a clinically relevant reduction in mortality after early PR (4 trials, 319 patients; RR = 0.58 (95% CI: [0.35 to 0.98])) and at the longest follow-up (3 trials, 127 patients; RR = 0.55 (95% CI: [0.12 to 2.57])). Early PR reduced number of days in hospital by 4.27 days (1 trial, 180 patients; 95% CI: [- 6.85 to - 1.69]) and hospital readmissions (6 trials, 319 patients; RR = 0.47 (95% CI: [0.29 to 0.75])). Moreover, early PR improved HRQoL and walking distance, and did not affect drop-out rate. Several of the trials had unclear risk of bias in regard to the randomization and blinding, for some outcome there was also a lack of power. CONCLUSION Moderate quality of evidence showed reductions in mortality, number of days in hospital and number of readmissions after early PR in patients hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation. Long-term effects on mortality were not statistically significant, but improvements in HRQoL and exercise capacity appeared to be maintained for at least 12 months. Therefore, we recommend early supervised PR to patients with COPD-related exacerbations. PR should be initiated during hospital admission or within 4 weeks after hospital discharge.","Ryrs√∏, Camilla Koch; Godtfredsen, Nina Skavlan; Kofod, Linette Marie; Lavesen, Marie; Mogensen, Line; Tobberup, Randi; Farver-Vestergaard, Ingeborg; Callesen, Henriette Edemann; Tendal, Britta; Lange, Peter; Iepsen, Ulrik Winning",BMC pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-018-0718-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30219047/,790
98753,Improving the quality of care in pregnancy and childbirth with coronavirus (COVID-19): a systematic review.,2020-05-14,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and malignant brain tumor, resulting in a poor prognosis. The current therapy for GBM consists in concurrent radiation and chemotherapy following removal of the tumor. Although the therapy prolongs patient survival, recurrence often occurs. The major cause of tumor recurrence is thought to be GBM stem cells (GSCs), which aid the development of chemo-radiotherapy resistance, and can self-renew and aberrantly differentiate. Therefore, GSCs should be targeted to eradicate the tumor and prevent recurrence. Transcriptomic analysis has categorized GBM into proneural (PN), mesenchymal and classical subtypes, and the outcome of recurrence and prognosis markedly depends on subtype. To identify specific GSC markers, the present study analyzed public microarray and RNA-seq data and identified dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 5 (DRP5) as a candidate GSC marker. DRP5 is known to mediate semaphorin 3A signaling and is involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and axon guidance during neuronal development. In the present study, DRP5 was specifically upregulated in the PN-subtype GSCs and served crucial roles in maintaining GSC properties, including tumor sphere formation, stem cell marker expression and xenograft tumor growth. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis revealed that DRP5 expression was positively correlated with signatures of stemness, including Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt/Œ≤-catenin expression, which are also known to be positively correlated with PN-subtype gene signatures. Conversely, DRP5 expression was negatively correlated with NF-Œ∫B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 stemness signatures, which are negatively correlated with PN-subtype gene signatures. Taken together, these findings suggested that DRP5 was specifically expressed in PN-subtype GSCs and may be used as a functional marker of PN-subtype GSCs.","Park, Min Gi; Seo, Sunyoung; Ham, Seok Won; Choi, Sang-Hun; Kim, Hyunggee",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724355/,790

METHODS This was a cross-sectional study at a single institution. Fellows and faculty in pediatric emergency medicine were invited to participate. Each subject performed intubations on 3 simulators (newborn, infant, adult), using a videolaryngoscope; each simulator was intubated by each subject with and without use of video. Primary outcome was first-attempt intubation success; secondary outcome was percentage of glottic opening score (POGO). RESULTS Twenty-six participants performed 156 intubations; complete data were available for 148 intubations. First-attempt success in the neonate was 88%; in the infant, 79%; and in the adult, 60%. In the adult simulator, videolaryngoscopy use showed a first-attempt success in 81% of subjects compared with 39% with direct laryngoscopy (difference 43%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 18% to 67%). There was no difference in first-attempt success rates between videolaryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy in the newborn or infant simulators. Videolaryngoscopy use led to increased POGO scores in all 3 simulators, with a difference of 25% (95% CI 2% to 48%) in newborn simulators, 23% (95% CI 2% to 48%) in infant simulators, and 42% (95% CI 18% to 66%) in adult simulators. CONCLUSION Videolaryngoscopy was associated with greater first-attempt success during intubation by pediatric emergency physicians on an adult simulator.

A primer for obstetricians.,2020-06-10,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To systematically review the current literature to assess the role of radiomics in the detection and evaluation of prostate cancer (PCa). RECENT FINDINGS Radiomics involves the high-throughput extraction of radiologic features from clinical imaging, using a panel of sophisticated data-characterization algorithms to make an objective and quantitative determination of diagnoses and clinical characteristics. Radiomics evaluation of existing clinical images would increase their clinical value in many cancer management pathways, including PCa. However, a consensus on the implementation of radiomics has not been established across different sites, delaying its implementation in clinical practice. There are many potential advantages to radiomics. The ability to extract features from existing clinical imaging is one such advantage. A second is the empiric nature of the analysis. The third lies in the application of new technologies, such as machine learning, to be able to evaluate large quantities of data to make clinical conclusions. In this systematic review, we identify publications regarding the role of radiomics in PCa detection and evaluation. Many of these studies noted that radiomics, when incorporated into predictive models, had an advantageous impact on detection of PCa, clinically significant PCa, and extracapsular extension. This may assist in individualized decision making not only for diagnosis of PCa, but also for surveillance and surgical planning. With additional validation in large sample sizes, and randomized, multicenter studies using a consensus driven methodology, radiomics has the potential to alter the landscape of PCa detection and management, necessitating further prospective randomized investigation. SUMMARY Radiomics is a promising new field, allowing for high-throughput analysis of imaging features for PCa detection and evaluation. These features can be extracted from existing data; therefore, the potential for future study is immense.","Sugano, Dordaneh; Sanford, Daniel; Abreu, Andre; Duddalwar, Vinay; Gill, Inderbir; Cacciamani, Giovanni E",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941257/,790

Although involvement of the lower respiratory track accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality seen, the virus involves several organ systems and the syndrome exhibits clinical diversity with a wide range of symptoms and manifestations. The involvement of elements of the hematopoietic system is prominent in severe cases and associated with poor outcomes and mortality. Lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and a prothrombotic state are common manifestations of COVID-19 and have important treatment and prognostic implications. Better understanding of the mechanisms of the pathophysiology of COVID-19-induced hematological abnormalities may ultimately result in better ways to treat them and decrease the associated morbidity and mortality.","Mina, Alain; Besien, Koen Van; Platanias, Leonidas C",Leukemia & lymphoma,https://doi.org/10.1080/10428194.2020.1788017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32643489/,790

This study aimed to characterize the stage of innovation for biological mesh devices used during complex abdominal wall reconstruction and to evaluate the quality of current evidence. Methods A systematic review was performed of published and ongoing studies between January 2000 and September 2017. Eligible studies were those where a biological mesh was used to support fascial closure, either prophylactically after midline laparotomy, or for reinforcement after repair of incisional hernia with midline incision. The primary outcome measure was the IDEAL framework stage of innovation. The key secondary outcome measure was the GRADE criteria for study quality. Results Thirty-five studies including 2681 patients were included. Four studies considered mesh prophylaxis, 23 considered hernia repair, and eight reported on both. There was one published randomized trial (IDEAL stage 3), none of which was of high quality; the others were non-randomized studies (IDEAL stage 2a). A detailed description of surgical technique was provided in most studies (27 of 35); however, no study reported outcomes according to the European Hernia Society consensus statement and only two described quality control of surgical technique during the study. From 21 ongoing randomized trials and observational studies, 11 considered repair of incisional hernia and 10 considered prophylaxis (seven in elective settings). Conclusion The evidence base for biological mesh is limited, and better reporting and quality control of surgical techniques are needed. Although results of ongoing trials over the next decade will improve the evidence base, further study is required in the emergency and contaminated settings.","Kamarajah, S K; Chapman, S J; Glasbey, J; Morton, D; Smart, N; Pinkney, T; Bhangu, A",BJS open,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.78; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511038/,790

The effects of this are well studied in terms of the spread of directly transmitted infections, but the role of air travel in the movement of vector-borne diseases is less well understood. Increasingly however, wider reaching surveillance for vector-borne diseases and our improving abilities to map the distributions of vectors and the diseases they carry, are providing opportunities to better our understanding of the impact of increasing air travel. Here we examine global trends in the continued expansion of air transport and its impact upon epidemiology. Novel malaria and chikungunya examples are presented, detailing how geospatial data in combination with information on air traffic can be used to predict the risks of vector-borne disease importation and establishment. Finally, we describe the development of an online tool, the Vector-Borne Disease Airline Importation Risk (VBD-Air) tool, which brings together spatial data on air traffic and vector-borne disease distributions to quantify the seasonally changing risks for importation to non-endemic regions. Such a framework provides the first steps towards an ultimate goal of adaptive management based on near real time flight data and vector-borne disease surveillance.","Tatem, A J; Huang, Z; Das, A; Qi, Q; Roth, J; Qiu, Y",Parasitology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031182012000352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22444826/,790

HCV nonstructural (NS) cysteine protease, NS2/3, is required for viral replication in vivo. Cystatin C is a naturally occurring cysteine protease inhibitor in human cells. We aimed to investigate the relation between serum levels of cystatin C and HCV viremia in treatment-na√Øve children with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS Serum cystatin C levels were measured in 27 children with chronic hepatitis C and determined their relation with liver functions, histopathological parameters, and hepatitis C viral load. Serum cystatin C was compared with that of 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS Cystatin C was significantly higher in patients than in controls (1.4 ¬± 0.47 vs 0.99 ¬± 0.49; P = 0.006), and in those with low viremia than in those with moderate viremia (1.55 ¬± 0.41 vs 0.99 ¬± 0.43; P = 0.013). Cystatin C was not correlated with histopathological findings in liver biopsy (P > 0.05 for all). In addition, there was no significant difference of cystatin C levels in patients with normal versus those with elevated transaminases (P > 0.05). Of importance, cystatin C correlated negatively with viral load (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Cystatin C levels correlated negatively with HCV viremia. This finding may reflect an inhibitory effect of cystatin C on HCV replication through inhibiting its NS2/3 and tempting for further studies for cystatin C as a possible adjuvant therapy for HCV infection.","Behairy, Behairy E; Saber, Magdy A; Elhenawy, Ibrahim A; Abou-Zeinah, Sahar S; El-Sharawy, Ahmed A; Sira, Mostafa M",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0b013e31823e98c2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22064633/,790

109990,Perinatal COVID-19 outcomes: evaluating the strength of current evidence.,2020-11-29,"PURPOSE Incisional hernia repair (IHR) with a mesh is necessary to achieve low recurrence rates and pain relief. In the short term, quality of life (QoL) is restored by IHR. Two centers pioneered the IHR in Sweden with the highly standardized Rives-Stoppa technique using a retromuscular mesh. We assessed long-term follow-up of recurrence rate and QoL. METHODS Medical records were searched for IHRs performed from 1998 to 2006 and included living patients with midline repairs. Questionnaires about physical status, complaints, and QoL (SF-36) were mailed, offering a clinical examination. Assessment of medical records of later surgery was performed in 2015. RESULTS Three hundred and one patients with midline incisional repairs were identified, and 217 accepted participation. Of these, 103 attended a clinical examination. Follow-up was 7 years until examination and 11 years to reassessment of medical records. In 26%, recurrent hernias were repaired. Postoperative complications were 26% Clavien-Dindo grade I-II and 1% grade III-IV. Mesh infections occurred in 1.4% without mesh removals, and 4% were reoperated because of complications. Overall recurrence rate was 8.1% and two-third of which were diagnosed at clinical examination. Recurrence after primary and recurrent hernia repair was 7.1 and 10.9%, respectively. Of all patients, 80% were satisfied; dissatisfaction was primarily caused by recurrence and chronic pain. SF-36 scores were 0.2 SD lower than the norm in all subscales, similar to those with 1-2 chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS Midline retromuscular mesh IHR has a low long-term recurrence rate even after recurrent repair. Patient satisfaction was high although QoL was reduced.","Rogmark, Peder; Smedberg, Sam; Montgomery, Agneta",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-017-4268-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29018922/,790

METHODS We analyzed data from the German Stroke Registry-Endovascular Treatment (GSR-ET; NCT03356392, date of registration: 22 Nov 2017). The primary outcomes were successful reperfusion defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI 2b-3), good outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-2 or back to baseline), and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on follow-up imaging at 24 h analyzed by unadjusted univariate and adjusted binary logistic regression analysis. Additionally, we analyzed mortality at 3 months with adjusted binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Out of 6173 patients, there were 1306 (21.2%) OAC patients, 479 (7.8%) with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and 827 (13.4%) with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulation (NOAC). The control group consisted of 4867 (78.8%) non-OAC patients. ET efficacy with the rates of mTICI 2b-3 was similar among the three groups (85.6%, 85.3% vs 84.3%, p = 0.93 and 1). On day 90, good outcome was less frequent in OAC patients (27.8%, 27.9% vs 39.5%, p < 0.005 and < 0.005). OAC status was not associated with ICH at 24 h (NOAC: odd's ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-1.20; VKA: OR 1.04, CI 0.75-1.46). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed no influence of OAC status on good outcome at 3 months (NOAC: OR 1.25, CI 0.99-1.59; VKA: OR 1.18, CI 0.89-1.56) and mortality at 3 months (NOAC: OR 1.03, CI 0.81-1.30; VKA: OR 1.04, CI 0.78-1.1.37).

TB was considered incurable till the mid 19th century. The major landmark in the treatment was the discovery of Rifampicin which has led to shorter courses of therapy as compared to the previous regimens which also consisted of injectables. Although, treatment for TB is evolving expeditiously today but a lot needs to be done as far as drug resistant TB (DRTB) is concerned. Non-standard regimens in private sector, lack of access to drug susceptibility testing, delay in the treatment, poor follow up and default in the treatment has led to emergence DRTB. Addition of newer drugs like bedaquiline and delamanid has made oral regimen possible in DRTB as well. Encouraging results of BPaL regimen for extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) may prove to be a game changer. The target of TB elimination by 2025 is onerous considering the huge population, rising DRTB patients and private sector non engagement in the programme despite implementation of second largest national programme of the world.","Gupta, Aditi; Chopra, Vishal",The Indian journal of tuberculosis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijtb.2020.10.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308654/,790

Methods: We studied a total of 143 patients with COVID-19 from January 29 to February 29, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, laboratory data, including ultrasound scans of the lower extremities, and outcome variables were obtained, comparisons were made between DVT and non-DVT groups. Results: Of the 143 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (aged 63 ¬± 14 years; 74 [51.7%] man), 66 patients developed lower extremity DVT (46.1%, included 23 [34.8%] with proximal DVT and 43 [65.2%] with distal DVT).Compared with patients who with no DVT, patients with DVT were older and had a lower oxygenation index, a higher rate of cardiac injury, and worse prognosis including an increased proportion of deaths (23 [34.8%] vs 9 [11.7%], P = 0.001) and a decreased proportion of patients discharged (32 [48.5%] vs 60 [77.9%], P < 0.001).

Conclusions: The prevalence of DVT is high and is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism may be protective in patients with a Padua protection score ‚â• 4 after admission. Our data seem to suggest that COVID-19 is probably an additional risk factor for DVT in the hospitalized patients.","Zhang, Li; Feng, Xiaokai; Zhang, Danqing; Jiang, Chunguo; Mei, Heng; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Cuihong; Li, Hong; Xia, Xiaoling; Kong, Shuangshuang; Liao, Jia; Jia, Huijun; Pang, Xueqin; Song, Yue; Tian, Ying; Wang, Bin; Wu, Chun; Yuan, Hongliang; Zhang, Yongxing; Li, Yuman; Sun, Wei; Zhang, Yanting; Zhu, Shuangshuang; Wang, Shuyuan; Xie, Yuji; Ge, Shuping; Zhang, Liming; Hu, Yu; Xie, Mingxing",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.046702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32421381/,790

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical spectrum of musculoskeletal involvement and relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage and CD4+ cells and other factors. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 75 patients of over 18 years of either sex with confirmed HIV status attending a tertiary care hospital in north India in one calendar year. Baseline demographic details, relevant history including duration of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), RM, joints involved, CD4 cell count, and biochemical parameters were evaluated. RESULTS Of 75 patients, 54 were male and 21 were female (mean age 33.15 ¬± 5.00 years, range 21-48 years). Most common RM was arthralgia (26.67%), followed by myalgia (18.67%), and arthritis (13.33%). Keratoderma blennorrhagicum (1.33%), tendo-achilles tendinitis (2.67%), and plantar fasciitis (2.67%) were other manifestations. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) was seen in 8% patients (undifferentiated SpA 4%, reactive arthritis 2.67%, psoriatic arthritis 1.67%). HIV-associated arthritis was seen in 2.67% while septic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and diffuse infiltrative lymphocytic syndrome were seen in one patient (1.33%) each. The mean duration of disease in patients with RM was significantly less than patients without RM (p < 0.01). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in patients with RM was significantly higher than in patients without RM (p < 0.05). Mean CD4 + cells were also significantly lower in patients with RM as compared to patients without RM (p < 0.05). Significantly fewer patients on cART had RM in comparison to patients not on cART (p < 0.001). Of 35 patients with RM, 25 were in CDC stage IV. CONCLUSION RM are common in HIV-infected patients. HIV arthralgia, myalgia, and undifferentiated SpA are the common manifestations. RM were associated with low CD4 counts. Most of the cases with RM were in CDC stage IV.","Saigal, Renu; Chakraborty, Avik; Yadav, Ram Narayan; Goyal, Laxmi Kant",Advances in therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-020-01470-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839939/,790
114654,Coronavirus and pregnancy: How can three-dimensional printing laboratories help?,2020-05-19,"To be able to resolve molecular-clusters it is crucial to access vital information (such as, molecule density, cluster-size, and others) that are key in understanding disease progression and the underlying mechanism. Traditional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of variable sizes (as determined by its localization precision (LP)) to reconstruct a super-resolution map. This results in an image with overlapping and superimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of single-molecules) that undermine image resolution. Ideally, it should be possible to identify the brightest molecules (also termed as the fortunate molecules) to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the recorded data. Probabilistic Optically-Selective Single-molecule Imaging Based Localization Encoded (POSSIBLE) microscopy explores this possibility by introducing a narrow probability size-distribution of single-molecules (narrow size-spectrum about a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting the mean and variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function). Subsequently, the dataset is processed and single-molecules are filtered by the Gaussian function to remove unfortunate molecules. The fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped to reconstruct an ultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique is capable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single-molecule size) provided enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected. In short, bright molecules (with large emissivity) holds the key. Here, we demonstrate the POSSIBLE microscopy technique and reconstruct single-molecule images with an average PSF sizes of œÉ ¬± ŒîœÉ = 15 ¬± 10 nm, 30 ¬± 2 nm & 50 ¬± 2 nm. Results show better-resolved Dendra2-HA clusters with large cluster-density in transfected NIH3T3 fibroblast cells as compared to the traditional SMLM techniques. Cluster analysis indicates densely-packed HA molecules, HA-HA interaction, and a surge in the number of HA molecules per cluster post 24 Hrs of transfection. The study using POSSIBLE microscopy introduces new insights in influenza biology. We anticipate exciting applications in the multidisciplinary field of disease biology, oncology, and biomedical imaging.","Pratim Mondal, Partha",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197236/,790
118266,COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy and postpartum.,2021-05-16,"The structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin is a nucleosome, comprising two histone H2A-H2B heterodimers and one histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer, wrapped around by ‚àº146 bp of DNA. The N-terminal flexible histone tails stick out from the histone core and have extensive posttranslational modifications, causing epigenetic changes of chromatin. Although crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy structures of nucleosomes are available, the flexible tail structures remain elusive. Using NMR, we have examined the dynamics of histone H3 tails in nucleosomes containing unmodified and tetra-acetylated H4 tails. In unmodified nucleosome, the H3 tail adopts a dynamic equilibrium structure between DNA-contact and reduced-contact states. In acetylated H4 nucleosome, however, the H3 tail equilibrium shifts to a mainly DNA-contact state with a minor reduced-contact state. The acetylated H4 tail is dynamically released from its own DNA-contact state to a reduced-contact state, while the H3 tail DNA-contact state becomes major. Notably, H3 K14 in the acetylated H4 nucleosome is much more accessible to acetyltransferase Gcn5 relative to unmodified nucleosome, possibly due to the formation of a favorable H3 tail conformation for Gcn5. In summary, each histone tail adopts a characteristic dynamic state but regulates one other, probably creating a histone tail network even on a nucleosome.","Furukawa, Ayako; Wakamori, Masatoshi; Arimura, Yasuhiro; Ohtomo, Hideaki; Tsunaka, Yasuo; Kurumizaka, Hitoshi; Umehara, Takashi; Nishimura, Yoshifumi",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010506117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747537/,790

We hypothesized that mixed micelles would form under specific conditions and provide a handle to tune formulation characteristics. EXPERIMENTS We examined the morphology of the self-assembled structures in mixtures of TPGS with two Tetronic: T1107 and T908, using a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), NMR spectroscopy (NOESY and diffusion NMR) and oscillatory rheology, over a range of compositions, temperatures and pH. Cell viability was assessed in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. FINDINGS The combination of TPGS with either of the two Tetronic produces spherical core-shell micelles that comprise both surfactants in their structure (mixed micelles). T1107 unimers incorporate into TPGS aggregates below the critical micelle temperature of the poloxamine, while mixed micelles only form under limited conditions with T908. At high concentration/temperature, small proportions of TPGS extend the gel phase, more markedly with T1107, with similar elastic moduli (30-50 kPa) and a BCC crystalline structure. Cell viability of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts grown in the hydrogels increases significantly when the poloxamine gels are doped with TPGS, making the combination of poloxamines and TPGS a promising platform for drug delivery.","Puig-Rigall, Joan; Blanco-Prieto, Mar√≠a J; Radulescu, Aurel; Dreiss, C√©cile A; Gonz√°lez-Gaitano, Gustavo",Journal of colloid and interface science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858401/,790

121595,Maternal and neonatal management during COVID-19.,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND Hypotension following spinal anesthesia (SA) during cesarean delivery (CD) occurs commonly and is related with maternal and fetal complications. Norepinephrine infusion is increasingly used for prevention of post-SA hypotension; however, its effects as compared to the traditional phenylephrine infusion remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of phenylephrine and norepinephrine administered as continuous infusion during elective CD on maternal hemodynamic parameters and maternal and fetal outcomes. METHODS This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study included 238 consecutive term parturients who underwent CD from February 2019 to October 2019. They were randomized to receive continuous infusion of 0.25 Œºg/kg/min phenylephrine, 0.05 Œºg/kg/min norepinephrine, or placebo. Hemodynamic monitoring was performed at 10 time points using LiDCOrapid. We analyzed umbilical vein (UV), umbilical artery (UA), and peripheral vein (PV) blood gas indexes and recorded intraoperative complications. RESULTS In phenylephrine group, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) remain during the whole operation. Compared to the control group, phenylephrine, but not norepinephrine, significantly increased the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to counteract the SA-induced vasodilatation, 3 min following norepinephrine/phenylephrine/LR administration (T4): 957.4 ¬± 590.3 vs 590.1 ¬± 273.7 (P < 0.000001); 5 min following norepinephrine/phenylephrine/LR administration (T5): 1104 ¬± 468.0 vs 789.4 ¬± 376.2 (P = 0.000002). at the time of incision (T6): 1084 ¬± 524.8 vs 825.2 ¬± 428.6 (P = 0.000188). Parturients in the phenylephrine group had significantly lower UV (1.91 ¬± 0.43) (P = 0.0003) and UA (2.05 ¬± 0.61) (P = 0.0038) lactate level compared to controls. Moreover, the UV pH value was higher in the phenylephrine than in the control group7.37 ¬± 0.03(P = 0.0013). Parturients had lower incidence of nausea, tachycardia, hypotension in phenylephrine group. CONCLUSIONS In this dataset, continuous phenylephrine infusion reduced the incidence of SA-induced hypotension, ameliorated SVR, while decreasing overall maternal complications. Phenylephrine infusions are considered the better choice during CD because of the significant benefit to the fetus.

We aimed to estimate the efficacy of a medical personnel education program in aseptic and scrub techniques on the rate of infectious morbidity after CD. METHODS A prospective, 2-period cohort intervention study was performed at a single institution. The first era, which included all CDs performed between September 2006 and August 2007, was used to obtain baseline infection rates. During this period, prophylactic antibiotics were given only to women undergoing elective CD. In era 2, July 2009 through June 2010, prophylactic antibiotics were given to all women. In addition, medical personnel underwent an education program, refresher course, and retraining in aseptic and scrub techniques. The study's primary outcome included any infectious morbidity related to the CD within 30 days from the operation. RESULTS The 1,616 CDs analyzed included 751 performed in era 1 and 865 performed in era 2. The incidence of any infectious morbidity dropped from 6.4% in era 1 to 2.5% in era 2 (P = .001). The incidence of any infectious morbidity in women undergoing elective CD fell from 5.3% to 0.9% (P = .001). Among women undergoing nonelective CD, the difference between the first and second eras was not statistically significant (7.5% vs. 4.5%; P = .09). However, the rate of incisional surgical site infection fell significantly, from 4% in era 1 to 1.5% in era 2 (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS The interventions implemented at our institution led to a considerable decline in post-CD infectious morbidity.","Salim, Raed; Braverman, Meirav; Berkovic, Ilanit; Suliman, Abeer; Teitler, Nava; Shalev, Eliezer",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2011.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21835505/,790

127928,COVID-19 pneumonia and pregnancy; a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-05-19,"Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by periodic cessation of breathing during sleep. OSA affects daily life and poses a severe threat to human health. The standard clinical method for identifying and predicting OSA events is the use of Polysomnography signals. In this paper, a novel scheme based on an ensemble of recurrence plots (RPs) and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (RPCNNs) is proposed to improve the prediction rate of OSA. First, RPs were used to represent the dynamic behavior of single electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for 60 s before and during OSA events. Then, using RPs, three prompt CNNs named ResNet-50 were fine-tuned, and their classification results were fused via the Majority Voting (MV) method to produce a final result concerning prediction. Next, the subject-independent Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO-CV) and subject-dependent 10-fold Cross-Validation (10-fold CV) methods were used to validate the prediction rate from signals derived from the University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database. Finally, the highest achieved average accuracy for the fusion level was 91.74% and 89.45% at the 10-fold CV and LOSO-CV. Additionally, our results outperformed state-of-the-art findings and could be recommended to predict and detect other biomedical signals. As a result, this predictive system can also be used to adjust the air pressure in sleep apnea patients' Automatic Positive Airway Pressure (APAP) devices.","Taghizadegan, Yashar; Jafarnia Dabanloo, Nader; Maghooli, Keivan; Sheikhani, Ali",Medical hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2021.110659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399170/,790

No information is currently available on the preservation of apheresis PLT in vitro quality parameters when PLTs are held at room temperature early in the storage period prior to transfer to cold storage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Double units of platelets suspended in 35% plasma/65% PAS-III were collected from normal consenting research donors and rested at room temperature for 1-2 hours. One of the units was then stored at 1-6¬∞C while the other unit was placed on an agitator at 20-24¬∞C. Eight hours after collection, the unit stored at room temperature was transferred to 1-6¬∞C storage without agitation. Units were sampled for an array of PLT in vitro parameters on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21. RESULTS As expected, PLTs held for 8 hours at 20-24¬∞C prior to 1-6¬∞C storage had greater lactate levels and reduced glucose levels and pH compared to PLTs subjected to a 1-2-hour room temperature hold prior to cold storage (P < .05). Unexpectedly, platelets held for 8 hours at room temperature had less aggregation response to collagen, ADP, and TRAP compared to PLTs held 1-2 hours at room temperature prior to cold storage (P < .05, n = 8).

A vision of Darwinian medicine.,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES To evaluate the long-term association between a multicomponent intervention program and disability in socioeconomically vulnerable older adults. DESIGN This was a nonrandomized prospective intervention trial. SETTING The setting was a community. PARTICIPANTS Participants included older Koreans living alone or receiving government assistance from a low-income program. INTERVENTION The intervention was a 24-week multicomponent program compromising group exercise, nutritional supplementation, management of depression, deprescribing, and home hazard reduction (n = 187) versus usual care (n = 196). MEASUREMENTS The number of dependencies in 17 basic and instrumental activities of daily living was measured every 3 months for 30 months (range: 0-17; greater values indicated worse disability). Inverse probability weighting Poisson regression was used to model the number of dependencies to adjust for confounding bias and higher dropout rates of those with greater disability. RESULTS The study population had a mean age of 76 years, and 26% were men. During the 30-month follow up, 17 died (n = 8, intervention; n = 9, control), 62 (n = 16, intervention; n = 46, control) were institutionalized or received nursing home care, and 34 (n = 15, intervention; n = 19, control) were lost to follow up. After inverse probability weighting, the mean number of dependencies at baseline was 1.21 and 1.29 for the intervention group and the control group, respectively (P = .80). The intervention group had fewer dependencies than the control group, but the difference was attenuated over time: 1.08 versus 1.60 at 6 months (P = .04), 1.29 versus 1.87 at 12 months (P = .03), 1.62 versus 2.17 at 18 months (P = .06), 2.08 versus 2.51 at 24 months (P = .18), and 2.73 versus 2.90 at 30 months (P = .67).

The pandemic is not only a health crisis but also a crisis of global governance. For example, the nation states in dealing with the crises of the pandemic have turned inwards, toward native and national solutions, and therefore away from the much-needed global cooperation to respond to the pandemic. This is an important concern for systems medicine and integrative biology in both normative and instrumental sense. Moreover, if we are to ""pandemic-proof"" the planet and the life science innovation ecosystem, new ways of understanding global governance are called for. This article examines the ways in which national governments have reacted to the crises triggered and embodied by the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaces the different approaches and conflicts between scientific experts and policy makers, and reveals the failure of science and politics. I analyze the uneven and disjointed way Western democratic governments have responded to the crisis and the way unchecked normative values and ideas have influenced the pandemic policy and prevented effective measures to contain the pandemic. Finally, the complex relationships between politics, knowledge, science, and governments are explored and clarified, and the way the COVID-19 crisis highlighted the long-standing tensions between technocracy and democracy. In conclusion, it is time to think critically and reflexively for all knowledge actors in systems science and innovate both planetary health and its global governance.","Boschele, Marco",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2021.0038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961517/,790

Although attention should now be paid to the experiences of students after they returned to campus, few studies have explored the factors and mechanisms that have influenced these students' school adaptation. The present study investigated the multiple roles of social support and resilience in mediating associations the relationship between Chinese university students' interpersonal relationships and their school adaptation during COVID-19 control period. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 4534 Chinese university students (Mage = 19.70, SD = 1.14) at two universities in Jiangxi provinces. The independent variable was interpersonal relationships; mediating variables were social support and resilience; and the dependent variable was school adaptation. Multiple mediation analysis was performed using the MPlus software. RESULTS Controlling for demographic variables, the quality of students' interpersonal relationships was significantly and positively related to their school adaptation, with students' ratings of social support and resilience mediating these associations. More interestingly, social support and resilience played multiple mediating roles in the relationship between interpersonal relationships and school adaptation. LIMITATIONS The age stage of the sample and the methods in which the data were collected may affect the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS During COVID-19 control period, interpersonal relationships can influence school adaptation either directly or indirectly by enhancing social support or resilience (parallel mediation) or by activating resilience via the experience of social support (serial mediation). This study's results emphasize the role of interpersonal relationships, as well as the contributions of positive external and internal factors on students' school adaptation during the epidemic control period. Accordingly, these findings may have implications for the mental health education of college students in the post-epidemic era.","Zhang, Xing; Huang, Peng-Fei; Li, Bi-Qin; Xu, Wen-Jian; Li, Wen; Zhou, Bin",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33640862/,790

It was the aim of this study to evaluate the performance and turnaround times of a new point-of-care multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) system for rapid identification of pathogens and antibiotic resistance markers. We assessed the applicability of the system under real-life conditions in critical ill patients with HAP. METHODS We enrolled forty critical ill patients with clinical signs for HAP into an observational study. Two samples of respiratory secretions were collected during one course of aspiration and cMD and mPCR testing (Unyvero, Curetis AG, Holzgerlingen, Germany) were performed immediately. The mPCR device was operated as a point-of-care system at the intensive care unit. We compared turnaround times, results of pathogen identification and results of antibiotic resistance testing of both methods. RESULTS Mean turnaround times (min-max) were 6.5 h (4.7-18.3 h) for multiplex PCR and 71 h (37.2-217.8 h) for conventional microbiology (final cMD results, incomplete results neglected). 60% (n = 24) of the mPCR tests were completely valid. Complete test failure occurred in 10% (n = 4) and partial test failure occurred in 30% (n = 12). We found concordant results in 45% (n = 18) and non-concordant results in 45% (n = 18) of all patients. 55% (n = 16) of the results were concordant in patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) > 5 (n = 29). Concordant results included three cases of multidrug resistant bacteria. MPCR frequently detected antibiotic resistance markers that were not found by cMD. CONCLUSIONS Unyvero allowed point-of-care microbial testing with short turnaround times. The performance of the system was poor. However, an improved system with a more reliable performance and an extended microbial panel could be a useful addition to cMD in intensive care medicine.

Most of these diets promise weight reduction via adherence to strict dietary guidelines, often removing certain types of food. With access to a plethora of information online, it is easy for adolescents to become confused when making dietary decisions. Although these diets promise benefits, it is important to understand common shortcomings and how to overcome them for safe implementation among adolescents.

These considerations are further modified for pediatric populations with a focus on the social influences on dieting. SUMMARY Although these diets may be promising, successful adherence to them requires addressing possible shortcomings associated with a certain diet. Pediatricians should be aware of how these dietary strategies may be properly implemented in order to prevent any harm to the patient. Empowering the patient and their families through informational resources is recommended. Pediatricians should also discuss motivations underlying their patient's dietary changes in order to determine whether these motivations are healthy.","Athanasian, Christian E; Lazarevic, Bojan; Kriegel, Elana R; Milanaik, Ruth L",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000001005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605628/,790

This paper explores the social-ecological elements that impact health-seeking behaviors in this community using interviews conducted with healthcare personnel and nonprofit leaders in the Rio Grande Valley between 2019 and 2020. Using this data, we found that anti-immigrant rhetoric has increased levels of fear among immigrants and mixed-status families, which has made them less willing to access healthcare. Additionally, we found that changes in the public charge rule has led to a decreasing number of children accessing government-provided health insurance.

We compared the change over the course of treatment in the social activities item of the Work and Social Adjustment Scale to the change in individual items of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self-Rated (QIDS-SR). Improvement in social functioning was modestly positively correlated with improvement in sad mood, concentration/decision making, involvement, and energy/fatigability. Only 16% to 22% of the variance in the change in social functioning was accounted for by these symptoms, and only 32% was accounted for by the total QIDS-SR score. In this large real-world sample of outpatients treated using citalopram, changes in depressive symptoms do not entirely explain improvements in social functioning.","Denninger, John W; van Nieuwenhuizen, Adrienne O; Wisniewski, Stephen R; Luther, James F; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Rush, A John; Gollan, Jackie K; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Fava, Maurizio",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0b013e31822fcbe2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964277/,790
152742,Psychological status of postpartum women under the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.,2020-05-18,"OBJECTIVE To assess feasibility, patient satisfaction, and financial advantages of telemedicine for epilepsy ambulatory care during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The demographic and clinical characteristics of all consecutive patients evaluated via telemedicine at a level 4 epilepsy center between March 20 and April 20, 2020 were obtained retrospectively from electronic medical records. A telephone survey to assess patient satisfaction and preferences was conducted within one month following the initial visit. RESULTS Among 223 telehealth patients, 85.7% used both synchronous audio and video technology. During the visits, 39% of patients had their anticonvulsants adjusted while 18.8% and 11.2% were referred to laboratory/diagnostic testing and specialty consults, respectively. In a post-visit survey, the highest degree of satisfaction with care was expressed by 76.9% of patients. The degree of satisfaction tended to increase the further a patient lived from the clinic (p = 0.05). Beyond the pandemic, 89% of patients reported a preference for continuing telemedicine if their epilepsy symptoms remained stable, while only 44.4% chose telemedicine should their symptoms worsen. Inclement weather and lack of transportation were factors favoring continued use of telemedicine. An estimated cost saving to patient attributed to telemedicine was $30.20 ¬± 3.8 per visit. SIGNIFICANCE Our findings suggest that epilepsy care via telemedicine provided high satisfaction and economic benefit, without compromising patients' quality of care, thereby supporting the use of virtual care during current and future epidemiological fallouts. Beyond the current pandemic, patients with stable seizure symptoms may prefer to use telemedicine for their epilepsy care.","Datta, Proleta; Barrett, Wattana; Bentzinger, Monica; Jasinski, Tracy; Jayagopal, Lakshman Arcot; Mahoney, Alexa; Pearon, Crystal; Swaminathan, Arun; Vuppala, Aditya; Samson, Kaeli K; Wang, Hongmei; Taraschenko, Olga",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33545652/,790

155427,Prone versus supine position for regional cerebral tissue oxygenation in preterm neonates receiving noninvasive ventilation.,2019,"The antifungal resistance threat posed by Candida auris necessitates bold and innovative therapeutic options. Farnesol is a quorum-sensing molecule with a potential antifungal and/or adjuvant effect; it may be a promising candidate in alternative treatment regimens. To gain further insights into the farnesol-related effect on C. auris, genome-wide gene transcription analysis was performed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Farnesol exposure resulted in 1,766 differentially expressed genes. Of these genes, 447 and 304 genes with at least 1.5-fold increase or decrease in transcription, respectively, were selected for further investigation. Genes involved in morphogenesis, biofilm events (maturation and dispersion), gluconeogenesis, iron metabolism, and regulation of RNA biosynthesis showed downregulation, whereas those related to antioxidative defense, transmembrane transport, glyoxylate cycle, fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation, and peroxisome processes were upregulated. In addition, farnesol treatment increased the transcription of certain efflux pump genes, including MDR1, CDR1, and CDR2. Growth, measured by the change in the number of CFU, was significantly inhibited within 2 h of the addition of farnesol (5.8 √ó 107 ¬± 1.1 √ó 107 and 1.1 √ó 107 ¬± 0.3 √ó 107 CFU/ml for untreated control and farnesol-exposed cells, respectively) (P < 0.001). In addition, farnesol treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular iron (152.2 ¬± 21.1 versus 116.0 ¬± 10.0 mg/kg), manganese (67.9 ¬± 5.1 versus 18.6 ¬± 1.8 mg/kg), and zinc (787.8 ¬± 22.2 versus 245.8 ¬± 34.4 mg/kg) (P < 0.05 to 0.001) compared to untreated control cells, whereas the level of cooper was significantly increased (274.6 ¬± 15.7 versus 828.8 ¬± 106.4 mg/kg) (P < 0.001). Our data demonstrate that farnesol significantly influences the growth, intracellular metal ion contents, and gene transcription related to fatty acid metabolism, which could open new directions in developing alternative therapies against C. auris. IMPORTANCE Candida auris is a dangerous fungal pathogen that causes outbreaks in health care facilities, with infections associated with a high mortality rate. As conventional antifungal drugs have limited effects against the majority of clinical isolates, new and innovative therapies are urgently needed. Farnesol is a key regulator molecule of fungal morphogenesis, inducing phenotypic adaptations and influencing biofilm formation as well as virulence. Alongside these physiological modulations, it has a potent antifungal effect alone or in combination with traditional antifungals, especially at supraphysiological concentrations. However, our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying this antifungal effect against C. auris is limited. This study has demonstrated that farnesol enhances the oxidative stress and reduces the fungal survival strategies. Furthermore, it inhibits manganese, zinc transport, and iron metabolism as well as increases fungal intracellular copper content. In addition, metabolism was modulated toward Œ≤-oxidation. These results provide definitive explanations for the observed antifungal effects.","Jakab, √Ågnes; Balla, No√©mi; Ragy√°k, √Ågota; Nagy, Fruzsina; Kov√°cs, Fruzsina; Sajtos, Zs√≥fi; T√≥th, Zolt√°n; Borman, Andrew M; P√≥csi, Istv√°n; Baranyai, Edina; Majoros, L√°szl√≥; Kov√°cs, Ren√°t√≥",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00710-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643421/,790

157586,A novel approach to reduce blood loss in patients with placenta accreta spectrum disorder.,2019,"Infection of mice with Sindbis virus (SINV) produces encephalomyelitis and provides a model for examination of the central nervous system (CNS) immune response to alphavirus infection. Clearance of infectious virus is accomplished through a cooperative effort between SINV-specific antibody and IFN-Œ≥, but the regulatory interactions are poorly understood. To determine the effects of IFN-Œ≥ on clinical disease and the antiviral immune response, C57BL/6 mice lacking IFN-Œ≥ (Ifng-/-) or IFN-Œ≥ receptor (Ifngr1-/-) were studied in comparison to WT mice. Maximum production of Ifng mRNA and IFN-Œ≥ protein in the CNS of WT and Ifngr1-/- mice occurred 5-7 days after infection, with higher levels of IFN-Œ≥ in Ifngr1-/- mice. Onset of clinical disease was earlier in mice with impaired IFN-Œ≥ signalling, although Ifngr1-/- mice recovered more rapidly. Ifng-/- and Ifngr1-/- mice maintained body weight better than WT mice, associated with better food intake and lower brain levels of inflammatory cytokines. Clearance of infectious virus from the spinal cords was slower, and CNS, but not serum, levels of SINV-specific IgM, IgG2a and IgG2b were lower in Ifngr1-/- and Ifng-/- mice compared to WT mice. Decreased CNS antiviral antibody was associated with lower expression of mRNAs for B-cell attracting chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL13 and fewer B cells in the CNS. Therefore, IFN-Œ≥ signalling increases levels of CNS pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to clinical disease, but synergistically clears virus with SINV-specific antibody at least in part by increasing chemokine production important for infiltration of antibody-secreting B cells into the CNS.","Baxter, Victoria K; Griffin, Diane E",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27667782/,790

The COVID-19 pandemic is still here, and it is unclear when the end will be in sight. However, most, if not all, of the novel interview techniques that were rapidly adopted by cardiothoracic training programs during the 2020 interview season will continue to be relevant even after the pandemic and need for social distancing subsides. In this literature review, we highlight techniques that can be used by cardiothoracic training programs to virtually showcase their attributes and strengths, in order to give applicants as realistic of a view of the program as possible. Such efforts include developing and emphasizing a social media presence, expanding information within training program websites, broadcasting virtual educational content, and creating virtual tours. In addition, we will review approaches towards structuring a virtual interview day in order to provide candidates with a deeper glimpse into the inner workings of the program.

Community health centers (CHCs) serve as the patient medical home for populations that are disproportionately more susceptible to COVID-19; yet, there is a lack of understanding of current efforts in place by CHCs to prepare for and respond to the pandemic. METHODS We used a comprehensive cross-sectional survey and focus groups with health care personnel to understand the needs and current efforts in place by CHCs, and we derived themes from the focus group data. RESULTS Survey respondents (n = 234; 19% response rate) identified COVID-19 infection prevention and control (76%), safety precautions (72%), and screening, diagnostic testing, and management of patients (66%) as major educational needs. Focus group findings (n = 39) highlighted 5 key themes relevant to readiness: leadership, resources, workforce capacity, communication, and formal policies and procedures. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated long-standing CHC capacity issues making it challenging for them to adequately respond to the outbreak. Policies promoting greater investment in CHCs may strengthen them to better meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of society, and thereby help flatten the curve.","Damian, April Joy; Gonzalez, Melanie; Oo, May; Anderson, Daren",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622823/,790

Due to intense adhesions between pouch and remnant, a closure by suture of the fistula was not possible. The fistula was initially treated with a fully covered metal stent. After multiple stent migrations despite clip attachment to the mucosa, the stent was changed to a partially covered metal stent. Fistula healing progress was documented every 2 weeks.

Early in outbreaks, evidence is scarce, but it accumulates rapidly. We are continuously facing new disease outbreaks, including the new coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) in December 2019.The objective of this study was to describe the accumulation of evidence during the 2013-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Pacific and the Americas related to aetiological causal questions about congenital abnormalities and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Methods: We hypothesised that the temporal sequence would follow a pre-specified order, according to study design. We assessed 1) how long it takes before findings from a specific study design appear, 2) how publication of preprints could reduce the time to publication and 3) how time to publication evolves over time. Results: We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019. In the 2013-2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports, case series and basic research studies were published first. Case-control and cohort studies appeared between 400-700 days after ZIKV was first detected in the region of the study origin. Delay due to the publication process were lowest at the beginning of the outbreak. Only 4.6% of the publications was available as preprints. Discussion: The accumulation of evidence over time in new causal problems generally followed a hierarchy. Preprints reduced the delay to initial publication. Our methods can be applied to new emerging infectious diseases.","Counotte, Michel J; Meili, Kaspar W; Low, Nicola",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036806,790

The development of uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response is a key factor in patients with critical COVID-19. Mild patients have milder inflammation and mild symptoms, but the lung inflammation in critical ones is more severe: the inflammatory factor expression levels are abnormally high; the infiltration of lung inflammatory cells is obvious along with the histopathological changes of viral pneumonia and inflammatory pneumonia. Continuous immunity response causes the accumulation of lung fibrin, permeability change, injury of the pulmonary blood vessels, and ultimately destroys the lung structure and affects ventilation and circulatory function of the lung. Therefore, continuous and severe inflammation is closely related to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation in critical COVID-19 patients, which is the key point for the transition from mild to critical patients.","Liao, Juan; Wen, Bin; Deng, Xin",Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33148390/,790

232106,Avoiding the Banality of Evil in Times of COVID-19: Thinking Differently with a Biopsychosocial Perspective for Future Health and Social Policies Development,2020,"BACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 pandemic, people should adopt protective behaviors at home (self-isolation, social distancing, putting shopping and packages aside, wearing face coverings, cleaning and disinfecting, and handwashing). There is currently limited support to help individuals conduct these behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report current household infection control behaviors in the United Kingdom and examine how they might be improved. METHODS: This was a pragmatic cross-sectional observational study of anonymous participant data from Germ Defence between May 6-24, 2020. Germ Defence is an open-access fully automated website providing behavioral advice for infection control within households. A total of 28,285 users sought advice from four website pathways based on household status (advice to protect themselves generally, to protect others if the user was showing symptoms, to protect themselves if household members were showing symptoms, and to protect a household member who is at high risk). Users reported current infection control behaviors within the home and intentions to change these behaviors. RESULTS: Current behaviors varied across all infection control measures but were between sometimes (face covering: mean 1.61, SD 1.19; social distancing: mean 2.40, SD 1.22; isolating: mean 2.78, SD 1.29; putting packages and shopping aside: mean 2.75, SD 1.55) and quite often (cleaning and disinfecting: mean 3.17, SD 1.18), except for handwashing (very often: mean 4.00, SD 1.03). Behaviors were similar regardless of the website pathway used. After using Germ Defence, users recorded intentions to improve infection control behavior across all website pathways and for all behaviors (overall average infection control score mean difference 0.30, 95% CI 0.29-0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported infection control behaviors other than handwashing are lower than is optimal for infection prevention, although handwashing is much higher.

261498,Effects of Comorbid Factors on Prognosis of Three Different Geriatric Groups with COVID-19 Diagnosis,2020,"Homologous recombination (HR) has an intimate relationship with genome replication, both during repair of DNA lesions that might prevent DNA synthesis and in tackling stalls to the replication fork. Recent studies led us to ask if HR might have a more central role in replicating the genome of Leishmania, a eukaryotic parasite. Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding whether or not HR genes are essential, and genome-wide mapping has provided evidence for an unorthodox organisation of DNA replication initiation sites, termed origins. To answer this question, we have employed a combined CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre approach to rapidly generate and assess the effect of conditional ablation of RAD51 and three RAD51-related proteins in Leishmania major. Using this approach, we demonstrate that loss of any of these HR factors is not immediately lethal but in each case growth slows with time and leads to DNA damage and accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA content. Despite these similarities, we show that only loss of RAD51 or RAD51-3 impairs DNA synthesis and causes elevated levels of genome-wide mutation. Furthermore, we show that these two HR factors act in distinct ways, since ablation of RAD51, but not RAD51-3, has a profound effect on DNA replication, causing loss of initiation at the major origins and increased DNA synthesis at subtelomeres. Our work clarifies questions regarding the importance of HR to survival of Leishmania and reveals an unanticipated, central role for RAD51 in the programme of genome replication in a microbial eukaryote.","Damasceno, Jeziel D; Reis-Cunha, Jo√£o; Crouch, Kathryn; Beraldi, Dario; Lapsley, Craig; Tosi, Luiz R O; Bartholomeu, Daniella; McCulloch, Richard",PLoS Genet,,790

277674,Diarrhea Is Associated with Increased Severity of Disease in COVID-19: Systemic Review and Metaanalysis,2021,"PURPOSE: Our purpose was to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of all existing literature regarding imaging findings on chest CT and associated clinical features in pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: A literature search was conducted on April 21, 2020 and updated on July 24, 2020 using PubMed, Embase, World Health Organization, and Google Scholar databases. Only studies which described chest CT findings of COVID-19 in pregnant patients were included for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 67 articles and 427 pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed. The most frequently encountered pulmonary findings on chest CT were ground-glass opacities (77.2%, 250/324), posterior lung involvement (72.5%, 50/69), multilobar involvement (71.8%, 239/333), bilateral lung involvement (69.4%, 231/333), peripheral distribution (68.1%, 98/144), and consolidation (40.9%, 94/230). Pregnant patients were also found to present more frequently with consolidation (40.9% vs. 21.0-31.8%) and pleural effusion (30.0% vs. 5.0%) in comparison to the general population. Associated clinical features included antepartum fever (198 cases), lymphopenia (128 cases), and neutrophilia (97 cases). Of the 251 neonates delivered, 96.8% had negative RT-PCR and/or IgG antibody testing for COVID-19. In the eight cases (3.2%) of reported neonatal infection, tests were either conducted on samples collected up to 72 h after birth or were found negative on all subsequent RT-PCR tests. CONCLUSION: Pregnant patients appear to present more commonly with more advanced COVID-19 CT findings compared to the general adult population. Furthermore, characteristic laboratory abnormalities found in pregnant patients tended to mirror those found in the general patient population. Lastly, results from neonatal testing suggest a low risk of vertical transmission.","Oshay, Rachel R; Chen, Michael Y C; Fields, Brandon K K; Demirjian, Natalie L; Lee, Ryan S; Mosallaei, Daniel; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,,790

452984,Person-Centered Approach to the Diverse Mental Healthcare Needs During COVID 19 Pandemic,2020,"Every new pandemic forces us to start new specific behaviors both in the civil life and within the hospitals trying to contain the spreading of the infection and preserve the more fragile people. In this regard, at the debut of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, our Local Health Agency had drastically modified every clinical and organizational pathways in order to limit the diffusion of the infection as well as to maintain a good quality of care and preserve healthcare workers. We report how we have modified the usual pediatric intra-hospital pathways in our primary level hospital to avoid mixing children with suspected and non-suspected symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Before every hospitalization, regardless of symptoms, each child and him/her parent/caregiver are undergone to rapid antigenic and molecular swab to rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection;hence, positive patients are transferred to Pediatric Unit of third level hospital equipped by a Pediatric COVID Intensive Unit. We think the healthcare behaviors described in this manuscript can help to reduce the intra-hospital spreading of SARS-CoV-2, although children seem to have a minimal role in the dissemination, but we cannot let down your guard. Simultaneously we observed that the overall children requiring inpatient pediatric evaluation and hospitalization have dramatically decreased from the beginning of pandemic.

474709,[Shanghai municipal expert consensus on standardized prevention and control of COVID-19 during procedures of oral radiology],2020,"Objective: To assess the acceptance of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine among healthcare workers at two general hospitals in Vietnam when it is available. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sampling from January to February 2021 among 410 healthcare workers at two general hospitals in Vietnam via a self-administered questionnaire. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of vaccine acceptance including the demographic factors, COVID-19 knowledge, and vaccine beliefs based on the domains of Health Belief Model. Results: Among 410 healthcare workers, 76.10% showed vaccination willingness. Predictors of acceptance were determined that the group reporting as 'vaccine acceptance' was more likely to be positive towards the perceived susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 (OR 2.45;95% CI 1.48-4.06, P&lt;0.05), perceived benefits of vaccination, and cues to action (OR 4.36;95% CI 2.35-8.09, and OR 5.49;95% CI 2.84-10.61, respectively, all P&lt;0.001), but less likely to have the perceived barriers to vaccination (OR 0.19;95% CI 0.09-0.38;P&lt;0.001) compared with the no acceptance group. Besides, people who had a good knowledge regarding the severity of illness were 3.37 times more likely to have identified as vaccine acceptance (OR 3.37;95% CI 1.04-10.86, P&lt;0.05). The demographic factors were also associated with willingness to receive the vaccine, with participants who were staff and received COVID-19 information from relatives were less likely to accept the vaccine over those who were doctors and not receiving information from relatives (OR 0.36;95% CI 0.13-0.96, and OR 0.37;95% CI 0.17-0.78, respectively, all P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: A rate of willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was relatively high with discrepancies between occupation, receiving information from relatives, knowledge toward the severity of illness, and the elements of Health Belief Model. The findings will provide information for the management authorities to develop relevant interventions to promote COVID-19 vaccination uptake. ¬© 2021 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters KluwerMedknow.

475258,Left behind by COVID-19: Experiences of ‚ÄúLeft-Behind‚Äù Girls in Rural China,2020,"BACKGROUND: Testes vary widely in mass relative to body mass across species, but we know very little about which genes underlie and contribute to such variation. This is partly because evidence for which genes are implicated in testis size variation tends to come from investigations involving just one or a few species. Contemporary comparative phylogenetic methods provide an opportunity to test candidate genes for their role in phenotypic change at a macro-evolutionary scale-across species and over millions of years. Previous attempts to detect genotype-phenotype associations across species have been limited in that they can only detect where genes have driven directional selection (e.g. brain size increase). RESULTS: Here, we introduce an approach that uses rates of evolutionary change to overcome this limitation to test whether any of twelve candidate genes have driven testis size evolution across tetrapod vertebrates-regardless of directionality. We do this by seeking a relationship between the rates of genetic and phenotypic evolution. Our results reveal five genes (Alkbh5, Dmrtb1, Pld6, Nlrp3, Sp4) that each have played unique and complex roles in tetrapod testis size diversity. In all five genes, we find strong significant associations between the rate of protein-coding substitutions and the rate of testis size evolution. Such an association has never, to our knowledge, been tested before for any gene or phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new approach to tackle one of the most fundamental questions in biology: how do individual genes give rise to biological diversity? The ability to detect genotype-phenotype associations that have acted across species has the potential to build a picture of how natural selection has sculpted phenotypic change over millions of years.","Baker, Joanna; Meade, Andrew; Venditti, Chris",BMC Biol,,790

Simultaneously, the growing availability of precise geolocation information is enabling visualization of global phenomena such as environmental changes and disease propagation. Opportunities for tracking spatial variations in language use, however, have largely been overlooked, especially on small spatial scales. Here we explore the use of Twitter data with precise geolocation information to resolve spatial variations in language use on an urban scale down to single city blocks. We identify several categories of language tokens likely to show distinctive patterns of use and develop quantitative methods to visualize the spatial distributions associated with these patterns. Our analysis concentrates on comparison of contrasting pairs of Tweet distributions from the same category, each defined by a set of tokens. Our work shows that analysis of small-scale variations can provide unique information on correlations between language use and social context which are highly valuable to a wide range of fields from linguistic science and commercial advertising to social services.","Kellert, Olga; Matlis, Nicholas H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00533v1.pdf,790

However, not all recovered patients develop adequate antibody titers for donation and the relationship between avidity and neutralizing titers is currently not well understood. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG titers and avidity were measured in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (n√¢¬Ä =√¢¬Ä 16 individuals) and a cross-sectional sample of convalescent plasma donors (n√¢¬Ä =√¢¬Ä 130). Epidemiologic correlates of avidity were examined in donors by linear regression. The association of avidity and a high neutralizing titer (NT) were also assessed in donors using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Antibody avidity increased over duration of infection and remained elevated. In convalescent plasma donors, higher levels of anti-spike avidity were associated with older age, male sex, and hospitalization. Higher NTs had a stronger positive correlation with anti-spike IgG avidity (Spearman &#961; = 0.386; P√¢¬Ä <√¢¬Ä .001) than with anti-nucleocapsid IgG avidity (Spearman &#961; = 0.211; P√¢¬Ä =√¢¬Ä .026).

In connective tissue disease patients, the spectrum of clinical manifestations is even broader. In mild COVID-19 patients, diffuse lymphadenopathy (DL) has not been described as a late manifestation, and only severe COVID-19 has been associated with lupus flare-ups. Herein, we report 3 cases of connective tissue disease patients that presented with DL after diagnosis and complete resolution of mild COVID-19 disease. CASE REPORTS: Case 1. A 28-year-old man with inactive lupus, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and a history of lung and cutaneous involvement. He presented with fever, polyarthralgia, and multiple lymphadenopathies 3 weeks after COVID-19 disease resolution. After evaluation, immunosuppressive treatment was initiated, with rapid response. Case 2. A 25-year-old woman with inactive lupus with a history of articular, hematologic, and cutaneous involvement. Four weeks after resolution of COVID-19 disease, she presented with malaise and cervical lymph-adenopathies. After laboratory testing and imaging, she was treated for lupus flare-up, with rapid response. Case 3. A 68-year-old woman with inactive lupus with a history of articular and cutaneous involvement. Four weeks after COVID-19 resolution, she presented with malaise and cervical and axillary lymphadenopathies. After extensive evaluation, immunosuppressive treatment resulted in a rapid response. CONCLUSIONS: After 3 to 4 weeks of mild, outpatient-treated COVID-19 and complete resolution of symptoms, 3 patients with connective tissue disease presented diffuse lymphadenopathy associated with inflammatory and constitutional symptoms. Infectious and neoplastic causes were thoroughly ruled out. All patients responded to reintroduction of or an increase in immunosuppressive therapy. We recommend considering the diffuse lymphadenopathy as a possible post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) manifestation in these patients, mainly when they are in the inactive phase.","Karsulovic, Claudio; Hojman, Lia P.; Seelmann, Daniela L.; Wurmann, Pamela A.",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.932751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504052/,790

Although the elicitation of humoral responses against different viral proteins is rapid and occurs in most infected individuals, its magnitude is highly variable among them and positively correlates with COVID-19 disease severity. This rapid response is characterized by the almost concomitant appearance of virus-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies that contain neutralizing antibodies directed against different epitopes of the Spike glycoprotein. Of particularly interest, the antibodies against domain of the Spike that interacts with the cellular receptor ACE2, known as the receptor binding domain (RBD), are present in most infected individuals and are block viral entry and infectivity. Such neutralizing antibodies protect different animal species when administered before virus exposure; therefore, its elicitation is the main target of current vaccine approaches and their clinical use as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is being explored. Yet, little information exists on the duration of humoral responses during natural infection. This is a key issue that will impact the management of the pandemic and determine the utility of seroconversion studies and the level of herd immunity. Certainly, several cases of reinfection have been reported, suggesting that immunity could be transient, as reported for other coronaviruses. In summary, although the kinetics of the generation of antibodies against SASR-CoV-2 and their protective activity have been clearly defined, their role in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the length of these responses are still open questions.","Carrillo, Jorge; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; √Åvila-Nieto, Carlos; Pradenas, Edwards; Clotet, Bonaventura; Blanco, Juli√†",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33187644/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20320374?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.108; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20320374,790

Based on samples from 63 COVID-19 survivors up to 7 months after symptom onset, and on 50 serum samples taken before the beginning of the pandemic, we compared the performances of three commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies (Euroimmun SARS-COV-2 IgA/IgG, Mikrogen recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, and Serion ELISA agile SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG) and three rapid lateral flow (immunochromatographic) tests (Abbott PanBio COVID-19 IgG/IgM, Nadal COVID-19 IgG/IgM, and Cleartest Corona 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM) with a 50% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) representing the gold standard. Fifty-seven out of 63 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (90%) showed neutralizing antibodies. The sensitivity of the seven assays ranged from 7.0% to 98.3%, and the specificity ranged from 86.0% to 100.0%.

661214,Letter to the editor regarding the article: vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review.,2021-09-01,"Eight accessory proteins have been identified in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). They are believed to play roles in the viral life cycle and may contribute to the pathogenesis and virulence. ORF9b as one of these accessory proteins is located in subgenomic mRNA9 and encodes a 98 amino acid protein. However, whether 9b protein is a structural component of SARS-CoV particles remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that 9b protein is translated from bicistronic mRNA9 via leaky ribosome scanning and it is incorporated into both virus-like particles (VLPs) and purified SARS-CoV virions. Further analysis shows that sufficient incorporation of 9b protein into VLPs is dependent upon the co-expression of E and M proteins, but not upon the presence of either S or N protein. Our data indicate that 9b protein of SARS-CoV is another virion-associated accessory protein. This finding will lead to a better understanding of the properties of the SARS-CoV 9b protein.","Xu, Ke; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Zeng, Rong; Lu, Wei; Lin, Yong-Ping; Xue, Liang; Li, Li; Yang, Lei-Lei; Xu, Chen; Dai, Jie; Wang, Fei; Li, Qing; Dong, Qing-Xi; Yang, Rui-Fu; Wu, Jia-Rui; Sun, Bing",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209002256; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.03.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19394665/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209002256,790

This study investigated the differences between Polish ASD females and males based on the responses provided by parents/caregivers to a Polish adaptation of the Social Communication Questionnaire, SCQ Lifetime and SCQ Current. The study included 90 ASD participants from Mental Health Services and Autism Clinics in Poland with no intellectual disability and no profound communication difficulties. Parents provided information on the SCQ items which were compared under three domains of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Four SCQ items with the examples were investigated. No significant differences were found between the two sexes in the three domains. The repetitive use of objects declined with age in ASD males. Although the findings of the present study did not reveal substantial gender biases in the Polish adaptation of the SCQ, it is necessary to take into account potential gender differences in the clinical presentation of ASD and in the adaptation of screening and diagnostic tools.","Rynkiewicz, Agnieszka; Szura, Magdalena; Bernaciak, Daria; Kozak, Anna; Karwowska, Magdalena",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067422/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11060682,790

The study was carried out on February 2021 with the participation of 402 health employees working in the pandemic hospitals. Approximately 33% of the participant health employees stated that they did not think of being vaccinated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Insufficient testing for the vaccines that are developed to fight against pandemics, having fear about their side effects, and finding them unreliable give rise to vaccine hesitancy in health employees. Besides, it was identified that the health employees' confidence in the vaccines and their confidence in the administrators about the vaccines affected their attitudes toward vaccination.","Yildirim, Dilek; Ciris Yildiz, Cennet; Dincer, Berna",Archives of environmental & occupational health,https://doi.org/10.1080/19338244.2021.1960258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387537/,790
