The paper presents a survey about students behavior and attitudes towards online education in the pandemic period from the Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Romania. A group of 300 students participated. The questionnaire was structured in four parts to determine student’s individual characteristics, student’s needs, students’ knowledge in using virtual platforms and students’ quality preferences for online education. The students said that online education in a pandemic situation is beneficial for 78% of them. A total of 41.7% percent of students appreciated the teachers’ teaching skills and the quality of online courses since the beginning of the pandemic, and 18.7% percent of the students appreciated the additional online materials for study to support their education. However, students found online education stressful, but preferred online assessment for evaluation. This pandemic has led to the new stage of Education 4.0, online education, and the need to harmonize methods of education with the requirements of new generations.","Boca, Gratiela Dana",Sustainability,929,1

This behavioral response has increased loneliness. Loneliness not only increases the risk of psychiatric disorders, but also affects occupational mental health. To avoid the negative effects of isolation, it is important to have social contact with other people, especially family members. Employment and economic instability caused by COVID-19 may have also affected family relationships. It is important to understand the association between family relationships and loneliness in workers under the pandemic. Methods: We collected usable data from 27,036 Japanese workers who completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked how long they spend with members of their family during mealtimes or at home, and if they experienced loneliness; the latter was assessed by a single question. Other questions included whether participants lived with their spouse, or with someone in need of care. To estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of time with family associated with loneliness we used a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustments for age, sex, marital status, presence of a cohabitant requiring care, equivalent income, educational level, frequency of remote work, availability of someone for casual chat, smoking, drinking, time for leisure interests, and cumulative rates of COVID-19 in the prefecture. Results: Ten percent (2,750) of the 27,036 participants reported loneliness. The survey showed a significant negative correlation between time spent with family and loneliness (p<0.001): participants who spent more time with family were less likely to feel loneliness. In addition, not living with a spouse and living with someone in need of care were associated with loneliness (not living with a spouse: p<0.001; living with someone in need of care: p<0.001). Conclusion: Loneliness under COVID-19 pandemic conditions was negatively associated with time spent with family members, with the converse result found for participants cohabiting with someone in need of care. These associations suggest the potential value of changes to working practices and interventions to combat loneliness.","Fujii, R.; Konno, Y.; Tateishi, S.; Hino, A.; Tsuji, M.; Ikegami, K.; Nagata, M.; Yoshimura, R.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.",,929,1

Method: Participants were 510 individuals (approximately 50% who endorsed a sexual or gender minority identity) recruited via Qualtrics Research Services in April 2020, during the height of shelter-in-place (SiP) restrictions across the United States. They completed a questionnaire battery that included measures of COVID-19 stressors, physical and psychological IPA perpetration, and heavy drinking. Results: Rates of physical and psychological IPA perpetration significantly increased after implementation of SiP restrictions which aimed to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. COVID-19 stress was significantly and positively associated with physical and psychological IPA perpetration;however, COVID-19 stress was positively associated with physical IPA perpetration among nonheavy drinking, but not heavy drinking, participants. Conclusions: Drawn from a large sample of participants of diverse sexual identities, findings tentatively implicate COVID-19 stress as a critical correlate of IPA perpetration and suggest that ""low-risk"" individuals (i.e., nonheavy drinkers) should not be overlooked. These data provide preliminary support for the usefulness of public health polices and individual-level interventions that target stress, heavy drinking, and their antecedents.

This idea is indeed a poignant one for our times, and for the estrangement as well as strangeness being experienced (at the time of writing) as a result of ‘lockdown’, ‘self-isolation’, and ‘social distancing’. But how can it shape the development of poetries between India and Australia? Celan’s notion has a timelessness and universality, based as it is on an intensely dialogical poetics. As this paper attempts to show, the nuances of this poetics become increasingly pertinent to this exchange between Kolkata-based academic Sharmila Ray, and myself, Perth-based poet Mags Webster. It has been, for me, an exercise in seeking poetic and ontological common ground. I discuss how, prompted by Ray’s epistolatory approach to her home city of Kolkata, I came to interrogate more deeply, in my responses and through my thinking, notions around not only the ‘to whom’ of the poem, but also, and perhaps more importantly for this particular project, the ‘about whom’. © 2020, Australasian Association of Writing Programs.

Although mental health problems have been reported in this population, it is important to study resilience, in order to identify its strengths. The purpose was to study resilience in Mexican nurses and the mental health and sociodemographic factors associated with it. A crosssectional study was used. Method: A sociodemographic and COVID-19 related questionnaire, the Resilience Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire-28, was sent via online. 556 nurses were included, the majority were women (80%), single (60.8%), aged between 26-35 years (38.3%). Results: Lower resilience was found among nurses who were younger (p<0.001, ɳ2=0.05), single (p<0.001, ɳ2=0.02) and with lower levels of education (p=0.001, ɳ2=0.02). Predictors of resilience included the search for mental health information (β =-0.152, p <0.001), higher education (β = 0.142, p<0.001), low levels of depression (β=-0.307, p<0.001) and low levels of social dysfunction (β =-0.261, p<0.001). Conclusion: This findings allowed to identify the factors which are associated with resilience among nurses and how this plays an important role in their mental. Likewise, this data allows for the identification of high psychosocial risk groups, to better guide mental health strategies aimed at increasing resilience. © Copyright Servicio de Publicaciones - Universidad de Murcia","Arriaga, R.

The study also examined social support as a buffering agent against the harmful effects of job insecurity. Data were collected from employees (N = 272) working in numerous hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies across Pakistan. Hierarchical moderated regression analysis was used to test the study’s hypotheses. The results suggested that job insecurity was negatively related to self-esteem and positively related to economic deprivation. In addition, social support significantly moderated the effects of job insecurity on mental health, self-esteem, economic self-efficacy and life satisfaction such that the negative effects of job insecurity were stronger when social support was low. The results for economic deprivation, however, were contrary to the expectations, whereby job insecurity had a strong positive effect on economic deprivation in case of high social support.

The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity. Methods Double-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60 ng to 60 ug) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects. Results UFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a mouse model showed a two-phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12 hours, 2.1% of the initial administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels after 24 hours. Conclusions UFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 hours after dosing.","Harris, H. M.; Boyet, K.

Le personnel infirmier et paramédical a été transféré vers des établissements de soins actifs et les consultations ont été suspendues dans la plupart des secteurs qui traitent les maladies chroniques. En dépit des difficultés initiales liées à la mise en place des télécommunications me permettant, en tant que médecin spécialisée dans les céphalées, d’offrir des soins de santé à distance, la plupart de mes patients ont été reconnaissants de cet accès à la télésanté. Celle-ci leur a permis de maintenir un contact médical avec moi en toute sécurité. Cependant, j’ai observé que ce nouveau modèle de soins ne servait pas au mieux les intérêts de tous mes patients. Les effets néfastes du confinement sur les populations de patients vulnérables n’ayant pas accès au soutien collectif des réseaux sociaux suscitent une inquiétude généraliséeNote de bas de page 1. Plus particulièrement, les victimes de violence conjugale ont fait état d’un risque accru de violenceNote de bas de page 2. Étant donné que je m’occupe de patients qui non seulement sont majoritairement des femmes, mais ont également une hypersensibilité cérébrale innée aux stimuli aversifs, on me confie souvent des informations sensibles sur les déclencheurs de céphalées, dont la détresse émotionnelle causée par la violence conjugaleNote de bas de page 3. Les directives sur les mesures d’urgence associées à la pandémie de COVID-19 n’ont pas autorisé les consultations médicales en personne pour les victimes de violence conjugale. Les consultations en personne ont été limitées aux examens physiques dans le cas d’une affection aiguë potentiellement fatale, comme une céphalée en coup de tonnerre évoquant un saignement intracrânien, ou les dysfonctionnements de dispositifs thérapeutiques perfectionnés, comme les systèmes d’administration de médicaments parentéraux et les modulateurs implantables de signalisation nerveuseNote de bas de page 4Note de bas de page 5. Heureusement pour mes patients subissant de la violence conjugale, la direction de mon hôpital a accédé à ma demande de maintenir les consultations médicales en personne, quel que soit l’état de la céphalée. Bien entendu, un dépistage des symptômes de COVID-19 est effectué 24 heures ou moins avant le rendez-vous et les mesures de sécurité (en particulier hygiène des mains, port du masque et distanciation physique) sont appliquées. Ce n’est pas parce qu’un service est offert pour un motif non urgent ou qui n’engage pas le pronostic vital que ce service n’est pas essentiel. Plusieurs facteurs sont susceptibles de restreindre l’accès aux soins de santé des victimes de violence conjugale : les coûts, la crainte des préjugés et de la discrimination, les tactiques de contrôle des partenaires violents et un faible sentiment d’efficacité personnelleNote de bas de page 6Note de bas de page 7Note de bas de page 8. Les mesures d’urgence qui ont dû être prises pour freiner la pandémie ont accentué la vulnérabilité à la violence conjugale, en raison des crises créées par les pertes et suppressions d’emplois et en raison également de l’isolement social dû la distanciation physique obligatoire. Malgré l’augmentation anticipée du nombre d’incidents en lien avec la violence conjugale, les services d’intervention d’urgence ont constaté une diminution du nombre de victimes qui demandent de l’aide, probablement en raison de leur crainte de s’exposer et d’exposer leurs proches au virus et également car elles se retrouvent coincées avec leur agresseurNote de bas de page 9. La pandémie a également réduit l’accès à des lieux sûrs. La plupart des refuges fonctionnent à moindre capacité, les déplacements sont restreints, le transport en commun a été réduit et des couvre-feux ont été imposésNote de bas de page 10. De plus, comme la majorité des centres de soins n’autorisent plus les consultations sans rendez-vous, les victimes sont susceptibles d’être menacées lorsqu’elles prennent rendez-vous en ligne ou par téléphone en présence de leur agresseurNote de bas de page 11. En outre, les victimes de violence conjugale qui appartiennent à des communautés ethniques marginalisées sont susceptibles d’être davantage méfiantes vis-à-vis des autorités policières, du fait que les policiers infligent des sanctions financières en cas de non-respect du confinement, et ces perceptions négatives du système judiciaire se traduisent souvent par une méfiance à l’égard des institutions médicalesNote de bas de page 12Note de bas de page 13. Les activités cliniques en santé sexuelle et reproductive ont été maintenues pour les victimes de violence familiale, afin de repérer les dommages collatéraux de l’isolement social attribuable à la pandémieNote de bas de page 14. Toutefois, si l’accès à son fournisseur de soins chroniques est limité, une patiente victime de violence conjugale risque de ne pas vouloir se confier pour obtenir de l’aide à un professionnel qu’elle ne connaît pas. Elle peut craindre par exemple un rendez-vous précipité et un manque de compréhension des professionnels dans les établissements de soins aigus. De plus, elle peut se sentir coupable d’accaparer le personnel des services d’urgence, déjà au maximum de leur capacité. Elle peut se sentir mal à l’aise à l’idée d’aborder des sujets sensibles dans un cadre inconnu, surtout sur un brancard dans le couloir ou au sein d’un service d’urgence bruyant où la confidentialité est limitée. Les médecins de tous les secteurs offrant des soins aux malades chroniques devraient être encouragés à considérer leurs services comme essentiels si leurs patients risquent d’être victimes de violence en raison des mesures de confinement en place. La gestion des problèmes de santé chroniques implique un suivi à long terme, souvent sur plusieurs années, ce qui crée une alliance thérapeutique entre le médecin et son patient et peut inciter ce dernier à demander de l’aide en temps de crise. Cette alliance est généralement le reflet de la qualité de la communication entre le patient et le fournisseur de soins de santé, il suppose une relation personnelle et un travail de collaborationNote de bas de page 15. La relation entre patient et médecin étant au cœur de leur rôle, les médecins de famille établissent souvent des alliances de ce type avec leurs patients, grâce à une coordination globale des soins qui ne se limite pas à la maladieNote de bas de page 16Note de bas de page 17. Les alliances entre patient et professionnel les plus fréquentes, hors contexte de la santé sexuelle ou reproductive, relèvent par exemple du traitement à long terme des endocrinopathies, des maladies auto-immunes ou inflammatoires, des maladies rénales chroniques et des affections respiratoires ou cardiaquesNote de bas de page 15. L’approche que nous proposons ici est susceptible de se révéler utile dans le contexte d’une relation déjà en place avec une patiente ayant confié des antécédents de violence et d’abus. Dans le cadre de la restructuration des soins de santé pendant la pandémie, les médecins qui connaissent des patients ayant été victimes de violence familiale devraient, dans la mesure où la logistique le permet, prévoir au moins une consultation en personne avec chacun d’eux. La plupart des médecins ont sans doute déjà abordé la possibilité pour leurs patients d’obtenir de l’aide mais, souvent, ces discussions demeurent superficielles et se limitent à encourager la personne à recourir aux ressources communautaires, sans compter que de nombreux médecins doivent composer avec une lourde charge de travail et ne ressentent en eux pas la confiance nécessaire pour aider ces patientsNote de bas de page 6. Pourtant, les interventions répétées d’un médecin en qui le patient a confiance, dans un environnement sûr, sont opportunes et perçues favorablement par le patient, à la différence des appels téléphoniques de suiviNote de bas de page 18. Dans ce contexte, la consultation en personne ne vise pas à déceler la violence conjugale, car la patiente a déjà divulgué cette information, mais plutôt à évaluer sa maladie chronique et à lui offrir d’être mis en relation avec des ressources spécialisées en violence conjugale durant l’épidémie et la crise sanitaire psychosociale. Si la personne a besoin d’un plan de protection, le médecin doit demeurer conscient des limites de son expertise en matière de violence conjugale et juger de la pertinence de communiquer avec d’autres professionnels. Depuis le début de la pandémie de COVID-19, de nombreux établissements ont mis en place une équipe de soutien social en cas de crise, que les travailleurs de la santé qui ont besoin de conseils et d’expertise peuvent consulter pour aider leurs patients. Voici quelques conseils pratiques et des exemples de points à aborder pendant l’évaluation en personne avec une victime de violence conjugale : * Pour vos patients qui maîtrisent mal la technologie ou qui ont un accès limité à un ordinateur, prévoyez du temps pendant la rencontre pour leur fournir l’adresse de l’hôpital et des refuges les plus proches de leur domicile ainsi que d’autres ressources telles que les centres culturels communautaires. Imprimez leur au besoin des cartes de ces emplacements. Veillez à leur fournir des données à jour sur ces ressources et à leur indiquer tout changement opérationnel/organisationnel en lien avec la pandémie. * Lors de la planification du prochain rendez-vous de suivi,demandez à votre patiente quel est le meilleur moment pour l’appeler afin qu’elle soit seule pour discuter de ses problèmes de santé. * Dans les établissements où les notes médicales sont encore manuscrites, assurez-vous que le scénario de protection établi avec votre patiente soit retranscrit en format électronique et compréhensible pour tout professionnel de la santé au cas où elle doive se présenter aux urgences. Cela permet aussi de garantir à la patiente qu’elle n’aura pas à fournir de longues explications lors du triage, surtout si son agresseur l’accompagne. * Précisez à votre patiente la date et l’endroit exact dans les dossiers où le scénario de protection est classé. Elle pourra ainsi le signaler discrètement et rapidement au personnel de triage. * Vérifiez la liste des rendez-vous annulés et celle des patients qui ne se sont pas présentés à un rendez-vous, afin de vous assurer que ces derniers n’ont pas été retirés de la liste d’attente à votre insu. En effet, certains établissements autorisent un nombre limité d’annulations, de rendez-vous manqués ou de tentatives de report, à la suite de quoi ils suppriment automatiquement la personne des listes. * Évitez de décrire ces patientes comme victimes de violence conjugale à votre personnel administratif. De nombreuses personnes concernées par cette situation ne désirent pas ce type d’étiquette, et de multiples raisons peuvent justifier par ailleurs une consultation en personne, comme la nécessité d’un examen physique si on décèle un signal d’alarme lors d’un entretien en télésanté (comme, en neurologie, une perte de vision transitoire accompagnée d’un mal de tête). Il n’est donc pas nécessaire de préciser au personnel non médical et au personnel non impliqué dans le plan de soins d’un patient la raison d’une visite confidentielle. Après cette consultation en personne, le médecin va pouvoir décider de la fréquence du suivi médical et de ses modalités. Toutefois, si le maintien du contact avec une patiente relève du contexte de violence familiale, il serait pertinent d’orienter celle-ci vers des experts en violence conjugale, plus à même de faire valoir la nécessité de soins. Si la patiente et le médecin préfèrent poursuivre les soins en télésanté, le médecin peut envoyer une lettre à la patiente avec une date provisoire de rendez-vous en personne après la pandémie. La patiente peut placer cette lettre bien en vue, pour rappeler à tous les membres du foyer qu’elle est suivie par un professionnel de la santé qui compte évaluer son bien-être et procéder à un examen après la pandémie. Selon Mechanic et SchlesingerNote de bas de page 19, « le succès des soins médicaux dépend avant tout de la confiance des patients envers le fait que leurs médecins […] accordent la plus haute priorité au bien-être de leurs patients ». Comme il faudra probablement du temps aux autorités de santé publique pour mettre en place des initiatives visant à réduire les répercussions sexospécifiques de la pandémie de COVID-19, nous devons veiller à ce que nos populations de patients vulnérables ne soient pas négligéesNote de bas de page 20. Malgré les défis éthiques posés par les mesures d’urgence liées à la COVID-19 et la recherche d’un équilibre entre sécurité publique et soins axés sur le patient, nous devons reconnaître les situations où nous sommes appelés à prendre la défense de nos patients, en particulier de ceux qui ne le font pas ou ne sont pas en état de le faire. En tant que fournisseurs de soins de première ligne, nous devons exposer notre point de vue aux autorités de santé publique, notamment en ce qui concerne les facteurs principaux susceptibles d’influencer la décision d’offrir des consultations en personne pendant la pandémie. Ces facteurs vont souvent au-delà des questions pratiques habituelles sur la nécessité d’un examen physique ou la facilité d’accès d’un patient à la technologie requise pour les soins virtuels. Dans cet article, je tiens à souligner l’importance de maintenir un contact médical, en particulier une consultation en personne dans la mesure du possible, avec les victimes de violence conjugale ayant déjà révélé subir des actes violents. Ce contact est particulièrement précieux lorsqu’une alliance thérapeutique a été établie avec une patiente, par exemple au fil de la prise en charge d’une maladie chronique. Bien que cet article soit rédigé du point de vue d’une pratique en médecine des céphalées, les questions qu’il soulève sont applicables plus largement, au-delà de la spécialité de la clinique, de la répartition par sexe des patients ou du manque de personnel dû au redéploiement occasionné par la COVID-19. Les médecins qui travaillent dans les secteurs non essentiels à l’intervention directe contre la COVID-19 et dont les activités cliniques ont été modifiées devraient envisager de maintenir leurs services en tant que soins essentiels pour ce groupe de patients. Comme de nombreux services sociaux communautaires enregistrent une augmentation importante des délais d’attente, il est important de rester flexible envers nos patients. En outre, le médecin traitant du patient doit participer, si le patient y consent, au plan de soins. Il n’est cependant pas rare que le clinicien responsable du traitement d’une maladie chronique, en particulier en cas de maladies complexes de niveau tertiaire, ait une alliance thérapeutique plus forte avec le patient en raison des contacts médicaux fréquents que cela implique. Enfin, dans le cadre de l’amélioration souhaitée par les autorités de santé publique en matière de restructuration des soins de santé durant la pandémie, les médecins sont invités à collaborer avec d’autres équipes institutionnelles spécialisées lorsque leur expertise s’avère limitée, en particulier avec le personnel psychosocial, dans le but d’aider les populations marginalisées et vulnérables. Cette collaboration peut s’avérer particulièrement profitable aux victimes de violence conjugale, dans la mesure où un scénario de protection bien conçu tient compte de la dynamique complexe des situations d’abus, au-delà de l’expérience de la violence.

We aim to review the role of AI as a decisive technology to analyze, prepare us for prevention and fight with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and other pandemics. Methods The rapid review of the literature is done on the database of Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar using the keyword of COVID-19 or Coronavirus and Artificial Intelligence or AI. Collected the latest information regarding AI for COVID-19, then analyzed the same to identify its possible application for this disease. Results We have identified seven significant applications of AI for COVID-19 pandemic. This technology plays an important role to detect the cluster of cases and to predict where this virus will affect in future by collecting and analyzing all previous data. Conclusions Healthcare organizations are in an urgent need for decision-making technologies to handle this virus and help them in getting proper suggestions in real-time to avoid its spread. AI works in a proficient way to mimic like human intelligence. It may also play a vital role in understanding and suggesting the development of a vaccine for COVID-19. This result-driven technology is used for proper screening, analyzing, prediction and tracking of current patients and likely future patients.

Conventionally, harmful pesticides are used to contain anthracnose disease with limited success. In this study, we assessed the potential of Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS) approach to target the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides COM1 (CgCOM1) developmental gene involved in the fungal conidial and appressorium formation, to restrict fungal infection in chilli and tomato fruits. For this study, we have developed stable transgenic lines of chilli and tomato expressing CgCOM1-RNAi construct employing Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic plants were characterized by molecular and gene expression analyses. Production of specific CgCOM1 siRNA in transgenic chilli and tomato RNAi lines was confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR. Fungal challenge assays on leaves and fruits showed that the transgenic lines were resistant to anthracnose disease-causing C. gloeosporioides in comparison to wild type and empty-vector control plants. RT-qPCR analyses in transgenic lines revealed barely any CgCOM1 transcripts in the C. gloeosporioides infected tissues, indicating near complete silencing of CgCOM1 gene expression in the pathogen. Microscopic examination of the Cg-challenged leaves of chilli-CgCOM1i lines revealed highly suppressed conidial germination, germ tube development, appressoria formation and mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides, resulting in reduced infection of plant tissues. These results demonstrated highly efficient use of HIGS in silencing the expression of essential fungal developmental genes to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi, thus providing a highly precise approach to arrest the spread of disease.","Mahto, Binod Kumar; Singh, Anjulata; Pareek, Manish; Rajam, Manchikatla V.; Dhar-Ray, Swatismita; Reddy, Pallavolu M.",bioRxiv,929,1

Though the recovery rate is also increasing, daily reporting cases are also increasing substantially. The best way till now is to take precautions and following the government guidelines. Till today, many different countries are line up to produce effective vaccination, but still, no such vaccine has completed its trial, and further, it will take a long time for the production and distribution among common citizens. We currently have a test process known as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that is not reliable during the early stage of the disease. Also, a fast diagnosis is required as RT-PCR is time taking operation. Hence, imaging can be useful for the diagnosis as it can be quick and more reliable even in the early stage of the COVID-19 disease. Artificial techniques can be applied to radiological images such as CT scans and X-rays. In this article, we review the various research and responses in diagnosing the said disease using AI techniques on radiological images.

Main aim of this paper is to compile all scattered information regarding Dhoopana Karma from different Ayurvedic sculptures. All information of these karma which is in dispursed form is complied & described under different heads such as history pf Dhoopana Karma, synonyms, classification, indications (general & specific), various drugs useful for Dhoopana, their period for collection, different formulations for Dhoopana, instruments for Dhoopana, different modes of administration / procedure, method of storing and preservation of Dhoopana Dravya & duration of procedure in descriptive manner & tabular form. Extensive review related with Dhoopana Karma shows that that Dhoopan Karma which is a most common method of sterilization described in an ayurveda & it is categorised under topical (Bahiparimarjana) treatment. Broad spectrum utility of these different formulations of Dhoopana suggests demands for researches in future to study their various pharmacological properties & actions such as bacteriostatic or bactericidal, wormicidal, anti-inflammatory,antiseptic, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal anti-pyretic. Suchpe of vivid research may become helpful to prevent the need for medical intervention in entities such as COVID-19.

A web-based screening has been conducted at the end of May, 2020. A representation of resource loss, threat of loss, gain, and value data was collected three months after first patient and restrictions. After meeting an inclusion criterion, data of 1100 respondents have been selected for the analysis. Basing on literature review, four comparison groups were formed: COVID-19 patients (N = 65);single male respondents aged from 18 to 34 with low financial income (N = 42);female respondents aged from 18 to 34 with low financial income who share living space with more than two persons (N = 32);a ""resourceful"" group of male participants aged from 35 to 54 with high income and ongoing relationships (N = 54). Descriptive statistics and Cohen's d criteria are applied. Measures: social-demographic questionnaire and modified COR-E questionnaire. Resource change due to the pandemic circumstances in general population appears to be modest. Threat of resource loss is higher than real resource loss. The COVID-19 situation mostly impacted following resources: Financial Stability, Feeling of Safety, Sense of Control in Life, Sense of Independence, Intimates' Health, and Work Stability. Comparison groups show significant differences in resource change constellations consistent with similar data from other countries.","Shankov, F. M.; Chumakova, M. A.; Vasilchuk, M.

It develops a framework of documentary legitimation, where each of the six modes recognized by Bill Nichols in Representing Reality: Issues and Concepts in Documentary (1991) and Introduction to Documentary (2017) ? expository, participatory, observational, performative, reflexive and poetic modes ? tends to highlight certain legitimating strategies. For instance, the expository mode mainly legitimates through voice-of-God commentary, expert speeches and expository intertitles, the participatory mode legitimates through witness testimony and the observational mode legitimates through audience observation, and so on. The proposed framework is applied to a case study of a documentary entitled The Lockdown: One Month in Wuhan produced by China Global Television Network (CGTN). Analysis demonstrates how legitimation of the Wuhan lockdown during the early outbreak of COVID-19 is realized by adopting different representation modes and legitimating strategies. The article illustrates how an interdisciplinary approach may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of legitimation and its realization.","Yu, Hailing Yan Ye",Visual Communication,929,33

MATERIAL AND METHODS We prospectively evaluated 40 patients undergoing laparoscopic renal procedures with the Fluid Warming System (first 20 cases) and then the Clearify Visualization System (second 20 cases). We utilized the standard Fluid Warming System per a 30-second modified protocol established in our laboratory. We used the Clearify according to manufacturer instructions. For each procedure we documented the etiology of each episode of visual obstruction, procedure type and surgery duration. We performed a cost analysis. For all cases we used the same insufflator, insufflation trocar location and trocar configuration. RESULTS All 40 patients completed the study protocol without incident. The mean fogging events per hour for the Fluid Warming System and Clearify Visualization System were 0.7 (0-2.52) and 1.4 (0-5.02), respectively (P = 0.045). Surgery duration and cost per procedure were similar for both systems. CONCLUSION The Fluid Warming System with modified technique was found to have less fogging events than the Clearify Visualization System, with no difference in operative time or cost.","Drysch, Austin; Schmitt, Kenneth; Uribe, Brittany; Yoon, Renai; Okhunov, Zhamshid; Landman, Jaime",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,929,2

Previous study has evaluated groundwater contamination risk at Yinchuan Plain, China, according to aquifer vulnerability. The present study enriches the assessment of contamination risk by adding pollution loading, which represents the hazard from human activities, and groundwater value, which represents the economic loss as a result of groundwater pollution. An approach that combines toxicity, release possibility, and the potential release quantity of pollutants on the ground surface was used to estimate the pollution loading. An integrated approach that considered both the in situ and extractive values was used to estimate groundwater value. In addition, a basic risk map was constructed by overlying the vulnerability and pollution loading maps showing the potential probability of pollution, while a value-weighted risk map was produced by overlying the basic risk and value map indicating the urgency of protection. The validation by specific contaminants shows the reliability of the basic risk assessment. Both the basic and value-weighted risk maps indicate a very high groundwater contamination risk in Yinchuan City, and the southern part of Yinchuan Plain exhibited a relatively high contamination risk. As a result of not only high vulnerability but also very high pollution loading and groundwater value, Yinchuan City is the most urgent area requiring groundwater protection. The produced maps provide effective information for decision-making regarding the optimization of monitoring network, preferential treatment, and allocating future potentially hazardous.","Li, Xinyan; Wu, Hao; Qian, Hui",,929,16

False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of transmission of infected people and for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, as well as COVID-19 repositories, including the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19 and the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria and collected data from the included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the proportion of false-negative test results using a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model. The certainty of the evidence about false-negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and strategies. All information in this article is current up to July 17, 2020. RESULTS: We included 34 studies enrolling 12,057 COVID-19 confirmed cases. All studies were affected by several risks of bias and applicability concerns. The pooled estimate of false-negative proportion was highly affected by unexplained heterogeneity (tau-squared = 1.39; 90% prediction interval from 0.02 to 0.54). The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial and largely unexplained heterogeneity in the proportion of false-negative RT-PCR results. The collected evidence has several limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection given that up to 54% of COVID-19 patients may have an initial false-negative RT-PCR (very low certainty of evidence).

The impossibility of visiting their loved ones during the hospital stay causes additional distress for families: in addition to the worries about clinical recovery, they may feel exclusion and powerlessness, anxiety, depression, mistrust in the care team and post-traumatic stress disorder. The impossibility of conducting the daily meetings with families poses a challenge for healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to delineate and share consensus statements in order to enable healthcare team to provide by telephone or video calls an optimal level of communication with patient's relatives under circumstances of complete isolation. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effectiveness and the AHCPR Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Reports were explored from 1999 to 2019. Exclusion criteria were: poor or absent relevance regarding the aim of the consensus statements, studies prior to 1999, non-English language. Since the present pandemic context is completely new, unexpected and unexplored, there are not randomised controlled trials regarding clinical communication in a setting of complete isolation. Thus, a multiprofessional taskforce of physicians, nurses, psychologists and legal experts, together with some family members and former intensive care unit patients was established by four Italian national scientific societies. Using an e-Delphi methodology, general and specific questions were posed, relevant topics were argumented, until arriving to delineate position statements and practical checklist, which were set and evaluated through an evidence-based consensus procedure. FINDINGS: Ten statements and two practical checklists for phone or video calls were drafted and evaluated; they are related to who, when, why and how family members must be given clinical information under circumstances of complete isolation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The statements and the checklists offer a structured methodology in order to ensure a good-quality communication between healthcare team and family members even in isolation, confirming that time dedicated to communication has to be intended as a time of care.","Mistraletti, Giovanni; Gristina, Giuseppe; Mascarin, Sara; Iacobone, Emanuele; Giubbilo, Ilaria; Bonfanti, Silvia; Fiocca, Federico; Fullin, Giorgio; Fuselli, Ennio; Bocci, Maria Grazia; Mazzon, Davide; Giusti, Gian Domenico; Galazzi, Alessandro; Negro, Alessandra; De Iaco, Fabio; Gandolfo, Enrico; Lamiani, Giulia; Del Negro, Silvia; Monti, Laura; Salvago, Fabrizia; Di Leo, Silvia; Gribaudi, Maria Nefeli; Piccinni, Mariassunta; Riccioni, Luigi; Giannini, Alberto; Livigni, Sergio; Maglione, Carla; Vergano, Marco; Marinangeli, Franco; Lovato, Luisa; Mezzetti, Andrea; Drigo, Elio; Vegni, Elena; Calva, Sally; Aprile, Anna; Losi, Gianfranco; Fontanella, Lucia; Calegari, Giulio; Ansaloni, Cristina; Pugliese, Francesco Rocco; Manca, Salvatore; Orsi, Luciano; Moggia, Fabrizio; Scelsi, Silvia; Corcione, Antonio; Petrini, Flavia",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),929,1

Recently, ongoing viral epidemic due to coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affected mainland China that now threatened to spread to populations in most countries of the world. In spite of this, there is currently no antiviral drug/ vaccine available against coronavirus infection, COVID-19. In the present study, computer-aided drug design-based screening to find out promising inhibitors against the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leads to infection, COVID-19. The lead therapeutic molecule was investigated through docking and molecular dynamics simulations. In this, binding affinity of noscapines(23B)-protease of SARS-CoV-2 complex was evaluated through MD simulations at different temperatures. Our research group has established that noscapine is a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of drug resistant cancers; however, noscapine was also being used as anti-malarial, anti-stroke and cough-suppressant. This study suggests for the first time that noscapine exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting viral protein synthesis.","Kumar, Durgesh; Kumari, Kamlesh; Jayaraj, Abhilash; Kumar, Vinod; Kumar, Ramappa Venkatesh; Dass, Sujata K; Chandra, Ramesh; Singh, Prashant",J Biomol Struct Dyn,929,10

OBJECTIVES: To compare key demographic and physiologic parameters, biomarkers and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 ARDS and ARDS secondary to direct lung injury from other etiologies of pneumonia. METHODS: We enrolled 27 patients with COVID-19 ARDS in a prospective, observational cohort study, and compared them with a historical, pre-COVID-19 cohort of patients with viral ARDS (n=14), bacterial ARDS (n=21), and ARDS due to culture-negative pneumonia (n=30). We recorded clinical demographics, measured respiratory mechanical parameters, collected serial peripheral blood specimens for measurement of plasma interleukin-(IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10, and followed patients prospectively for patient-centered outcomes. We conducted between group comparisons with non-parametric tests and analyzed time-to-event outcomes with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 ARDS had higher body mass index and were more likely to be Black, or residents of skilled nursing facilities, compared to non-COVID-19 ARDS (p<0.05). COVID-19 patients had lower delivered minute ventilation compared to bacterial and culture-negative ARDS (post-hoc p<0.01), but not compared to viral ARDS. We found no differences in static compliance, hypoxemic indices or carbon dioxide clearance between groups. COVID-19 patients had lower IL-6 levels compared to bacterial and culture-negative ARDS at early time points post-intubation, but no differences in IL-6 levels compared to viral ARDS. COVID-19 patients had longer duration of mechanical ventilation but similar 60-day mortality, both in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 ARDS bears several similarities to viral ARDS but demonstrates lower minute ventilation and lower systemic levels of IL-6 compared to bacterial and culture-negative ARDS. COVID-19 ARDS was associated with longer dependence on mechanical ventilation compared to non-COVID ARDS. Such detectable differences of COVID-19 do not merit deviation from evidence-based management of ARDS but suggest priorities for clinical research to better characterize and treat this new clinical entity.","Bain, William; Yang, Haopu; Shah, Faraaz Ali; Suber, Tomeka; Drohan, Callie; Al-Yousif, Nameer; DeSensi, Rebecca S; Bensen, Nicole; Schaefer, Caitlin; Rosborough, Brian R; Somasundaram, Ashwin; Workman, Creg J; Lampenfeld, Caleb; Cillo, Anthony R; Cardello, Carly; Shan, Feng; Bruno, Tullia C; Vignali, Dario Aa; Ray, Prabir; Ray, Anuradha; Zhang, Yingze; Lee, Janet S; Methé, Barbara; McVerry, Bryan J; Morris, Alison; Kitsios, Georgios D",Ann.

MSI Reproductive Choices UK (MSUK), one of the largest providers of abortion services in England, launched a no-test telemedicine EMA pathway on 6 April 2020. The objectives of this study were to report key patient-reported outcome measures and to assess whether our sample was representative of the whole population receiving no-test telemedicine EMA. METHODS: A sample of all MSUK's telemedicine EMA patients between April and August 2020 were invited to opt in to a follow-up call to answer clinical and satisfaction questions. A total of 1243 (13.7% of all telemedicine EMAs) were successfully followed-up, on average within 5 days post-procedure. RESULTS: Patients reported high confidence in telemedicine EMA and high satisfaction with the convenience, privacy and ease of managing their abortion at home. The sample responding were broadly equivalent to the whole population receiving telemedicine. No patient reported that they were unable to consult privately. The majority (1035, 83%) of patients reported preferring the telemedicine pathway, with 824 (66%) indicating that they would choose telemedicine again if COVID-19 were no longer an issue. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine EMA is a valued, private, convenient and more accessible option that is highly acceptable for patients seeking an abortion, especially those for whom in-clinic visits are logistically or emotionally challenging. Evidence that this pathway would be a first choice again in future for most patients supports the case to make telemedicine EMA permanent.","Porter Erlank, Chelsey; Lord, Jonathan; Church, Kathryn",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),929,1

Given the state of healthcare, policymakers were urged to contain the spread of infection, minimize stress on the health systems and ensure public safety. Most effective tool that was at their disposal was to close non-essential business and issue a stay home order. In this paper we consider techniques to measure the effectiveness of stringency measures adopted by governments across the world. Analyzing effectiveness of control measures like lock-down allows us to understand whether the decisions made were optimal and resulted in a reduction of burden on the healthcare system. In specific we consider using a synthetic control to construct alternative scenarios and understand what would have been the effect on health if less stringent measures were adopted. We present analysis for The State of New York, United States, Italy and The Indian capital city Delhi and show how lock-down measures has helped and what the counterfactual scenarios would have been in comparison to the current state of affairs. We show that in The State of New York the number of deaths could have been 6 times higher, and in Italy, the number of deaths could have been 3 times higher by 26th of June, 2020.","Ghosh, Subhas Kumar; Ghosh, Sachchit; Narumanchi, Sai Shanmukha",,929,24

With many scientific and humanitarian efforts ongoing to develop diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments for COVID-19, and to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, mass spectrometry research, including proteomics, is playing a role in determining the biology of this viral infection. Proteomics studies are starting to lead to an understanding of the roles of viral and host proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infection, their protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications. This is beginning to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets or diagnostic strategies that can be used to reduce the long-term burden of the pandemic. However, the extraordinary situation caused by the global pandemic is also highlighting the need to improve mass spectrometry data and workflow sharing. We therefore describe freely available data and computational resources that can facilitate and assist the mass spectrometry-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2. We exemplify this by reanalyzing a virus-host interactome data set to detect protein-protein interactions and identify host proteins that could potentially be used as targets for drug repurposing.","Bittremieux, Wout; Adams, Charlotte; Laukens, Kris; Dorrestein, Pieter C; Bandeira, Nuno",J Proteome Res,929,13

Methods: This study utilized the experiment-control method. Data were collected using a patient and disease information form and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) Test. An experimental group of patients sniffed Turkish coffee, and the coffee's effect on the patients' sense of smell was examined. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 25 (IBM). Results: Of the patients in the experimental group, 25% had moderate hyposmia, 58.3% had severe hyposmia, and 16.7% had anosmia prior to sniffing Turkish coffee. After sniffing the Turkish coffee, 13.3% of these patients regained their ability to smell normally, while 18.3% had mild hyposmia, 45% had moderate hyposmia, 6.7% had severe hyposmia, and 16.7% had anosmia. There was no difference in the control group between first and second measurement. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients who sniffed Turkish coffee intermittently regained some of their sense of smell for one hour. Turkish coffee is cheap, fragrant, widely available, and easy to access. Therefore, results of this study suggest that it may be recommended for treating olfactory disorder in COVID-19 patients.","Bulbuloglu, Semra; Altun, Yasar",Ideggyogy Sz,929,1

Nursing education includes both classroom teaching and clinical practicum components. In preparing for their practicum, students must learn not only fundamental nursing care knowledge but also basic knowledge on emerging infectious diseases. All schools nationwide have complied with the Ministry of Education order to postpone the opening of the fall semester in response to the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. Campus epidemic prevention measures were implemented through student counseling networks, and flexible teaching strategies, including online teaching and distance teaching, were implemented to protect the learning rights of students. This paper explores the strategies implemented in response to emerging infectious diseases in nursing education based on the core values of professional nursing. Examining the precautions taken at campuses and teaching strategies adopted in response to the COVID 19 pandemic may provide valuable insights that may be applied to the future development of nursing education.","Hsieh, Hsin-Yu; Hsu, Yu-Yun; Ko, Nai-Ying; Yen, Miaofen",Hu Li Za Zhi,929,24

So far, viral targets of cellular immunity and factors determining successful mounting of T-cell responses are poorly defined. We therefore analyzed cellular responses to membrane, nucleocapsid and spike protein in individuals suffering from moderate or severe infection and after recovery from mild disease. We demonstrate that the CoV-2 specific CD4+ T-helper cell response is directed against all three proteins with comparable magnitude, ex vivo proliferation and portions of responding patients. However, deceased individuals were more frequently amongst non-responders. Higher patient age and comorbidity index correlated with increased frequencies of CoV-2 specific CD4+ T-cells, harboring higher portions of IL-2-, but lower portions of IFNÎ³ secreting cells. Diminished frequencies of membrane protein reactive IFNÎ³+ T cells were particularly associated with higher Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II scores in patients admitted to intensive care. CoV-2 specific T cells exhibited elevated PD-1 expression in active patients as compared to recovered individuals with previous mild disease. In summary, our data suggest a link between individual patient predisposition with respect to age and comorbidity and impairment of CoV-2 specific Th1-type cellular immunity, thereby supporting a concept of altered T-cell function in patients at risk.","Sattler, Arne; Angermair, Stefan; Stockmann, Helena; Heim, Katrin Moira; Khadzhynov, Dmytro; Treskatsch, Sascha; Halleck, Fabian; Kreis, Martin E; Kotsch, Katja",J. clin. invest,929,21

One year after it became a pandemic, the current COVID-19 situation in Brazil is an example of how the impacts of a pandemic are beyond health outcomes and how health, social, and political actions are intertwined. Objectives: We aimed to provide an overview of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, from a social and political point of view, and to discuss the perspectives from now on. Methods: This is a narrative review using official, scientific (PubMed, Medline, and SciELO databases) and publicly available data. Press articles were also used that contain important information not found in these databases. Findings: We address the impacts of COVID-19 in different regions of Brazil, on indigenous populations, health care workers, and how internal social contrasts impacted the pandemics advance across the country. We also discuss key points that culminated in the countrys failed management of the COVID-19 spread, such as poor management of the public health care system, disparities between public and private health care infrastructure, lack of mass testing and viral spread tracking, lack of preparedness and planning to implement strict isolation and social distancing measures, and, most importantly, political instability, a deteriorating Health Ministry and sabotaging attitudes of the countrys president, including anti-scientific actions, underplaying COVID-19 severity, spreading and powering fake news about the pandemic, promoting knowingly inefficient medications for COVID-19 treatment, and interference in collective health policies, including the countrys vaccination plan. Conclusions: After one year of COVID-19 and a disastrous management of the disease, Brazil has more than 11 million cases, 270,000 deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in the world, most of which could have been avoided and can be credited to negligence of municipal, state, and federal authorities, especially President Jair Messias Bolsonaro. Unfortunately, the country is an example of what not to do in a pandemic setting. Key Points: One year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Brazil had the second higher number of cases and deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to the disease. Lack of massive testing, non-stringent and ineffective collective health policies, poor management of the public health care system, and political instability were the main drivers of the countrys flawed management of the COVID-19 advancement. Anti-science and sabotaging actions by government had a pivotal role in the countrys current situation. Brazil has a large territory and is marked by social contrasts among different regions and states, which showed contrasting data regarding the impact caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 databases and data sharing are important to provide an overview of epidemiological aspects of the disease; however, Brazil lacks standardization in these datasets.","Boschiero, Matheus Negri; Palamim, Camila Vantini Capasso; Ortega, Manoela Marques; Mauch, Renan Marrichi; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima",Ann Glob Health,929,24
